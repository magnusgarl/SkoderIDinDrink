"1. IntroductionTheories of imitation, conformity, or social convergence, suggest that we tend to follow examples set by others, especially in matters of moral behavior (conditional morality). However, these others might be setting multiple examples which often challenge each other. When so, is it possible that certain examples transmit more than others? In this paper, we employ a laboratory experiment to study whether examples of both, lying and truth-telling are comparably transmittable. Our evidence suggest that both transmit but the effect of observing honesty is weaker and smaller compared to the stronger effect of observing dishonesty.We are building upon the experimental economics literature studying related matters of morality. An earlier strand of that literature demonstrated that, contrary to economic intuition, individuals exhibit preferences for honesty. Even in situations where lying means higher payoffs without externalities, a non-negligible proportion would remain honest or, would lie, but not fully (Fischbacher and Föllmi-Heusi, 2013,Abeler et al., 2014). One of the explanations put forward is that honesty, as a social norm, has been internalized, making individuals lying averse due to the psychological costs accruing with norm-deviance (Hurkens and Kartik, 2009). Further, that individuals might engage in some partial lying to the extent they can justify this and maintain a positive self-view (Shalvi et al., 2012). Recent evidence suggests that these individual preferences might not be for honesty per se, but rather, for appearing honest. Following, that individuals entertain social image concerns which allow for a more flexible view of honesty. In contexts where lying cannot be precisely estimated, or liars cannot be identified, individuals are not as honest as models of pure preferences for honesty would predict (Gneezy et al., 2018,Abeler et al., 2019).The notion of conditional morality we study here, i.e., that people flexibly imitate others’ lying or truth-telling, is consistent with social image concerns but also with the economic assumptions of self-interest. It works as follows; individuals are self-interested and have the conflicting desire to obtain higher payoffs through lying, but also, to maintain the image of an honest person. For low payoffs, social and self-image concerns are dominating payoff maximizing motivations and individuals behave honestly, as theyought toKajackaite and Gneezy (2017). This is true unless individuals expect or know others are lying. These expectations or knowledge, shift focus from whatought to be doneto whatis being doneand draw a moral wiggle room for individuals to behave dishonestly without suffering social image discomforts. Similar arguments can apply on the reverse. In cases where individuals expect or know others are honest, social and self-image concerns become more salient and reinforce whatought tobe done.Our contribution here is that we introduce a novel way to measure the transmission of honesty and dishonesty. We operationalize beliefs as intention proxies to study the switch between honesty and dishonesty at the individual level using a simultaneous and sequential move lying paradigm.Closest to ours are lying experiments with peer information. Although such experiments exist, they either involve strategic interactions, or (dis)honesty is not observable on an individual level, or they only consider the diffusion of dishonesty.Rilke et al. (2021)report that the presence of a first mover decreases dishonesty in strategic, repeated interactions but not in one-shot settings. Our study differs; the context is non-strategic while image concerns are constant across treatments. The study closest to ours isDiekmann et al. (2015)which also uses a non-strategic context; however, in that experiment lying is not precisely observed among peers and honesty transmission is not measured.More studies examine moral conditionality in different ways. For example,Apffelstaedt et al. (2022)show that when a rule is elected rather than intrinsically applied, it shifts individuals’ perceptions about what is appropriate (actions previously judged socially inappropriate can become socially appropriate). Using narratives, (Adrian and Eugenio, 2022) show a different type of transmission asymmetry; positive narratives increase prosocial behavior while negative narratives have no effects.",Paola,Georgia,Luis,None,None,Economics Letters,"Volume 231, October 2023, 111257",0
"1. IntroductionThe all-or-nothing mechanism is the most commonly used funding method in crowdfunding. Under this mechanism, contributions are solicited toward a project and if the contribution target is reached, the project developer collects the contributions, which are otherwise refunded to their contributors. This mechanism is also known as the assurance contract, the provision-point mechanism, or the threshold implementation mechanism and is a subject of extensive study across different disciplines. In the context of crowdfunding for public goods, which is also the context of the present paper, the application of the all-or-nothing mechanism is a showcase of its weak implementation properties. Due to multiple equilibria andfree riding, most fundraising campaigns are not successful and the most frequent outcome is when none or very few contributions are raised.1In the refund bonus extension of the all-or-nothing mechanism or, henceforth, the assurance contract, proposed byTabarrok (1998)and further developed byZubrickas (2014), if the contribution target is missed contributors are not only refunded but also receive a refund bonus. With refund bonuses the zero-contribution outcome cannot be an equilibrium, and in the absence of uncertainty about the aggregate value of the public good project, the contribution target is reached in equilibrium and, thus, refund bonuses are not paid. Intuitively, the prospect of receiving a refund bonus or having the public good provided encourages contributions up to the provision point. This prediction finds experimental support inCason and Zubrickas, 2017,Cason and Zubrickas, 2019,Cason et al. (2021), andLi et al. (2023). For more discussion and application of refund bonuses, seeChandra et al. (2016)andLi et al. (2021).Previous studies, however, do not address the question of the source of refund bonuses. If it is the project developer who is to pay refund bonuses (rather than the crowdfunding platform), then the risk of their payout may discourage project developers from their application. This risk comes to the fore if the value of the public good is uncertain because refund bonus payout then occurs with a positive probability inBayesianNash equilibrium. In this paper, we demonstrate in a framework with imperfect information that when offering refund bonuses the project developer obtains the same expected revenue as in the efficient equilibrium of the standard assurance contract. Hence, refund bonuses improve the implementation properties of the assurance contract without financial implications for project developers or their supporting entrepreneurs. This result can be related to the Revenue Equivalence Theorem (Myerson, 1981) applied to crowdfunding.",Timothy,Robertas,None,None,None,Economics Letters,"Volume 231, October 2023, 111265",0
"1. IntroductionA bilateral exchange rate is the price of a currency in terms of a numéraire currency. Invariant currency indexes are normalised bilateral exchange rates that are independent of the choice of numéraire currency (Hovanov et al., 2004). The normalisation changes the numéraire of the currency from a single-currency numéraire to a multicurrency numéraire (Kunkler, 2022). As a consequence, invariant currency indexes are multilateral exchange rates, which provide transparency on the underlying currency weights. In contrast, a stable aggregate currency is an optimal multicurrency numéraire, which is a weighted basket of currencies. The optimal multicurrency numéraire is estimated using a minimum-variance portfolio optimisation subject to two optimisation constraints: that the portfolio weights sum to one and that all of the portfolio weights are nonnegative (Hovanov et al., 2004). The motivation of this paper is to highlight some fundamental issues with the concept of a stable aggregate currency.The concept of a stable aggregate currency is a novel approach that estimates an optional multicurrency numéraire using portfolio optimisation. More specifically, a stable aggregate currency is estimated using a minimum-variance portfolio optimisation with two optimisation constraints: the portfolio weights sum to one and each portfolio weight is nonnegative. The result of the portfolio optimisation is an optimal portfolio of invariant currency indexes, rather than an optimal portfolio of currencies. Thus, it is important to understand the relationship between the portfolio weights of the optimal portfolio of invariant currency indexes and the currency weights of the optional multicurrency numéraire. For example, when the portfolio weights sum to one, the portfolio weights are not equal to the currency weights (Kunkler, 2022).Stable aggregate currencies have been applied several times in the literature.Hovanov et al. (2004)introduced the concept of a stable aggregate currency as a proxy for a world currency, which was more stable than any individual currency.Pontines (2009)estimated a stable aggregate currency for an optimal common currency basket in East Asia. In the cryptocurrency literature,Giudici et al. (2022)estimated a stable aggregate currency to create a digit currency whose movements are minimised relative to several international currencies.This paper contributes to the literature by showing that there are some fundamental issues with the concept of a stable aggregate currency. These issues include a spurious covariance matrix, Seigel’s paradox, a singular covariance matrix, and assuming that the portfolio weights of the optimal portfolio of invariant currency indexes are equal to the currency weights of the optional multicurrency numéraire. Once these issues have been resolved, it is shown that the portfolio optimisation problem is infeasible.",Michael,None,None,None,None,Economics Letters,"Volume 231, October 2023, 111267",0
"1. IntroductionPerformance-contingent bonuses are a prominent tool for companies to incentivize employees’ performances (WoldatWork, 2021). However, changing incentive systems is common due to internal and external developments. Limited research has examined performance after removing monetary incentives, finding that performance is lower after an incentive than it was before the incentive (Bareket-Bojmel et al., 2014,Deci, 1971,Huffman and Bognanno, 2017). This provides evidence that monetary incentives can crowed-out intrinsic (non-monetary) motivation. This study uses a performance-contingent bonus of more leisure time to study whether a novel non-monetary bonus domain can reduce this crowding-out effect.1Such leisure time bonuses are generally better perceived than monetary ones (Vogelsang, 2022). Moreover, they might feel less controlling, further reducing a crowding-out effect (Deci and Ryan, 1985). Generally, enhanced fungibility and divisibility are interesting attributes of leisure time, setting it apart from other non-monetary bonuses while maintaining a non-monetary nature (Vogelsang, 2022).I use a laboratory experiment to isolate the crowding-out effect across different bonus domains without any further explicit or implicit incentives that may keep performance at a higher level even after removing an incentive. Results show that performance pay leads to higher output in the first of two working periods compared to a baseline of no incentive. However, after removing performance pay in the second working period, I find evidence of a crowding-out effect with a significant decrease in performance below the baseline. Importantly, this crowding-out effect is milder with time incentives, with which subjects can leave the laboratory earlier in the second working period depending on their performance in the first one.Overall, this finding supports the notion discussed by psychologists and economists that incentives have the potential to undermine intrinsic motivation. From an economic perspective, this effect can be explained by the following mechanism: when an agent receives an incentive, she also receives private information from the principal regarding the costs or pleasure associated with the working tasks (Bénabou and Tirole, 2003). During the incentivized period, the extrinsic motivation provided by the incentive (over)compensates for the decrease in intrinsic motivation resulting from the agent’s updated belief about the working task. However, once the incentive is removed, the agent is left with the updated belief that the task is less enjoyable. This decreased intrinsic motivation leads to reduced performance compared to the initial period when no incentive was present.2A post-experimental questionnaire suggests this mechanism as the most plausible one as the monetary incentive indeed decreased the enjoyability of the working task, and this to a stronger extent than the time incentive.Download :Download high-res image (226KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1.

"1. IntroductionSocial media has become an essential tool for scholars to share, enhance, validate, and expand their engagement and interaction within the academic community (Veletsianos, 2016). Twitter is one of the most actively used social media platforms by researchers for microblogging and interactions, especially among economists and social scientists (Sugimoto et al., 2017). AlthoughKlar et al. (2020)find a strong correlation between promoting research on Twitter and citations received by that research,Tonia et al. (2016)find no effect of social media exposure on citations using a randomized trial with health science publications.We investigate the causal effect of Twitter activity on academic citations by analyzing Twitter engagement around a substantial collection of VoxEU columns which we cross-reference with corresponding journal publications and citations. VoxEU is a notable online platform which enjoys significant recognition among academic economists and allows them to write columns about their recent research findings. To establish causality, we implement an instrumental variable strategy that capitalizes on the timing of the VoxEU column publication. We find that the existence of at least one tweet, as opposed to none, leads to a16−25%increase in citations; doubling the overall Twitter engagement generates a6−16%increase in citations.",Ho,Ali,Sascha,Benno,None,Economics Letters,"Volume 231, October 2023, 111270",0
"1. IntroductionA series of theoretical models shows that trade liberalization increases welfare by providing access to new differentiated product varieties (e.g.,Armington, 1969,Krugman, 1980,Arkolakis et al., 2008, andFeenstra, 2018). In seminal studies,Feenstra (1994)andBroda and Weinstein (2006)(henceforth F/BW) develop and implement an econometric method that estimates the welfare gains associated with increases in product varieties. Numerous subsequent studies apply, or build on F/BW (e.g.,Broda and Weinstein, 2010,Soderbery, 2015,Hottman et al., 2016,Feenstra and Weinstein, 2017,Soderbery, 2018, andRedding and Weinstein, 2020).Quantifying welfare gains from product varieties requires industry-level import demand elasticities, which are notoriously difficult to estimate. F/BW’s approach is the most widely respected structural method to address the classical simultaneity issue associated with estimating these elasticities in international trade data.1Relying on the assumption that demand and supply shocks are orthogonal, their method combines two structural equations, one for import demand and one for import supply, into a single estimating equation. The estimated coefficients are then used to recover measures for the underlying structural parameters of the model – one of which is the import demand elasticity needed for welfare estimation.A significant criticism directed towards F/BW is that the orthogonality condition required for identification may not hold (e.g.,Soderbery, 2015). Beginning withLinder (1961), an empirical literature in international trade argues that there is a correlation between the quality of exported products and the characteristics of the exporting country. High income per capita countries are more productive (high supply shocks)andare more likely to produce high quality goods (high demand shocks) compared to lower income per capita countries (e.g.,Hallak, 2006,Hallak, 2010, andKhandelwal, 2010). This suggests that the demand and supply shocks are positively correlated and, as a result, that the F/BW orthogonality condition may not hold in practice.The first contribution of this paper is to suggest a simple amendment to F/BW’s method that increases the likelihood that the orthogonality condition is satisfied. In a nutshell, F/BW suggest an heteroskedastic estimator that identifies coefficients using second moments of bilateral trade shares and prices (Rigobon, 2003).2The transformation of the data into variances and covariances implicitly controls for the impact of importer-time and time-invariant factors. However, it does not address the potential impacts of exporter-time factors such as exporter productivity and product quality. This paper shows that extending the benchmark model to include additional covariates solves this problem.The second contribution of the paper is to compare the benchmark F/BW estimates to estimates obtained with the extended model. Three main results emerge from this exercise. First, F-tests support the extended model over the constraint (benchmark) model. Second, about 60 percent of the estimated elasticities are smaller in the extended model compared to the benchmark model. Third, the correlation between the two sets of estimates is positive (as expected) but small, at 0.33. Overall, these empirical results suggest that it may be important to control for exporter-year factors when estimating import demand elasticities.To the best of my knowledge, this is the first paper to assess the effect of controlling for exporter-time factors in F/BW’s method.3In his seminal study,Feenstra (1994)did not raise the issue because his estimation uses United States (US) import data only. In that case, there is not enough variation to control for exporter-time factors. However, subsequent studies (includingBroda and Weinstein, 2006) include numerous importing countries. In that context, it is possible to exploit the richer panel structure of the data to control for exporter-time factors, in addition to importer-time and time-invariant factors. Nevertheless, the issue seems to remain unaddressed.The remainder of the paper proceeds as follow. Section2motivates the inclusion of additional controls in the F/BW’s estimating equation. Section3presents and compares empirical estimates obtained from the benchmark F/BW method and from a richer model that controls for the impact of exporter-time factors. Section4briefly concludes.",Antoine,None,None,None,None,Economics Letters,"Volume 231, October 2023, 111272",0
