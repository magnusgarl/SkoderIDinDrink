"1. IntroductionOccupational licensing is state-sanctioned permission to work in a particular occupation. These regulations are typically passed in pursuit of protecting the health, safety, and well-being of consumers. Across the United States and Europe, licensing has grown during the last fifty years from applying to approximately 5% of workers to over 20% (Cunningham, 2019,Koumenta et al., 2014,Koumenta and Pagliero, 2019). As licensing grows, it becomes increasingly important to understand how these regulations affect workers and the structure of employment and earnings, particularly if they contribute to new adverse labor market frictions.The prior literature suggests that occupational licensing regulations in the US, many of which differ across states, have significant effects on the labor market dynamics of licensed occupations1and on certain occupations that perform substitutable functions.2However, except for studies that examine occupations that perform overlapping duties, the prior literature has not considered how licensing regulations in one occupation spill over to directly affect the labor market experience of workers in other occupations. In particular, it is important to consider these questions: for workers that would have entered a licensed occupationbut forthe requirements of the license, where do they go, what are their earnings and employment rates, and how does that affect the labor market generally? The answer can inform economists, workers, and policymakers about the important ways in which occupational regulations may exacerbate income inequality and reduce economic efficiency.This study addresses these questions by testing for the presence of earnings and employment spillovers of occupational licensing on a set of plausible counterfactual occupations. The lack of clear or systematic definitions of “counterfactual occupations” has been a key limitation in the literature. I address this by defining these as occupations that use similar skills, which I measure using data from the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) database. I propose the application of an unsupervised machine learning procedure for creating skill groups. I then use variation in the licensing environment across US states to empirically identify the scope of earnings spillovers as well as the mechanisms behind them.I empirically test for spillovers in three steps. First, in order to define a set of counterfactual occupations, I use data from the O*NET database and a non-parametric hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) technique to group together occupations into clusters that require similar levels of key skills. The skills upon which I base these clusters come fromAcemoglu and Autor (2011)and represent combinations of non-routine, routine, manual, cognitive, and interpersonal skills.3This is the first study to use this novel, skill-based approach to study the effects of labor market regulations. This approach provides a roadmap for future work to expand the set of applications for data on occupational skills.Second, using data from the Current Population Survey, I use the share of individual workers that indicates they are required to have a license as a proxy for the regulatory environment for each occupation in each state (Kleiner and Soltas, 2019). As the key treatment variable, I calculate the share of workers licensed within a state-skill cluster celloutsideone’s own occupation (which I call the “focal occupation”) to measure licensure exposure from other relevant occupations. My empirical strategy then uses microdata from the American Community Survey in a state boundary discontinuity design to systematically compare the earnings of observationally equivalent workers in the same occupation in local labor markets that arbitrarily face different licensing exposures depending on which side of the state border they reside in. Because the licensing environment is defined at the state level, licensing shares are exogenous to local labor market factors. I also test for heterogeneous effects across different subgroups, particularly across gender, race/ethnicity, and nativity. Using my estimates, I then calculate the counterfactual distribution of earnings within occupations if licensing were eliminated altogether. This exercise demonstrates the total effect that licensing has on earnings inequality when accounting for these spillovers in addition to any positive earnings effects of licensing one’s own occupation.Third, I estimate the effects of licensing exposure on local labor market employment and demographic composition in each focal occupation. The direction of this employment effect informs the underlying mechanism behind earnings spillovers. A positive employment spillover on other occupations is consistent with a direct labor supply mechanism, while a negative employment spillover is consistent with other explanations such as shiftinglabor demandor amonopsonymechanism.Consistent with the prior literature, I find an average earnings premium of approximately 8% in occupations required to have a license in their state relative to the same occupation in non-licensed jurisdictions on the other side of a state border. Conversely, I find that a 10 percentage point increase in the share of licensed workers in the same skill cluster outside a worker’s own occupation (approximately one standard deviation) is associated with earnings that are 1.6–2.3%lower. These negative effects are stronger for women, non–Hispanic black, and foreign-born Hispanic workers and are most concentrated in the non-tradable sector of the economy. Because these demographic groups are in the lower portion of the income distribution, these effects imply that licensing and related regulation externalities contribute to local income inequality. My counterfactual exercise suggests that eliminating occupational licensing would reduce earnings inequality within occupations by 2–4% across various measures such as the 90/10 and 10/50 percentile earnings ratios, while the overallGini coefficientwithin occupations would fall by as much as 7%. Eliminating licensing would increase mean earnings, particularly for black workers. In overall counterfactual exercises, for every extra $1 earned via the own-occupation licensing premium, approximately $2.23 is lost via spillover effects.I find no evidence of a direct labor supply increase to the focal occupation. On the contrary, I find a statistically significant decline in employment in the focal occupation as a result of licensing in other occupations. I also find that as a cluster outside the focal occupation becomes more licensed, the share of workers in the focal occupation who are women falls, as does the average years of completed education in the focal occupation. The share of workers in the focal occupation that is Hispanic or foreign-born rises. FollowingOster (2019), I test the importance of sorting along these characteristics in explaining the earnings effects I observe. Occupational composition in observed characteristics collectively accounts for approximately one-third of the observed earnings effects; under the assumption of the equal importance of sorting on unobserved and observed characteristics, total sorting on both accounts may explain approximately half of the total spillover effects.I augment my analysis with a variety of robustness tests, including specifications with localized labor market fixed effects that limit identifying variation to areas that border multiple states, using simple cross-state variation in licensing for identification, sequentially eliminating skill groups, and using a different data source for licensing rules. I also perform a placebo exercise in which I randomly assign occupations to skill clusters and recompute my estimates. This exercise rules out correlated shocks coming through mechanisms other than occupational skill similarity.I then discuss some of the mechanisms that may explain spillovers across occupations. Spillovers may come through several candidate mechanisms. First, licenses can have negative wage spillovers by raising costly barriers to entry in one occupation and redirecting and increasing labor supply to unlicensed occupations. However, the results that I find for employment are not consistent with this explanation.Second, other work on licensing suggests that the rate of new firms opening in particular locations is responsive to the licensing environment (Plemmons, 2022,Zapletal, 2019). If firms avoid costly licensing rules via location choices, this may drive down local demand for labor in general or for labor in particular skill groups orindustries. Though I do not find overall reductions in labor demand, I do find some support for the industry-specific labor demand effect by separating within-industry licensing exposure from total exposure. Both types of exposure have important effects, meaning that, while industry-specific labor demand may be a mechanism behind some portion of the total effect, industry sorting cannot explain the entire effect.Third, a contraction in employment in licensed occupations might also reduce employment in occupations that are complements to licensed occupations. Measuring complementarity exposure as a weighted share of licensing intensity within narrow industries, I find a limited role for this channel in explaining the earnings and employment effects in my analysis.Fourth, in a state of imperfectly competitive labor markets, occupational licensing may increase firm monopsony power because licenses make outside options costlier to enter or harder to find. In such a setting, employment in other occupations may fall because firms with market power have the ability to hire fewer workers and paylower wages(Ashenfelter et al., 2010). This can happen directly by increasing adjustment costs (e.g. time, money) or by indirectly reducing the number of outside firms hiring workers with similar skills through firm location choices (Plemmons, 2022). Both of these may lead to a decrease in labor supply elasticity to the firm and increase firm market power. Though not conclusive without firm-level data, this analysis provides evidence of this channel being a likely explanation.This paper contributes to the growing empirical literature on the effects of labor market regulations on workers and the labor market as a whole. In addition to the growing field of research on occupational licensing, recent studies have examined the effects of enforcing non-compete and non-disclosure agreements and have found that enforcement of these agreements reduces worker wages (Lipsitz and Starr, Forthcoming,Starr, 2019,Starr et al., 2021), including possible negative effects on those unconstrained by these agreements (Starr et al., 2019). The main mechanisms are a combination of a decrease in the number of outside options for a worker, an increase in search andswitching costs, and a decline in worker mobility, each of which increases firm monopsony power. This recent literature connects to a well-established theoretical literature on the role of labor market institutions and occupational crowding. For example, discriminatory hiring practices against black workers, particularly in stable skilled “craft” professions, may lead to occupational segregation and lower earnings for black workers by pushing them into lower-paid service jobs (Bergmann, 1971,Bergmann, 1974). Similarly, unionization in industries may have negative effects on the earnings of non-union labor in the presence of crowding or complementarities (Neumark and Wachter, 1995). This study contributes to this literature by considering licensing as a particularly costly barrier that positively affects the “in-group” while negatively affecting the “out-group.”On the topic of occupational licensing, recent studies suggest there are sizable wage premiums associated with occupational licensing on the order of 7–30% (Kleiner and Krueger, 2013,Gittleman et al., 2018,Kleiner and Vorotnikov, 2017,Kleiner and Soltas, 2019,Thornton and Timmons, 2013,Carollo, 2020b,Zhang and Gunderson, 2020). Synthetic control and other panel estimates of licensing wage premiums within occupations are approximately 7–10% and are similar to my estimates (Pizzola and Tabarrok, 2017,Thornton and Timmons, 2013,Carollo, 2020b).The main mechanism for these wage premiums is a reduction in labor supply and employment in licensed occupations (approximately 20% as inBlair and Chung, 2019,Kleiner and Soltas, 2019), with some exceptions in occupations like nursing (DePasquale and Stange, 2016). Licensed workers also work more hours (Bailey and Belfield, 2018,Kleiner and Soltas, 2019), and prices in the product market for licensed workers rise (Wing and Marier, 2014,Adams III, et al., 2002). In addition, the composition of workers shifts with licensing, with more women and black workers entering licensed occupations (Bailey and Belfield, 2018,Redbird, 2017), possibly to take advantage of the signal value of a license (Blair and Chung, 2018). Work on migration suggests that licenses decrease interstate migration by as much as 36% (Johnson and Kleiner, 2017). Importantly, occupational licensing reduces labor market fluidity as measured by job changes and can explain nearly 8% of the total reduction in occupational mobility over the last twenty years (Kleiner and Xu, 2020). This paper contributes to this literature by showing that the wage premium to licensing also comes with a wage penalty for other workers, which may arise through these various frictions.There are two strands of the literature on licensing related to spillovers. First, some studies estimate a wage premium for having a license using binary indicators for licensure as the treatment variable (e.g.Kleiner and Krueger, 2013,Gittleman et al., 2018,Zhang and Gunderson, 2020). While the estimates without occupation fixed effects may contain some information about possible “cross-status” spillover effects of licensing—i.e. licensed on the unlicensed—evaluating that information is not the focus of those studies. These coefficients cannot separate occupation selection effects from cross-occupation spillovers. Finally, these studies primarily rely on selection on observables approaches with individual licensing status as the treatment, which complicates a causal interpretation. My boundary discontinuity design addresses these selection issues, and my clustering approach provides a novel method for directly identifying spillovers while accounting for occupation characteristics.Second, a few important papers find notable direct effects of licensing requirements on occupations that perform substitutable functions. Licensing and credentialing requirements for physical therapists can negatively affect occupational therapists’ wages because many services are substitutable between the two (Cai and Kleiner, 2016). When nurse practitioners are given broader scope for their practice, physicians’ wages fall, while nurse practitioners’ wages rise (Kleiner et al., 2016,Dillender et al., 2022).Kleiner and Park (2010)examine the effects of broadening the scope of practice for dental hygienists. They find that as regulations that allow hygienists to be self-employed are implemented, wages and employment for hygienists both increase, while earnings and employment for dentists both fall. The authors contextualize this result in a monopsony model in which tighter scope of practice regulations grant monopsony power to dentists, who tend to own their own practices and often house the services of hygienists. This paper expands upon this work by broadening the possible role of spillovers and labor market power to a wider set of occupations.This paper contributes to our understanding of the operation of regulated labor markets by identifying the broad effects of occupation-specific regulations on other occupations. This paper demonstrates that strict entry regulation comes at a cost to other workers: lower labor market earnings and employment for those in occupations that use similar skills. This study also shows that these wage externalities are not consistent with a pure labor supply shift to unlicensed occupations. Though industry- and skill-specific labor demand that responds to licensing rules may play a factor, my analysis suggests this cannot explain the entirety of the effects I find. Occupational entry restrictions increase labor market rigidity and influence firm location choices, both of which intensify firm labor market power. My analysis also sheds light on who bears the largest costs of these occupational regulations and shows that the costs disproportionately load on workers that are already more likely to be lower in the income distribution, resulting in an increase in earnings inequality both within and across occupations. This analysis deepens our understanding of the trade-offs between the consumer protection benefits of entry regulations and the dispersed costs of licensure as they are imposed upon consumers and workers in general, most of whom play no part in the legislative negotiations that ultimately determine the scope of these regulations.",Samuel,None,None,None,None,Journal of Public Economics,"Volume 225, September 2023, 104947",0
"1. IntroductionA Potential Pareto Public Good (PPPG) creates an aggregate net benefit to society while harming some of the involved participants in the process (Dekel et al., 2017). Examples include waste treatment facilities (e.g., incinerators or disposals), prisons, and wind turbines (Meyerhoff et al., 2010,Zerrahn, 2017). The collective provision of a PPPG is convoluted and has two dimensions: where to build the project, what we call thesitingproblem; and how large the PPPG would be, what we call thesizingproblem. Since larger projects may be more efficient but cause greater harm, making the compensation attractive to the host who can provide the most extensive public good is fundamental to reaching its Pareto potential.The literature has separately tackled the siting and sizing problems. One strand has proposed mechanisms that select the host of the PPPG and grant a compensation that ensures voluntary participation (Minehart and Neeman, 2002,Sakai, 2012). They address a “not in my backyard”–NIMBY–or “locally unwanted land use”–LULU–situation, acronyms revealing the emphasis on thesitingproblem (Popper, 1983,Schively, 2007). The other strand, addressing thesizingproblem, has focused on incentive-compatible mechanisms that guarantee the efficient provision of public goods, often with personalizedtaxesreflecting the intensity in the valuation of the public project (Chen, 2002,Van Essen and Walker, 2017).We aim to solve together the siting and sizing problems by proposing a mechanism that simultaneously selects a “suitable” host for the PPPG and the optimal size embedded in a Lindahl allocation, defined as an efficient allocation with a set of prices reflecting a burden-sharing agreement (Buchholz and Peters, 2007). Embedding the two problems within our mechanism has three advantages derived from the relationship between project size and the required host’s compensation. First, marginal costs and benefits become central in the normative analysis of PPPG provision. Thus, marginal changes in the size-dependent compensation are more informative about welfare considerations compared to analysis based on binary provision decisions. Second, the collective decision on project size alleviates the NIMBY’s popular resistance because the mechanism embeds elements to curb project size. Third, an endogenous project size allows conceiving this problem in terms of optimally installed capacities, improving future planning and reducing the required facilities.Solving the two problems together is non-trivial. If the host selection criteria combine suitability and public good size, mechanisms tackling thesitingproblem may lose their truthful revelation properties because potential hosts may distort their messages to avoid the local harm. Solutions in this direction select the host first and, in a further stage, the other communities determine the size-dependent compensation (Laurent-Lucchetti and Leroux, 2011). Nonetheless, such informational requirements are equivalent to knowingex antewho the most suitable host is. On the other hand, mechanisms tackling thesizingproblem may not induce voluntary participation if prices follow a Clarke tax rule (e.g., the Vickrey–Clarke–Groves mechanism). Prices based on the caused externality discourage potential hosts because removing their negative utility from the welfare computations would have yielded larger facilities.In our mechanism, each community submits a four-dimensional message. Three components interplay in a market-like fashion: a desired size (or quantity) of the facility, a requested price per unit for being the host, and a paid price per unit for being a non-host community. The fourth component, a bid, allows communities to compete to become the host in a modified second-price auction. The market-like components generate Lindahl allocations in equilibrium: the efficient quantity is attained by charging each community a price proportional to its marginal benefit from this provision (called a Lindahl tax), granting that the total payments are enough tofinancethe public good. The host’s Lindahl tax is negative and reflects the compensation, or earnings, from hosting the facility. If the sum of prices per unit of non-host communities is sufficient to cover the price requested by the host and the building cost per unit, the facility is implemented, and its size is defined by the geometric average of all the desired quantities. An equilibrium with project implementation implies that: (i) each community submits its Lindahl tax, and the total payment matches the total cost and compensation; (ii) the outcome quantity islocallyoptimal for each community.The market-like part of the mechanism does not guarantee a globally optimal allocation because we can have as many Lindahl allocations as communities involved. Communities may be better off as the host, relative to being a non-host, due to the financial compensation in the former role. Moreover, host selection based on prices will create strategic incentives to overstate the willingness to host the facility. Communities interested in taking this role would compete à la Bertrand, and the winner would select a size above its optimal adjusted by a lower compensation per unit of the facility.The auction-like component in our mechanism addresses the “role strategic uncertainty” (i.e., whether a community that benefits from being the host should behave like one) and induces the selection of the globally optimal Lindahl allocation. Each community announces a bid they are willing to pay to become the host. The highest bidder is selected and pays the second-highest bid. This payment acts as a selection device: a community that bears the lower cost of hosting the facility has, after receiving the Lindahl tax, the higher net benefit of being the host and, therefore, the highest willingness to pay for this role. As in standard second-price auctions, truthful bidding (given the other communities’ strategies) leads to an efficient allocation even if each community’s preferences remainprivate information: no community can profit by misreporting the gains from becoming the host.The dual approach of our mechanism reveals that efficient sizing is alocalproperty and efficient siting is aglobalproperty. Besides, our mechanism differs from the existing ones in two features. First, whereas former mechanisms conceive the transfer as a compensation (Kunreuther et al., 1987,O’Sullivan, 1993,Kleindorfer and Sertel, 1994,Minehart and Neeman, 2002), our auction-like component induces competition among communities to become the “seller” in the market-like component of our mechanism. Second, most previous mechanisms sacrifice efficient host selection to maintain budget balance. We took the opposite direction because the payment made by the host is only positive when there is some contestability for the hosting role. Hence, our auction-like component preserves budget balancedness as long as there is a single community willing to host.Our model abstains from two aspects. First, unlikeWaehrer (2003)andAmbec and Kervinio (2016), we do not considerspatial effectsand implicitly assume that the facility’s costs are encapsulated in the hosting community. Abandoning this assumption will increase the complexity of our mechanism because having more than two types (due to buyers’ proximity) would increase the message’s submitted prices. Second, we abstain from discussing the aggregation of preferences within a community. That is, we do not consider the individual incentives behind the delegation process of the community’s decision.",Eduardo,César,None,None,None,Journal of Public Economics,"Volume 225, September 2023, 104953",0
"1. Introduction“It is more important to know what sort of person has a disease than to know what sort of disease a person has.”–HippocratesStandard economic models often assume transactions occur between anonymous buyers and sellers. In practice, however, many exchanges take place in the context of longstanding relationships, such as the client-lawyer, borrower-lender, or patient-primary care physician (PCP) relationship. Of relationships in the healthcare context, a patient’s relationship with a PCP may be one of the most important. Worldwide, PCPs form the building block of the healthcare system, coordinating patient care across specialists, catching initial conditions, and referring patients to downstream care (Starfield, 1994). PCP-patient relationships also tend to be long-lasting: 65% of adults have seen their PCP for more than three years (Baker et al., 2003).Despite their prevalence, it is unclear if patients value relationships and, if so, whether this valuation leads to better health. On the one hand, relationships may be overvalued and detrimental to health outcomes, like doctors performing more C-sections when they know the patient (Johnson et al., 2016). On the other hand, relationships may positively impact patients’ health if health-specific information grows over time or if a good match takes time to find (Alsan et al., 2019).I start by providing descriptive evidence that patients value relationships. I use a travel-cost model to quantify how far patients are willing to travel to maintain their relationship when a PCP moves. I focus on moves where patients can visit moving PCPs by driving⩽40 min farther or see replacement PCPs at the original clinic.1If patients value the relationship, they should follow moving PCP. If patients view PCPs as interchangeable, patients should see staying PCPs at the original clinic.I construct a novel dataset quantifying drive time between patient and clinic-physician zip codes in a 20% sample of Medicare data from 2002–2019. I show that, when a PCP moves⩽40 min away, 45% of patients follow, costing patients about $184 additional dollars per year.2Patients with the longest tercile of relationships are 14 percentage points (pp) more likely than patients with the shortest tercile of relationships to follow their moving PCP.3The evidence suggests that patients value having a relationship with their PCP and that this value increases over the length of the relationship.I then quantify patients’ valuation of relationships in a quasi-experimental framework by leveraging a separate set of moves where patients cannot follow PCPs: physician retirements and relocations>100 miles away. I quantify the effect in a difference-in-differences research design, using a matched control group of PCPs who did not exit but are otherwise similar to exiting PCPs. For identification, I assume that PCPs depart for idiosyncratic reasons unrelated to the health of their patients 2–3 years before the exit. Outcomes of treated and control patients trend similarly 1–3 years before the exit, supporting this assumption.The evidence supports a model where patients value relationships, which positively affect patients’ health. Relationships determine where patients’ demand care: in response to a PCP’s exit, only 23% of patients form a new PCP relationship, instead substituting to physicians they know long-term. For instance, patients increase their use of pre-existing specialists by 5.5%. Adverse events also increase in response to the loss of the relationship. Patients are 4% more likely to die, 4% more likely to have an emergency department visit, and 3% more likely to be admitted to the hospital after losing their PCP. Patients are also 4% more likely to be admitted to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) and 3% more likely to initiate hospice and home health care. The effects are consistent across subgroups, such as baseline risk, disability, being a racial minority, and being also eligible for Medicaid (“dual eligibles”).4To understand why the loss of a PCP impacts patients, I start by ruling out mechanisms not specific to the relationship. I do not find evidence that the firm is disrupted or for network effects by estimating the impact of a PCP’s exit on their coworking, staying PCPs and their patients (patients who never saw the exiting PCP).5I find that staying PCPs see 44 more patients per year after a coworking PCP’s exit, but the outcomes of staying PCPs’ patients are not affected. I also show that access to care does not explain impacts by showing that patients in higher PCP density areas havelargerimpacts than patients in lower PCP density areas, as opposed to the opposite. Further, I rule out differences between exiting and replacement PCPs rate of referring to specialists as an explanation for patients’ increased use of specialists after a PCP’s exit.6I then use heterogeneity in the treatment effect to provide evidence in support of relationships positively impacting patients’ health. I exploit variation in the length of the PCP-patient relationship to show that adverse events increase with the length of the relationship. The evidence suggests that relationships result from an “experience” component, which increases the value of collaboration over time (Becker, 1962,Jaravel et al., 2018,Polanyi, 1966).I build on the existing literature by providing evidence that patients value relationships and that relationships positively impact patients’ production of health. My findings complement work showing that the loss of a PCP disrupts patient care and has mixed impacts on patient welfare in response to a PCP’s retirement among Medicare patients (Sabety et al., 2021,Zhang, 2022,Kwok, 2019), a PCP’s exit among high risk Medicaid patients (Staiger, 2022), and a PCP’s deployment among military patients (Schwab, 2023); there has also been work in Switzerland (Bischof and Kaiser, 2021) and Denmark (Simonsen et al., 2021) quantifying the impact of practice closures on patients.I attempt to bring together the current body of work by leveraging the largest sample to-date: PCP moves and retirements in a 20% sample of Medicare patients from 2002–2019. The sample’s magnitude gives me precision to quantify rare events like mortality and use heterogeneity to delve into mechanisms. For instance,Sabety et al. (2021)andZhang (2022)find imprecise impacts on mortality, partly because their samples are 1/5 as large. The long panel also allows me to be the first to examine the relevance of PCP-patient relationships for patient outcomes. I do so by quantifying patients’ revealed preference for relationships, that patients substitute to providers they know, and that treatment effects vary by the length of the relationship.PCP-patient relationships are often severed, whether through insurance network changes, physician retirement, death, and relocation, as well as non-compete agreements that prevent patients from moving with PCPs across firms (Barnett et al., 2017,Sinsky et al., 2022,Hausman and Lavetti, 2021). Results suggest there are trade-offs to artificially severing relationships via contracts like insurance network changes and non-compete agreements. These results are directly relevant to patients, providers, firms, and policymakers attempting to understand and potentially mitigate the harms of disrupting relationships.The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes how data are constructed. Section 3 quantifies patients willingness-to-follow PCPs. In Section 4, I describe my empirical strategy and identification assumptions. Section 5 presents the aggregate impact of a loss of a PCP. Section 6 explores the specific mechanisms behind the aggregate results. Section 7 concludes.",Adrienne,None,None,None,None,Journal of Public Economics,"Volume 225, September 2023, 104927",0
"1. IntroductionFirms respond to increased labor costs through both employment and non-employment margins. They may reduce their workforce, adopt new labor-saving technologies, increase work intensity, or relocate their business. These diverse adjustment mechanisms make it difficult to fully understand the consequences of a policy that raises firms’ labor costs. Even well-intended policies can result in unintended adverse outcomes for target recipients.In this study, we examine unintended consequences of the minimum wage policy in South Korea. Employers are required to contribute a fixed percentage of employees’ earnings towards social insurance, such as health insurance, retirement pensions, unemployment insurance, and disability insurance.1The contribution amount is proportional to earnings, averaging 8 percent of total earnings during the sample period from 2011 to 2019.2On the other hand, an increase in the minimum wage compels firms to raise hourly wages for employees whose current wages are below the new minimum wage. This may lead to an increase in total earnings and subsequently a higher mandated social insurance contribution. However, it is important to note that workers employed for less than 60 h per month are exempt from mandated contributions. As a result, raising the minimum wage incentivizes firms to take greater advantage of exempt workers, potentially leading to declines in social insurance coverage.Both the minimum wage and social insurance mandate are policies that are widespread in many countries, but there has been limited research on their interaction effects. A social insurance mandate shifts the labor demand curve downward by the amount that employers must pay. At the same time, unlike in the standard case of tax incidence, the labor supply curve is also shifted downwardly by the extent to which employees value social insurance coverage (Summers, 1989).Gruber (1994)showed that when a particular non-wage benefit, such asmaternity benefits, is mandated, a significant portion of its cost is shifted to targeted workers, reducing the negative employment effects of the social insurance mandate. However, this equilibrium adjustment does not occur if wages are downward rigid due to a minimum wage. In such cases, mandating non-wage benefits likely decrease employment, and this negative effect is likely exacerbated if the contribution amount is proportional to earnings.We examine how firms respond to increased labor costs resulting from a minimum wage increase in the presence of a social insurance mandate.3We focus on “under-60” workers: those who work less than 60 h per month and are therefore exempt from employer-mandated contributions. This exemption rule creates a discontinuity in total labor costs per hour at the work hour cutoff.We leverage this discontinuity for a sharp identification of treatment effects. We estimate the effect of a minimum wage increase on the distribution of monthly hours worked. Specifically, we divide hours worked into five-hour bins (e.g., 55–59 and 60–64) and estimate the effect of a minimum wage increase on the share of workers in each bin. We use these estimates to examine whether raising the minimum wage increases the share of under-60 workers and whether this effect is discontinuous at the cutoff hour. Since there are no other policies to use 60 as the cutoff hour than the employer-mandated contribution towards social insurance, we can be sure that the discontinuity in minimum wage effects is the joint consequence of the minimum wage and the social insurance mandate.To identify the causal effects of higher labor costs on the distribution of monthly hours worked, we utilize temporal variation in whether the national minimum wage is binding within exogenously defined groups of workers. Our baseline analysis groups workers by gender, age, education, and industry. For each group, we compute the fraction of “bound” workers whose hourly wage is greater than or equal to the current minimum wage but lower than the new minimum wage (Card, 1992,Machin et al., 2003,Draca et al., 2011,Clemens, 2016,Harasztosi and Lindner, 2019,Jardim and Van Inwegen, 2019,Kabátek, 2021). The fraction of bound workers varies not only across groups but also across years within a group, depending on group-specific wage distribution and the magnitude of increase in the minimum wage.Variations in the fraction of bound workers may reflect group-specific changes in wage distribution over years, for instance, by business cycle. This is a reasonable criticism, since the business-cycle effect is heterogeneous across demographic groups (Bitler and Hoynes, 2015). We check whether our measure solely captures the impact of the minimum wage by separately controlling for the proportions of low-wage workers paid slightly above the minimum wage. This is a feasible robustness check since our payroll data precisely measure earnings and hours worked. Our payroll data consist of individual records for 10 million employees at 30,000 establishments, which were collected by the Ministry of Employment and Labor (MOEL). The data are repeated cross-sections that are representative of non-public establishments with one or more employee. In addition to this robustness check, we additionally validate our results by exploiting unanticipated hikes of the minimum wage during 2018 and 2019. The minimum wage increased by around 30 percent during this period, which was much larger in magnitude compared to increases in prior years. We show that our results are robust when focusing on this particular episode.We find that the share of under-60 workers increases after a rise in the minimum wage. Comparing the effects of the minimum wage over the distribution of hours worked, we find that the effects are discontinuous and drop to zero exactly at the cutoff hour, 60. Note that we do not impose any restriction that could differently treat two groups of workers above and below the cutoff. Thus, the discontinuity in estimates for the minimum wage effect at the cutoff hour is found in the data without any parametric restrictions. Given that there is no confounding factor related to the cutoff hour, our findings support that the minimum wage and social insurance mandate jointly increase the share of short-time workers below 60 h. Although the share of under-60 workers is comparatively small, 3.9 percent in our data, our results show that changing hours worked can be another non-employment margin of adjustment to a cost shock. A couple of additional findings further bolster our conclusion. First, we do not find the same results prior to 2011, when working at least 60 h per month was not the eligibility condition for employer-mandated contributions. Second, we find that our findings are robust to controlling for the proportions of low-wage workers.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section2reviews the literature related to our study. In Section3, we introduce the data and institutional background of the social insurance system. We also explain the minimum wage in Korea and document recent trends of short-time workers. In Section4, we explain our estimation model and identification assumptions.

"1. IntroductionU.S. state and local governments spend substantial resources on subsidies competing for mobile firms. According to a database from the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, the annual costs of such subsidies have more than tripled since 1990 reaching a total of $45 billion in 2015. This figure is equivalent to around 30 percent of state and local business tax revenue and adds up all subsidies that are commonly available to medium and medium-large firms. They includejob creationtax credits, property tax abatements, investment tax credits, research and development tax credits, and customized job training subsidies.3In this paper, we provide a first comprehensive quantitative analysis of this subsidy competition in the U.S.. We first ask what motivates governments to subsidize firm relocations and quantify how strong their incentives are. We then characterize fully non-cooperative and cooperative subsidy choices and assess how far away we are from these extremes. By doing so, we aim to make sense of a widely used policy intervention and inform the surrounding policy debate. For example, a recurring question is whether the U.S. should follow the EU’s example and ban subsidy competition among states.We pursue this analysis in the context of aquantitative economicgeography model which we calibrate to U.S. states. Influenced by thetrade policyliterature, we calculate optimal subsidies, Nash subsidies, and cooperative subsidies and then compare them to observed subsidies. Optimal subsidies are the subsidies states would offer if they did not have to fear any retaliation and shed light on the incentives states have. Nash subsidies are the subsidies arising in a best-response equilibrium and can be thought of as capturing a ”subsidy war”. Cooperative subsidies are the optimal subsidies of the federal government.We find that states have strong incentives to subsidize firm relocations in order to gain at the expense of other states. Optimal subsidies average $14.9 billion, would raise real income by an average 2.2 percent in the subsidy imposing state, and would lower real income by an average −0.2 percent in all other states. We also find that observed subsidies are much closer to cooperative than non-cooperative subsidies but that the potential costs of an escalation of subsidy competition are large. In particular, moving from observed subsidies to Nash subsidies would cost on average −1.1 percent of real income while moving to cooperative (i.e. zero) subsidies would only improve welfare minimally.The key mechanism in our analysis is an agglomeration externality in theNew Economic Geographytradition which derives from an interaction of internal increasing returns and trade costs. In particular, consumers benefit from being close to firms because this gives them access to cheaper final goods. Similarly, firms benefit from being close to firms because this gives them access to cheaperintermediate goods. By subsidizing firm relocations, states try to foster local agglomeration at the expense of other states so that their subsidies are beggar-thy-neighbor policies.When constructing our model, we try to strike a balance between parsimony and realism to be able to clearly illustrate the main mechanisms and yet obtain broadly credible quantitative results. In our opinion, parsimony is an important virtue even for quantitative models since more realistic assumptions only make such models more credible to the extent that they do not turn them into a black box. This is even more true in economic geography models in which analytical results are notoriously hard to derive so that quantitative analyses also serve to reveal more fundamental conceptual points.Our paper builds on a rich literature in public economics, economic geography, and international economics. Most closely related are a number of recent papers studying place-based policies in quantitative economic geography environments.4Relative to most of these papers, our key contribution is to go beyond an analysis of exogenous policy changes and solve for non-cooperative and cooperative policy. To the best of our knowledge,Fajgelbaum and Gaubert (2020)is the only other paper in that literature going beyond an analysis of exogenous policy changes. However, they focus on the social planner’s solution and do not consider subsidy competition.Our paper also connects to the broader bidding for firms and tax competition literature. Relative to this literature, a key distinguishing feature is our use of a quantitative economic geography model.5As surveyed byRedding (2020), models like ours have proven very effective at capturing the spatial distribution of economic activity and thus seem like a natural starting point for our quantitative analysis of subsidy competition. As will become clear later, we do not focus on firm-level business incentives but instead on broad-based subsidies available to all firms. In that sense, our work is more closely related to the tax competition than the bidding for firms literature.The optimal subsidy argument we develop in the paper builds on the insight ofVenables (1987)that governments have an incentive to exploit theagglomeration economiesbackward and forward linkages bring about. We have already explored the implications of it for tariff wars in a series of earlier papers (Ossa, 2011,Ossa, 2012,Ossa, 2014) and also draw on some of the methods we developed there. Having said this, there are some fundamental differences between tariff wars and subsidy wars. The most striking one is that subsidy wars can potentially improve overall welfare because the localspilloverswhich make subsidy wars tempting also bring about allocative inefficiencies which subsidies can correct.6The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we lay out the theoretical framework describing the basic setup, the equilibrium for given subsidies, thegeneral equilibriumeffects of subsidy changes, and the agglomeration and dispersion forces at work. In Section 3, we turn to the calibration, explaining how we choose the model parameters, what adjustments we make to the model, and how we deal with possible multiplicity. In section 4, we perform the main analysis, exploring the welfare effects of subsidies, optimal subsidies, Nash subsidies, and cooperative subsidies.",Alessandro,Ralph,None,None,None,Journal of Public Economics,"Volume 224, August 2023, 104919",0
"1. IntroductionUnderstanding what affects women’s educational investment remains important because education decisions are often intertwined with other social statuses and are made at a young age, leaving a great consequence of this investment on their career and family formation. Many papers investigate the determinants of women’s education and various factors have been proposed (Lazear, 1977,Becker, 2009,Goldin, 1992,Lafortune, 2013). Among the determinants of education, what has long attracted grand attention is the labor market gains—not only because the mechanism has well been established byeconomic theory(Becker (1960)) but also because many policies have actually been enacted to promote women’s advancement in the labor market. While there is an undeniable relationship between women’s education and labor market outcomes, it requires empirical analysis to assess the degree to which labor market opportunities affect women’s education decisions.This paper estimates the effects of reduced labor market returns on women’s college enrollment decisions by analyzing an introduction of a gender-based hiring quota in Iran. The Iranian hiring quota, which was announced in March of 2010 and immediately took effect, significantly reduced new female hires in the public sector from 55.3% in 2008–2009 to 24.8% in 2010–2011 (Source: Statistical Center of Iran). After the quota implementation, gender qualification is added to all public sector job postings and most job openings are allocated to men. This large-scale, economy-wide quota provides an ideal setup to estimate the effects of labor market opportunities on women’s college education because the sudden introduction of the quota leads to a sharp reduction inlabor demandfor skilled women, independent of the preceding trends in labor market conditions. The expected impact is almost exclusively for young female college graduates because the Iranian public sector provides a major source of employment opportunities for skilled women, and most public-sector jobs require a college degree.To show this, we exploit a discontinuity in expected labor demand for female college graduates and apply a fuzzy regression discontinuity (FRD) design using the birth year and month as the forcing variable. Specifically, we consider that the quota reform affected college entering decisions for the education cohorts who graduated from high school after the announcement of the policy and compare their educational outcomes to those who had graduated from high school (and made college entering decisions) before the announcement. Foreseeing a sharp reduction in employment opportunities, women in the last year of high school or younger would value college education differently from the previous education cohorts. The year-month birth cohort is convincingly exogenous and highly correlated with the timing of deciding college enrollment because most Iranian students follow a September school cutoff and spend three years in high school.Using nationally representative data from the 2006–2015 Iranian Labor Force Survey (ILFS), we find that the hiring quota reduced women’s college attendance rate (conditional on completing secondary school degrees) by 11.4% points from 46.8% and increased that of men by 4.6% points from 50.8%. Such large, immediate effects of the quota are reasonable given the great magnitude of job reduction; a rough estimate indicates that 37–48% of new jobs are lost for college-educated women.1People also quickly became aware of the policy due to the media coverage and perceived the policy as a long-lasting change.2We further estimate the effects on college majors to investigate the well-documented findings in the literature that labor market returns also influence college major choices. We find that the quota decreased the proportion of female students in college majors with a higher probability of public employment. The findings on college majors provide additional evidence of the importance of labor market returns on women’s educational outcomes and support our argument that reduced college enrollment is likely through the channel of reduced labor market returns.To understand which groups are more sensitive to labor market returns in designing effective public policies, we conduct further subgroup analysis. We find that the effects on college enrollment are significantly larger in the urban areas, for households with more siblings, but there is no notable difference in the effects between those with a male sibling and those with a female sibling. These results are in accordance with our proposed mechanism. The greater impact in the urban areas is likely to reflect a larger intensity of the treatment since most job reductions for women are observed in the urban areas. The larger sensitivity related to the number of siblings may indicate a greater sensitivity among those with a tighter household budget. No differences across the gender of siblings show no support for changes in social norms or the perceived importance of sending boys to college.Last, we look at the other impacts of the quota. In particular, we are interested in whether the quota affects educational outcomes other than college enrollment and what happened to those who declined to attend college after the quota. We find no significant effects on enrollment in high school or the timing of graduation from high school. Such results are not surprising because the quota did not affect job openings for those without a college degree. We also find no evidence for changes in thelabor supply behaviorof female high school graduates in the post-quota period. All in all, these analyses show that no other effects have been detected, and we conclude that college education decisions are the main impacts of the quota.Given that the quota adversely affected women’s college education, a natural question to ask is how the quota affects women’s later life outcomes through the channel of reduced education. Though we are not able to apply the Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity (FRD) design nor show the results over a longer period due to the data limitation, we plot the marriage andfertility ratesevaluated at each age across birth cohorts. We find no significant differences in the outcomes at ages 18 and 19 but detect an increase in both outcomes at ages 20 and 21 for the cohorts whose college decisions are more likely to be affected by the quota. The results show that those who do not attend college chose earlier entry into marriage and/or motherhood, and the effects start to be visible two to three years after the quota. These data patterns are in line with the findings in the literature that education reduces the propensity to get married and have children at a younger age (Goldin et al., 2006,Duflo et al., 2015, andJensen (2012)). However, how the effect evolves over a longer period remains unknown.This paper contributes to the literature on returns to education by exploiting perceived changes in employment opportunities with a focus on women’s college education. An increasing number of recent studies estimate the effects of labor market returns on education decisions and consistently find labor market returns as an important education determinant for both genders. Most of thecausal analysisstudying college education utilizes well-designed experiments that generate exogenous changes in subjective (or perceived) returns to education (Arcidiacono et al., 2012,Jensen, 2010,Jensen, 2012,Kaufmann, 2014,Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner, 2012,Attanasio and Kaufmann (2014)). There are extant studies using non-experimental data and look at primary education or secondary education but not college education because the intended treatment alters demand for lower-skilled workers in rural areas in less developed countries, mostly populated by individuals with less education (Oster and Steinberg, 2013,Shah and Steinberg, 2019, andHeath and Mushfiq Mobarak (2015)).3One exception,Abramitzky and Lavy (2014), use Israeli data to estimate the effects of a pay reform that increased labor market returns to high school and college education. Their design estimates the causal effect of the returns to schooling on high school education, but not the one on a college education because their estimates on college capture the combined effects of increased returns to schooling and improved high school performance. Addressing this lacuna, our analysis adds to this strand of the literature by investigating a rare situation that reduced labor demand for young female college graduates only while keeping other factors constant. Since the actual labor market changes caused by policies may generate differences across individuals in the way of collecting information, our analysis demonstrates how individuals form their perceptions about the changes and react to them, thus helping us assess the role of public policies.Finally, this paper complements the literature on hiring quotas and affirmative action policies by focusing on the quota against women and its impact on post-secondary schooling decisions. There are relatively scarce studies on large-scale gender hiring quotas. Most evidence on the effects of hiring quota is based on racial quota (Chay, 1998,McCrary, 2007,Chin and Prakash, 2011,Peck, 2017). Most of the existing papers on gender hiring quotas analyze caps for women in parliaments or executive posts. For example,Duflo (2005)reviews and analyzes the gender hiring quota with a focus on the political reservation. Due to the scarce incidence of economy-wide hiring policies for women like the 2010 Iranian quota and, correspondingly, the limited resulting data, this study helps us understand the policy impacts of hiring quota that directly affected young women with a focus on their pursuit of a college education. Therefore, the findings of this paper demonstrate the importance of government policy in affecting women’s human capital accumulation.",Safoura,Atsuko,None,None,None,Journal of Public Economics,"Volume 224, August 2023, 104896",0
"1. IntroductionStarting from the 1980s, the distribution of income in many developed economies has progressively become more unequal and more concentrated.3And yet, tax-transfer systems have not become more redistributive—on the contrary, in a number of countries they have actually become less so.Egger et al. (2019)have recently shown that, since the mid-1990s, economic globalization has resulted in a higher labor tax burden on the middle classes of OECD countries and a lower labor tax burden for the top one percent of earners. Similarly,Immervoll and Richardson (2011, Table 4), in a comprehensive study of redistribution policy among OECD countries, find that the gap between the Gini coefficient of market incomes and that of disposable incomes—a broad measure of redistribution—has fallen from the mid-1990s onwards.4For the U.S., several studies find a reduced progressivity of the tax system (Bargain et al., 2015,Piketty et al., 2018,Wu, 2021), which is only partially offset by changes in the transfer system (Heathcote et al., 2020).5The observation of greater inequality going hand-in–hand with less redistribution through taxation poses a puzzle, and one that is of major policy importance. Standard theories of optimal taxation would predict an increase in tax levels when top incomes rise (Saez, 2001,Slemrod and Bakija, 2001). A combination of higher levels of inequality with less redistributive taxes can only be reconciled with those theories if the increase in inequality is accompanied by an increase in the elasticity of the tax base. And indeed, the evidence points towards a substantially increased tax elasticity of high incomes since the 1980s (e.g.,Rubolino and Waldenström, 2019). Accordingly, one prominent argument in the literature is that the tax base has become more elastic at the upper end of the income distribution because high-income earners have become more inter-jurisdictionally mobile (e.g.,Lehmann et al., 2014). However, for a significant fraction of individuals at the top of the income distribution, international mobility remains limited (Battisti et al., 2018,Kleven et al., 2020).6In this paper we advance an alternative, and complementary, explanation for the concurrent observation of higher income concentration and lower redistribution. Our argument focuses on how optimal redistributive policies are affected by the internationalization ofproduct markets—rather than labor markets— and how this feeds back on the structure of incentive contracts in the labor market.Our starting point is the observation that labor markets are fundamentally shaped by incentive contracts. In a narrow sense, performance-based contracts can be distinguished by an explicit bonus element that is based on measured performance. In the UK,Bell and Van Reenen (2014)show that bonus income represents more than 10% of the total salary for the top 10% of earners employed in financial services, and for the top 5% of earners in other sectors. More generally,Lemieux et al. (2009)find, for a panel of more than 3,000 employees in the U.S., that almost 40% of workers receive some form of performance pay. In other OECD countries, the share of incentive contracts is somewhat lower, but still above 20% (Bryson et al., 2012). In a broader interpretation, many employed individuals who do not explicitly receive bonuses still face implicit performance-related incentives.Fama (1980)andHolmstrom (1999)have emphasized the role of implicit incentive contracts in a dynamic setting where satisfactory performance of a worker today is rewarded by promotions and a higher (nominally fixed) pay tomorrow. The importance of such implicit incentives has been empirically confirmed with both field and experimental data (Frederiksen, 2013,Sliwka and Werner, 2017). Increased reliance on performance pay is also a core reason for why U.S. wages have become substantially more volatile since the mid-1980s (Champagne and Kurmann, 2013,Nucci and Riggi, 2013). With incentive contracts, income inequality stems from two different sources: differences in individual abilities and outcome-dependent wage differentials for individuals of identical abilities. Redistributive taxation can address the first source of wage inequality but not the second, as the latter arises as a second-best market solution to a moral hazard problem. Performance pay thus limits the redistributive role of tax policy for any empirically observed distribution of earnings.The second building block in our argument is the observation that the globalization of product markets is associated with higher individual income risk and steeper pay incentives.Rodrik, 1997,Rodrik, 1998, was among the first to show that rising trade exposure is associated with higher aggregate income volatility. At industry and firm levels,Autor et al., 2017,Autor et al., 2020, have documented rising concentration indices in major industry groups of the U.S. economy and have proposed asuperstar firmmodel to explain why industries seem to be increasingly characterized by ‘winner-takes-most’ features. This matches international evidence of ‘export superstars’, showing that the top percentile of firms is responsible for 80% of a country’s exports (Bernard et al., 2018), and that the top firm alone is able to create sectoral comparative advantage (Freund and Pierola, 2015). Analyzing the labor market implications of globalization,Cuñat and Guadalupe (2009)provide empirical evidence that increased foreign competition raises the share of performance pay and increases wage differentials among executives in U.S. firms. Similarly,Dasgupta et al. (2018)report that major industry-level tariff cuts induced CEO turnover in U.S. firms and increased incentive pay for the new, outside CEOs. On the exporting side,Ma and Ruzic (2020)show that China’s accession to the WTO in 2001 increased within-firm earnings differentials among U.S. firms that exported to China before the trade shock. In line with these findings, we model product market integration as a process that increases aggregate productivity but also raises income risks for firms and their workers as a result of increasingly global product market competition.To develop our arguments, we describe a model of second-best contracting where incomplete insurance is required to elicit effort in the presence of moral hazard. Risk-averse workers with heterogeneous abilities face a continuous choice of labor supply, and a discrete choice between a performance-based contract that induces effort and a less efficient fixed-wage contract that does not. In equilibrium, higher productivity workers select into performance contracts, whereas less productive workers choose fixed-wage contracts. We then introduce a model of international competition in product markets, where market integration leads to a concentration of project returns. This increases the variance of returns within incentive contracts, which in turn raises the critical productivity level above which a worker will select into a performance-based contract.Finally, we ask how these changes feed into the choice of an optimal linear tax rate financing a lump-sum transfer.7To this end, we characterize optimal tax policy in our model of incomplete contracting, before studying how the optimal tax formula is affected by a wider spread in market returns that follows from globalization. The increased prevalence of lower-productivity, fixed-wage contracts induced by this increase in income uncertainty, and the rising costs of disrupting higher-productivity performance-based contracts through taxes, both contribute to a push for lower taxes. As a result, we show that economic globalization can lead to a reduction in taxes, despite the concomitant increase in income concentration. Results obtained from a numerical version of the model calibrated to 2016 U.S. data shows that a globalization-induced increase in income concentration leads to a fall in the optimal tax rate under plausible parameter values. In contrast, we show that a similar increase in income concentration in a standard optimal tax model with complete contracting leads to an increase in the optimal tax rate.Our study is related to several strands of literature, starting with the large literature on the optimal progressivity of income taxes (seeDiamond and Saez, 2011, for an overview), and, more specifically, on redistributive taxation in the presence of earnings risk (seeBoadway and Sato, 2015, for a synthesis). FollowingVarian (1980), most of this literature takes earnings volatility as exogenous, driven by luck. The implications of endogenous earnings risk are considered in a small literature strand that focuses on the ‘crowding out’ of private insurance by social insurance or redistributive taxation (Golosov and Tsyvinski, 2007,Chetty and Saez, 2010;Krueger and Perri, 2011,Chang and Park, 2021). Most closely related to our analysis isDoligalski et al. (2022), who analyze redistributive taxation in a model of performance pay contracts where individuals make continuous effort decisions within contracts. Besides differences in the way they model effort and contracts, their focus is on the implications of performance pay for the optimal non-linear income tax. Our focus is instead on how the internationalization of product markets affects the optimal linear income tax through its effects on the structure of labor market contracts.8Our study also connects to prior research analyzing the optimal tax implications of the internationalization of labor markets, which largely focuses on the increased mobility of high-income earners (Simula and Trannoy, 2010,Bierbrauer et al., 2013;Lehmann et al., 2014,Tóbias, 2016,Landier and Plantin, 2017). In these models, changes in optimal income tax rates are exclusively driven by efficiency considerations related to the level and the slope of the semi-elasticity of migration.9They tend to find that labor market integration leads to inefficiently low redistributive income taxes, althoughJaneba and Schulz (2023)show that the downward effect of migration on redistributive income taxes is partly offset by general equilibrium effects.10Here we focus instead on the global competition of product markets and its effects on performance-based contracts as an alternative channel through which economic globalization influences tax policy choices. In our model, the increase in income dispersion within contracts induced by economic globalization generates an effect analogous to the ‘superstar effect’ examined byScheuer and Werning (2017). However, introducing superstar effects for a given distribution of abilities in the setting they study leaves the optimal redistributive tax rate unchanged, because the higher redistributive gain from the tax is exactly offset by the larger elasticity of the tax base. In our setting instead, the increase in the dispersion of income within contracts can lead to a fall in the optimal tax rate.Our analysis proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes our model of incomplete contracting, studies the sorting of heterogeneous workers into performance-based versus fixed-wage contracts, and analyzes how taxation affects the structure of contracts. Section 3 introduces a model of international trade and discusses the relationship between the structure of contracts and economic globalization. Section 4 turns to redistributive taxation: it analyzes the effects of economic globalization on the optimal tax rate and presents numerical simulation results from a calibrated version of the model. Section 5 discusses our findings and their robustness to extensions. Section 6 concludes.",Antoine,Andreas,Carlo,None,None,Journal of Public Economics,"Volume 224, August 2023, 104920",0
"1. IntroductionFirms exercise significant market power when setting wages. How much market power they can exert depends critically on the elasticity of labor supply (Robinson, 1933,Manning, 2003). This statistic is not policy-invariant. I show that this insight has an implication fortaxpolicy. In particular, if wages are set by a monopsonist and individuals choose how many hours to work, the government can use thecurvatureof the tax function to boost wages of low-skilled workers by raising their elasticity of labor supply. This is achieved by settingmarginal tax ratesthat are declining in income. Consequently, the optimal tax schedule is concave at the bottom of the income distribution.To reach this conclusion, I study a Mirrleesian environment where individuals differ in their ability, which is not observed by the government. Individuals take their hourly wage and the tax schedule as given and optimally choose how many hours to work. Wages are not determined competitively as inMirrlees (1971), but instead set by a monopsonist that observes ability and maximizes profits taking into account how wages affect individual labor supply. As a result, wages are marked down relative to productivity, which generates downward distortions in labor supply. The government has a preference for redistribution and levies a nonlinear tax on labor earnings and an exogenous tax on profits.A novel feature is that labor market outcomes do not only depend on the level and slope of the tax function, but also on its curvature, i.e., the second derivative. The latter determines how responsive individuals are to wage changes. To illustrate, suppose the tax function is convex and marginal tax rates increase steeply with income. Individuals then have weak incentives to work longer hours following an increase in the hourly wage. A low elasticity of labor supply, in turn, implies that a profit-maximizing monopsonist setslow wages. Consequently, a local increase in thesecondderivative of the tax function reduces the hourly wage, hours worked and labor earnings.A government that is interested in redistribution can exploit this feature to boost wages of low-skilled workers. I characterize the allocation that maximizes welfare subject to resource and incentive constraints, and show that the tax schedule that implements it is concave at the bottom of the income distribution. Declining marginal tax rates at low earnings raise the labor supply elasticity of low-skilled workers, which increases their wages. The government sets the curvature of the tax function in such a way that the monopsonist does not extract any rents from hiring the least-skilled workers: if the tax system is optimized, the monopsonist pays the least-skilled workers a wage equal to their productivity. At the bottom of the income distribution, the optimal tax system thus offsets the negative impact ofmonopsonypower on wages.The finding that optimal marginal tax rates for low-skilled workers are declining in income is a local result. I also derive an optimal tax formula that holds at each point in the income distribution. To that end, I study the welfare effects of increasing thesecondderivative of the tax function just below a particular income level, and decreasing it right above. This reform induces a local increase in the marginal tax rate, cf.Saez (2001)andGolosov et al. (2014). The optimal tax formula is obtained by setting the sum of the welfare-relevant effects from this reform equal to zero. Compared to existing results from the literature, the additionalsufficient statisticsthat characterize optimal tax policy are the impact of tax curvature on labor earnings and hourly wages, and the impact of the level and slope of the tax function on hourly wages and profits.To illustrate the implications of the monopsonistic forces for optimal income taxes, I calibrate a structural version of the model to the US economy, assuming the latter is subject to a very high degree of monopsony power. At the optimal tax system, the government exploits curvature effects to boost the wages of low-skilled workers. It does so by letting marginal tax rates decline rapidly at low income levels. In addition, to alleviate the downward distortions from monopsony power on labor supply, most workers face a negative marginal tax rate, which never occurs if labor markets are competitive (cf.Mirrlees, 1971,Saez, 2001). It should be noted, however, that the negative marginal tax rates are a consequence of imposing a degree of monopsony power that is much larger than in the actual economy, as in the model individuals can only work at one firm. If that assumption is relaxed, optimal marginal tax rates are unlikely to be negative.A number of recent papers study optimal redistributive taxation in an environment where firms have market power, either in the market for goods (Kaplow, 2019,Boar and Midrigan, 2020,Kushnir and Zubrickas, 2020,Eeckhout et al., 2021,Gürer, 2021) or, as in the current paper, the market for labor (Hariton and Piaser, 2007,Cahuc and Laroque, 2014,da Costa and Maestri, 2019,Hummel, 2021).Cahuc and Laroque (2014)study the desirability of minimum wages alongside an optimal income tax if firms observe ability and labor supply responds on the extensive (participation) margin. By contrast,Hariton and Piaser (2007)andda Costa and Maestri (2019)characterize optimal tax policy in an environment where firms do not observe ability and workers supply labor on the intensive (hours, effort) margin.Hummel (2021)analyzes the implications of monopsony power for optimal income taxation and welfare if firms observe ability and labor supply responds on both the intensive and extensive margin. As inHariton and Piaser (2007)andda Costa and Maestri (2019), firms offer workers contracts that specify labor effort and earnings. The key difference with these studies is that in the current paper, the monopsonist only sets hourly wages as individuals choose how many hours to work. Consequently, unlike in the aforementioned studies, labor market outcomes depend on the curvature of the tax function, which is the main focus of this paper.1It is well known that measures of labor supply or earnings responses to wage or tax changes, such as the elasticity of taxable income (ETI), depend on the curvature of the tax function. See, among others,Saez (2001)andJacquet and Lehmann (2021)for a discussion of this issue. A key difference is that in my model, the curvature of the tax function affects labor market outcomes directly and not only the behavioral responses to wage or tax changes.Slemrod and Kopczuk (2002)derive an optimal elasticity of taxable income in an environment where the government can affect this elasticity using administrative instruments. By contrast, in my model the government uses the curvature of the tax function to affect the elasticity of labor supply.The wage responses to tax changes that modify optimal tax formulas are reminiscent of the literature that studies optimal income taxation withgeneral equilibriumeffects on wages. See, for example,Stiglitz, 1982,Rothschild and Scheuer, 2013andSachs et al. (2020). In these studies, labor markets are perfectly competitive and wages respond to tax changes because labor types are imperfect substitutes in production. By contrast, in my model labor types are perfect substitutes in production and wages respond to tax changes because firms have labor market power.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model and analyzes the impact of tax curvature on labor market outcomes. Section 3 studies the implications for optimal marginal tax rates at the bottom.

"1. IntroductionWhile economists have traditionally expressed skepticism about place-based policies, a growing literature revisits both the efficiency and equity consequences of targeting transfers to specific places (e.g.,Austin et al., 2018,Fajgelbaum and Gaubert, 2020,Gaubert et al., 2020). Examples of policies intended to improveeconomic conditionsin specific areas include targeted employment subsidies to workers or firms (e.g.,Busso et al., 2013) and block grants to local communities (e.g.,Bartik, 2020). In 2019, the U.S. spent about $300 billion on place-based government transfers, but it spent a far greater amount—over $3 trillion—on person-based transfers.1These numbers increased dramatically over the next three years in response to the COVID-19 pandemic with the federal government’s unprecedented expansion in relief and stimulus funds that flowed to individuals, businesses, and sub-national governments.2Many of the person-based transfers, both before and during the pandemic, depend on individuals’ employment and earnings, so policies that nominally are place-neutral could provide additional resources to areas that experience adverse economic conditions. Person-based transfers could have important place-based consequences because of the fiscal multiplier, which might improve the economic opportunities of individuals who do not directly receive transfers. For example, younger individuals who are located in areas with depressed economic opportunities might benefit from the increase in local spending facilitated by retirement benefits received by older individuals. More broadly, the place-specific consequences of person-based transfer programs inform the effectiveness of social insurance programs and the optimal design of supplementary place-based policies.This paper investigates the response of the social safety net to place-specific shifts in economic activity arising from recessions over 50 years.3Specifically, we study how per capita earnings and government transfers evolve in local areas where national recessions are more versus less severe. We draw upon multiple data sources, including those from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Census Bureau, and the Social Security Administration, to create annual panels of longitudinally-harmonized geographic areas stretching over five decades. We estimateevent studymodels that relate the evolution of income measures to sharpemployment changesduring recessions, while controlling for pre-recession trends in population growth.Our focus on recessions is motivated by two main considerations. First, the response of the safety net to recessions is of central importance to policymakers and researchers (e.g.,Moffitt, 2013,Bitler and Hoynes, 2016,Bitler et al., 2017a). Second, recessions lead to persistent declines in economic activity in areas that experience more severe employment losses (Hershbein and Stuart, 2023). The lasting effects of recessions on local economic activity allow us to identify the response of the safety net to persistent changes in economic opportunity, which has been the focus of much recent work (e.g.,Austin et al., 2018).We find that person-based transfer programs have substantial place-based consequences. In particular, local labor markets that experience more severe employment losses during a recession face lasting reductions in employment and per capita earnings, but they also receive lasting increases in per capita transfers. Our estimates imply that a metro area experiencing a 5 percent greater employment loss during a recession has total transfers per capita that are 2.4 percent higher nearly a decade after the national recession trough.4While sizable, the elevated transfers equal only 16 percent of the long-term decline in per capita earnings on average.Our data permit us to examine which types of transfers respond, both immediately in the wake of the recession and over the next several years. By design, unemployment insurance (UI) responds immediately and then fades away. Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security (which includes retirement and disability insurance) account for nearly all of the long-run increase in per capita transfers. Income maintenance transfers also show a sustained rise, but the magnitudes are small because these programs account for only 10 percent of total transfers.5Education and training transfers account for a negligible share of the total transfer response.Because we examine the response of transfers at the local labor market level, a change in the composition of residents is a potential mechanism for post-recession changes in transfers. We find that recessions differentially shift the age structure of harder-hit areas, making them older, and that these shifts can explain 60 percent of the long-term increase in transfers. In contrast, changes in the age structure explain much less of the impacts of recessions on per capita earnings.Additional analyses underscore the quantitative importance of person-based transfers for places. Simple calculations imply that a metro area with the median population (about 265,000 residents) that experiences a 5 percent greater employment loss during the recession receives about $630 million more in transfers during the first ten post-recession years. For a metro area at the 90th percentile of the population distribution (with 1.86 million residents), the increase in transfers in response to a 5 percent greater employment loss is over $4.4 billion. While there is considerable variation in existing estimates of local fiscal multipliers (e.g.,Chodorow-Reich, 2019,Pennings, 2021,Ramey, 2019,Clemens et al., 2022,Suárez Serrato et al., 2016), our results suggest that employment declines in negatively impacted areas could be up to 21 percent more severe in the absence of increases in person-based transfers.Our paper primarily contributes to studies of negative economic shocks and individual transfer receipt (e.g.,Bitler et al., 2017a,Bitler et al., 2017b,Bitler and Hoynes, 2016,Hoynes et al., 2012,Moffitt et al., 2020). Closely related research finds that local economic conditions influence the receipt of Social Security Disability Insurance, Supplemental Security Income, and cash welfare (Black et al., 2002,Autor and Duggan, 2003,Black et al., 2003,Charles et al., 2018,Maestas et al., 2021). We contribute to this literature in three ways. First, we examine a broader set of transfers, geographies, and years.6Second, we focus on the consequences of transfers for places, which complements the existing focus on the consequences of transfers for individuals.7Our analysis of the consequences of transfer programs for places reveals that retirement and medical transfers play a larger role than commonly understood. In contrast, the means-tested programs previously studied do not make up the bulk of transfer dollars going to negatively affected local areas over the longer term. Finally, we combine our estimates of the transfer response with estimates of fiscal multipliers to explore the degree to which person-based transfers could mitigate declines in local employment after recessions. These calculations underscore the sizable consequences of person-based transfers for places.",Brad,Bryan,None,None,None,Journal of Public Economics,"Volume 224, August 2023, 104923",0
"1. IntroductionWe test whether minimum wage policy influences employment, permanent employment exit, and retirement benefit claiming for low-wage, retirement-age workers. Retirement is one of the most consequential economic decisions that individuals make and policies that influence this decision also impact thefinancesof the Social Security system. Minimum wage research often focuses on narrow groups such as teenagers and restaurant workers because these two groups are disproportionately made up of minimum wage workers, but the proportion of individuals who work for a rate of pay near the minimum wage also increases for ages near retirement (seeFig. 1). Theoretical considerations offer conflicting predictions for the impact of minimum wage increases on employment for older workers, but are consistent in predicting large increases in the quantitiy of labor supplied by older low-wage workers. Work incentives associated with the Social Security earnings test may also play a role, as working full-time for the minimum wage historically corresponds to earnings near the earnings test threshold.Download :Download high-res image (128KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. Share of workers earning near minimum wage by age. Source: U.S. Census Bureau Gold Standard File, CBDRB-FY20-CED001-B0003. Note: Share of person-month wage observations less than or equal to 120% of the minimum wage in the SIPP Gold Standard File, by age.Existing evidence related to minimum wages and older workers, specifically, or labor supply, more broadly, is limited despite a large literature on minimum wages and employment. Much of the minimum wage literature focuses on narrow groups such as teenagers, less educated workers, and low-wageindustries.Labor supply effectsare less likely thanlabor demandto play an important role for these groups. The literature that does focus on older workers provides mixed evidence for the impact of increases in the minimum wage on employment and Social Security retirement benefits (Borgschulte and Cho, 2020,Fang and Gunderson, 2009,Lordan and Neumark, 2018). Other recent work has shown positive effects of minimum wages on job search effort and the labor supply of released prisoners and single mothers (Adams et al., 2022,Agan and Makowsky, 2021,Godøy et al., 2021).The contribution of our study stems from the use of linked survey-administrative data. Prior work on minimum wages and older workers is limited by having to rely on self-reported outcomes at a single point in time and/or aggregate Social Security claims data. We provide new micro evidence by linking Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) respondents to individual-level longitudinal administrative records from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Social Security Administration (SSA), thus providing several decades of objective measures of individual-level employment outcomes and benefit receipt. These data avoid measurement issues related to self-reported and aggregate data. They also allow us to analyze longer-run effects on permanent employment exit and identify potential mechanisms for the effects.We find positive effects of minimum wage increases on employment using individual-level panel data regressions. Our results are robust to the use of recent methods in the difference-in-differences andevent studyliterature that account fortreatment effectheterogeneity and staggered treatment timing. Specifically, we find that a 10% increase in the minimum wage is associated with a 2–7 percentage point increase in the probability of employment in a given year after the minimum wage increase (3–10% increase from the sample mean), depending on the method and specification. The event study results show evidence of important dynamics that play out in years after a minimum wage increase. We also find evidence of a decrease in the hazard probability of full permanent employment exit and the hazard probability of claiming retirement benefits after the minimum wage increase.Increased employment and delayed permanent employment exit for older workers is consistent with large elasticities of labor supply for older workers coupled with other margins of firm adjustments, labor-labor substitution, and/orimperfect competition. This could also explain the reduction in retirement benefit claiming if individuals tend to tie the timing of when they claim retirement benefits to when they exit employment. However, the Social Security earnings test may also play a role as working full-time at the minimum wage historically results in annual earnings near the earnings test threshold. We test this by exploiting the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act of 2000, which removed the Social Security earnings test for individuals past their full retirement age (FRA). We find that individuals not subject to an earnings test are still more likely to be employed after a minimum wage increase, but no longer show delayed claiming. This suggests that the delay in claiming retirement benefits associated with minimum wage increases is due in part to higher wages pushing individuals’ earnings across, or further beyond, the earnings test threshold.A key takeaway from our results is that low-wage individuals near retirement are very responsive to wage changes. In order to compare our results to other studies, we translate our preferred minimum wage-employment results into an own-wage elasticity that is equal to 0.816 for individuals ages 62–70. A recent survey of the literature found that the median own-wage elasticity of employment due to minimum wages for overall low-wage workers is −0.04 (Dube, 2019). We replicate our analysis on younger samples of individuals and find own-elasticities that are much smaller and not statistically different from zero. Thus, the large own-wage employment elasticity for retirement-age individuals appears to be due to unique labor supply behavior on their part. Our results contribute to the growing evidence that minimum wage increases can induce positive labor supply effects for certain populations (Adams et al., 2022,Agan and Makowsky, 2021,Godøy et al., 2021) and evidence from life-cycle models of labor supply that generate large labor supply elasticities with respect to wage around the time of retirement (Fan et al., 2022,French, 2005,French and Jones, 2011). Our results also contribute to work showing that small overall employment effects may mask important effect heterogeneity across groups (Cengiz et al., 2019,Neumark and Shirley, 2022): while prior research identifies teenagers, individuals with less education, and individuals in tradable sectors as groups that may suffer employment losses, we identify older low-wage individuals as a group that benefits most from minimum wage increases.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 summarizes related work on minimum wages and employment, details of the Social Security program, and theoretical models.

"1. IntroductionThis paper studies whether providing educational support to low-achieving students affects the academic performance of their higher-achieving classmates. In the more than 50 years since the publication of the Coleman Report (Coleman (1968)), a large body of research in economics, education and sociology has documented the central role played by peers in determining academic outcomes at all education levels.1Of particular interest is the effect that low-achieving students can have on the performance of the rest of their classmates. Recent studies suggest that these students are detrimental to the academic performance of higher-achieving peers (e.g.,Carrell and Hoekstra, 2010,Lavy et al., 2011;Imberman et al. (2012)). Moreover, there is evidence that these effects are persistent and translate into lower educational attainment and reduced earnings (Carrell et al. (2018)).The existence of negative externalities that low achievers may have on other students provides a compelling argument for whyallparents and policymakers should be concerned about how to properly support this group of students – over and above society’s wider interest in providing low achievers with the skills they need to succeed in school and in the workplace. Yet, previous work has largely been limited to describing the phenomenon rather than studying potential policies that could attenuate the impact of low-achieving peers.In this paper, we exploit the randomized evaluation of a remedial education program that targeted struggling students within a class, to study whether an exogenous improvement of the skills of students at the bottom of the test-score distribution can generate gains for the rest of the class through achievement peer effects. The intervention we consider aimed to improve reading among low-achieving third-grade students in Colombia. At the beginning of the school year, all students were tested to determine their baseline literacy level. Students with baseline reading scores lower than a certain threshold were deemed eligible to receive the tutoring classes.2Schools were then randomized into treatment and control groups. In treatment schools, eligible children were taken out of regular classes to work in small groups with a qualified tutor, who followed a structured pedagogical curriculum for 40 min, three times a week. In control schools, eligible children continued their classes as usual. The intervention improved literacy skills of low-achieving students by one-third of astandard deviation(Alvarez Marinelli et al. (2021)).The research design naturally generates two groups of students within the same class: low-achieving students who were eligible to receive the intervention, and higher-achieving students who were not eligible. (Henceforth, we refer to the students whose scores were low enough to be eligible for the tutoring as low achievers; and we refer to their classmates whose scores were above the threshold for eligibility for the tutoring as higher achievers.) Determination of students’ eligibility for the tutoring program took place prior to schools’ randomization into treatment and control status, allowing us to identify these two groups of children in both treated and control schools.We find that non-eligible children in treated schools scored 0.108 of a standard deviation higher than similar children in the control group. This coefficient is sizable and represents roughly 30 percent of thetreatment effectwe measure on theeligiblestudents. This result is economically meaningful, and its magnitude can be compared to a more commonly proposed school-level reform to tackle poor learning, tracking by prior achievement (Duflo et al. (2011)).We interpret the reduced-form effect on higher achievers as aspillover effectwithin treatment units, and we estimate linear-in-means models of peer effects. Credibly identifying peer effects is challenging given the well-known issues of selection, reflection, and correlated unobservables (Manski (1993)). We overcome these identification challenges by exploiting the experimentally induced variation in the outcome of a sub-set of individuals in the peer group. This approach is defined byMoffitt (2001)as apartial population experiment. Randomization of the program solves the reflection problem as it induces exogenous variation in the outcomes of low-performing children withoutdirectlyaffecting higher-performing students. Second, random assignment implies that the treatment is orthogonal to all observable and unobservable characteristics, solving the problem of correlated unobservables. Finally, because peer groups are established before the policy change and remain fixed throughout the experiment, endogenous group membership is not an issue. We can think of peer effects as being conditional on any selection into groups that might have taken place prior to the experiment.We find strong evidence of peer effects in academic outcomes. A one-standard-deviation increase in peers’contemporaneoustest scores increases individual reading score by 0.679 of a standard deviation. We also find evidence of non-linearities, with stronger effects for students at the top of the achievement distribution.In the educational context, the term peer effect is generally used as an umbrella term that comprisesany externalty, implying that peers’ outcomes have an impact on an individual’s outcome. Peers can affect learning outcomes eitherdirectly, through peer-to-peer interactions or misbehavior, orindirectly, by affecting teachers’ effort and practices (Epple and Romano, 2011,Sacerdote, 2011). We provide suggestive evidence that speaks to these different mechanisms. Using survey data on teachers, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that teachers continued with classroom practices that they were using prior to the start of the intervention. At the same time, we find tentative evidence of a reduction in classroom disruption in treatment schools, which may have driven part of the results (although the effect is not precisely estimated). This suggests that low levels of achievement foster disruptive behavior, and that interventions that only affect learning without directly targeting behavior can relax the constraints posed by low-achieving students on the rest of their classmates.One potential concern with the interpretation of our results is that by removing low-achieving peers from the classroom, higher-achieving students experienced a reduction in class size, which in turn could have had adirectimpact on their performance. We provide several pieces of evidence against this interpretation. First, because of program implementation features the classroom-size reduction was modest (the number of students decreased by just three in an average class of 31 students). Using existing estimates from the literature, we show that this class-size reduction can explain at most a tenth of the reduced-form effect on higher-achieving children. Second, the remedial tutorials did not necessarily take place during regular literacy lessons. For this reason, if the reduction in class size were behind the reduced-form effect on higher-achieving students’ test scores, we would expect to see similar effects on subjects other than literacy. We do not. Third, we find homogeneous effects on higher-achievers in classes that (by virtue of the random assignment of eligible children to tutorial groups) experienced larger or smaller reductions in size.This paper makes several contributions to the literature.First, we relate to a literature studying spillover effects in the educational setting (e.g.,Opper (2019)). We contribute to this literature by demonstrating how educational intervention targeting specific students in the class can generate social multiplier effects that benefit the whole student population. In particular, we show that the failure to consider thesegeneral equilibriumeffects might lead to anunderestimationof the impacts of remedial education interventions. In our context, confining the consideration of the treatment effect to theeligiblepopulation would underestimate the benefits of the program by 47 percent. Our results imply that policies aimed at improving the bottom of the distribution have the potential to generate social-multiplier effects. Importantly, the findings indicate that it is possible to substantially improve academic outcomesfor allwith interventions targeted to the weakest. We believe that these considerations are important to inform any policy debate concerned with the benefits of remedial education interventions, and the allocation of public funds to these types of programs.3Our findings also underline the need to collect data on the entire local economy to fully appreciate the effects ofeducational policieswith a specific target population (low-achieving students in our setting). In addition, the results have implications for the design of policy evaluations in education and suggest the importance of experimentally manipulating individuals’ treatment status within treatment units (schools in our setting) to identify social interactions (this is true in any setting where spillovers are likely to operate, e.g.,Angelucci and De Giorgi, 2009,Cunha et al., 2019).Second, this paper makes three original contributions to a large literature on peer effects in education. In contrast with most of the previous literature, we study the impact of peers’ contemporaneous achievement – theendogenouseffect in the terminology ofManski (1993)– on individual outcomes directly, as opposed to peers’ background characteristics, such as gender, race, or prior achievement.4This is particularly important given that peer effects stemming from background characteristics do not entail a social-multiplier effect. On the other hand, effects stemming from peers’ contemporaneous achievement have the potential to generate social-multiplier effects. As explained inManski (1993): “If individual achievement increases with the average achievement of the students in the school, then an effective tutoring programme not only directly helps the tutored students but, as their achievement rises, indirectly helps all students in the school, with a feedback to further achievement gains by the tutored students. Exogenous effects and correlated effects do not generate this social multiplier.” Just as described in Manski’s seminal contribution, in our setting the beneficial effects of improving the academic achievement of low-achieving students spill over onto non-treated students, magnifying the total output of the program.5A second feature of our paper is that it focuses on peer effects in naturally occurring groups, and exploit the random variation in the outcomes of a subset of group members. This distances our work from that strand of the literature that uses the random allocation of students to groups.6This distinction is important given that opportunities to randomly assign peers are rare in real-world settings – whereas the possibility of randomly treating a subset of individuals within a group might not be so rare. Moreover, a particularly important issue is whether the results in those studies that exploit the random allocation of peers generalize to naturally occurring peer groups. The results inCarrell et al. (2013)directly speak to this issue by highlighting how exogenously manipulating group composition might have unpredictable (and sometimes detrimental) effects on students’ academic outcomes. In the context of the U.S.Air ForceAcademy,Carrell et al. (2013)show that low-ability students placed into “optimally” designed peer groups perform significantly worse than comparable students who were randomly allocated to squadrons.7The explanation for this result is that the treatment changed the patterns of social interactions in ways that were key for student achievement. This evidence highlights how policy-induced patterns of social interactions may be a major obstacle to predicting the effects of altering peers’ composition. Such concerns cast some doubt on the external validity of studies that randomly assign individuals to groups.Finally, this study provides a successful example of how peer effects can be exploited in the design of public policies aimed at improving students’ academic performance. In contrast toCarrell et al. (2013), who focus onexogenouspeer effects by randomly varying thecompositionof peer groups, we exploit the existence ofendogenouseffects within preexisting peer groups, and show that experimentally manipulating the outcomes of the weakest students in the classroom leads to improvements for the overall student population.The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the setting and the remedial education intervention. In Section 3, we discuss the issues related to the identification of peer effects and explain how we use the intervention to overcome these identification challenges. Section 4 describes the data and the experimental effects on the sample of low achievers. In Section 5 we presents the results. Section 6 addresses potential threats to identification, and discusses mechanisms and policy implications.

"1. IntroductionLong-term (LT) unemployment has been at the top of policymakers’ and researchers’ agendas for many years. In 2021, 39% of the EU’s 15 million jobseekers––or 5.9 million people––had been unemployed for more than 12 months, and theGreat Recessionhas imported this traditionally European concern to the United States. LT unemployment is problematic for both society and individuals. For society, it is costly in terms of social safety net expenditures and unused productive capacity. For individuals, long periods of unemployment increase the risk ofpovertyand social exclusion, have adverse effects on health, and lower overall life satisfaction (e.g.,Gerdtham and Johannesson, 2003,Kassenboehmer and Haisken-DeNew, 2009).Many countries have adopted job search monitoring (JSM) programs to foster a prompt return into employment after job displacement by limiting moral hazard issues within unemployment insurance (UI). However, it is unclear to what extent these programs can be effective at raising employment when targeted at the LT unemployed. On the one hand, since job search efforts decrease with unemployment duration, such programs might be particularly effective at sustaining job search efforts among LT unemployed individuals. On the other hand, since these individuals have a weak attachment to the labor market (Krueger et al., 2014), these programs could also foster exits from the labor market through other social safety net programs.In this paper, we study the effects of a JSM program implemented in Belgium in 2004 that targets LT unemployed individuals, focusing on both transitions into employment and potential substitution effects with other social safety net programs. After 15 months of unemployment, participants were invited to periodically visit their employment agency to be interviewed by a caseworker on their job search activities. The consequences of a negative evaluation ranged from a mere warning to permanent exclusion from UI. The focus of the Belgian JSM program on the LT unemployed contrasts with the choice of most other countries to start monitoring after just a few weeks. This allows us to evaluate the effects of JSM when it starts at a more advanced stage of the unemployment spell.Our empirical strategy exploits the fact that between July 2007 and January 2013, the UI agency restricted the inclusion of UI beneficiaries into the JSM program to those who reached 15 months of unemployment before their 49th birthday. We use detailed individual information from register data on the universe of Belgian UI beneficiaries to set up a regression discontinuity (RD) design at age 49. We then estimate the effect of JSM, within a three-year period, on unemployment, employment, disability insurance (DI) participation as well as participation in other social welfare programs (SWP).1We find that JSM leads to a significant 16.6 percentage point (pp) increase in the likelihood of LT unemployed individuals exiting unemployment. However, this increase is primarily driven by a higher probability of receiving DI benefits, with a 12.6 pp rise. In contrast, JSM does not seem to have a noticeable effect on the probability of LT unemployed individuals ever finding employment or engaging in other SWP. We find similar results when looking at the effects of JSM on the cumulative number of days spent in each status. For the LT unemployed, the “spillover effects” of JSM on other social safety net programs thus appear to be restricted to DI, reinforcing previous findings that DI is a close substitute to UI (Borghans et al., 2014,Andersen et al., 2019).We provide further insights into the underlying mechanisms that are driving our findings. First, in a dynamic analysis, we document that the exits from UI to DI persist for up to three years after the monitoring procedure starts. These effects become evident before any sanctions can be imposed for non-compliance with job search requirements, suggesting that the mere threat of a sanction is enough to encourage individuals to transition to DI. Second, we provide more insights into the effects on DI. We show that JSM increases transitions to both short-term (ST) and LT DI, suggesting that health impairments are sufficiently serious to warrant entry into the LT DI program. These increases are driven by musculoskeletal and psychological disorders. In addition, individuals on the left and right of the cutoff exhibit similar exclusion rates from DI, indicating that those who transition to DI as a result of JSM are not in better health than other DI recipients. Third, in our analysis of fiscal implications, we show that the decrease in UI transfers as a result of JSM is almost entirely offset by the increase in DI transfers.Our paper contributes to the literature on JSM programs by studying their effects on the LT unemployed population. An early literature developed job search models with endogenous search effort and sanctions to study the effect of JSM on the job finding rate (Van den Berg et al., 2004,Abbring et al., 2005,Van den Berg and van der Klaauw, 2006,Boone et al., 2007). This theoretical literature predicts that JSM increases job finding for individuals with initially low search efforts and reduces reservation wages, as the present value of UI decreases relative to employment. These predictions are confirmed by a large body of empirical work (e.g.,Van den Berg et al., 2004;Lalive et al., 2005;Cockx and Dejemeppe, 2012;Arni et al., 2013,Lammers et al., 2013,Van den Berg and Vikström, 2014,Avram et al., 2018,Card et al., 2018,Arni and Schiprowski, 2019), although some find small or insignificant effects of JSM on employment (e.g.,Van den Berg and van der Klaauw, 2006,Ashenfelter et al., 2005,Cockx et al., 2018). The effect of JSM on the job finding rate might be alleviated when the program is imposed on individuals who exhibit high search costs (e.g., due to difficulties writing a motivation letter or CV) or reservation wages that are close or equal to the legal minimum wage. This could be particularly relevant for the LT unemployed population, who have a weak connection to the labor market (Krueger et al., 2014).2Moreover, our paper contributes to a literature documenting substitution effects between social safety net programs as a result of changes in eligibility rules or replacement benefits (e.g.,Autor and Duggan, 2003,Karlström et al., 2008,Staubli, 2011,Staubli and Zweimüller, 2013,Borghans et al., 2014,Haller et al., 2020,Johnsen et al., 2022). In this vein, three papers directly focus on JSM to show that it can affect participation in other social safety net programs, although none focus on the LT unemployed population.Petrongolo (2009)finds that starting an unemployment spell soon after the introduction of the Jobseekers' Allowance (JSA) in the UK increases the likelihood of receiving disability benefits by 2.5%-3% in the following year.Lammers et al. (2013)find that imposing JSM on the unemployed aged 57.5–59.5 increases their probability of transitioning to DI within two years by 4.3 pp for men and 9.1 pp for women.Avram et al. (2018)show that imposing job search requirements on single parents increases their probability of receiving health-related benefits by 18 pp after nine months. These studies thus indicate that the implementation of JSM increases the occurrence of disability among the unemployed population, which echoes a literature showing that DI is a close substitute to UI (Black et al., 2002,Charles et al., 2018,Andersen et al., 2019).Our key contribution to the literature is to assess the overall effect––includingspillover effectson other social safety net programs––of implementing JSM on LT UI beneficiaries. Because of their weak attachment to the labor market, LT unemployed individuals might be particularly prone to substituting away from UI to other social safety net programs as a result of JSM. Our paper indeed suggests that in the case of weakly employable individuals (in this case the LT unemployed), substitution effects of JSM can overshadowlabor supply effects.In addition, we provide several novel insights on the mechanisms driving the effects of JSM. First, we complement existing studies showing that a sanction threat is sufficient to foster exits from UI (Black et al., 2003,Boone et al., 2009;Arni et al., 2013) by demonstrating that this also applies to the LT unemployed population but through DI instead of employment. Second, we show suggestive evidence that the effects of JSM on DI documented in this paper are driven by existing health impairments among the LT unemployed population. Finally, our fiscal analysis allows us to conclude that JSM, when targeted at the LT unemployed, generates fiscal spillovers to other social safety net programs that counterbalance the saving on UI spending.The rest of the paper is outlined as follows. In the next section, we briefly explain the Belgian institutional setting.Section 3describes the data used for conducting our estimations, andSection 4presents our identification strategy.Section 5outlines the empirical findings, andSection 6ends with a concluding discussion.",Octave,Elisabeth,Ilan,None,None,Journal of Public Economics,"Volume 224, August 2023, 104929",0
"1. IntroductionConsumers and firms are increasingly going cashless. Even before the COVID-19 crisis, the share of adults using electronic payments in the developing world was increasing fast, by over a third over the 2014–2017 period (Demirguc-Kunt et al., 2018). This rapid technological change could make it easier for governments to tax transactions: electronic transactions, unlike cash, are processed byfinancial institutionsacting as third parties, creating a paper trail which can be used by tax authorities to assess liabilities. There are, however, reasons to question whether this will lead to improvements in tax enforcement and compliance in contexts with limited tax capacity. Governments may not use the third party information effectively (Almunia et al., 2021) and firms may react strategically to keep their liabilities low (Carrillo et al., 2017). While the policy world is optimistic on the revenue-raising potential of the shift to electronic payments (Rogoff, 2016,OECD, 2017,Awasthi and Engelschalk, 2018), empirical evidence is scarce.This paper sheds new light on the potential tax compliance gains of the shift to electronic payments by studying the effect of India’s demonetization episode on firms’ tax payments. On November 8th, 2016, the government of India declared 86% of the existing currency in circulation illegal tender. Printing constraints prevented the immediate replacement of old currency with new notes, leading to a sharp decrease in cash in circulation, a large increase in electronic payments and a drop in economic activity (Chodorow-Reich et al., 2019,Crouzet et al., 2022,Aggarwal et al., 2020).The evolution of key variables before and during the demonetization period can be seen inFig. 1. The left panels plot the evolution of sales reported by firms to tax authorities and taxes paid, using administrative data on firms’ quarterly tax returns for the universe of firms paying Value Added Tax in West Bengal. We see a large increase in the sales firms report to the tax authority and their tax payments in the two quarters following the policy announcement (left panels). This is puzzling given the well documented negative effects of demonetization on economic activity (Banerjee and Kala, 2017,Kumar, 2017,Chodorow-Reich et al., 2019,Karmakar and Narayanan, 2020), which suggestrealsales likely did not increase for the average firm. The right panels ofFig. 1offer a potential explanation for this puzzle: we see a large contemporaneous increase in electronic transaction amounts and the number of electronic payment machines in use from the month of the policy announcement.Download :Download high-res image (443KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1.Evolution of keytaxreturns and electronic transaction variables over time. Notes: These graphs plot the evolution of key variables over time for the period during which they are available in our data, with each point an average across firms for each period (quarter). The vertical dashed lines indicate the start (2016 Q1) and end (2017Q1) of the period defining our estimation sample; the vertical solid line indicates the start of demonetization. Graphs on the left plot the evolution of tax return variables which vary at the firm level: log reported sales (top graph) and log tax payments (bottom graph). These variables are residualized by taking quarter-of-year×district fixed effects (see the text for more details and Fig. A1 for a graph plotting the unresidualized variables). Graphs on the right plot the evolution of electronic payments which vary at the postcode level: log aggregate transaction amounts (top graph) and log total electronic payments machines in use (bottom graph). See the text for a description of the variables and data sources.To go beyond correlations in the time-series evidence, we apply an identification strategy similar to that ofChodorow-Reich et al., 2019,Crouzet et al., 2022,Khanna and Mukherjee, 2022: we use variations in the strength of the demonetization shock at the local level and within-firm variation over time to identify the effect of demonetization. Newly printed currency notes were distributed through local bank branches known as currency chests. Our demonetization shock variable captures variation across local areas in the presence of currency chests, this determined how easily agents were able to access the new notes and therefore how much they were affected by demonetization.We find that demonetization increased reported sales and taxes: the effect at the mean demonetization shock value is 2.4%. We discuss potential mechanisms underlying this effect, and show that the demonetization shock variable is a strong predictor of the growth in electronic payments locally as well as reported sales and tax payments. We argue that aspects of demonetization other than its effects on electronic payments are unlikely to explain the observed effects on tax return variables. Overall, our results are consistent with the idea that electronic payments increase the share of economic activity on which taxes are paid. This could reflect both higher compliance at the firm level and tax compliant firms that use electronic payments gaining market shares because of consumers’ reluctance to use cash.This paper’s main contribution relates to the role of technology in improving state capacity in the developing world. Recent work shows that the use of new electronic technologies can substantially improve the delivery of public services (Muralidharan et al., 2016,Muralidharan et al., 2020,Dodge et al., 2021), the quality of procurement (Lewis-Faupel et al., 2016) or tax revenues (Bellon et al., 2019,Fan et al., 2020,Ali et al., 2021,Okunogbe and Santoro, 2022). Research on taxation has emphasized the importance of third-party reporting in particular (Kleven et al., 2011);Pomeranz (2015)andNaritomi (2018)show that third-party reported transactions can increase tax compliance.Kleven et al. (2016)andJensen (2019)argue more generally that structural change over the course of development increases the use of third-party reporting, which in turn increases governments’ capacity to tax. The evidence presented in this paper suggests the rapid spread of new payment technologies, another form of structural change, could boost tax capacity in the developing world. As such, this paper also speaks to the wider literature on the determinants of tax compliance in developing countries.1The literature on the role of electronic payments specifically in improving tax compliance is scarce and mostly restricted to cross-country correlations (Awasthi and Engelschalk, 2018) or rich countries (Slemrod et al., 2017,Adhikari et al., 2021). In the developing world,Brockmeyer and Saenz Somarriba (2021)find no effects on tax payments of a Uruguayan reform incentivizing the use of bank cards, whilstBachas et al. (2020)find that Mexico’s tax on cash failed to increase the use of electronic payments. The policy experiment we study in contrast led to a large shift towards digital payments.2Overall, our results provide tentative good news for the many developing countries that incentivize the use of electronic payments in the hope that these policies will ‘pay for themselves’ via compliance effects (seeBrockmeyer and Saenz Somarriba, 2021), for a review of these policies.This paper’s second contribution lies in its study of the effect of India’s radical demonetization policy on tax compliance. The idea that demonetization would increase compliance was often put forward by government figures (Lahiri, 2020). Our paper is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to test this claim using data on firm-level tax payments and a credible source of policy variation. Of course, the results should be interpreted in the context of demonetization’s well-documented negative impact on the economy as a whole (Banerjee and Kala, 2017,Chodorow-Reich et al., 2019,Karmakar and Narayanan, 2020), as well as its failure to achieve its main aim — the eradication of proceeds from the black economy. While our results suggest demonetization may have had positive effects ontax collection, the economic cost of the policy should be kept in mind while assessing its overall effect.",Satadru,Lucie,Tushar,Ross,None,Journal of Public Economics,"Volume 224, August 2023, 104907",0
"1. IntroductionThe relationship betweenwealthand support for redistribution is a classic topic in the social sciences (Marx, 1859,Lipset, 1960,Downs, 1957). The correlation is generally negative (Alesina and Giuliano, 2011), but causal evidence remains scarce. This is not due to a lack of interest, which is evident from its prominence in theoretical models (Romer, 1975,Meltzer and Richard, 1981), but rather to the difficulty of finding plausibly exogenous variation in wealth. The nature of this relationship is increasingly relevant for low- and middle-income countries today. As these economies grow, and their citizens and political elites become wealthier, the potential impact on demand for redistribution may have an important bearing on the development of nascent welfare states.From a classical economic viewpoint, individual support for redistribution reflects economic self-interest. According to this“pocketbook”perspective, better-off people should oppose redistribution, because they are more likely to have to pay for it. In reality, however, support for redistribution is also driven byinequalityaversion and fairness considerations that may run counter to self-interest (Cappelen et al., 2007). Indeed, the respondents in our context voice overwhelming aversion to inequality, believe that inequality in Ethiopia is unfair, and support redistribution.1Moreover, people generally consider economic differences to be fairer and, hence, more acceptable, if they are the result of effort rather than luck or personal connections (Alesina and Giuliano, 2011,Alesina and Glaeser, 2004,Alesina and Angeletos, 2005,Alesina et al., 2018,Fong, 2001,Almås et al., 2020). Support for redistribution may, therefore, depend not only on self-interest and fairness considerations, but also on beliefs about the sources of inequality.We provide evidence on the causal effects of material conditions on support for redistribution by studying winners and losers of an Ethiopian housing lottery. The lottery randomly allocates the right to purchase an apartment at a highly subsidized price, and winners experience a substantial increase in wealth. In contrast to other sources of variation in wealth,windfallsshould notdirectlyaffect fundamental attitudes towards inequality.2On the other hand, winners should reduce their support for redistribution out of self-interest.Our main finding is that winning the lottery does not affect fundamental attitudes towards redistribution or inequality acceptance, suggesting that such attitudes are rooted in deep and stable values. Winners are, however, less supportive of a specific redistributive policy that would affect them directly; namely a realestate tax. This is consistent with the pocketbook-perspective. We also find evidence of endogenous beliefs. In particular, we show that lottery winners are less likely than losers to attributepovertyto (bad) luck, even though the difference in economic resources between the two groups is entirely due to chance. This indicates that people may be subject to aself-serving bias(Zuckerman, 1979,Mezulis et al., 2004).3To enhance the credibility of our findings, we replicate them using survey data from an earlier round of the lottery collected byFranklin (2019), which included similar questions. These data support the overall conclusion that general attitudes towards redistribution and inequality acceptance are unaffected by winning the lottery, and again we find that winners are less likely to believe that luck is important for economic success.The fact that the observed changes in beliefs do not translate into a decreased support for redistribution might seem surprising. At least, that is what we would expect to see if preferences for redistribution were driven by meritocratic fairness views. While one could think of several potential explanations for this finding —including motivated reasoning or simply that changes in attitudes take longer to materialize than changes in beliefs— a more plausible explanation may be that the lottery participants we study simply do not hold such meritocratic views. Indeed, new global evidence suggest that people in non-Western countries (including Ethiopia) are not as meritocratic as people in richer countries (Almås et al., 2022). Hence, even though lottery winners are less likely to think that success is due to luck, we would not necessarily expect this belief to strongly influence inequality acceptance or support for redistribution in the context that we study.Our findings contribute to the scarce literature on the causal effects of wealth and income on support for redistribution. To our knowledge, only two previous studies have investigated the effects of lottery-induced wealth on political attitudes or outcomes.Powdthavee and Oswald (2014)use self-reported data from the British Household Panel Survey to compare lottery winners before and after they win. They find that winners of larger amounts are less likely to vote for parties that favor redistribution.Doherty et al. (2006)exploit the variation in prizes among lottery winners in the US to show that winners of larger amounts are more hostile to estate taxes. They find no effects on support for redistribution, views on inequality, nor on the desire to expand the social safety net; however, the absence of such effects is unclear, because the small sample size (342 winners) does not permit the authors to reject either large or null effects.Our study overcomes a key limitation of the previous lottery studies. They compare winners from different lotteries and lack information about how much people played before winning. It is, therefore, unclear if the winners of different amounts are drawn from the same distribution. By contrast, we compare randomly drawn winners and losers from the same lottery. Furthermore, given that roughly half of the city’s population signed up for the lottery we study, the participants are probably more representative of the general population than is the case for most prize-lotteries. Finally, our investigation includes a wider set of outcomes on inequality acceptance, beliefs and support for redistribution, allowing us to investigate different aspects of the income-attitudes nexus.Despite housings’ large share of the total stock of wealth in most countries (Piketty and Zucman, 2014), there is even less work on the effect of this particular type of wealth. Using longitudinal data from the USA and the UK, as well as cross sectional data from 29 countries,Ansell (2014)shows that house ownership and higher housing prices are related to lower demand for redistribution.4We also contribute to a literature documenting that beliefs may adjust endogenously to material conditions. This includes the study ofDi Tella et al. (2007), who show that assignment of property rights to squatters increases pro-market beliefs, as well as recent evidence from the laboratory (Deffains et al., 2016,Durante et al., 2014,Molina et al., 2019). Our findings are also consistent with new evidence from a large-scale study implemented with a representative sample from the United States, showing that economic success has a causal effect on beliefs (Fehr and Vollmann, 2021). Motivated beliefs serve both psychological and functional needs (Bénabou and Tirole, 2016,Bénabou, 2015). In our case, winners may adjust beliefs to avoid identity conflicts or preserve internal consistency, and selective recall may make them understate the role of luck.Finally, our paper contributes to a broader literature on the endogeneity of policy preferences and determinants of support for redistribution.5Importantly, the literature on support for redistribution and belief formation is so far based almost exclusively on samples from high-income, Western countries. It is, however, critical to provide evidence from low-income but fast-growing countries such as Ethiopia. Indeed, fast changes ineconomic conditionsand income mobility in such countries could lead to significant transformations in the traditional support for public redistribution.",Asbjørn,Simon,Tigabu,Andreas,Vincent,Journal of Public Economics,"Volume 224, August 2023, 104939",0
"1. IntroductionWhen state and local governments use business incentives to compete for firms, the political payoffs of winning, such as higher reelection chances, are privately derived by the elected officials of the winning jurisdictions. On the other hand, the economic payoffs of winning, such as new job opportunities, can spill over to the residents of the neighboring, non-winning jurisdictions.The presence of economic spillovers would, in theory, lead governments to lower the incentive offers to freeride on the wins of nearby jurisdictions. On the other hand, the presence of political payoffs would work in the opposite direction, escalating the bidding competition as governments try to derive private returns to winning.This paper analyzes how potential political payoffs shape government competition for firms using a simple model of government competition and firm location choice. Understanding the role of political payoffs can be important for evaluating the efficacy of business incentives. For example, if a large share of the total payoff of attracting firms is privately derived by politicians, residents would find that the incentives are suboptimally large in terms of maximizing their economic payoffs. To that end, I propose an empirical approach of deriving lower bounds on the political payoffs, based on the model insight that the incentives are driven more by political payoffs in the presence of larger economic spillovers, which cause jurisdictions to freeride. This approach is applied to the recent state competition between Kansas and Missouri for relocations of existing firms within the Kansas City metropolitan area.In the model, governments compete for firms with unobserved profit heterogeneity in a setup similar to a first-price scoring auction. The economic and political payoffs of winning firms are distinguished and assumed to be comonotonic. Governments derive economic spillovers when other governments in the same metro area win, but the political payoffs are derived only by the winning governments. Governments offer incentives that maximize the expected payoffs, and firms then choose locations that maximize profits, which depend on both the incentive offers and unobserved profitability. If governments in a metro area coordinate on incentive provision, their joint welfare can improve through internalization of the competitive externalities or the economic spillovers, the relative importance of which depends on the substitutability of the locations for firms.I use the model to propose a way of deriving lower bounds on political payoffs with accepted incentives data. The first-order condition for optimal incentive shows that as the economic spillovers increase, political payoffs explain a larger share of a location’s total payoff from winning.For intuition, consider a simple example of Kansas competing to relocate a firm from Missouri. Suppose the firm is only choosing between the two states. The firm generates total economic payoffs ofvfor the two locations and(1-γ)vis derived by the winning location. In this case, for a given bid and profit differential between Kansas and Missouri, I can infer different values of Kansas’s political payoffs depending onγ, which governs how much ofvspills over to the losing location:1.γ=0.5. Winning and losing deliver the same economic payoffs. There is no reason to bid except due to political payoffs. Kansas’s political payoff equals its total payoff from winning.2.γ=0.4. Winning delivers0.2vmore economic payoff than losing. The economic payoff component of Kansas’s total payoff from winning is thus0.2v. Kansas’s political payoff equals0.2vless than its total payoff from winning.3.γ=0. Only the winning location derives both economic and political payoffs. The economic payoff component of Kansas’s total payoff from winning is thus the entirev. Kansas’s political payoff equalsvless than the total payoff from winning.This example illustrates that a location freerides more when the spillover is larger (higherγ) in which case the political payoff explains a larger share of the location’s total payoff from winning. This idea is summarized in the first-order condition:Economicpayofffromwinning⏟1-γv+Politicalpayofffromwinning=Bid+Strategicmarkdown+Freeridingmarkdown⏟γv.I apply the empirical approach to the setting of Kansas City, where the states of Kansas and Missouri recently competed intensely to relocate existing firms within the metro area. I use Hall Family Foundation’s data on incentives accepted by firms that relocated across the state border in Kansas City during 2009–2019.For implementation, I take the following steps to quantify the three parameters on the right-hand side of the first-order condition shown above. First, I approximate the economic spillover (γ1-γin the example) with commuting flow data. The intuition is that Kansas would derive large spillovers from Missouri’s win if many Kansas residents are observed to commute to Missouri. Second, I quantify the strategic markdown by calibrating firms’ default profits with data on maximum accepted incentives and the share of relocating firms. The intuition is that the profitability in Kansas would be low if Missouri is observed to have relocated many firms by paying relatively low incentives. Third, I estimate the equilibrium bid distribution by maximizing the likelihood of observing the accepted incentives. The covariation in accepted incentives and jobs is informative of how rapidly incentives increase in jobs.With these model parameters, I take the difference between Kansas and Missouri’s total payoffs from winning, assuming that the two states’ economic payoff quantiles are proportional. This approach obviates the need to quantify economic payoffs. For example, if Kansas and Missouri have identical economic payoffs, the difference between their total payoffs would reveal the difference in their political payoffs.Results show that at least 10% of Kansas and Missouri’s median payoff from winning was political when each jurisdiction relocated a typical firm that is observed to have moved to that jurisdiction. These results imply that the equilibrium relocation incentives of both locations were substantially driven by the private gains of politicians. Both states’ sizable political payoffs implied by the lower bounds likely reflect the political landscape in the region during the sample period, when Kansas implemented the “Kansas Experiment,” consisting of aggressive tax cuts andeconomic development policies, which escalated the border war between the two states.This paper’s model can be used to study the importance of political payoffs in other settings of inter-jurisdictional competition. The empirical strategy would be applicable in regions where jurisdictions that firms find substitutable compete in the presence of economic spillovers.There are two main caveats to the empirical approach based on this paper’s stylized model. First is the possible upward bias in my approximation of the economic spillover. Tax revenues generated from new firms would not spill over, and in the long run, residents may also move to optimize their commutes. Second, the local incentives are not considered in the analysis. The different generosity of the local incentive provision between the two jurisdictions can further shift the lower bounds on political payoffs. A richer model that endogenizes economic spillovers and the interaction between state and local governments is needed to address these limitations.Related literatureThis paper contributes to the literature studying the effects of government policies and firm entry on local welfare (e.g.,Neumark and Kolko, 2010,Kline and Moretti, 2014,Billings, 2009,Moretti and Wilson, 2017, andPatrick (2016)) by theoretically studying the welfare impacts of governments bidding for firms in presence of local economic spillovers and political payoffs from winning firms. The auction framework used to study these welfare consequences is similar to the approaches taken byMast, 2020,Slattery, 2020, andKim (2020). These earlier studies estimate the payoffs of winning firms without distinguishing the economic and political payoffs. In contrast, this paper offers a way of deriving the lower bounds on political payoffs using available data on accepted incentives and the equilibrium relationships between the latent payoffs and the incentive offers.This paper is related to the broader public economics literature studying fiscal competition in the presence of externalities.1Case et al. (1993)find positive interdependence in state expenditures among states that are similarly situated in various observable dimensions, implying the existence of competitive externalities ingovernment expenditures.Besley and Case (1992)present a model of yardstick competition in which voters judge incumbent politicians by comparing policies proposed by the incumbent politicians of different jurisdictions. They provide empirical evidence of tax policies being strategic complements, again suggesting the existence of competitive externalities when jurisdictions settaxes. More recently,Agrawal et al. (2020a)find that the tax competition is less fierce among French municipalities that voluntarily agree tofinancejoint projects, suggesting that the municipalities internalize competitive externalities when entering inter-municipal cooperation with shared policy goals. My paper complements this line of literature by incorporating two types of externalities in an increasingly important context of governments bidding for individual firms: competitive externalities and positive economic spillovers such as shared job opportunities. These two types of externalities exert opposing effects on the potential gains from inter-jurisdictional coordination in my model. Specifically, the gains from internalizing economic spillovers are achieved when jurisdictions jointly raise incentive offers to address the freeriding problem. On the other hand, the gains from internalizing competitive externalities are achieved when jurisdictions jointly lower incentive offers and collectively pay less for the wins.This paper is also related to the literature studying the importance of political factors in shaping government policies.Besley and Case (1995)find that taxes and government expenditure respond to whether a governor’s term limit is binding. Similarly,Slattery, 2020,Slattery and Zidar, 2020, andSlattery (2022)find that incentive spending is highly correlated with whether the incumbent governor can run for reelection and whether it is an election year.Jensen et al. (2014)provide evidence using internet surveys that politicians benefit from offering tax incentives by taking credit for investment inflows, andJensen et al. (2015)provide empirical evidence that elected mayors provide larger incentives and enjoy more lax oversight of incentive projects than non-elected city managers. By allowing separate political and economic payoffs to impact the business incentive decisions, I build on the findings from these earlier studies, which show that political factors play an important role in determining government policies. Political science literature on retrospective voting on economic outcomes (e.g., summaries byHealy and Malhotra (2013)andAshworth (2012)) also shows that voters use key economic outcomes such as job numbers to assess incumbent politicians. This would suggest that the private gains derived by politicians and economic gains derived by voters are positively correlated, which motivates the assumed comonotonicity between the economic and political payoffs in this paper.This paper’s empirical focus on the local competition between Kansas and Missouri for firm relocation within Kansas City is related to prior studies that provide empirical evidence of the importance of government competition in local settings. For example,Stokan and Deslatte (2019)find that incentive usage is increasing in the proliferation of local governments. Similarly,Mast (2020)finds that the Industrial Development Agencies (IDA) in New York State increase firm-specific tax breaks when other IDAs are nearby, which would intensify the local competition for firms.",Donghyuk,None,None,None,None,Journal of Public Economics,"Volume 224, August 2023, 104941",0
"1. IntroductionFirms can reduce theirtaxburden in many ways, but international corporations have more opportunities to do so, being able to shift profits from high-tax countries to low-tax ones.1While these practices allow firms to significantly lower their effective tax rates, they erode the ability of high-tax jurisdictions to generate tax revenue. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimates that up to 10% of the globaltax baseescapes taxation due to profit shifting, whileWier et al. (2019)highlight that multinational corporations are able to avoid as much as 36% of their fiscal responsibility through this mechanism. For that reason, the OECD advocates strongly for policies and practices that limit firms’ ability to take advantage of international tax differences.Amultinational corporationthat wishes to shift profit from a high-tax country to a low-tax one can do so in various ways. One strategy is to reallocate debt to entities in high-tax countries, to benefit from the associated tax deductions.2This process leads to thinly capitalized firms. Many countries have introduced regulations limiting thin capitalization by using safe-haven debt-to-equity ratios, where tax deductions no longer apply when debt relative to equity reaches these ratios. The United Kingdom uses a strict ratio of 1:1, some countries such as France and the United States have adopted less restrictive ratios of 1.5:1, while others use even more permissive ratios. Between 1996 and 2009, the share of OECD countries imposing thin-capitalization rules increased from 45% to 70%. However, the average safe-haven debt-to-equity ratio remained fairly constant at around 3:1.3Alternatively, multinational corporations can exploit tax-rate differentials by altering internal transfer pricing. To combat such practices, some countries have adopted “arm’s length principles” so that transfer prices are in line with prices for similar transactions between independent parties.Lohse and Riedel (2013)classified countries by the strictness of those arm’s length principles by looking at documentation requirements. Here again, according to Lohse and Riedel’s index, some countries have adopted strict requirements, such as the United Kingdom, with a score of 4 on a scale between 0 and 5, while some others are less demanding, such as the United States, with a score of 3. The proportion of OECD countries that regulate transfer pricing increased by almost 20 percentage points between 1996 and 2009, but the average regulation strictness index increased by only about one-half.4This suggests that many countries are not doing as much as possible to control profit shifting. In light of this, we investigate why allowing some profit shifting to occur may be beneficial, even for profit-exporting countries.To analyze why some countries allow some profit shifting to occur, we set up a tax competition model with two countries and a parasitictax haven. In the model, heterogeneous multinational corporations settle their main production facilities in one of the two countries; they also operate a subsidiary in the tax haven to optimize tax planning. The firms are faced with country-specific costs, meaning that in the absence of tax differences, they have preferences over location decisions. In addition to location decisions, the corporations shift a share of their taxable income to the tax haven. Anti-profit-shifting controls and monitoring can make such activities either more or less costly. In our model, governments tax profits to maximize tax revenue. We also allow the governments to directly care about production facilities in their jurisdictions.5We solve for equilibrium tax rates and look at the impact on countries’ welfare of enforcing anti-profit-shifting controls.Our main aim is to derive conditions under which a government may prefer lenient profit-shifting controls. We identify four elements a government may consider when choosing the optimal level of enforcement. The first two elements are (i) the direct benefit of discouraging profit shifting and (ii) the cost of implementing controls. Stricter enforcement discourages profit-shifting activities by increasing the cost to corporations that violate regulations. If profit shifting is highly responsive to control, enforcement is desirable. By shifting profit, firms are able to lower their effective tax rate. (iii) Stricter enforcement inflates the domestic effective tax rate and makes investments in other countries more attractive. If investments are highly responsive to profit-shifting control, laxer enforcement may be desirable, particularly when there are significant non-fiscal benefits to attracting firms. (iv) Finally, controlling profit shifting influences how tax rates are determined. Thus, strict enforcement may not be desirable if it leads to lower tax rates. We call this the tax competition effect.Both the nominal tax rate and degree of profit-shifting control jointly determine the effective tax rate. For a given investment level, an increase in either instrument leads to higher tax revenue. Holding enforcement constant, a higher statutory tax rate raises revenue collected from a given tax base. Similarly, stricter enforcement reduces tax-base erosion and boosts tax-revenue collection. Because both instruments influence the effective tax rate, an increase in either the nominal tax rate or the degree of profit-shifting control discourages investments. The two instruments can be complementary in raising tax revenue. For example, a country that wants to raise fiscal revenue aggressively may increase the nominal tax rate and the degree of profit-shifting control at the same time. Alternatively, both instruments could be substitutes where stricter enforcement is associated with a lower tax rate or the inverse. This case is consistent withHaufler and Schjelderup (2000), where a government may want to set a low tax rate, but stricter depreciation allowances broaden the tax base.The first step of our analysis is to understand how countries set tax rates balancing the need for tax revenue and the desire to attract investments. As in most tax competition settings, equilibrium tax rates are determined by the elasticity of each country’s tax base. A country that has a more volatile tax base has a stronger incentive to set a lower tax rate. In our environment, the total tax base can be divided into two components: (i) the per-firm retained profit, accounting for profit-shifting activity, and (ii) the number of firms a country can attract. We show that stricter enforcement limits the responsiveness of profit shifting. Faced with more difficult and costly ways to shift profits, a firm is less inclined to exploit the “tax differential” between the domestic and the parasitic tax rate. Thus, the per-firm retained profits are less sensitive to the domestic tax rate and reward setting a higher tax rate. At the same time, stricter enforcement makes local investment more sensitive to the domestic tax rate. When firms can shift profit easily, tax differences between the two countries do not matter much because firms can lower their effective tax rate. With stronger enforcement, investments become more sensitive to taxes, so it can be worthwhile to set a low rate. Consequently, our model shows that the impact on equilibrium tax rates of controlling profit-shifting is ambiguous. On the one hand, investment is made more responsive to domestic tax rates (inducing a more aggressive tax competition), while on the other hand, the responsiveness of profit-shifting behavior to domestic taxes is decreased (inducing a less aggressive tax competition). Thus, our model abstracts from thegeneral equilibriumeffects of taxation on the remuneration of factors of production and other production inefficiencies induced by taxation. Our model also ignores the direct impact of profit-shifting controls on firms’ gross profits as identified byDe Simone et al. (2022).We characterize both of our main results in terms of four observable semi-elasticities. The desirability of stricter profit-shifting controls depends positively on the responsiveness of retained profits to changes in enforcement, but depends negatively on the responsiveness of investments to a similar variation. Taxes are high when investments and retained profits are not as responsive to rates. Finally, foreign tax rates are lower when enforcement makes investments much more sensitive to the domestic tax rate and makes retained profits less sensitive to the same variable. We collect estimates for all of these variables and show that the conditions needed for the desirability of lax profit-shifting controls can be satisfied for reasonable parameters.We also conduct simulations with two objectives in mind. First, we demonstrate that our model can generate equilibria with lax enforcement for reasonable parameter values. Second, we explore the impact of asymmetry between countries competing for capital. In equilibrium, larger countries have a comparative advantage in attracting capital. It is well known in the tax competition literature that larger countries set a higher tax rate because they have a less elastic tax base. Their comparative advantage creates something similar to market power, and thus larger countries also implement stricter profit-shifting enforcement. The same intuition applies because stronger enforcement is a way to collect additional tax revenue by increasing the effective tax rates. This is consistent with observations byBuettner et al. (2018).Other authors have looked at similar questions from different angles.Haufler and Schjelderup, 2000,Slemrod and Wilson, 2009, andWeichenrieder and Xu (2019)take a negative view of both profit shifting and tax havens: In addition to tax-base erosion, the first paper suggests that profit shifting distorts the optimal tax system, the second considers the detrimental effects of enforcement and concealment, and the last one discusses problems associated with round-tripping investments. Other authors, like us, highlight potential benefits associated with profit shifting.Haufler and Schjelderup, 2000,Mintz and Smart, 2004, andDesai et al. (2006)point out that lower effective tax rates stimulate investments.Peralta et al., 2006,Bucovetsky and Haufler, 2008, andHong and Smart (2010)indicate that profit shifting allows governments to fiscally discriminate between international firms and local firms that are unable to shift profits.6Johannesen, 2010,Becker and Fuest, 2012, andStoewhase (2013)argue that profit shifting may incite countries to set higher nominal tax rates. Our goal is to paint a broad picture of the problem and fill some gaps in our understanding of the forces at play.Profit shifting influences the tax proceeds of jurisdictions through three different channels. The most obvious one is tax-base erosion because firms send profits to be taxed abroad instead of locally. This channel is considered in all of the papers mentioned above and unambiguously reduces the welfare of high-tax countries. The second channel is the capital allocation or investment channel. Here, because shifting profits abroad enables firms to lower their effective tax rates, high-tax jurisdictions become a more desirable location choice, making it easier for high-tax countries to attract capital and firms. Many of the papers above also consider this positive effect. The last, and least obvious, channel is the strategic tax-setting effect, whereby the tax competition game is altered by profit-shifting activities, and equilibrium tax rates may increase or decrease.We set out to develop a model that considers all three channels simultaneously and where tax rates are determined endogenously and chosen to maximize the tax levy and spillover benefits. We thus depart from the existing literature.Becker and Fuest (2012)abstract from physicalcapital mobility, inMintz and Smart (2004)tax rates are exogenous,Slemrod and Wilson (2009)andJohannesen (2010)treat profit-shifting controls as exogenous, andHong and Smart (2010)include redistributive arguments. Our results are built on observable elasticities of both capital movement and tax-base erosion. Contrary toPeralta et al., 2006,Johannesen, 2010, andStoewhase (2013), we account for multiple heterogeneous international firms. We also ignore the merits of discrimination as proposed inPeralta et al., 2006,Bucovetsky and Haufler, 2008, andHong and Smart (2010), by assuming that all firms are international. In our model, the desirability of laxer enforcement arises from the enhanced ability to attract firms and the associated increase in the foreign tax rate. Adding domestic firms would allow for a lower effective tax rate on international firms while maintaining a higher rate for domestic ones.In Section 2, we present our theoretical model and derive our main result. We first characterize firms’ location and profit-shifting decisions for a given menu of taxes and regulatory enforcement policies. We then define governments’ fiscal policies, taking profit-shifting controls as given. Finally, we investigate under what condition it is desirable to employ less than full effort to control profit shifting. In Section 3, we present our simulations and validate our results using the estimates collected. In Section 4, we discuss our conclusions.

"1. IntroductionThe performance of the democratic process depends both on what information voters possess and on how they use it. There is a long-standing debate in the elections literature about voters’ competence to collect and process information (seeLupia et al. (1998)). Correspondingly, scholars have developed a variety of models to better understand how different types of political information affect voter behavior and electoral accountability (e.g.Ashworth and Shotts, 2010,Canes-Wrone et al., 2001,Demirkaya, 2019,Maskin and Tirole, 2004). However, nearly all such works assume that once information enters the public domain – whether it be via news media, public figures, or academic centers – it is “free” for voters to collect, interpret, and incorporate into their decisionmaking.In reality, however, voters must actuallychooseto spend some of their limited time and attention consuming and interpreting political information. In this paper we seek to understand how this “attention constraint” affects voter behavior and democratic performance. To do so we build directly on the electoral accountability model ofCanes-Wrone et al. (2001). In this model, a representative voter seeks to evaluate an incumbent’s degree ofexpertiseat identifying good policies (rather than his degree of preference alignment, as inMaskin and Tirole (2004)). This leads a career-concerned politician topanderby choosing the ex-ante “popular” policy (i.e., the policy favored by the prior) even when he privately believes it to be incorrect to try and signal that expertise (see alsoPrat (2005)). To this model we add an ability for the voter to learn about theconsequencesof the incumbent’s policy by paying costly attention after it is implemented. Thus, while our voter need not base her vote on the incumbent’s policy choice alone, she must expend costly effort if she wishes to base her vote on something more. (For expositional simplicity we henceforth continue to refer to the voter as “she” and the incumbent as “he.”).Our first key insight is that the disposition of a rational voter’s attention is not neutral; instead, it will depend on exactlywhichpolicy the incumbent chose in a particular way. The reason is that a rational voter is lookingforsomething when she chooses to pay attention; specifically, she is looking for information that would reverse her voting intention given the policy she observed. Thus, if her intention is toretainthe incumbent after observing his policy (because he is initially strong vis-a-vis the challenger), then she will only pay attention to findnegative informationthat would justify replacing him. Conversely, if her intention is toreplacethe incumbent after observing his policy (because he is initially weak vis-a-vis the challenger), then she will only pay attention to findpositive informationthat would justify retaining him. Thus, it is not necessarily a more or less popular policy that will elicit the most attention, but rather the policy the voter believes most likely to yield an outcome that would change her voting intention.Having established how and why a rational voter will pay different levels of attention to different policies, we next consider how this “asymmetric attention” affects incumbent behavior. In the baselineCanes-Wrone et al. (2001)model, the incumbent’s decisions are distorted by an incentive to pander by choosing the popular policy to signal expertise. When the voter can choose whether to pay attention, however, there may be an additional incentive that distorts the incumbent’s policy choice – to manipulate the voter’s attention. This effect is consistent with an empirical literature showing that incumbents take anticipated media attention into account when choosing policy (Durante and Zhuravskaya, 2018,Kaplan et al., 2019), and in principle could bias the incumbent both toward or away from a popular policy. For example, if the incumbent expects to be replaced absent additional information, but also thinks that the unpopular policy will draw more voter scrutiny, then he may choose it despite privately believing it is wrong to effectively “gamble for resurrection,” (Dewan and Hortala-Vallve, 2019), hoping that both his private beliefs are wrong and that the voter will learn of his (accidental) success.Canes-Wrone et al. (2001)term this sort of behavior “fake leadership,” and show that it can occur when the unpopular policy exogenously draws more scrutiny than the popular one.Our first result is that rational voter attention cannot induce an incumbent to pursue fake leadership – even though rational attention can be asymmetric, favor the unpopular policy, and distort the incumbent’s policy choice. This result is a consequence of how the incumbent’s standing vis-a-vis the challengersimultaneouslyinfluences both the incumbent’s willingness to subject himself to attention and the voter’s willingness to pay it. Specifically, a moderately strong incumbent will prefer to choose a policy thatdeflectsattention – understanding that only a known policy failure will get him replaced – while a moderately weak incumbent will prefer to choose a policy thatelicitsattention – understanding that only a known policy success will get him retained. At the same time, the voter is most willing to pay attention to theunpopularpolicy when the incumbent is moderately strong – because it is most likely to reveal a failure that would change her vote – and is most willing to pay attention to thepopularpolicy when the incumbent is moderately weak – because it is the most likely to reveal a success that would change her vote. Thus, when the incumbent has an incentive to avoid attention (because he is moderately strong) it is specifically pandering that will draw it, and when he has an incentive to seek attention (because he is moderately weak) it is again pandering that will deflect it. Consequently, rational attention can never bias the incumbent’s decision toward the unpopular policy.We next examine the voter’s equilibrium pattern of attention. We find that the voter is likeliest to pay attention when the incumbent and challenger begin evenly matched, and her attention decreases as the election becomes imbalanced in either direction. The reason is simple; attention is most valuable for improving selection when the voter is most uncertain about her optimal vote. We also find that the ex-ante unpopular policy generally elicits more voter attention than the popular one despite the fact that the popular policy is associated with pandering. The reason is that it is harder for the voter to “catch” a low-ability incumbent trying to pander than it is for her to “discover” a high-ability incumbent exercising leadership. The former is so incompetent that he might accidentally succeed when he merely intended to pander (thereby escaping detection), but the latter will always succeed when exercising leadership by virtue of his expertise. Our model thus provides a rational basis for why unpopular policies might effectively maximize voter engagement, in contrast to explanations based on voter emotions or cognitive biases (Healy and Malhotra, 2013).We last consider how voter attention affects pandering and voter welfare. We find that the voter’s ability to learn about outcomes via costly attention (weakly) benefits her when paying attention is either “cheap” or “very costly” – when it is cheap the voter will always pay attention (which perfectly aligns the incumbent’s incentives), and when it is very costly she never will (leaving the incumbent’s incentives unchanged). However, when the cost of paying attention isintermediatethe voter will only sometimes do so, which can exacerbate or induce pandering; either by incentivizing a moderately strong incumbent to pander to avoid the attention that the unpopular policy brings, or a moderately weak incumbent to pander to seek the attention that the popular policy brings. Under these circumstances the voter’s ability to learn about policy consequences by paying costly attention will harm accountability, and may also harm voter welfare. An interesting implication is that seemingly benign interventions to improve either the availability or accuracy of policy information might nevertheless harm voters, if they also exacerbate the voters’ propensity to pay different levels of attention to different policies. This result contrasts starkly with a large theoretical and empirical literature arguing that greater availability of political information will improve incumbent behavior (seeAshworth (2012)for a review).",Saba,Alexander,None,None,None,Journal of Public Economics,"Volume 224, August 2023, 104918",0
"1. IntroductionEnrollment in higher education has traditionally been analyzed through the lens of human capital models, where attending college is considered an investment opportunity. However, the value students place on different aspects of the college experience likely constitutes a key factor underlying post-secondary education decisions. A growing body of evidence suggests that these valuations are not solely based on expected financial returns (Gullason, 1989,Alstadsaeter, 2011,Wiswall and Zafar, 2015,Boneva and Rauh, 2019,Arcidiacono et al., 2020). In fact, the number of applications that universities receive changes based on the performance of their sports teams (Pope and Pope, 2009) and reputation fluctuations (Alter and Reback, 2014).However, the precise value students allocate to the various components of their college experience is largely unknown. The goals of this study are twofold. First, we aim to rigorously recover students’ willingness-to-pay (WTP) for college-related activities – specifically, the value that students assign to in-person classes (versus remote instruction) and social activities while in college. Second, we aim to characterize the heterogeneity in the WTP based on students’ demographic characteristics and to uncover plausible mechanisms that can explain why some groups drop out from higher education at higher rates.For this purpose, we leveraged variation in educational experiences generated by the COVID-19 shock and surveyed approximately 1,500 undergraduate students at Arizona State University (ASU), one of the largest public universities in the United States, in late April 2020. The survey included a module to understand how students’ intended enrollment decisions for the Fall 2020 semester would vary across the different possible states of the world. Specifically, students who were not planning to graduate or transfer after the spring 2020 semester were presented with six different scenarios for the fall, which varied class format (i.e., in-person vs. remote instruction), restrictions to campus social life, and prevalence of COVID-19. These scenarios were intended to mimic the possible states of the world in which students may find themselves in the fall of 2020. They were then asked for the likelihood of continuing their enrollment in each of those cases,1under varying education costs (which were anchored to the student’s individual annual net costs). COVID-19 made the hypothetical scenarios relevant and realistic. These data allow us to estimate a simple model of expected utility of enrollment, providing a framework to recover quantitative measures of WTP. Given the structure of the hypothetical scenarios, we are able to estimate the value that students assign to in-person classes and social activities while in college, in theabsenceof the pandemic. We focus on these amenities in particular because they can only be consumed while a student is actively enrolled in university, and thus may capture a relevant proportion of the consumption value of a “college experience”.We first show that there is substantial variation in responses, both across individuals and across scenarios. For example, the average intended likelihood of enrolling in higher education in the “normal” state of the world that mimics the pre-COVID case (in-person instruction, ongoing social activities on campus, and no COVID-19) is 89.7%. In the state of the world with no in-person instruction, no social activities on campus, and ongoing COVID-19 – the scenario that most resembles the state realized at ASU in fall 2021 – the average intended likelihood of enrolling was 80%. The likelihood of enrolling in the COVID state is lower than the reported likelihood of enrolling in the normal state for 44.7% of the students, and identical for 45.4% of the students. The heterogeneity in responses also varies systematically by the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the students.We next outline a simple model of college attendance that links student’s utility to enrollment probabilities, where their utility can depend on certain amenities in school (in-person instruction and campus life), on whether the pandemic is ongoing or not, and the cost of attendance. We show how the variation in responses across scenarios, combined with variation in college costs that we experimentally manipulate within each scenario, can be used to quantify the WTP for in-person instruction and social activities in dollar terms. We start with aggregate-level estimates, pooling all the data across respondents for estimation. Our results indicate that the WTP for in-person instruction (relative to a remote format) in a world without COVID-19 represents around 4.2% of the average net cost of attending ASU (i.e., cost net of scholarships/grants), while the WTP for on-campus social activities is 8.1% of the average costs. The WTP for in-person instruction appears relatively small, which suggests that many students perceive remote classes as a reasonablygood substitutefor in-person classes. On the other hand, on-campus social activities appear more difficult to replace. Consistent with this, we find that students who do not think that online classes were a good substitute for in-person instruction have a significantly higher average WTP for in-person instruction.The rich individual-level data we collect is conceptually similar to panel data where one would observe a given respondent making choices in different states of the world. This allows us to estimate the model at the individual level, and explore the heterogeneity in preferences across students in a flexible and unrestricted way (seeWiswall and Zafar, 2018for related discussion). As we show, this also allows us to relax some of the identification assumptions that are implicit in the pooled estimation. The average WTP measures, that is, the individual-level WTP estimates averaged across individuals, are similar to those from the pooled estimation: an average WTP of 6.5% (of average annual net costs) for in-person instruction, and 10.2% for social activities. However, we find large heterogeneity in WTP across students, even after adjusting for estimation uncertainty using a standard Bayesian shrinkage procedure. For example, the 10th (90th) percentile of the individual-specific estimated WTP for in-person classes relative to remote learning is -$1,309 ($2,385) per year. This heterogeneity also varies systematically by student characteristics. For example, first-generation students’ average WTP for in-person classes is only $662 per year, while second-generation students (that is, students with at least one college-educated parent) have an average WTP of $956. To provide a benchmark to these dollar amounts, the average net cost of attending ASU in our sample is $12,948 per year, which is quite similar to the average net cost of $14,081 reported by ASU for the year 2018/2019 (NCES College Navigator). First-generation students also appear less willing to pay for campus social activities (on average, $921 per year versus $1,558 for second-generation).2Similar patterns emerge across other socioeconomic divides; for example, lower-income students are less willing to pay for in-person instruction and social activities.In order to investigate the mechanisms underpinning the observed heterogeneity in the WTP, we project student-specific estimates of WTP onto a rich set of student characteristics. We find that observable characteristics are able to explain a non-trivial part of the gap in WTP for social activities for first-generation and lower-income students. One factor that explains much of the variation across socioeconomic groups is whether the student works while attending university. We find that students who work more than 20 h per week (who tend to be disproportionately lower-income, non–Honors, and first-generation) derive substantially lower value from campus activities. This suggests that time constraints may play an important role in the utility students derive from campus social life. Even though we are unable to uncover the exact channels which drive this correlation, our analysis suggests that socioeconomic differences in students’ WTP for campus social life are driven at least partly by constraints.On the other hand, the gap in lower-income students’ WTP for in-person instruction remains remarkably robust to the same set of controls, suggesting that other unobservable factors explain their differential valuation for in-person instruction. We do, however, find other sensible correlates of the heterogeneity in the WTP for in-person instruction. For example, we find large correlations between the WTP for in-person instruction and qualitative opinions about the onlinelearning experience. However, none of these factors can explain the large gap by socioeconomic status (SES) in WTP for in-person instruction. Ultimately, we are unable to definitively determine if SES gaps in WTP for in-person instruction are driven by (observed and unobserved) constraints, perceptions of the human capital production function, or tastes, a policy-relevant distinction worthy of future investigation.Like this paper,Gong et al. (2021)also provides a quantitative measure of the consumption value of college. Their approach, however, is quite different from ours and uses data on consumption during and after college and desired borrowing amounts from Berea College students. While their empirical strategy, which is based on the Euler equation for consumption, provides an overall measure of consumption value of college (relative to not enrolling in college), we provide a valuation of two specific, and well-defined, amenities consumed while attending college (in-class instruction, and on-campus social activities). Likewise,Jacob et al. (2018)estimate a model of college demand that exploits variation in attributes and enrollment within universities across cohorts. Using an approach quite different from ours (and one that entails a different set of assumptions), they find that students’ demand is responsive to spending on amenities. One major advantage of our approach is that it allows us to characterize the heterogeneity in the WTP measures (a key concern for policymakers) with a unique degree of flexibility and by leveraging a unique shock.3Methodologically, our paper is related to a small but growing literature that uses strategically-designed survey questions in conjunction with structural models to understand decision-making (for example,Delavande and Zafar, 2019,Ameriks et al., 2020,Fuster et al., 2020). Our approach hinges on the implicit assumption that stated choices reported in hypothetical scenarios are reflective of what respondents would do in actual scenarios. Historically, there has been concern about the plausibility of this assumption, but growing evidence shows that the two approaches of using stated choices or actual choices yield similar estimates when the counterfactual scenarios presented to respondents are realistic and relevant (see the discussion in Section 5.2 ofFuster and Zafar (2022)regarding the plausibility of this methodology). We argue that is the case here; we elicit likelihood of college enrollment in a context where many university-related activities had been disrupted due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Scenarios that would have otherwise been unfathomable prior to early 2020 (such as a state of the world with universities conducting remote teaching and halting campus activities) became realities for students. Moreover, at the time of the survey, students were actively thinking about these possibilities.While the assumption underlying our approach – that stated choices in counterfactual scenarios are a reasonable proxy for actual behavior in such cases – is not directly testable, we present several pieces of evidence which should further increase confidence in our empirical strategy. First, the heterogeneity in WTPs that we uncover is meaningful and systematic. For example, we find that the estimated individual-level WTP for social activities is positively correlated with the pre-COVID-19 social engagement of students, as one would expect if our approach uncovered meaningful heterogeneity in preferences. This test is similar in spirit to that conducted byMaestas et al. (2018), who show that their estimated WTPs for working conditions using hypothetical scenarios are positively correlated with the actual working conditions of the respondents. Second, we find that the students’ intended likelihood of enrolling at ASU in the fall (for the state of the world that most closely resembles the one that was realized) is positively correlated with their subsequentactualenrollment decisions that we observe in the administrative data. We find, for example, that students with a high WTP for in-person instruction (i.e., those in the top tercile) are approximately 3 pp percentage points less likely to end up enrolling in the fall than those students with low WTPs (i.e., those in the bottom tercile) for in-person instruction.4While our setup allows us to estimate the WTP for these amenities in a world without COVID-19, a concern could be that the way students respond to the scenarios may be impacted by their experiences during the pandemic. While this may make our findings somewhat context-specific, this concern is shared with virtually all studies in applied work that rely on variation generated by specific events (e.g.instrumental variablesonly identify local average treatment effects). Thus, we believe our estimates are relevant (at least) for the cohorts of college and pre-college students that have been impacted by the pandemic. Given that we hardly have any quantitative estimates for the value that college students assign to different college experiences, we believe our results are useful and informative. At the same time, we acknowledge certain limitations. For example, it could be that students view the interruption of these activities as temporary, and that their WTP for in-person instruction and/or social life for a disruption of a semester or two is quite different from their WTP if those conditions were to last for four years. Similarly, students are not allowed to transfer to a different institution in our setup and hence are locked-in at a specific university.Overall, our empirical strategy provides helpful guidance on how to structureeducation policyin the short to the medium term. We believe that our analysis has the potential to critically contribute to the important ongoing policy debate on the cost of higher education in the U.S., and provide valuable information to administrators on how to structure university fees and services in order to promote campus diversity. Our results clearly indicate that some aspects of the college experience – in-person instruction and campus life – are valued differently by students, and therefore, university attendance should not be treated as a homogeneous good.This paper is structured as follows.

"1. IntroductionAcross settings — such as education, security, waste disposal, and primary healthcare — congested and inefficient public provision often coexists with private market low-cost alternatives.1In many developing countries, public provision of healthcare is inefficient (Das et al., 2016,Dizon-Ross et al., 2017), with congestion at facilities decreasing access (Dupas and Miguel, 2017,Ashraf et al., 2014,Christensen et al., 2021).2Although private care may be less congested, it is expensive, usually paid out-of-pocket, and may not even be higher quality (Leive and Xu, 2008,Das and Hammer, 2014). Expansions in private-market healthcare delivery, usually in the form of low-cost, limited-service providers – for example, retail clinics and mobile clinics – offer services that are cheaper than traditional private doctors and quicker than public clinics.3However, characterizing the interplay between these different providers is essential for understanding such markets and informing policy design.This paper analyzes how entry of a low-cost private provider affects public utilization and explores one channel on which quality may differ at the new facilities. I focus on the expansion of private pharmacy-adjacent doctors’ offices (PADOs) — essentially, retail clinics at private pharmacies — in Mexico.4Using the PADO registry from the Ministry of Health (SSA), I exploit 5,111 entries, mostly in urban areas, across Mexico from 2005 to 2015.Accessing anonymized patient records from a medium-sized PADO chain as a case study, I begin by documenting that over half of all PADO visits are for acute respiratory infections (ARIs). Thus, I focus the initial analysis on public healthcare utilization for ARIs. With data from public outpatient clinics, emergency rooms (ERs), and hospitals, I construct a balanced panel of ARI visits or hospital admissions at each facility during four-week periods. I then match each PADO entry to public facilities within 5 km and aggregate counts as a measure of public utilization in the local healthcare market around each PADO.I identify the effect of PADO entry on utilization through an event study design with time period and PADO fixed effects (FE), using the estimators inDe Chaisemartin and d’Haultfoeuille (2022)that are robust to heterogeneous average treatment effects (ATE). The main identifying assumption is that, absent PADO entry, utilization trends would have been similar across locations. I partially test this by inspecting the pre-entry coefficients.I estimate a significant decline in public clinic visits for ARIs of 1–2% after PADO entry, or an average of 13–29 fewer visits per week. For ER visits, I find a large decrease of 64% for ARI visits, or about 15 less per week.5Lastly, I do not find significant effects for ARI hospital admissions, though the point estimates suggest one fewer ARI hospitalization every 19 weeks. Overall, these estimates show that PADOs are pulling ARI patients away from public providers at the outpatient level.Supplementary analyses in the online appendix show that substitution is stronger in markets with more public clinics and with a higher baseline patient volume (i.e., potentially more congested). Moreover, PADOs are associated with a decline in waiting times and a slight increase in the time public clinic doctors spend with patients, consistent with PADOs leading to decongestion of these busy facilities. I find no significant associations between PADOs and ARI death rates nor between PADOs and physician labor supply.To understand potentialspillovers, I analyze other large diagnostic groups. For pneumonia, which acts as a proxy for severe ARIs, I find no significant effects for public clinic visits, although there is a significant impact of around 31% fewer ER visits. For gastrointestinal diseases (GIDs), I find no effects on clinic visits but a strong significant decline at ERs. Lastly, I estimate a small but significant increase in clinic visits for chronic conditions, coupled with weak evidence of a decline in ER visits, which may be due to better management of these diseases and is also consistent with decongestion effects at the public clinics.Altogether, results suggest that PADOs are pulling patients away from ERs for infectious diseases and from outpatient clinics for milder ARIs, which allows more patients with chronic conditions to visit the public clinics. Supplementary analyses show that the decline in ER visits is driven by non-urgent cases. This then seems to suggest that PADOs are welfare-improving for access. However, due to the vertical integration with private pharmacies, there may be additional costs. For instance, the pay structure for PADO doctors suggests strong financial incentives to overprescribe their patients (Díaz-Portillo et al., 2015).Hence, one potential cost may be related to changes in antibiotic prescriptions. For the case study, I document that doctors at this PADO chain prescribe antibiotics for over 60% of ARI visits, even after accounting for differences across physicians and over time, and even for patients diagnosed with the common cold, which is most likely caused by a virus. I also report that strong antibiotics are more likely to be prescribed than milder types, conditional on an ARI diagnosis and an antibiotic prescription. For context, less than 5% of common colds are caused by bacteria (see, for instance,Makela et al. (1998)). Furthermore, high prescription rates of antibiotics for ARIs is a common problem in other settings: for instance, 27% for Norway in 2003 (Gjelstad et al., 2009), 49% for the US in 2002 (Roumie et al., 2005), and a median of 54% for the UK in 2011 (Gulliford et al., 2014).To explore the potential consequences on prescribing behavior, I obtain proprietary penicillin sales data from a leading pharmaceutical consulting company. I construct a balanced panel of 183 penicillin products — both narrow and broad spectrum — across 563 municipalities on a monthly basis from 2010 to 2012. Broad spectrum penicillin is stronger, more expensive, and medical guidelines caution against overusing it as a first course of action due to the low probability of being medically necessary for common infections and due to the risk of fostering bacterial resistance (Leung et al., 2011).I then analyze the association between PADOs and penicillin sales under a continuous treatment difference-in-differences (DiD), with time, municipality, and product FE, but caution against making a strong causal interpretation due to the pitfalls of these types of designs (Callaway and Goodman-Bacon, 2021). Aninstrumental variables(IV) approach complements this analysis, which may provide some support for a causal claim.The main DiD specification shows that an additional PADO per 10,000 people is associated with a 12% decline in narrow spectrum sales and a 17% increase in broad spectrum sales.6This decline in narrow-type sales is concentrated among low-price products, while the increase in broad types is driven by high-price products. Since PADOs are unlikely to treat the more serious ARI cases, and to the extent that stronger penicillin is likely to be medically unnecessary, I interpret this shift toward stronger penicillin types as suggestive evidence that PADOs may sacrifice quality of care due to their direct ties to the pharmacy. However, data limitations — such as not being able to link sales with PADO doctor prescriptions and not observing sales of other types of antibiotics — invite further research.Overall, this study shows that PADOs may be improving access to healthcare by shuffling non-urgent patients away from congested public ERs, and away from public clinics for milder ARIs. However, there may be additional costs, such as a shift in prescriptions toward stronger antibiotics. Calculating the net effect on welfare is beyond the scope of this paper, although the findings do emphasize a trade-off between access and quality. Results suggest that better regulation of PADOs and possibly strategic partnerships between PADOs and the public sector may be welfare improving.This paper contributes primarily to the literature exploring healthcare delivery alternatives in developing countries, such as community workers (Björkman Nyqvist et al., 2019,Wagner et al., 2020) and informal providers (Sudhinaraset et al., 2013). However, while most studies focus on health outcomes, I analyze substitution away from public facilities. Given that public and private providers coexist and considering the vertical integration of PADOs with pharmacies, I am able to explore the trade-off between an increase in access to care and potentially negative effects on the quality of care offered at the retail clinics.",Adrian,None,None,None,None,Journal of Public Economics,"Volume 224, August 2023, 104938",0
"1. IntroductionEmployers and employees together spend nearly $1 trillion on Employer-Sponsored Health Insurance (ESI) premiums each year (National Health Expenditure Accounts, 2020). Most of these premiums are excluded from income andpayroll taxes, resulting in an annualtaxexpenditure of about $200 billion (Office of Tax Analysis, 2015). Growth in the cost of ESI has outstripped growth in wages, making health benefits an increasingly important percentage of employee compensation. At the same time, income inequality has been growing, and there is an active debate about the best ways to measure income using administrative tax data (Auten and Splinter, 2018,Piketty et al., 2018). Because, historically, not all employers or insurers have had to report nontaxable benefits to the IRS on information returns, the coverage and quality of information about health insurance costs have limited its usefulness.Most income studies impute health benefits from publicly available survey data, such as the Current Population Survey (CPS) or Medical Expenditure Panel Survey – Insurance Component (MEPS-IC) (Burkhauser et al., 2013,Kaestner and Lubotsky, 2016,Piketty et al., 2018). Recently, studies have started incorporating newly available premium information from administrative tax records to their measures of income (Auten and Splinter, 2018). We link individual-level ESI coverage to premium costs in administrative tax data to shed additional light on ESI premiums and their relationship to income.We build on recent work that uses administrative tax data to describe the distribution ofhealth insurance coverageamong the U.S. population (Lurie and Pearce, 2021). Rather than examine the source of coverage at the individual level, we first focus on policy-level information. Specifically, we link ESI premium costs from Code DD on Form W-2,Wage and Tax Statement, to information about the policy and policyholder from other tax forms to calculate an annualized premium that makes the cost of a plan comparable regardless of the fraction of the year the policy was held. Then, since our newly linked tax data reliably measures income for the population of ESI policyholders, we also provide several descriptions of the relationship between income and premium costs and how this impacts measures of inequality. We therefore use two different concepts for the cost of ESI: (1) the policy-level cost of insurance coverage, which we report as annualized premiums, and (2) the individual- or tax unit-level amount spent on health insurance during the year, or premiums paid.The only other study that explores the distribution of premiums in tax data primarily compares Code DD values with insurance costs in the CPS and briefly touches on the relationship between premiums and wages (Larrimore and Splinter, 2019). By using only information available on the W-2, they do not observe the number of months of coverage or people covered. They partially address this by using marital status to proxy for people covered, but they are unable to adjust for the number of covered months. In this paper, we unlock more of the potential of what we can learn about health insurance premiums in the tax data by linking to information from other tax forms. Our annualized premiums are more comparable to other health insurance policies. Linking additional tax records also allows us to identify policyholders whose employer does not report ESI premium costs on the W-2 so we can impute their premiums in our analysis of income inequality.We provide descriptions of ESI policies across policy types and policyholder characteristics such as age, gender, and geography. The overall premium distribution in the tax data is remarkably similar to that in the MEPS-IC. We also show that policyholders with higher incomes pay more in premiums, but their premiums are a smaller fraction of their income. Indeed, those with larger incomes receive a disproportionate amount of ESI spending because they buy more expensive policies on average and are more likely to be covered by ESI. Because higher income policyholders and their employers spend more on ESI and themarginal tax ratesthat determine the tax value of the exclusion are progressive, they also receive a disproportionate amount of government subsidies for health insurance. This holds even when we account for non-ESI subsidies through Medicare, Medicaid, and Premium Tax Credits.Even though the distribution of health subsidies is skewed toward those with higher incomes, it is less than a quarter as unequal as the distribution of income itself. Thus, a total income concept that includes health benefits will be less unequal than measures of income without them, as suggested in previous research (Burkhauser, Larrimore, and Simon, 2013.;Kaestner and Lubotsky, 2016).",Ithai,Corbin,None,None,None,Journal of Public Economics,"Volume 224, August 2023, 104942",0
"1. IntroductionUnemployment is one of the most severe risks that many people face. Even with unemployment benefits provided by the government, it is well documented that becoming unemployed forces people to make substantial and undesirable cuts in their consumption (e.g.,Gruber, 1997). Furthermore,Braxton et al. (2020)provide evidence that the unemployed resort to costly self-insurance by defaulting on their debt with the consequence of long-lasting detrimental effects on their credit score and financial liberty. In light of this, why isn’t there a thriving private unemployment insurance market in the US?.The profitability of insurance in existing markets is plagued by two types ofprivate informationfrictions: moral hazard and adverse selection. To study the existence of a profitable unemployment insurance market,Hendren (2017)extends the static binary loss adverse selection model originally proposed byRothschild and Stiglitz (1976)with moral hazard. He demonstrates that only adverse selection, and not moral hazard is relevant for market existence, echoing the classical result ofShavell (1979).1Eventually,Hendren (2017)argues quantitatively that the reason for the missing market is that unemployment insurance policies would be too adversely selected to be profitable.In the Rothschild and Stiglitz model, risk-averse agents have private advance information on their idiosyncratic endowment risk, which leads to an adverse selection problem. Conditional on this information, but before the endowment shock realizes, they decide whether to accept an insurance contract offered by a risk-neutral insurer or to merely consume their endowments inautarky. This decision occurs at a single instance, which is why we refer to it as a single-interaction model. This parsimonious framework abstracts, by construction, from long-run interactions between agents and the insurer. We show that allowing for long-run interactions matters for the existence of a profitable unemployment insurance market and offers new insights on overcoming the negative effects of adverse selection for market existence.To study the profitability of private unemployment insurance, we develop a dynamic version of the binary loss model. Private advance information arrives every period and is modeled as a private signal that informs agents about their subsequent endowment shock. After the signal realizes, agents decide in each period whether to sustain the insurance contract on offer. With repeated interactions – and this is the crucial difference to the single-interaction case – the insurer has the possibility to threaten agents with exclusion from future insurance in case they decide to reject the contract. Exclusion fundamentally alters agents’ incentives to participate in the insurance market. Not only the current but also the future benefits of insurance matter when agents decide whether to accept an insurance contract offered to them. As a consequence, their willingness to pay for insurance increases.The benefits of insurance in the dynamic economy are larger than in the single-interaction economy because they include additional insurance possibilities. In a dynamic economy, agents can insure not only the fundamental endowment shocks but also the future private signal realizations, that is, “bad news” received in the future. Insurance against bad news cannot be provided in the single-interaction environment because today’s news has already been realized. Consequently, the threat of exclusion from future insurance is a powerful one in the dynamic context. It can even prompt agents who don’t face any unemployment risk in the current period to purchase insurance. The inclusion of these agents in insurance is vital for profitability because they constitute good risks today. In the single-interaction model, these agents are unwilling to pay for insurance and drop out of the insurance scheme.As our main theoretical result, we provide a no-trade condition for the dynamic economy with the length of exclusion as the key parameter, which generalizes the earlier contributions. The possibility of exclusion is what distinguishes our dynamic framework from previous work. Without exclusion, the no-trade condition reduces to the one provided in the earlier literature. Intuitively, the longer the agents are excluded from future insurance, the higher their willingness to pay for insurance is today. This makes the provision of insurance more profitable to the insurer and is reflected in a more restrictive no-trade condition in the dynamic economy. On the other hand, the lower the likelihood of the good signal agents receiving bad news in the future, the tougher it is to offer insurance at a profit. In the extreme case of them never receiving bad news, the no-trade condition again reduces to the one derived for the single-interaction model.We employ our model to study the issue of the missing unemployment insurance (UI) market in the US. While the missing market is a universal phenomenon, our focus on this country is motivated by the fact that the importance of private advance information on future job losses is well documented for the US;Stephens (2004)finds that individual subjective job-loss expectations carry predictive power for subsequent job losses, even when public information available to an econometrician is taken into account. Through the lens of our model, we revisit the issue of the missing private unemployment insurance market in the US and ask: do repeated interactions and market exclusion matter for its existence?.To illustrate their quantitative importance, we inform our theoretical model with existing estimates of individuals’ willingness to pay for UI and the costs of adverse selection stemming from the Panel Study of Economic Dynamics (PSID) and the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS). The willingness to pay estimates do include self-insurance via savings and the existing public unemployment insurance as the status quo. These estimates imply markups to pay for UI between 30 and 90 percent. Thus, the question is whether it is profitable to provide private insurance in addition to the already existing insurance possibilities against unemployment. Without exclusion from insurance in the future, the cost of adverse selection far exceeds agents’ willingness to pay, and private unemployment insurance is not profitable. This changes when we allow for exclusion. For the UI markup of 60 percent, the model implies that if agents are excluded for approximately one year after a default, unemployment insurance can be provided at a profit.The exclusion length for profitable unemployment insurance is well below the exclusion length in the US unsecured credit market. After filing for privatebankruptcy, individuals face a loss in financial liberty of up to 10 years, according to Chapter 7. Compared to this exclusion length, the exclusion of one year to render the UI market profitable does not appear long.2A relatively short exclusion length suffices to render the unemployment insurance market profitable because the benefits of future insurance are quantitatively important. Thereby, the future benefits of insurance stem predominantly from insurance against bad news that was not accounted for in the previous literature.The quantitative importance of exclusion for the profitability of private UI is a robust finding. Its importance prevails even when we allow for permanent unobserved heterogeneity. Indeed, our exclusion thresholds are virtually unchanged when we use estimates of the degree to which unemployment risk is clustered on the individual level fromMorchio (2020). While the one-year ahead job-loss indicators in the HRS are also correlated with realized job losses two years and beyond, the implied signal persistency is relatively modest, hardly affecting the necessary exclusion lengths for a profitable UI provision. Further, it does not depend on whether we consider an economy with infinitely or a life-cycle economy with finitely lived agents. A life-cycle version of the model is relevant because the threat of exclusion is of no concern to agents who are retiring. We find that a similar length of exclusion is enough for a profitable insurance provision in this case. The insurer can exploit that agents’ willingness to pay for insurance differs with age. The insurer provides less attractive UI to the young cohorts – who value insurance the most – and extracts more resources from them to subsidize the better insurance offered to individuals nearing retirement, which prevents the contract from unraveling.Our quantitative results suggest that adverse selection rooting in individual foreknowledge of a future job loss, while still relevant, is unlikely to be the sole cause of the missing unemployment insurance market. Arguably, there isn’t a thriving private UI market in the US but our results have clear policy implications for how to kick-start the market. To make the exclusion threat credible, it is helpful to have a registry system that collects information on defaults on UI policies, similar to the successful registry with information on credit defaults. Creating and maintaining such a registry entails fixed costs, and economic policy can contribute to overcoming them. One difference to the credit market is that we show that exclusion is not only important for the well-functioning of the UI market, but actually indispensable for its existence. Thus, the launch of the registry system must be pre-announced and in place when the first UI policies are sold.Related literatureIn a related paper,Braxton et al. (2020)study optimal public UI in a dynamic economy with temporary exclusion from the credit market of defaulting agents due to search frictions. Our contribution is to highlight the importance of contractual exclusion for the existence of a profitable UI market hampered by adverse selection stemming from private information on future job losses. Our paper is closely related toHendren (2017), who also studies the conditions for profitable unemployment insurance. We generalize his theoretical results in a dynamic economy to accentuate the role of market exclusion and insurance against bad news for the existence of a profitable UI market.We also contribute to the literature on the optimal design of unemployment insurance over the life cycle. While the previous literature mainly focuses on moral hazard as the private information friction, we offer new insights into the design of optimal insurance because we investigate the role of adverse selection.Michelacci and Ruffo (2015)find that younger and not older workers should receive more generous UI because the implicit costs of moral hazard are mitigated by long-term career concerns in their case. We find that unemployment insurance for older workers should be subsidized because exclusion from future insurance is less relevant for them.Our theoretical approach shares similarities with the literature on the welfare effects of advance information in efficient risk sharing.Hirshleifer (1971)andSchlee (2001)show that advance information can make risk-averse agents ex-ante worse off if such information leads to the evaporation of risks that otherwise could have been shared in a competitive equilibrium with full insurance. Allowing also for the insurance of news as well as fundamental risk,Denderski and Stoltenberg (2020)analyze the social value of better public information when agents also have private advance information about future income shocks. None of these papers study the role of advance information and exclusion for the existence of a profitable UI market.In Section2, we present the model. In Section3, we provide and discuss our theoretical results on the existence of insurance.

"1. IntroductionThere is an increased awareness, both in the scholarly literature and in popular perception, of the shortcomings of electoral democracy and the inadequacies of relying solely on electoral accountability to incentivize politicians to govern better. This has led to large body of research on interventions to improve the quality of government. Most studies to improve politician performance have focused on improving political selection (e.g.Besley, 2004,Fisman et al., 2015,Gavoille and Verschelde, 2017,Gulzar and Khaan, 2021), and interventions to improve the effort of politicians currently serving in office are relatively rare.There is a much larger literature on addressing government failure by strengthening mechanisms for accountability (Ashworth, 2012,Mookherjee, 2015)1. These include improving the legitimacy of political institutions and expanding franchise (e.g.Baland and Robinson, 2008,Fujiwara, 2015), introducing campaign finance reforms (e.g.Avis et al., 2017), state-led audits (Olken, 2007,Ferraz and Finan, 2011), and grievance redressal mechanisms (Sharan and Kumar, 2021). All these have been found to improve government performance. Another strand of literature examines the impact of bottom-up approaches by strengtheningcommunity participationand citizen accountability (Olken, 2007,Mansuri and Rao, 2013,Rao et al., 2017,Giné and Mansuri, 2018), which broadly shows mixed effects, partly dependent on the nature of the intervention and whether it is permanent or ad hoc. Intertemporal voting models of electoral accountability, under imperfect information, (as inBesley and Case, 1995) also highlight the role of interventions that raise the cost of rent extraction such as state-led audits (Ferraz and Finan, 2011), expansion in media (Besley and Burgess, 2002), and voter informational campaigns (Banerjee et al., 2011,Aker et al., 2017).However, the literature on directly motivating politicians to perform better is sparse. An important paper byFerraz and Finan (2009)on Brazilian municipal governments exploits a discontinuity that increases politician salaries and finds that higher wages for elected leaders result in better performance—more bills proposed and approved, and more resources allocated to publicly funded schools and clinics. There is no evidence on whether performance-based rewards can also directly incentivize political agents to exert more effort towards targeted development outcomes.In this paper, we present experimental evidence on the efficacy of a performance-based incentive in motivating elected politicians to improve delivery of a large-scale anti-poverty program in India. The rewards provide better graded politicians with either a higher public budget, or with a nonfinancial incentive, or kudos, in the form of a public certificate that they can use in election campaigns. The sites of our experiment are village governments in the state of Tamil Nadu in southern India where we incentivize village presidents. The 73rdamendment to the Indian constitution passed in 1992 mandated the formation of independently elected village councils known as gram panchayats (henceforth GPs). In the years since, several national and state governments, across political parties, have directed that safety net programs, public assistance, and public goods construction projects be managed by GPs. This has made GPs (and GP presidents) a central player in the development agenda in India—in efforts to reducepovertyandinequality, in local infrastructure development, and the management of common property resources. There is a large scholarly literature on the political economy of GPs, and much of it has demonstrated that “government failure” at the local level is widespread (Mookherjee, 2014). There is evidence that presidents of GPs favor their home village and caste (Besley et al., 2012), and that elite capture and clientelist arrangements are pervasive (e.g.Bardhan and Mookherjee, 2012,Anderson et al., 2015).We investigate if public incentives—where the rewards are tied to performance on the delivery of a large public program implemented by local governments—can improve observed policy outcomes. The study sample consists of 198 GP presidents who had recently been elected for a five-year term. In the beginning of their current term, GP presidents were randomly assigned into one of two performance-based incentive schemes (with either financial or nonfinancial rewards), or a control group. The nonfinancial incentive promised to advertise the achievement of high performing presidents by organizing an information campaign that highlighted this performance. High performing presidents who were assigned to the financial incentive received additional public resources in the form of cash grants that could be used for investment in local infrastructure and public goods. Eligibility for rewards was based on an objective evaluation of president performance on multiple program dimensions; and those who qualified received the reward towards the end of their current term, before the next scheduled election.The results show that financial and nonfinancial incentives improved the evaluation score received by GP presidents. The incentives improved GP president’s score across all three components of the evaluation criteria—inclusion, transparency, and delivery of safety net and public assistance programs. While the impact of financial incentives on the evaluation score was larger, in terms of magnitude, relative to that of nonfinancial incentives (though not statistically significantly different at conventional levels), financial rewards were also costly to implement. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that expanding the financial incentive schemes to the entire project area would represent 5.9 percent of the total project budget while the non-financial incentive would cost 0.1 percent of the budget. Cost-benefit analysis show that nonfinancial incentives were more cost effective by a factor of at least 17.For outcomes related to delivery of safety nets and public assistance programs, both financial and nonfinancial incentives led to an increase in the total number of beneficiaries of new programs like youth skill-development, as well as an increase in the total number of new cards issued for long-running pension schemes such as a disability grant. For formula bound programs, such as a one-time grant for a house construction that can only have a fixed number of beneficiaries, both incentives improved the spatial distribution of grant recipients across different hamlets within the GP.Nonfinancial incentives, in particular, also reduced differences in resource allocation (including the distribution of one-time housing grants) between the president’s residential hamlet and other hamlets within the GP. Such within-GP differences in resource allocation were prevalent in the control GPs and in the baseline that suggests that GP presidents typically preferentially target resources towards their own hamlet. These results are in line with standard voting models where the degree of accuracy with which voters can observe president quality differ by hamlets. In such contexts with imperfect information, rewards like public recognition that provide credible information to voters across all hamlets can help redress within-GP differences in resource allocation that are prevalent in the status quo.Our paper, like much of the literature on improving elected government performance, focuses on local governments. Local governments have long been perceived, at least since John Stuart Mill, as “training grounds for democracy” where democracy is likely to work better because (a) the proximity of leaders and their constituents leads to better information, (b) there are sharper electoral incentives due to a more direct mapping between performance and votes, and (c) there is potential for better monitoring of politician performance by citizens. Variants of this logic, and a related belief that communities are best suited to have control over decisions that have an impact on their lives, have led to a sharp increase in locally managed development funding and assistance (Mansuri and Rao, 2012). However, the empirical evidence on the effectiveness of these reforms is mixed. In particular, the promise of efficiency gains in political accountability and the delivery of public programs have, in large part, not materialized (Mansuri and Rao, 2012,Mookherjee, 2015).Our results thus also relate to the literature on the use of performance-based incentives to improve the delivery of public goods and services in a wide range of settings which has thus far focused on bureacrats and government employees (seeFinan et al., 2017for a review). The literature spans work on incentives for teachers (e.g.Muralidharan and Sundararaman, 2011), health care workers (e.g.Ashraf et al., 2014), community leaders (Olken et al., 2014), government officials (Bó et al., 2013,Khan et al., 2015), microcredit officers (e.g.Giné et al., 2022), and police (Banerjee et al., 2021). Such incentives have largely been private; and they have thus far focused on agents who are not politically accountable.2There is, however, little evidence on whether similar interventions can also be used with elected leaders to improve governance.In Section 2 of this paper we will sketch the context of the Indian gram panchayat system, and of the Pudhu Vaazhvu project in Tamil Nadu within the rubric of which our experiment took place. Section 3 explains our experimental design. Section 4 outlines our sources of data and spells out the empirical strategy we use. Section 5 describes our results and Section 6 concludes the paper.",Ghazala,Nethra,Vijayendra,Slesh,None,Journal of Public Economics,"Volume 224, August 2023, 104922",0
"1. IntroductionIndividuals may respond to changes in taxation along several margins, including changes in work effort, labor supply, job location, and tax avoidance. The magnitudes of these behavioral responses are crucial for economic policy and to evaluate efficiency costs of taxation. Under certain conditions, the elasticity of taxable income (ETI) has been shown to capture all relevant responses for efficiency andoptimal taxation(Feldstein, 1995,Feldstein, 1999) as a sum. Using the hierarchy ofSlemrod, 1990,Slemrod, 1995, the ETI contains three tiers of behavioral responses: real, avoidance, and timing responses. In a narrow perspective, where the tax system is given, the relative sizes of these responses are irrelevant for, e.g., the government budget. In a broader perspective, where it is possible to design the tax system to reduce avoidance opportunities and increase tax enforcement, the types of behavioral responses become crucial (Saez et al., 2012). If avoidance and timing responses can be effectively minimized, real responses are what remains. Responses in labor supply, in the form of leisure choices and firms’ inputs in production functions, are at the core of the real responses in Slemrod’s hierarchy. Therefore, estimating the responsiveness of labor supply is vital for economic policy decisions.There are several papers documenting large avoidance and timing responses,1and it is the standard view among many public economists that the ETI is primarily driven by such responses (Slemrod, 1995,Slemrod and Yitzhaki, 2002,Saez et al., 2012,Harju and Matikka, 2016). Contrary to this view, I show, by estimating the elasticity of labor supply (ELS) at the intensive margin along with ETI, that adjustments to hours of work is at the core of real responses and the primary driver of total responses for wage earners in Denmark. I argue that this is because of two reasons. First, avoidance and timing responses are low for wage earners who are subject to third-party reporting in Denmark (Kleven et al., 2011,Kleven and Schultz, 2014), and second, the response in hours of work is large due to the fluidity and flexibility of the Danish labor market. I show that job switches and adjustments to paid absence in particular make hours of work responsive in Denmark. Together, these arguments suggest that real responses are the main driver of total responses in Denmark.The primary goal of this paper is to link the ETI and ELS literatures by estimating ELS in addition to ETI. Estimating ETI has received considerable attention, largely because the ETI concept includes all taxpayers’ responses to tax rate changes, all of which reflect inefficiencies, as these responses would not be made absent taxes. The ETI is used as asufficient statisticfor welfare analysis (Feldstein, 1999,Chetty, 2009), meaning that one does not need to inquire into the anatomy of behavioral responses. However, this sufficient statistic property tends to be overstated (Saez et al., 2012). For instance, the sufficient statistic condition requires the absence of externalities, but given the purpose of most deductions, they typically generate nonnegligible externalities, e.g., charitable contributions (Doerrenberg et al., Jul 2017). The empirical analysis used in this paper follows the conventional ETI literature. Inspiration is drawn from bothKleven and Schultz (2014)andWeber (2014), who in turn followGruber and Saez (2002). The conventional ETI approach models taxable income as a function of the marginal tax rate. To account for reverse causality, the standard strategy is to use exogenous variation induced by tax reforms by predicting changes in marginal tax rates using only base-year (”pre-reform”) income. While variation induced by tax reforms is exogenous to post-reform incomes, it still depends on pre-reform income levels, which are correlated with the error term throughmean reversionand heterogeneous growth rates in income. This is commonly conceptualized by modeling income as a process with a serially correlated transitory component that leads to endogeneity.Gruber and Saez (2002)andKleven and Schultz (2014)control for the endogeneity by including (nonlinear) controls for base-year income. Income controls used in this manner can also be interpreted as controlling for nonparallel trends in a difference-in-differences setting.Weber (2014)shows that base-year income controls are endogenous under a serially correlated error term of the income process but that endogeneity is reduced arbitrarily much by basing instruments and income controls on further lagged income. My empirical analysis keeps a close connection to the ETI literature while focusing on labor supply responses at the intensive margin, which provides a ratio of real to total responses. The analysis complements the ETI literature by decomposing the total effect and identifying potential channels for the real responses, which is necessary for calculating the efficiency cost of taxation (Chetty, 2009).Estimating the ratio of real to total responses by comparing ELS to ETI is of high interest but has been difficult for two reasons. First, large discrepancies in methodological approaches make comparison difficult. Second, a practical difficulty in using hours of work as the outcome of interest is the availability and precision of such a measure. Previous labor supply literature has relied on survey data on hours of work,2which are imprecise, have limited coverage of the population, and often consist of short individual panels. It is unlikely that full behavioral responses have materialized within a single year, and it is standard in the ETI literature to account for ”sluggish” responses that take several years to materialize. In this paper, I use ”performed” work hours from large and detailed administrative register data. Register data include longer individual panels, which makes it possible to calculate individual differences in marginal taxes and hours of work over time, to account for sluggish adjustments. The advantage of usingperformedhours of work is that it includes paid overtime3and excludes paid absence (e.g., due to sickness, maternity leave, special holidays and similar). In this way, it captures variation in contracted hours of work and, to some extent, variation in effort, as measured by taking more paid overtime and/or less paid leave. The increasing availability of a precise and detailed measure of hours of work is promising for future estimation of labor supply responses and relating real to total responses to taxation.Using these data, I make three key contributions to literature. First, I estimate the three-year ELS, ELI (elasticity of labor income), and ETI to be0.08,0.06, and0.1, respectively. The results for ELI and ETI are very similar to the findings ofKleven and Schultz (2014)for Denmark, who estimate ELI and ETI to be0.05and0.06for wage earners. My contribution is to provide the relation between behavioral responses in labor supply (ELS) and total behavioral responses to tax rate changes (ETI). Labor supply responses is a highly appealing outcome variable because it reflects real responses, not subject to intertemporal shifting or tax avoidance. In this way, I link the ETI and ELS literatures, and this is, to the best of my knowledge, the first attempt to provide evidence that a large part of the total behavioral responses of wage earners stem from real responses by individuals adjusting their hours of work. These results complement the ETI literature by documenting real responses as a core underlying driver of the total effect of taxation.My second contribution comes from decomposing labor supply responses into within-job and across-job variation. One may mistakenly have the impression that labor supply analyses rely on the assumption that individuals can freely choose their work hours at a fixed wage with a single employer (Blundell et al., 1999). Instead, individual variation in hours of work can come from two different sources; within-job or across-job variation. Within-job variation can come from individuals renegotiating their job contract to obtain more hours (e.g., going from part- to full-time work), taking more overtime work or making less use of paid absence. Across-job variation can come from the individual switching to a job with more work hours or taking up new side employment.Blundell et al. (1999)interpret labor market models as characterizing situations where individuals select their hours of work by selecting across employers offering different wage packages. I find evidence that the estimated ELS is primarily driven by individuals switching main andsecondary employment, by increasing their contract hours, and decreasing paid absence. I also find a smaller, positive effect on paid overtime. Across-job variation being the dominant channel implies that ELS will be larger the easier job-to-job transitions are. An implication is that ELS depends on labor market conditions and tightness.The third contribution is methodological, showing that using marginal tax instruments based on lagged income information as suggested byWeber (2014)is not always feasible and comes at a cost. Basing instruments on further lagged income reduces their explanatory power, which may even increase asymptotic bias. Additionally, instruments based on further lagged income changes the compliant population. This may lead to a compliant population that is characterized by a higher/lower responsiveness to tax rate changes, which increases/decreases the estimated elasticity and might reduce external validity.These three contributions are largely achieved by applying the methodological advancements made in the ETI literature to estimating ELS, using large and detailed administrative register data. Even if ETI fulfills the conditions for being a sufficient statistic for welfare analysis, all three tiers of responses in Slemrod’s hierarchy are intertwined. The primary objective of this paper is to return to labor supply responses as the outcome of interest, which only reflects real responses, and thereby disentangle labor responses from the total effect as estimated by ETI. .",Hans,None,None,None,None,Journal of Public Economics,"Volume 224, August 2023, 104943",0
"1. IntroductionThe act of giving to charity is not without costs. It involves search costs to acquire information about the candidate charity, psychological costs when contemplating whether or not to give and how much, and time and attention costs to complete the donation transaction.1We develop anonparametric testto assess the importance of general nuisance costs to giving that does not require knowing the source of the costs (e.g. search, psychological, attention, time).2This is valuable because specific knowledge of what these costs actually are for potential donors is limited or unknown. We model nuisance costs as a fixed cost that needs to be covered before an individual is willing to donate. Our test then gives a clearer picture of the effect size of these general costs on giving. We show that nuisance costs are sizeable. If these costs did not exist, our analysis suggests the number of donations would double.We conduct a large online giving field experiment with over 17,200 potential donors to investigate the empirical relevance of nuisance costs. Potential donors were presented with one of three fixed matches that would be paid to the charity, $5, $25 or $50, if they made a donation of at least $1, $5 or $10 respectively. Thus, the implicit match price was kept constant at 5:1. Absent nuisance costs, standard assumptions on preferences to give predict that donation rates will not increase as the minimum donation required rises. In other words, individuals willing to give at higher required minimums should be willing to give at lower ones as well, but those observed to give at a low minimum donation will not necessarily give at higher ones. In the presence of nuisance costs, however, donation rates could increase as required minimums rise. This is because the match paid to the charity increases and effectively compensates for the nuisance cost. In essence, if the match the charity receives covers the donor’s nuisance cost, it can sway the donor to donate. The findings from the field experiment provide a simple and direct test of the relevance of nuisance costs to giving.3The study design and hypotheses rely on weak assumptions on the preferences for giving: monotonicity and convexity. This allows for identification of the presence of nuisance costs without needing to pinpoint the source. This is advantageous because the sources of nuisance costs are likely to be heterogeneous and unknown. Specific giving costs have been studied with field and laboratory experiments, focusing on reminders and the cost to complete the financial transaction (Rasul and Huck, 2010), language barriers (Meer and Rigbi, 2013) and opportunity cost of time (Knowles and Servátka, 2015,Hutchinson-Quillian et al., 2021). However, without prior knowledge of what specific nuisance costs a potential donor faces, a researcher would need to exhaustively test alternatives, and not all might be easily amenable to experimental manipulation. Our study sidesteps this by examining the observable implications of the existence of nuisance costs in general. The design and empirical strategy we employ might be useful in other contexts as well where nuisance costs are likely present, i.e. participation in social programs or accessing government benefits.4Matching donations is a common practice in fundraising campaigns. Charities leverage funds made available from a donor or a grant to provide potential donors an incentive to give. Donations are typically matched “dollar-for-dollar,” i.e. for every dollar a donor gives, the charity receives a dollar from the matching fund. Threshold matches, i.e. donate at least $X, and the charity will receive a match of $X, are less common but may be more efficient (Castillo and Petrie, 2021,Adena and Huck, 2022). Our field experiment uses threshold matches and a constant implicit matching rate of 5:1 across all conditions. This design feature is important because if matching rates differed, simple comparisons of the propensity to donate and the amount donated would not necessarily identify the presence of nuisance costs. Higher matching rates could generate an increase in donation rates and/or amount donated simply because the price of giving has declined or because they signal a greater need of the charity. Indeed, the existence of nuisance costs is consistent with results showing that higher match rates increase donation rates while not affecting the amount donated (e.g.,Karlan and List, 2007,Huck and Rasul, 2011).To assess the monetary costs of these barriers to giving, we make additional assumptions on preferences so that we can estimate costs. We follow the common approach in empirical work in this area and model preferences as iso-elastic (Kleven and Waseem, 2013,Hungerman and Ottoni-Wilhelm, 2021,Ottoni-Wilhelm et al., 2017).5The model captures the main aspects of the giving decision and the nature of the market. In this framework, only individuals with higher nuisance costs donate as the minimum required donation increases, holding constant the match rate. The underlying distribution of nuisance costs can be uncovered by offering different required minimum donations. Our field experiment conditions do this, and the data are used to approximate the magnitude of nuisance costs to giving.6Estimated nuisance costs for those who donate when offered a $25 match for a donation of at least $5 is $7 or more and could be higher depending on price responsiveness and preferences. The nuisance costs for those offered a $50 match for a donation of at least $10 is $29 or more. These costs are also widespread in our sample. At least 45% of donors in the high match condition have costs of $7 or higher and 23% have costs of $29 or higher.7Almost one percent of those contacted in the field experiment made a donation, and this donation rate is comparable to previous fundraising field experiments using direct mail (Eckel and Grossman, 2008,Karlan and List, 2007) and email communication (Castillo and Petrie, 2021), where donation rates were between 1–2%. Consistent with the presence of nuisance costs to giving, we find a statistically significant increase in the donation rate as the minimum required donation increases. The rate in the $1:$5, $5:$25 and $10:$50 treatments are 0.52%, 0.74% and 0.97% respectively. The average donation, conditional on making a donation, was $29.50, and this is not statistically significantly different across conditions.Our findings contribute to the literature on charitable giving (e.g.,Vesterlund, 2006,Andreoni and Payne, 2013,Ottoni-Wilhelm et al., 2017) by examining the impact of individuals’ nuisance costs to give on donation rates and amounts. The nuisance costs we estimate are sizable and would affect an individual’s willingness to search and choose among charities. The presence of nuisance costs suggests that offering a fixed match amount for a donation above a threshold may be more effective at garnering donations than the common practice among charities of matching every dollar donated. More broadly, the existence of nuisance costs would impact the amount of government transfers to charities (Andreoni and Payne, 2003) and competition among charities (Krasteva and Yildirim, 2013).The findings also contribute to the burgeoning theoretical and empirical literature on decision frictions (e.g.Taubinsky and Rees-Jones, 2018,Hanna et al., 2014,Bordalo et al., 2013,Grubb and Osborne, 2015,Bordalo et al., 2012,Abaluck and Gruber, 2011,Abaluck and Gruber, 2016,Gabaix, 2014,Ellison and Ellison, 2009,Hortacsu and Syverson, 2004,Chetty et al., 2009,Chetty, 2012,Handel and Kolstad, 2015,Madrian and Shea, 2001,Kling et al., 2012,Jessoe and Rapson, 2014,Bhargava et al., 2017,Allcott and Taubinsky, 2015) by showing that these costs are large in the context of charitable giving. The advantage of the method we develop is that it reveals the presence of general nuisance costs without having to know the precise source of these costs.8An understanding of decision frictions is crucial for policy design, and our field experiment allows a direct measure of nuisance costs. The act of giving is costly, and evidence suggests that individuals purposely commit errors or become inattentive as a way to avoid giving (Andreoni et al., 2017,Exley, 2016,Exley and Petrie, 2018,Exley and Kessler, 2019). Models of endogeneous attention (e.g.Bordalo et al., 2013,Gabaix, 2014) can help rationalize our findings, but our experiment is not designed to distinguish among competing theories.The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 outlines the theory for making a donation in the presence of nuisance costs and derives testable implications. Section 3 describes the field experiment design and implementation. Section 4 presents results and parametric estimates of nuisance costs. Section 5 concludes.",Marco,Ragan,Clarence,None,None,Journal of Public Economics,"Volume 224, August 2023, 104945",0
"1. IntroductionCurvature in utility of consumption, which captures how much less high consumption households value an additional $1 relative to low consumption households, is a crucial parameter for the design of tax systems (Mirrlees, 1971,Saez, 2001), unemployment insurance (Baily, 1978,Chetty, 2006), in-kind goods provision (Munro, 1991,Gadenne et al., 2022), cash transfers programs (Bergstrom and Dodds, 2021,Haushofer et al., 2022), and workfare provision (Kreiner and Tranaes, 2005). Given the need to implement social safety net programs in developing countries in order to alleviate worldpoverty(World Bank, 2018), understanding curvature in utility of consumption for low- and middle-income countries is of central policy importance. However, there is very little consensus about curvature in utility of consumption, especially for developing countries, not only because few papers have been able to exploit large-scale, experimental/quasi-experimental variation to estimate this crucial empirical object, but also because most estimates are in developed settings.This paper develops and implements a new method to estimate the elasticity of marginal utility of consumption (with respect to consumption) in developing countries using reduced-form schooling elasticities and the consumption cost of schooling. The central insights build on the work ofFisher, 1927,Frisch, 1932andFellner (1967), which was more recently popularized byChetty (2006): income and price effects contain information about the elasticity of marginal utility of consumption (hereafter, the EMUC).1We extend this logic to a very general model of schooling decisions, showing how the EMUC can be recovered from threesufficient statistics: the reduced-form elasticity of schooling with respect to the price of schooling, the reduced-form elasticity of schooling with respect to (unearned) income, and the percentage drop in consumption that ensues from sending a child to school. We then implement this method for poor households in rural Mexico using quasi-experimental variation generated by theconditional cash transferprogram Progresa to estimate these three sufficient statistics. Our setting, like many other settings in low- and middle-income countries, features a large opportunity cost of sending a child to school as children can earn substantial incomes relative to their parents (as most jobs are low skill). As such, we estimate a sizable drop in consumption due to schooling which, combined with estimates of income and price effects fromBergstrom and Dodds (2021), yields an estimate of the EMUC of 1.6. This implies that as consumption increases by 1%, marginal utility of consumption decreases by 1.6%.While, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to estimate the EMUC using schooling decisions, numerous papers have attempted to measure curvature in utility using various methods. Broadly, there are two strands of literature that estimate curvature in utility of consumption. The first strand uses survey evidence to directly elicit how happiness metrics change with consumption; for instance,Layard et al. (2008)use this approach to estimate the EMUC at 1.26. The second strand uses revealed preference arguments that ultimately rely on different separability assumptions. Some papers use revealed preference arguments along with an assumption of state separability (i.e., expected utility theory) to estimate the EMUC, which, in this case, is equivalent to the coefficient of relative risk aversion:Outreville (2014)surveys this literature, finding estimates that vary widely from less than 1 to greater than 30 depending on context and method. Other papers assume separability in utility over consumption and another good: for example,Chetty (2006)assumes separability in consumption and labor supply, estimating the EMUC at approximately 1.2Alternatively, other papers use revealed preference arguments assuming that utility is time separable, inferring the EMUC as the inverse of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS):Havránek (2015)surveys this literature finding an average EMUC of 3 (or an average EIS of 1/3) for asset holders.3Our method fits into this second strand of the literature: we use revealed preference arguments along with the assumption that utility over consumption and schooling is separable to infer the EMUC. If one assumes the benefits to schooling accrue in the future (i.e., to the next generation), then this assumption is equivalent to assuming time separability. Thus, we are perhaps most closely related to the literature that infers the EMUC (or EIS) from intertemporal decisions. By using schooling as the investment decision, we are able to estimate the EMUC (or EIS) for a set of households who do not necessarily have access to conventional financial markets.Even though there are many methods to back out the curvature of utility over consumption, most studies take place in developed settings. The relatively small set of studies that take place in developing countries typically use either time series variation to estimate the EIS for asset holders (discussed inHavránek et al. (2015)) or small-scale experiments involving choices over lotteries, which may be poorly understood by the subjects (Cook et al., 2013), to elicit risk preferences (e.g.,Binswanger, 1981,Yesuf and Bluffstone, 2009). Few papers have been able to exploit large-scale, experimental/quasi-experimental variation combined with real-world economic choices to estimate curvature of utility over consumption. Hence, some of the discrepancies between various estimates of curvature are almost surely due to a lack of credibly exogenous variation. As far as we know, our approach is unique within developing country contexts insofar as we exploit large scale, experimental/quasi-experimental variation to estimate the EMUC for poor households.4This paper begins by exploring a model with binary schooling decisions for families with a single child. We define the price effect of schooling as the change in the fraction of children going to school in response to a change in the price of schooling; similarly, the income effect of schooling is defined as the change in the fraction of children going to school in response to a change in (unearned) income. Expressing these two effects in terms of primitives, we show that the ratio of income to price effects is (first-order approximately) equal to the percentage change in consumption that results from schooling multiplied by the EMUC. This baseline setup is essentially an extension ofFisher, 1927,Frisch, 1932andFellner (1967)(hereafter the FFF method; seeEvans (2005)for further discussion of the FFF method), who show that the ratio of income to own-price elasticities is equal to the EMUC for any continuous good that is additively separable from other consumption variables. We build off this existing work by showing that the relationship between the EMUC and our three sufficient statistics holds in substantially more general settings. We show that the relationship still holds in a model with multiple children (and hence multiple schooling decisions), many binary schooling decisions made over multiple years in a dynamic framework with uncertainty, parentallabor supply decisions, and saving/borrowing decisions. The core idea is that all of these additional bells and whistles simply allow households to mediate the drop in consumption that results from sending a child to school. As long as we can observe the total impact that schooling has on consumption (inclusive of all of these behavioral responses) along with the reduced-form income and price effects, we can still recover the EMUC.We then apply our theoretical framework to the setting of Progresa, a large conditional cash transfer (CCT) program in rural Mexico. Our empirical contribution is to estimate the consumption cost of schooling (i.e., the impact of sending an additional child to school on household consumption) using the randomized introduction of Progresa grants across villages. Estimating the impact of sending a child to school on consumption is challenging because both consumption and schooling decisions are driven by household primitives which we cannot easily control for. In particular, we cannot adequately control for household income because income is measured with substantial error (as is the case in most developing countries); thus, we face endogeneity concerns because income is likely positively correlated with schooling decisions (i.e., schooling is a normal good) and income is mechanically correlated with consumption. To overcome this issue, we use two alternative IV difference-in-difference strategies. Our main specification regresses household consumption (excluding transfer payments) on schooling, using a difference-in-difference first stage regression whereofferedtransfers (transfers a household would receive if they sent all their children to school) is used as an instrument for schooling decisions, controlling for time and area fixed-effects. Using this IV-difference-in-difference approach, we estimate that consumption decreases by around 30% when a household sends an additional secondary-school-aged child to school. We then employ a second IV-difference-in-difference strategy that uses the presence of primary and secondary schools in a village as instruments for schooling, finding very similar results. While a 30% consumption cost of schooling may seem high, it is consistent with the fact that children earn similar amounts to their parents in Progresa villages (Schultz, 2004).We combine this consumption cost of schooling with income and price effect estimates for the same setting fromBergstrom and Dodds (2021), who find that income effects are 48% as large as price effects. Putting it all together, we estimate the EMUC as the ratio of income to price effects relative to the proportionate drop in consumption that results from sending an additional child to school, obtaining an estimate for the EMUC of 1.6.The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section I derives the relationship between income effects, price effects, the consumption cost of schooling, and the EMUC. Section II discusses the Progresa program and the income and price effect estimates fromBergstrom and Dodds (2021). Section III estimates the consumption cost of schooling. Section IV presents our estimate of the EMUC and Section V concludes.",Katy,William,None,None,None,Journal of Public Economics,"Volume 224, August 2023, 104948",0
