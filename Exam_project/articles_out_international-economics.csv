"1. IntroductionDifferent methodologies have been applied to analyze the relationship between trade agreements and trade flows. In recent decades, network approaches have been incorporated theoretically as well as empirically. However, while trade flows can be correctly represented using traditional networks (graphs, mathematically speaking1), this is not the case for agreements, which associate two or morenodeswith one singlelink. The objective of this paper was thus methodological. We aimed to capture trade agreements not by graphs, but byhypergraphs, which generalize graphs when there are single links for more than two nodes.2This mathematical structure has already been used byJorzik and Mueller-Langer (2020)to capture the genesis of trade agreements. We used hypergraphs in a different way. Our objective was to identify from observational data the countries that are connected by trade agreements to such an extent that they can be considered as members of the same subset or module in the partition of countries based on those agreements. For trade flows, we used the usual graph representation to generate the same type of subset or modules.An analysis ofmodularity(also known ascommunity detection) was then conducted on both networks, trade agreements and trade flows, in order to compare the communities apparent in each network. We focused on a snapshot of 2017 data, and we found that there is not a complete contradiction between the modules generated by trade agreements and those corresponding to the intensity of trade flows, but also not a perfect coincidence. Namely, focusing on the modules with the strongest connections between the members,3the results seem to justify Brexit, but also to show that the CETA4agreement was only a confirmation of an existing tendency for Canadian involvement in agreements with European countries.Old debates on the relationship between trade agreements and trade flows lie behind these unexpected results. Also, new questions emerged. Should a hypergraph approach be applied to analyze the role of different trade agreements in a more disaggregated setting, that is, not only at national level, but also for differentindustriesor sectors? This is a thought-provoking suggestion. Do our results suggest that the European Community was unable to enhance trade between the United Kingdom and other members? Could the same question be formulated after substituting “welfare” or “growth” for “trade” in the question? This is not easy to answer. In the case of CETA, partners hoped that this agreement could increase trade between Canada and continental Europe. For the moment, observation confirms that the agreement was for the most part effective. The level of exports from the European Community to Canada increased regularly, from €29.64B in 2017 to €38.32B in 2019, decreasing to €33.49B in 2021, before increasing again to €37.29B in 2022 (Eurostat International, 2023). The effect on imports to Europe from Canada was more spectacular, jumping from €16.68B in 2017 to €25.65B in 2022, with a decrease between 2020 and 2021, linked to the pandemic crisis. Exports and imports having increased not in the same proportion but in similar amounts, the external balance of Europe with Canada remained relatively unchanged, the positive surplus moving from €12.59B in 2017 to €13.63B in 2022. In the same time, European countries’ trade with Canada, as a share of their total of trade in partnership with other countries, only increased from 1.6% to 1.7% for exports and from 1% to 1.1% for imports, which tends to indicate that the CETA agreement does not for the momentde factointegrate Canada as a major commercial partner of European countries but only increases its importance as an extra-European country.5But finally, we are less interested to know in the case of the CETA agreement if it became effective over time than to understand if this agreement really changed the way countries are clustered in terms of agreements: one of the outcomes of the paper is to show that, in July 2017, Canada was already in the cluster of Europe concerning agreements, as United Kingdom was already in the cluster of North American countries concerning trades of commodities at the same date, though Brexit only became effective in February 2020. These two events were therefore a continuation of past trends (CETA) or a formalization in the agreements of what was already happening in trade (Brexit)Our analysis concentrates on trade in goods and on agreements concerning goods only or goods and services but not services only. The reason is that “trade in services is affected less by distance and adjacency compared to trade in goods” (Yane et al., 2013p. 13).6Since our method of analysis aims to neutralize the gravity effect, particularly concerning trade flows, it would have been too easy to retain services, which are naturally not very sensitive to distance (no transport costs or time). By focusing on goods only, our results are more robust. When we obtain for instance that considering only trade of goods, United Kingdom is in the module of North America, this result is obviously maintained when services are introduced, but we are sure that it does not depend on services flows, which tend to be less affected by distance.The paper is organized as follows. Section2recalls the main debates and results related to the relation between trade agreements and trade flows, particularly those using a network approach.

"1. IntroductionThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's (KSA) economic diversification is inspected in the literature as a bundle within the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries because they have similar economic structures. The diversification's core idea is to gradually cut the relative importance of the hydrocarbon and relatedindustriesand thus reduce CO2emissions. Moreover, greater economic diversification would reduce ambiguity in the international oil market and ultimately guarantee a viable economy (Sweidan, 2021a). The KSA economic policymakers realized that crude oil is a limited resource, and the KSA economy is highly volatile to the oil price uncertainty, which generates unstable income,stock returns, consumption, and government budget (Alqahtani et al., 2020;Alqahtani et al., 2019;Pierru and Matar, 2014). Accordingly, the GCC countries broadcasted economic diversification as a strategic economic policy a long time ago.Unfortunately, the GCC economies' diversification progress, including KSA, is slow and weak. It is related to oil price fluctuations, managing the economy, the diversification plan, the government budget deficit, and the educational system (Hvidt, 2013;Al Naimi, 2022).Albassam (2015)investigated the KSA government's decisions and actions to diversify the economy. His analysis covered nine development plans during 1970–2013. After more than 40 years of various efforts to diversify the KSA economy, he found that the oil sector is the main engine of economic growth.1The Saudi Central Bank (SAMA) data shows that the average ratio of the oil-GDP to GDP is equal to 42.4% during 1970–2020.Fig. 1shows an apparent fluctuations trend of this ratio over time.Download :Download high-res image (124KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. The ratio of oil-GDP to GDP in Saudi Arabia during the period (1970–2020).Source: Central Bank of Saudi Arabia.The literature, i.e.,Hvidt, 2013;Djimeu and Omgba (2019);Sweidan (2020), argues that oil price is a critical economic variable for the economic diversification evolution in oil-exporting countries. Higher oil prices generate massive revenues for the oil-exporting countries and thus divert the motivation to proceed with the economic diversification plan.Recently, literature discussed an exciting issue related to the diversification philosophy on howgeopolitical riskaffects the economic sectors, i.e.,Cheng and Chiu (2018);Mei et al. (2020). This impact may encourage or discourage economic diversification progress. Geopolitical risk is an institutional uncertainty aspect that is associated with wars and tensions among nations and affects the peaceful course of international relations. Undoubtedly, the KSA is in the region's heart and a key player with a long-term vision and aspiration. Therefore, we cannot ignore the effect of international geopolitical risk on its economic diversification.Moreover, the emergence of the entrepreneurial state capitalist, i.e.,Bremmer (2009);Gray (2011);Kurlantzick (2016);Alami and Dixon (2020);Sweidan (2021b), has a significant role in the world economies and the GCC region alike.Kurlantzick (2016)defined state capitalists as countries whose government has significant ownership and control over the economy and the corporate sector. He classified the KSA among the most autocratic state capitalists. In these countries, the government intervenes in the economy by setting strategic goals and participating in the production mechanism. Also, it encourages the participation of the private sector linked to the elite to support and protect the political regime. Thus, the dominant firms belong to the political elite or merchant families. These developments open a significant question about the influence of geopolitical risk andgovernment expenditureson the economic diversification process. These new changes are significant, connected, and should be explored in the KSA economy because it is a perfect case for such a study.Many recent studies, i.e.,Guendouz and Ouassaf (2020);Yamada (2018);Banafea and Ibnrubbian (2018);Albassam (2015), explored the effect of variousmacroeconomic variableson the KSA economic diversification. The majority of these studies are descriptive and lack empirical analysis. Besides, exploring the determinants of the KSA economic diversification is motivated by the substantial fluctuations in oil prices, the severe international geopolitical tensions, and the new government role within the statecapitalismconcept. As a result, our work investigates and compares the effect of oil prices, international geopolitical risk, and the KSA government expenditures on the KSA economic diversification process over 1970–2020. Our paper uses the bounds testing approach to cointegration to estimate the coefficient of the AutoregressiveDistributed Lag model(ARDLM) to achieve its goal. Thiseconometricsapproach helps us trace the explanatory variables' short-run and long-run effects on the KSA economic diversification process. Our paper's contribution to this area of economic research is twofold. First, based on our knowledge, the literature lacks such a crucial comparison study on the KSA economy. Moreover, one of this paper's limitations is the lack of previous empirical works that link geopolitical risk and government expenditures to economic diversification. This shortage will constrain the ability of our paper to compare its results with previous works. Therefore, we add to the literature by filling this gap. Second, it extends our understanding of how global external variables affect economic diversification in a rich-and-oil-dependent nation. Alternatively, this paper tests the effect of those three critical variables in one model. The limitation of this contribution is the restriction on the data sample of the KSA. The remainder of our article is arranged as follows. Section 2 presents the appropriate literature framework. Section 3 introduces the present paper's data and methodology.

"1. IntroductionOn February 24, 2022, the Russianarmyinvaded Ukraine. In response, several countries, which accounted for 55% of the world GDP and absorbed almost 60% of the Russian exports in 2020, responded to the aggression by imposing restrictive measures on their trade with that country and on its financial sector.1These developments could eventually lead to a decoupling between Russia and the sanctioning economies, potentially being very costly for both parties. In light of this possibility, quantifying its impact becomes key to guiding policymakers.In this paper, we focus on trade decoupling by evaluating the economic consequences of a large increase in non-tariff barriers (NTBs) between sanctioning countries and Russia.2Our contribution is two-fold. First, we measure the potential impact of a decoupling from Russia on both trade and welfare. Second, we propose a methodology to assess how much welfare changes induced by theactualtrade sanctions imposed in 2022 compare to the changes obtained in our hypothetical decoupling.We start by investigating potential exposures to a decoupling by looking at trade interdependencies between Russia and Western economies in 2018. We rely onOECDTiVA Inter-Country Input-Output (I–O) data to assess the magnitude of Western countries’ reliance on Russian energy and industrial raw materials, and of Russian final demand in absorbing other countries’ production. We document that the dependency on raw materials, especially energy inputs, is sizable.With this picture in mind, we rely on the extension of the seminal quantitative trade model ofCaliendo and Parro (2015)proposed byAntràs and Chor (2018), to quantify the effects on countries’ welfare (i.e., real income) arising from permanent and large changes in NTBs. In particular, our baseline results assume that Western countries double NTBs on their trade flows with Russia. When trade costs onbothimports and exports double, we refer to this scenario as “trade decoupling”.We find that these disruptions would mainly affect Russia and its closest trade partners. Both Western restrictions on exports to Russia and those on imports would substantially harm Russia, with the latter reducing Russian welfare to a larger extent. The impact on the EU27 and the other sanctioning countries would be rather modest in the long run —even assuming restrictions on imports of energy products. Overall, a decoupling would reduce Russian welfare by 4.8% while EU27 welfare would decrease by 0.4%. We further show that supply chains contribute to amplifying the economic impact of the NTB increase and that energy products, especially oil, account for a sizable share of the welfare changes.As this class of models focuses on long-run effects, the analysis implicitly assumes that there are no technological limitations to countries’ ability to adjust their expenditure shares. Such considerations may not operate in the short run and may be particularly harmful to EU27 countries. Specifically, the transitory impact of an embargo on Russian energy could be substantial and might vary dramatically, depending on theelasticity of substitutionbetween imported energy and domestic inputs. We show that this is indeed the case by relying on a parsimonious two-sector framework (Bachmann et al., 2022). When assuming a sudden and complete disruption of Russian energy exports and limited possibilities to substitute them, the contraction in EU27 output could reach 4.7% in the short-run.Finally, we collect granular information on the trade restrictions imposed by the EU27 since February 2022 and combine this information with trade statistics to modify the I–O structure used in our simulations. In this way, we can evaluate how the welfare impact of the actual trade bans and restrictions compares to that induced by a trade decoupling from Russia. We find that welfare changes induced by implemented restrictions represent about 80% of those obtained in our hypothetical simulations.Our paper connects to recent literature studying the economic cost of decoupling (Eppinger et al., 2021,Felbermayr et al., 2023). Our work is most closely related toFelbermayr et al. (2023)who rely on the trade model ofCaliendo and Parro (2015)to analyze different trade war scenarios. Our focus, however, is on trade decoupling from Russia and we highlight the importance of energy and supply chains in driving welfare changes arising from changes in trade costs with respect to an important energy supplier. Moreover, we show how the effects may differ across different time horizons by providing evidence on the short-run effect of an energy ban. For this reason, we see our paper as complementary to theirs. In light of the previous consideration, our paper also connects to recent work byBachmann et al. (2022)andBaqaee et al. (2022). Indeed, we build on the tractable two-sector framework ofBachmann et al. (2022)and extend their energy shock scenario by adding a solidarity mechanism between EU27 countries. Finally, compared to all these important recent papers, we compare our counterfactual scenarios to the welfare effects arising from actual trade sanctions.The rest of the paper goes as follows. Section2describes the supply- and demand-side interlinkages between Russia and sanctioning countries. In Section3, we present the quantitative trade model and decoupling scenario. Results are reported in Section4and Section5explores different channels. Section6studies the welfare effect of current sanctions.

"1. IntroductionThebankingsector is a key componentof economic development(King and Levine, 1993), as it promoteswealthaccumulation and economic growth (Bencivenga and Smith, 1991). Thus, any change affecting the structure of this sector can have consequences on the real economy (Kerr and Nanda, 2009). In the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU1), the authorities, concerned about the role of the banking system, have put in place policies and measures (Financial liberalization policies; Basel I, II and III agreements) to make the banking market more efficient (Gammadigbé, 2018).The relationship between bank concentration, defined as an absence of (or limited) competition (Eggoh et al., 2021), and bank performance is widely documented in the literature. Thus, while some authors argue that the source of bank performance is market dynamism (Bain, 1956;Mason, 1939) and competition in the sector (Ariss, 2010;Delis and Tsionas, 2009;Eggoh et al., 2021), others find a negative correlation between competition and bank performance (Demsetz, 1973;Ferreira, 2013;Leon, 2012;Mohammed et al., 2015).In the WAEMU, where studies show that the level of banking efficiency (83%) is higher than the one found (70%) in the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) (Moussa and Ka, 2020;Djiogap and Song, 2016), the limited work on the link between competition and banking efficiency has led to mixed conclusions. For example,Leon (2012)argues that concentration increases banking efficiency, whileEggoh et al. (2021)andNdiaye (2018)find a decrease in bank efficiency in a presence of concentration. These studies, although serious, did not take into account the transformation of the WEAMU banking environment, marked by the growing presence of multinational banks, which could potentially lead to changes in competitiveness and performance in the zone. In addition, these studies did not take into account factors external to banking system, such ascorruptionand political instability, which are nevertheless very important insofar as countries in the zone are regularly shaken by political tensions, linked for example to elections and sudden political changes. Yet, in theory, the institutional environment could have effects on the banking market. Indeed, a good institutional environment creates discipline and transparency, which leads to greater bank efficiency (Barth et al., 2013;González et al., 2019;Pasiouras et al., 2009). Therefore, taking into account the macro-institutional framework is of great importance for a complete analysis (Ahlin et al., 2011;Gbandi et al., 2021). The objective of this paper is to shed light on the link between competition and bank efficiency in the WAEMU, focusing on the role of multinationals and institutions. The purpose of this paper is motivated by several reasons.Firstly, although there is a large literature on the relationship between competition and bank efficiency, most of it focuses on developed economies with little attention is paid to developing countries, especially the WAEMU region. Moreover,Couchoro and Gbandi (2018)show, in the context of Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), that the effect of the financial sector onpoverty, particularly microfinance, is less pronounced in the WAEMU zone than in the non-WAEMU zone of ECOWAS, the West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ). Based on the work ofNorth (1981)on the trajectories of Anglophone and Francophone countries, these results were explained by the difference in the macro-institutional environment between the two zones, where WAEMU countries, unlike those in the non-WAEMU zone of ECOWAS, are subject to the same monetary and financial regulations. Thus, in the ECOWAS financial sector, unlike the banking system of the WAEMU countries where the banking system is harmonized, those of the WAMZ have their own banking system. Therefore, from a methodological point of view, the choice of countries in the WAEMU zone permits to avoid heterogeneity between countries insofar as they have similar pasts and institutional environments. Moreover, this choice has the advantage of mitigating selection bias given that these countries come under the same supervisory institution in monetary and financial terms, namely the Central Bank of West African Countries (BCEAO), and that they are almost similar from a developmental point of view (Gbandi et al., 2021).Secondly, since 2000s, the banking sector in WAEMU countries has undergone a transformation process characterized by the appearance of new banks on the market. Thus, as shown inFig. 1in the annex, there has been a steady increase in the share of multinational banks since 2000. Indeed, the growth of multinational banks can pave the way for economies of scale (Berger and Ofek, 1996;Sapienza, 1998), alter market power, improve productivity optimization (Amihud and Lev, 1981) and, through diversification, affect the level of risk (Deng and Elyasiani, 2008) and efficiency of banks (Gertner et al. 1994). In addition, in order to cope with the decline in profitability and the erosion of market share brought about by deregulation and increased competition, mergers, acquisitions and collaborative operations are taking place in the banking sector (Karray and Chichti, 2013). These various operations are intended to allow these new scales of banks (multinational banks, banking groups or large banks) to obtain better cost structures, to benefit from the economies of scale and scope that their size confers, and thus improving efficiency. Central Bank of West African States reports state that in 2018, one - hundred and six (106) of the one hundred and forty-three (143) banking institutions operating in the Union are affiliated with twenty-nine (29) banking groups and multinationals. These entities account for 86.8% of banking - assets, 60.9% of branches, 84.4% of ATMs, 83.4% of bank accounts, 77.9% of employees and 96.9% of the provisional overall net income of the WAEMU banking sector. This structural transformation of the WAEMU banking sector market cannot be overlooked insofar as it is a determining factor in the efficiency of banks in the zone. Indeed, these banks may have better access to capital markets, a superior ability to diversify risk, and access to superior technologies for the collection and evaluation of “hard” quantitative information (Berger-Douce, 2005;Kanga et al., 2021;Shleifer and Vishny, 1997).Thirdly, this study adds to the existing literature in the WAEMU zone by using the Boone index as a proxy for competitiveness. Although previous works deal seriously with the link between concentration and performance in the WAEMU banking sector, it is clear that it is still flawed. Indeed, these previous works relied on the HHI and/or Lerner indices as proxies for banking concentration, which do not accurately reflect the characteristics of the banking market (Boone, 2008). By way of illustration, these indices take into account banking products as close substitutes, a very decisive approach to banking efficiency, given the asymmetric distribution of information in the market. In fact, according to the “Information Generating Hypothesis”, long-term relationships are privileged relationships that allow banks to have information on their customers, which helps to reduceinformation asymmetry(Hauswald and Marquez, 2006;Koetter et al., 2008;Marquez, 2002). In a context where banking products are close substitutes, and in the presence of strong competition, banks are more inclined to fatten their asset portfolio at the expense of quality. In doing so, banks facilitate the cavalier behavior of clients who easily move from one institution to another, thus undermining the ability of banks to have better market knowledge and thus better efficiency. So, the main advantage of the Boone indicator is that it can capture market dynamics, be easily implemented for a limited number of observations and avoids some major theoretical drawbacks of price-cost margin measures (Griffith et al., 2005;Boone, 2008;Boone et al., 2013). Moreover, previous works has focused on relatively small sample sizes and a relatively short time horizon: 93 banks over a 2002–2007 period forLeon (2012), 49 banks over a 2003–2014 period forNdiaye (2018), and 63 banks over a 2004–2016 period forEggoh et al. (2021). Without questioning the representativeness of these data, it can be noted that between and after these different periods many events occurred (seetable 7in annex) such as the adoption of a new regulatory framework (Basel III) in June 2016 and its application from January 2018. To address these shortcomings, we use, likeMoyo (2018), Lerner index and Boone's index (Boone, 2008) for bank competition, and use data with a larger size (141 banks) and a longer time horizon (20 years).Finally, it can be noted that the institutional environment of most WAEMU countries has been characterized by a high level of corruption in the management of public funds and political instability linked to poor governance (Abdoulaye, 2016;Gyimah-Brempong, 2002). According to the literature, political stability and control of corruption could reduce adverse selection and moral hazard of borrowers, improve loan conditions and thereforeloan repayment(Bae and Goyal, 2009;Schiantarelli et al., 2016). ForCohen et al. (1983)andHo and Michaely (1988), a good institutional environment is very important to reduce problems related to information asymmetry. Moreover, it reduces problems related to the transaction costs (Jude and Levieuge, 2015). This issue directly affects credit activities. The reason is that asymmetric information problem often presented as a major obstacle in channeling funds from savers to borrowers (Neyer, 2004;Miller, 2015). Compared with the reduction impacts of institutional quality on asymmetric information and transaction cost,Nguyen et al. (2018)found that better institutional quality induces higher credit level in the banking system in emerging economies from 2002 to 2013. In this context of low asymmetric information and transaction cost, commercial banks will be less likely to supply loans to poor credit-worthiness borrowers and borrowers will also less likely to be involved in risky projects (Canh et al., 2021), what should have a positive impact on the bank efficiency. This shows that the institutional envronment is one of the key factors that drive the relationship between bank competition and efficiency.To do so, we use the one-step procedure and the 2sls-IV to take into account the heterogeneity of the banking system and endogeneity biases, a Tobit to take into account the censoring of the dependent variable, and finally the GMM in system to test the robustness of the results. Using data from 141 banks, over a 20 years’ period from 2000 to 2019, from the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), World Development Indicators (WDI) and Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) databases, the results show that competition reduces the efficiency of banks in the WAEMU. However, above a certain threshold, competition has a positive effect on efficiency. In addition, the results reveal that the fact that banks belong to multinationals or banking groups, while negatively affecting efficiency, attenuates the negative effect of competition on banking efficiency. Furthermore, a lower quality of institutional framework, while reducing bank efficiency, contributes to the negative effect of competition on banking efficiency in the WAEMU.The rest of the paper is structured as follows: the literature review is presented in Section2, followed by the methodological framework of the analysis in Section3. Finally, the results are presented in Section4.",Richard,N'Yilimon,Segnon,Mawuli,None,International Economics,"Volume 175, October 2023, Pages 45-62",0
"1. IntroductionThe digital transformation is at the top of the EU's political agenda. In March 2021, the European Commission presented a ‘Digital Compass’ designed to guide Europe through its digital transformation (European Commission, 2021). This initiative focuses on the digital transformation of companies as well as on digital skills, infrastructures and public services. Budgetary support for the digital transformation comes from theEUR800bn Recovery and Resilience Facility, the centrepiece of the NextGenerationEU plan,1in which at least 20% of the funds are dedicated to the digital transition. This interest in the digital transformation reflects the belief that digitalisation is the foundation for technological leadership and international competitiveness as reflected in export performances.This paper relates directly to the topic of digital transformation and approaches it from a theoretical perspective. More precisely, it makes use of endowments-based comparative advantage, one of the main concepts of trade theory. According to the Heckscher-Ohlin model, factor endowments determine countries’ comparative advantage and, hence, global trade patterns. A country is considered to hold comparative advantage in (and hence exports) goods that makes intensive use of the factor that it is abundantly endowed with. In this context, it is important to distinguish between two concepts of factor abundance. First, a country is considered to be abundant in a specific factorfif its share of that factor in the global endowment exceeds its share in global GDP (Treﬂer, 1995;Feenstra, 2003). This factor-specific or absolute notion of factor abundance is important for testing the predictions of the Heckscher-Ohlin model. Second, there is the concept of relative factor abundance. A country is abundant in factorfrelative to another factorf′, if its endowment of factorfrelative to the world is higher than the corresponding ratio of factorf′(Leamer, 1980). This relative notion of factor abundance implies that, if a country is ICT capital intensive relative to non-ICT capital, its ratio of ICT capital to non-ICT capital in production should exceed the same ratio in consumption.Modern formulations of the Heckscher-Ohlin model take account of differences in technology across countries. The construction of international input-output data gave a boost to empirical work on the Heckscher-Ohlin theory, in particular in its so-called ‘factor content’ version. The factor content version of the Heckscher-Ohlin model, developed byVanek (1968), stipulates that countries which are abundant in a specific factor will also be a net exporter of that factor. In other words, its production vector is more capital-intensive than its consumption vector. The availability of international input-output data revived the empirical work on the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek (HOV) theorem, because it allows for differences in technologies across countries2and for the existence of trade in intermediates. These two features make it possible to calculate the factor contents of trade in a theory-consistent manner (Trefler and Zhu,2010. The structure of factor content predictions).Accounting for differences in technology either via country- and industry-specific primary input requirements (Hakura, 2001;Stehrer, 2014; Trefler and Zhu, . The structure of factor content predictions) or via country- and industry-specific factor productivities (Treﬂer, 1995) greatly improves the fit of the HOV theorem.3Moreover, the availability of new and more disaggregated data on capital stocks as well as a unique Italian database on the skill and tasks composition of occupations allows us to subdivide each of the traditional factor employed in the Heckscher-Ohlin framework – labour and capital – into two components. Labour is split into digital labour services (‘digital tasks’) and non-digital labour services (‘non-digital tasks’), while capital is split into ICT capital and non-ICT capital. While it is acknowledged that the HOV theorem and its empirical test rest upon strict assumptions – notably full employment, homothetic preferences and the absence of trade costs – it is the natural starting point to analyse cross-country differences in the availability of factor of production and their implications for trade patterns.For capital stocks, this kind of disaggregation of the factor endowment is straightforward. With respect to the disaggregation of labour by occupations, however, some additional considerations are in order. Prima facie, the former may be interpreted as a mirror of demand rather than of labour-supply composition.4If this is the case, this type of data risk being an inappropriate test bed to assess cross-country heterogeneities in terms of (labour) factor endowments. On the other hand, occupation-level data provide a unique picture of the workforce’ structural characteristics. From a labour input point of view, such characteristics - including their skill endowment and the tasks that workers can perform – are key to explain workers' productivity and, hence, firm, sector and country-level performances. In other words, what occupation-level data provide is a rather solid proxy of the labour input's structural characteristics (Cetrulo et al., 2020) – here differentiated by their digital and non-digital task content. By the same token, competences as well as workers' ability to perform specific tasks are the result of a path-dependent process affected by occupation-specific idiosyncratic characteristics (Fernández-Macías and Hurley, 2017). This lends additional support to occupation-level data as an appropriate base to quantitatively assess the structural composition of labour supply, as well as its implications for the performance of industries and economies.A fundamental critique to factor endowment-based comparative advantage approach comes from the camp of economists who argues thatinternational trade patternsare shaped mainly by ‘absolute advantages’ resulting from technological leadership and learning activities (e.g.Dosi et al., 1990). We sympathise with this view but would argue that there is not so much a contradiction but a complementarity in comparative and absolute advantage determining trade.5Moreover, the fact that the I–O methodologies also allow taking into account differences in technology heightens the relevance of the HOV approach. In line with existing results in the literature for more aggregate labour and capital services, we find that these factor endowments matter for trade patterns, such that countries abundantly endowed with, for example, ICT capita, are also net exporters of that factor.We underpin our findings of the relevance of the factor endowments studied with a gravity model that features industry level factor intensities and factor endowments followingChor (2010)andIto et al. (2017). While not fully comparable with the HOV approach, the results from the gravity estimations suggest that factor endowments and factor intensities affect trade patterns. More precisely, what we can deduct from the gravity model, is that, on average, a higher ratio of digital tasks to non-digital tasks and a higher ratio of ICT capital to non-ICT capital has a positive effect on exports, irrespective of the export measure considered.The paper's contribution to the literature is threefold. First, it provides new empirical evidence on the endowments of EU member states with digital tasks and ICT capital as well as the factor-based trade patterns, better known as themeasuredfactor content of trade (FCT). Second, it tests the fit of the HOV theorem for the digital and ICT endowments using the tools developed in the literature for a complete test of the HOV theorem, including a sign test and a rank. These tests are indicative of the explanatory power of the factor endowments under consideration for determining trade patterns. Owing to data limitations, all analyses are performed for a sample of 25 EU countries, so what is captured are intra-EU trade patterns. Third, the HOV analysis is supplement with endowment-augmented gravity estimations (Chor, 2010) which confirm the relevance of digital tasks and ICT capital for shaping trade patterns. In this respect, we go beyond the analysis of gross exports and value added exports (VAX) also using the factor content of exports (for both labour and capital services) as dependent variables.The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section2presents the methodology employed to calculate the measured FCT and to test the predictions of the HOV theorem, followed by an overview of the various data sources in Section3. Section4presents and discusses the results for both the HOV analysis and the gravity model.

"1. IntroductionForeign direct investment (FDI) has long been acknowledged as a conduit of knowledge transfer fromMultinational Enterprises(MNEs) to local firms (Gorg and Strobl, 2001).2The advanced managerial expertise and technological know-how of MNEs are sources of knowledgespilloversthat benefit domestic buyers and suppliers. Knowledge spillovers from MNEs are diffused in the recipient economy either within the same sector (intra-sector spillovers) or through customer–supplier relationships between MNEs and domestic producers (inter-industry spillovers) (Javorcik, 2004;Newman et al., 2015). Two facts are highlighted in this voluminous literature3: domestic firms improve productivity by supplying inputs to MNEs, and second, the capacity to absorb FDI-related knowledge differs substantially among local firms (Rojec and Knell, 2018). In the current literature, the various characteristics determining a domestic firm’s absorption capacity have not been thoroughly conceptualized and empirically tested. Currently, the focus is primarily on the level of human capital (Narula and Marin, 2003;Damijan et al., 2013;Demena and van Bergeijk, 2017) and innovation activity (i.e., in the form of R&D) of domestic firms (Castillo et al., 2012;Rojec and Knell, 2018). Despite the importance of these factors in enhancing the absorptive capacity of local firms, the effective integration of external knowledge in developing countries is also influenced by other structural factors, such as the gender distribution of ownership, that the existing literature overlooks.Given the increasing role of female entrepreneurship in the developing world4and the large amount of FDI flows directed to these geographical regions,5it makes imperative to incorporate the role of gender differences in understanding the evolution of productivity and innovation as well as the potential to absorb gains from FDI spillovers. In this paper, we examine whether the gender status of ownership at local firms in 32 emerging countries has an effect first, on productivity and various innovation characteristics and second, on the ability of a local firm to capture productivity gains from supply and purchase linkages with MNEs.On themacroeconomiclevel, the increased participation of women in the labor market has produced numerous positive welfare effects such as higher returns for female employment and faster accumulation of human capital (Knowles et al., 2002;Galor and Weil, 1996). These factors have contributed to growth in countries with historically high rates of unofficial female employment (Seguino, 2000;Fang et al., 2019). Active female participation in the labour market also results in lowerfertility ratesand better quality childcare, which in turn improves educational prospects and human capital for future generations (Galor and Weil, 2000;Galor, 2005).The performance and absorption of FDI spillovers in local firms by gender highlight aspects of female entrepreneurship. Even though the common trend indicates that the number of successful female entrepreneurs is growing, female-owned firms are lagging on several fronts (Amoroso and Audretsch, 2020). We identify four key aspects that potentially cause a productivity handicap in female-owned firms: (a) access tofinance; (b) response to competition; (c) network development; (d) work flexibility. These factors are related to domestic firms’ ability to facilitate the transfer of knowledge that is developed elsewhere. We expect that even though productivity laggard firms in the FDI host country are likely to benefit more from the advanced technological know-how of MNEs, effective absorption of external knowledge requires a certain level of technical expertise in the recipient firm to ensure a successful transfer.The ultimate goal of the present paper is to investigate whether underlying gender differentials in terms of performance are associated with a productivity penalty for female-owned domestic firms, which in turn drives their ability to capture gains from FDI supply–purchase spillovers. Methodologically, the paper is developed as follows: we first search for systematic differences in productivity and knowledge-creation activities based on the gender ownership status of domestic firms. We then assess the impact of supply–purchase spillovers from MNEs on the productivity of domestic firms controlling for the gender of the ownership. We follow the recent trend of literature (Alfaro-Urena et al., 2022) by constructing firm-specific supply–purchase linkages between local firms and MNEs contrary to previous sectoral-level approaches (Barrios et al., 2011;Mei, 2021).6Our approach allows us to identify not only gender differences in productivity but also how these productivity differentials affect the ability of domestic firms to facilitate foreign knowledge spillovers. Since women-owned MNEs may also share some characteristics with domestic small firms (i.e. lower working flexibility and limited ability to develop networks), which may hinder technology transfer and knowledge externalities from MNEs to local firms through input linkages, we further explore whether productivity gains from FDI is driven by the gender status in the ownership of MNEs. For robustness, we control for selectivity bias, which can be impacted by the tendency of female business owners to take over small and service-oriented companies due to limited access to external funding and political power.The paper includes two main contributions: first, it provides an extensive and systematic analysis of the relationship between gender diversification in ownership and firm characteristics, the first of its kind in the emerging world, and second, it evaluates empirically how gender differences impact FDI productivity gains. Our main findings show that female-owned domestic firms (in 32 emerging countries) are 7.2–16.7% less productive, 2.3–3.6% less likely to participate in R&D activities, 0.6–2.6% less likely to obtain international recognition, and 3.9–4.5% less likely to involve into product innovation and quality upgrading. Second, supplying inputs to MNEs generates productivity gains and promotes all innovation aspects of domestic firms, these beneficial effects vanish in female-owned domestic firms. Purchasing inputs from MNEs does not improve the productivity of domestic firms (regardless of gender ownership), which might represent a gender penalty for female-owned MNEs. Overall, our findings suggest that the diversification of gender in firm ownership is crucial in understanding the evolution of productivity in the emerging world.The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section2formulates hypotheses for gender ownership and firm performance. Section3describes the data, compares firm performance based on gender and defines the supply–purchase linkages. Section4showseconometricresults from measuring the gender premium (or penalty) on productivity and innovation as well as estimates the effects of FDI linkages and their interaction with the gender status on TFP of domestic firms.

"1. IntroductionTheglobal value chain(GVC) brings opportunities for developing and emerging nations to be involved in international production networks by specializing in one or several stages of production. State members can enjoy the benefits from the technology and know-how diffusion derived from multinational corporations, which are transmitted to local firms (Gereffi, 1999). Nevertheless, these benefits have not been distributed evenly across nations due to the existence of barriers to international operation, such as cultural dissimilarities (Doetzer, 2020). Hence, it calls for a thorough study on the nexus between cultural distance and GVC linkages.Cultural affinity can affect GVC involvement in a number of aspects. First, in the literature on global sourcing,Kukharskyy (2016)investigated the role of long-term orientation headquarters' and suppliers' managers on the increasing prevalence of vertical integration. Similarly,Gorodnichenko et al. (2018)documented an adverse impact of cultural distance on the relative attractiveness of integration. Regarding the role of culture in international transactions, several studies indicated a negative relationship between (various measures of) cultural distance and bilateral trade or foreign direct investment (Felbermayr and Toubal, 2010;Guiso et al., 2009). Second, the globalization of supply chains leads to an increase in the complexity and need for information visibility (Busse et al., 2017). The visibility of the supply chain refers to the internal and external distribution of vital information along the chain (Barratt and Oke, 2007) and nurtures resilient connections between GVC members (Spekman et al., 1998). GVC visibility is based on various cultural entities, affecting the entire supply chain. The cultural distance among manufacturers and suppliers generate barrier for global operations (Klassen and Whybark, 1994), reducing profits for related members, limiting trust, and triggering negotiation conflict (Ribbink and Grimm, 2014). Overcoming these challenges requires firms to understand and approach divergent cultures differently (Cannon et al., 2010) and adapt to the other partners’ cultural traits (Jia and Rutherford, 2010).Recent literature has revisited the dimensions of cultural proximity, specifically its symmetric and time-invariant properties that are proxied by using common language or similar genetic traits (Shenkar, 2001;Disdier et al., 2010;Felbermayr and Toubal, 2010). An extension of this is using bilateral trust, an asymmetric cultural measure in the sense that one can trust the other without being trusted, and vice versa. Hence, this variable can change over time and has essential implications for bilateral economic flows (Guiso et al., 2009). In this paper, we focus on the asymmetric and time-varying dimension of cultural proximity that refers to the appreciation of people in a nation as well as for the culture of people in trading partner nations. While the effects of culture on trade have been examined considerably, we solve the question of how asymmetric and time-varying dimensions of cultural proximity, such as bilateral trust or preferences towards cultural systems, affect GVC involvement. We followFiorini et al. (2021)andLanati and Venturini (2021)to use bilateral cultural trade flow as a proxy for asymmetric and time-varying dimensions of cultural proximity. While the current literature only focuses on the effects of cultural affinity on trade, FDI, and immigration, there exists no study investigating the asymmetric effect of both directions of cultural preferences on GVC participation to the best of our knowledge.Fig. 1shows how GVC participation is measured in a three-country setting. This figure is practical for understanding how cultural proximity affects GVC participation while simultaneously founding the background for our empirical study. As argued byKoopman et al. (2010), GVC participation could be defined as the source of the value-added embedded in exports, looking both backward and forward from the vision of a reference country (countryi). Backward participation is the value-added of countryj, embedded in exports from countryito countryj; forward participation is the value-added of countryi, which is contained in intermediate products that will be used to produce goods by countryjto export to the rest of the world (ROW). In this setting, cultural proximity can enhance GVC participation by reducing sourcing costs of manufacturers or triggering supplier switching in order to cope withlocal content requirementsunder RTA formation.Download :Download high-res image (291KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. The value-added components of gross exports and GVC trade flows.To employ the analysis, we extract data on bilateral cross-border trade in CGs from the BACI with UNCTAD classification as proxies for cultural proximity, while information on GVC participation is obtained from theOECDTiVA 2021 (Martins Guilhoto et al., 2022). Using an international sample of 54 countries between 1996 and 2018, we estimate a modified standard gravity equation of GVC trade by using Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood (PPML). The number of bilateral exports of cultural goods (CGs) captures some form of similarity towards the destination's (exporter's) culture for the inhabitants in the nation of origin (importer). This proxy for cultural proximity (CP) is incorporated into a gravity model of GVC which enables CP to change over years. In theory, we expect that positive changes in CP, which are captured by a higher value of exports of CGs, result in an increase in GVC participation by lowering asymmetric bilateral trade costs andinformation asymmetry.Our baseline results verify the importance of our extended definition of CP for GVC participation. As for the relative role of each dimension of the asymmetric element of CP, our findings reveal that stronger preferences for the culture of other countries improve both forward and backward linkages of that country. The impacts of cultural proximity are transferred via the channels of cost reductions and local content requirements. The results hold across a number of model specifications, including the addition of a full set of fixed effects as well as the instrumentation of cultural trade. These effects become particularly strong for geographically diverse country pairs and hold for an alternative measure of cultural goods classification.The main contribution of this paper is to point out that CP is one of the driving force of GVC participation and the impacts of CP are time-varying and asymmetric. Our contribution is pivotal as we disclose, with evidence that CP – which is captured by cultural exports/imports – may influence professional decisions of manufacturers to source from a specific country by reducing sourcing costs and relaxing local content requirements.The rest of the paper proceeds as follows.

"1. IntroductionSince the spread of the coronavirus at the beginning of 2020 or the break out of the war in Ukraine in February 2022, countries worldwide have taken drastic measures in response to these global shocks, many of these measures being very costly. Fiscal policies to address the pandemics or the consequences of the war include various instruments and programs. While the size and composition of fiscal support have varied across countries, often reflecting the countries’ available fiscal space, public deficit, and debt levels have increased considerably.Thus, sovereign debt and more generally public finance concerns are again at the forefront of the policy debate due to the huge borrowing level of many governments in reaction to recent global shocks. The eurozone government debt might continue to surge on the covid-19 pandemics (Katsanidou et al., 2022) and the consequences of the war in Ukraine. This raises again the risk of a sovereign crisis and underlines the divergences existing across European countries when exposed to shocks. This brings us back to the European sovereign debt crisis ten years ago and its causes. Hence, we will re-examine its origins by putting a particular focus on the link between public finance and external imbalances conditional to the heterogeneity of institutions across EU member states, with the objective to reach conclusions that could further be useful to the analysis of current shocks.A central issue in understanding the European sovereign debt crisis (2009–2012) is related to the accumulation of current account imbalances during the years running up to 2007 (Brunnermeier and Reis, 2019). The excessive scale of current account deficits in the so-called periphery during the pre-crisis period has contributed to the severity of the economic contraction and damagedbankingsystems and sovereign creditworthiness (seeLane and Milesi-Ferretti (2012), amongst others). High savings in the so-called core countries (like France and Germany) flowed to the so-called periphery countries (like Portugal, Italy, Spain, and Greece). In the periphery, thesecapital inflowsmight have been misallocated between and within sectors (Brunnermeier and Reis, 2019). Non-tradable sectors, particularly the construction sector, were favored by the financial inflows, at the detriment of the tradable sectors which were subject to more competition (Brunnermeier and Reis, 2019). This resulted in a loss of competitiveness of the periphery and the deterioration of its trade balance and, hence of its current account balance.1This situation yielded external imbalances within Europe: on the one hand, current account surpluses in the core and, on the other hand, current account deficits in the periphery that were financed mostly by the core. As a whole, the euro area neither saved nor borrowed, but within it, huge amounts of capital were sent from the core to the periphery (Brunnermeier and Reis, 2019). From the beginning of 2000 to the end of 2007, Germany and France ran a cumulative current account surplus of 638 billion €; Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain had a cumulative current account deficit of 668 billion €, as shown by Eurostat.The flow of capital across countries was intermediated by financial markets and institutions. A certain lack of financial regulation triggered risky financial transactions by banks (Brunnermeier and Reis, 2019). Many banks operated in the “shadow” by raising short-term funds that were used to buy long-term assets. This caused a liquidity crisis that was at the origin of a banking and financial crisis. It is worth underlying that banks’ activities and public debt are intrinsically linked. The strong relationship between banks and national governments led to a concentration of national bonds held by banks and also to government guarantees to banks. This is referred to as a “diabolic loop” (Brunnermeier et al., 2011) or a “deadly embrace” (Farhi and Tirole, 2018). In this context, banking crises trigger large fiscal costs related for example to bailing out the banks or collecting fewertaxes. As the boom turned into a bust, governments lost theirtax baseand had to assume private debt, thus generating a debt crisis (Brunnermeier and Reis, 2019). Moreover, the fiscal governance issue in Europe has been at the center of the debate during the debt crisis, particularly in the countries hit by the crisis.The occurrence of the debt crisis in Europe foreshadows also a governance problem not only at the banking and financial sector level but also at the public sector level. In this paper, we shed light on the role played by governance in mitigating the fiscal effects of external account imbalances within Europe.We analyze how the fiscal outcomes associated to the current account imbalances within Europe were differentiated. We hypothesize that the effects of current account on fiscal balances and debt within the Europe Union are nonlinear and that the non-linearity is modulated by the quality of governance. To test our hypothesis, we use data on 28 European Union countries from 2000 to 2019, apply the Panel Smooth Transition Regression (PSTR) model developed byGonzález et al. (2005)and proxy governance by measures ofcorruption. After performing the nonlinearity tests, we find evidence of a nonlinear relationship between current account balance and fiscal variables (primary fiscal balance and debt). We then estimate the model using the Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS).Our results suggest the presence of a nonlinear relationship between current account imbalances and fiscal outcomes. On the one hand, in countries with high corruption, a deterioration of the current account balance can be associated to a worsening of fiscal balance and an increase of debt (respectively, improved current account balances are linked to better fiscal balance and a reduction of debt). On the other hand, we find a negative elasticity of fiscal balance to current account balance when corruption is low (high index). This suggests that for countries with low corruption, a deteriorated current account balance is associated to improvements in fiscal balance and a reduction of debt (respectively, improvements of the current account go hand in hand with a deterioration of fiscal balance and an increase of debt). These findings indeed show that the fiscal outcomes associated to the current account can be mitigated among European nations by governance quality.The rest of the paper is structured as follows.

"1. IntroductionAmong the crucial implications of the current globalization wave is the remarkable increase in return and volatilityspilloversacross the global financial markets. Whereas a sizable literature emerged with convincing evidence of increase in the synchronization of traditional equity indexes across the global financial markets, after the equity market collapsed in 2000,Gorton and Rouwenhorst (2006)andErb and Harvey (2006)discovered negative correlations between global equity indexes and major commodity markets such as gold and energy. The aftermath of this was an increase in billions of institutional investment in this new asset class. However, the global financial crisis of 2007/2009 is believed to have counteracted the presumably uncorrelated financial markets and has therefore stressed the relevance of portfolio diversification (Le et al., 2021a). Following this, the degree of global financial market integration as well as the simultaneity of business cycles has become a crucial factor that investors and portfolio managers consider in predicting market turbulence and risk spillovers.The phrase “financial technology” which is more generally referred to as “FinTech”, relates to the adoption of new technologies in the provision offinancial services, which has now revolutionized the financialindustryin recent years.Le et al. (2021a)note that FinTech are firms or representatives of companies whose business model relates to the integration of modern, innovative technologies in the provision of financial services, mainly through internet-based and application-oriented financial products. Although the financial industry has witnessed a significant influence from the application of technology, the traditional scope of FinTech relates to attempts to disrupt and create significant competition among the incumbents through the introduction of new products and services that are more easy-to-use, efficient, clearer, and automated. Beyond the conventionalbankingservices and products, FinTech also encloses firms that are involved in the provision of technology, such as software solutions, insurance distribution and other third-party services. More so, in addition to offering these banking products and services, there are FinTechs that distribute insurance and other financial instruments as well as those that provide third-party services.Given the similarities in businesses as well as market segments, the more efficient and customer-oriented products and services offered by FinTech corporations are believed to have not only significantly disrupted the traditionalfinancial system, but have also attracted enormous inflow of investments from both the public and from traditionalfinancial institutions(seeYao et al., 2018,Le et al., 2021a). For instance,Accenture (2016)reported that in 2015, the FinTech industry attracted $12.2 billion in investment while KPMG’sFintechPulse report stated that global FinTech investment rose from $50.8 billion in 2017 to $111.8 billion in 2018 and from $87 billion in the first quarter of 2020 to $98 billion in first quarter of 2021 with Fintech deal volume hitting a new record of 2456 (KPMG, 2018,KPMG, 2021). Most of the huge inflows of capital into the FinTech industry is mainly through mergers and acquisitions by large traditional financial institutions as well as technology providers. For instance, in 2019 alone, Fidelity National Information Services which provides technology solutions to the financial services sector acquired a leading global payment processor, WorldPay for $43 billion (Ashta and Herrmann, 2021). With this continuous inflow of capital into the FinTech industry, FinTech has culminated into a new financial asset with unique features that set it apart from the conventional financial banking institutions and has made the interactions as well as diversification potentials between them and other financial assets worth analyzing.Similar to FinTech, green assets, as distinguished from traditional financial assets, is also an emerging financial asset with great potentials over non-green peers in the financial markets (Chakrabarti and Sen, 2021). Descriptively, it comprises “financial investments flowing into sustainable development projects and initiatives, environmental products, and policies that encourage the development of a more sustainable economy” (Lindenberg, 2014, p.1). As noted in previous studies, green financial instruments such as green bonds and climate-themed financial indexes have developed into a popular financial instrument in recent years, largely because they respond to the need for environmental protection while offering financial rewards (Huynh et al., 2020,Naeem et al., 2021). Indeed, greenfinanceare crucial financial instruments with the potential to release the required financial resources for climate transition (Liu et al., 2022a,Chatziantoniou et al., 2022).Hung (2021a)argues that transitioning towards a low-carbon economy depends mainly on the availability and exploitation of appropriate financial instruments that have the potential of mobilizing significant long-term financial resources. In particular, green bonds are distinctive, sustainability-oriented fixed-income financial instruments, whose proceeds are directed towards the financing or re-financing of green projects to help transition towards a low-carbon economy and ultimately, a net-zero emission. In this regard,Sartzetakis (2021)argues that following the urgent call to fight climate change, green finance has been considered as the main instrument of choice to finance climate change mitigation. For instance,Azhgaliyeva et al. (2020)report that the green bond market has grown rapidly from about $3.4 billion in 2012 to $156 billion in 2017 and is increasingly acting as a crucial bridge between capital providers and sustainable assets. Also,Climate Bonds Initiative (2020)shows that total green bond issuance rose to US258.9 billion in 2019, representing a 51% growth on 2018.Moreover, it has been emphasized that green finance models have evolved to embrace and become of growing importance to emerging FinTech models in sustainable projects, renewable energy,carbon creditsand the fight against climate change (Croutzet and Dabbous, 2021,Akomea-Frimpong et al., 2022). The conventional view is that the emergence of FinTech could fast-track the global transition to a low carbon future as they are accelerating the uptake of green financial instruments as well as the flow of capital to a more sustainable economy technology. Indeed, copious anecdotal evidence across different countries on the application of FinTech to mobilize finance for sustainable economy technology abounds in the literature (seeNassiry, 2018). Akin to this, an increasing number of studies have made concerted efforts at conceptualizing the linkages between FinTech and green finance. For instance,Dorfleitner and Braun (2019)argue that Fintech has the potential to mobilize significant green finance because FinTechs aim at facilitating access to novel sources of capital and investment while other studies argue that the role of FinTech is crucial to accelerate green financing through the combination of big data and artificial intelligence to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy (seeWang et al., 2021,Liu et al., 2022b) and the use of bigdata analyticsto promote green transition among consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises. Moreover,Schletz et al. (2020)posit that although interventions aimed at improving the level of energy efficiency appear to be slower mainly because of some market barriers, FinTech in the form of Blockchain technology has the potential of strengthening such interventions by modifying the existing as well as future energy systems designs. In this regard,Liu et al. (2022b)argue that given the potential of green financial instruments in augmenting capital and investment to ensure climate transition and that FinTech facilitates access to energy finance, both FinTech and green financing can jointly contribute towards energy efficiency and the transition to a low-carbon economy.Given the linkages between FinTech and green financial instruments as well as their distinctive features, these financial assets are attracting increasing interest from investors and portfolio managers around the world as an emerging alternative investment instruments as well as potential venue for diversification benefits. Along this line, a recent study byLe et al. (2021a)analyzed the diversification potentials of FinTech and green finance, paying particular attention to green bonds. Using bothDiebold and Yilmaz (2012)andBaruník et al. (2017)volatility spillover approaches, they document that short-term connectedness is high among these assets and that FinTech may not be a good hedging instrument in a portfolio consisting of these assets. In this paper, we extend this study by examining the dependence, co-movement and connectedness between FinTech and different green financial assets across different time scales and market conditions. In particular, this study analyzes the time and frequency specific dependence, co-movement as well as spillovers between FinTech and nine green financial assets. To our best knowledge, this is the first study to offer a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic dependence and connectedness between FinTech, green bonds and climate-themed financial assets while taking into consideration, different market conditions including the normal, bearish and bullish markets.The analysis of dynamic dependence, co-movement as well as connectedness among FinTech and green finance across different market conditions is important for investors in terms of designing strategies they can use in creating portfolios consisting of these financial assets. For policy-markers, the need to explore alternative deployment of finance to support climate change implies that relevant authorities should pay attention to the role of FinTech corporations in promoting ecologically sustainable projects. Indeed, both FinTech and green assets are related in terms of their many common features. For instance, FinTech promotes environmental sustainability because it makes financial companies become more sustainable through thepromotionof green finance. In this regard,Cen and He (2018)note that FinTech facilitates both green finance and sustainable development, which has redesigned the delivery of financial services and the ways of pricing. Thus, FinTech offers green financing solutions and has itself been described as green. These support occurs in several streams, which includes the promotion of green finance, cost reductions andinformation asymmetries, promoting efficiency, valuing nature’s assets and the provision of practical sustainable lifestyles.This paper contributes to the literature in at least four main fronts. First, it provides new evidence on the interaction between FinTech and green assets by examining the bivariate time and frequency domain co-movement between FinTech and green financial assets using wavelets coherency analysis. Second, within the waveletseconometricframework, we offer evidence of lead–lag dependence between FinTech and these financial instruments across different time and frequency scales to demonstrate whether FinTech can act as a hedge for green financial assets. Third, we analyze the degree of connectedness between FinTech, green bonds and the chosen clean energy stocks across different market conditions and investment horizons using the newly introduced Quantile-based Vector Auto-Regressive (QVAR) spillover model ofAndo et al. (2022). This enables us to shed light on level of risk spillovers among these assets under the normal, bearish as well as bullish market conditions and investment horizons such as short-term, medium- and long-term. Lastly, we provide the mean level of net pairwise directional spillover between FinTech and these financial assets across both investment horizons and market conditions. The analysis of the degree of connectedness between FinTech, green bonds and clean energy stocks has crucial implications in the identification of the direction of shocks transmission which may be a very helpful input in constructing portfolios consisting of these assets and for policy agents in the formulation of climate-friendly policies, especially in times of downturns. Hence, a closer investigation of the degree of shocks co-movement and spillovers between the stocks of FinTech corporations and those of related firms reveals key issues that demands research attention.The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section2provides a review of related literature while Section3gives a description of the data and the empirical strategy.

"1. IntroductionThe link between exchange rates and labour-market outcomes, which usually operates through institutional channels, is a classical topic inmacroeconomicsat least since aGoldstein (1974)'s study for the United Kingdom. Over the last fifty years, the literature has highlighted several factors that influence the impact of exchange rates on wages and employment. For sake of simplicity, these factors can be divided in two groups: those that mainly operate at an international level, i.e. among countries, and those that are more relevant at a national level, i.e. within a single country.The first group of factors includes, among others, the mobility of capital flows (Dornbusch, 1987;Djajić, 1988;Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2016), the integration of trade and financial markets (Reis, 2013) and the integration of labour markets (Mishra and Spilimbergo, 2011). The second group of factors includes, among others, the degree of financial development (Aghion et al., 2009), themonetary policyof the central bank (Cuciniello and Lambertini, 2016), the dynamics of labour productivity (Collins and Park, 1989), and the characteristics of the real economy with special reference to production sectors andindustries(Aizenman and Frenkel, 1988). Very often, of course, there is an interplay between national and international-level factors.In addition, within the second group of factors, the path that goes from exchange rates to wages and employment seems to be affected by specific characteristics of the domestic labour market. These may include the behaviour of unions (Andersen and Sørensen, 1988;Lawler, 2000;Wright and Bastos, 2012;Cuciniello and Lambertini, 2016), the degree of employment protection and wage rigidity (Sachs, 1980;Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2012;Galí and Monacelli, 2016), the intensity ofjob turnover(Goldberg and Tracy, 2001) and the geographical distribution of firms and workers, i.e. the so-called local labour markets (Burgess and Knetter, 1998;Goldberg and Tracy, 2000).Finally, and still within the second group of factors, some studies have underlined the role played by specific characteristics of domestic firms, such as their propensity to export (Araújo and Paz, 2014) or the existence of pay-protection schemes to insure the workers against product-market shocks (Alexandre et al., 2017).The number and the quality of the existing studies testify for the interest in the topic. One of the key results in the literature is that wages react more than employment to exchange-rate variations (Campa and Goldberg, 2001). This is one reason why this paper focuses on wages.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that studies the interaction between exchange-rate policy and wages, via institutions, by using a counterfactual approach with individual data. It adds to the existing research by providing new quasi-experimental evidence in macroeconomics (Fuchs-Schuendeln and Hassan, 2015). We implement a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimation with two nuances with respect to a more standard approach. First, on the lines ofJappelli and Pistaferri (2011), we exploit differences across units of two different countries, namely Italy and the United Kingdom, while a more standard macroeconomic quasi-experiment exploits differences across units of the same country. Second, we use data at individual level, while a more standard macroeconomic quasi-experiment relies on more aggregated data. In this specific respect, our approach is in line withAbdallah and Lastrapes (2012)who perform a macroeconomic quasi-experiment using household data, though they exploit differences across units of the same country, namely the United States.In particular, we study to what extent the fixed exchange-rate policy implemented in Italy between 1997 and 2000, by itself or in combination with the institutional setting, affected the growth rate ofreal wagesamong resident workers. To do this, we exploit a historical episode occurred in the 1990s.In September 1992, both Italy and the United Kingdom abandoned a fixed exchange-rate policy, adopting a flexible exchange-rate policy. However, in November 1996, Italy went back to a fixed exchange-rate policy, while the United Kingdom did not. This difference, which persisted over several years, is used in this paper to estimate the effect of the fixed exchange-rate policy adopted in Italy on the growth rate of real wages among resident workers, using the United Kingdom as a counterfactual.The choice of the counterfactual country is in line withJappelli and Pistaferri (2011)who also take the United Kingdom as a counterfactual for Italy, to study how the introduction of the euro affected the sensitivity of consumption with respect to income shocks in Italy.",Corrado,None,None,None,None,International Economics,"Volume 175, October 2023, Pages 158-170",0
