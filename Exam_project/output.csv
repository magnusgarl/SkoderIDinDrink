"1. IntroductionHow does the pace of learning – i.e. the gain in knowledge and skills associated with one year of schooling, oryearly learning gain– compare across countries? International assessments are designed to compare learning outcomes at a particular point in students’ school career, but they do not directly show how the learning gains made by students over comparable time intervals differ across countries. Some international assessments, such as the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), assess students who are in a particular grade level (typically, 4th and 8th grade); however, because of grade retention or grade skipping, in many countries students who are in the same grade level may have been exposed to different amounts of schooling. More generally, students start school with widely different knowledge and skills, meaning that differences in mean scores in these assessments cannot be readily interpreted as a measure of school productivity. TheProgramme for International Student Assessment(PISA), in contrast, assesses the learning of students at age 15, regardless of the grade level attended and the amount of schooling to which students have been exposed; its mean scores cannot indicate school productivity without strong assumptions.This article provides estimates of the yearly average learning gain in five jurisdictions that span a wide range of levelsof economic developmentacross three continents. Despite the large differences among these five school systems, the fact that results are expressed in terms of common metrics makes it possible to compare the relative effectiveness of learning systems around the age of 15 years, in three subjects (reading, mathematics and science).The results show that students’ yearly learning progress around the age of 15 varies from about one-tenth of astandard deviationin students’ test scores in Malaysia to about one-fourth of a standard deviation or more in Austria and Scotland (United Kingdom), with the estimates for Brazil and Singapore comprised in-between these extremes. These results indicate significant differences in the productivity of schooling: in mathematics, for example, our point estimates imply that students in Austria, Scotland and Singapore learn about twice as much or more than students in Brazil and Malaysia, over a 12-month period. Such wide differences suggest that skill and human capital differences between high- and middle-income countries will continue to increase, even beyond the age of 15, not only because of differences in educational attainment (quantity of schooling), but also (and perhaps mainly) because of differences in the quality of schooling.Results also show that in general, the average pace of learning of 15-year-olds does not differ significantly between boys and girls, or between advantaged students and disadvantaged students (defined by a median split on a variable measuring the social, economic and cultural status of students’ households). A significant difference in the yearly learning gain by subgroup is observed only in Scotland, where boys appear to make stronger progress than girls around the age of 15. This suggests that in all five countries, the wide socio-economic gaps observed at age 15, as well as the gaps in reading performance in favour of girls, largely reflect skill differences that appear at a younger age.Several articles, in the past, have tried to identify averagelearning progressionsfrom student assessment data, but only a few have done so in ways that allow to compare such progressions across countries. At first sight, the main obstacle in this endeavour is the fact that longitudinal data collections at international level are extremely rare. Only a few prior studies have embedded internationally linked assessments in longitudinal data collections (Nagy, Lüdtke, Köller, Heine, 2017,Prenzel, Baumert, Blum, Lehmann, Leutner, Neubrand, Pekrun, Rost, Schiefele, 2006,Singh, 2019).Singh (2019)highlights significant differences in productivity across developing countries, and shows that in primary grades, the effect of an extra year of schooling on test scores is substantially higher in Viet Nam than in Andra Pradesh (India), Ethiopia or Peru.1Prenzel et al. (2006)andNagy et al. (2017)provide estimates for 15-year-olds in Germany, based on the PISA test.2Despite its intuitive appeal, the identification of average learning gains from longitudinal data (i.e., from the aggregation of individual learning gains) faces two major challenges. A first challenge is to ensure that individual learning-gain estimates are not confounded by variations in students’ motivation or in other contingent factors that are unrelated to students’ learning. A second challenge, for the inference to a broader population of interest, is the possibility of selective attrition: due to school drop-out,absenteeism, grade repetition or for other reasons, the student population for which both baseline and follow-up test scores are available may differ in significant ways from the population of interest.In the absence of student-level panel data, some studies have aggregated cross-sectional data into pseudo-panels at the country-by-grade level to identify average grade progressions.3In particular,Jones et al. (2014)estimate cross-country differences in the pace of learning in primary grades for three African countries (Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda) from cross-sectional differences in mean scores across grades, based on tests whose results are reported on the same scale and which were administered to representative samples of children in these three countries. Because a one-grade difference does not always correspond to a difference of one year of schooling and age (in particular, due to grade retention), grade progressions are not necessarily a direct reflection of yearly learning gains. In addition, just like average differences in student-level test scores, differences in average test scores may also be plagued by selection effects, in particular due to drop out in higher grades.A more common approach to compare learning progressions (over time or across grade levels) in international assessment data has been the use of a regression-discontinuity estimator. We explore this approach in a companion paper (Avvisati and Givord, 2021). The typical estimator compares students born “just before” and “immediately after” the cut-off date for first-grade enrolment, in countries where the population assessed does not coincide with a single school-entry cohort. In contrast to prior studies that rely on this identification strategy (Anders, Jerrim, McCulloch, 2016,Kuzmina, Carnoy, 2016,Luyten, Peschar, Coe, 2008,Luyten, Veldkamp, 2011,Tiumeneva, Kuzmina, 2015), our companion paper suggests focusing on comparing, in PISA-participating countries, the eldest and the youngest students in terms of age (rather than in terms of school-entry age). Indeed, because at any given point in time, students’ age, their length of schooling, and their age at school entry are bound by a simple additive relationship, it is not possible to identify their distinct contribution to test scores in a cross-sectional design. While prior studies compared students of (almost) same age to focus on the joint effect of schooling and of school-entry age (sometimes claiming, for the interpretation of their results, that school-entryage effectsare negligible),4our companion paper compares students with the same school-entry age to focus on the joint effect of one year of schooling and of age; the latter corresponds to the quantity identified in the present study and in studies based on longitudinal, school-based data collections. Due to the limited sample size in survey datasets, however, cross-country comparisons of estimates based on a regression-discontinuity estimator are often imprecise.This study proposes an original identification strategy to estimate this joint effect of age and length of schooling on learning. We use the change, across different vintages of PISA, in the time of the year when the test was conducted. In PISA, the birth dates of eligible students depend on the testing date; and when the testing date changes, the month of birth of the eldest eligible students also changes. Thus, when grouping students by month of birth, two groups can be defined such that the change in testing date has opposite effects on their age and length of schooling at the time of the test: students born in certain months are assessed at a younger age and at an earlier point in their school career than would have been the case, had the testing date remained the same; in contrast, students born in the remaining months are assessed at an older age and at a later point in their school career. The change in testing date thus acts as an exogenous source of variation which allows for the identification of the full effect of a year of schooling and of age through a difference-in-difference estimator.",Francesco,Pauline,None
"1. IntroductionFamilies’ ability to outsource household production has been one of the driving factors behind women’s increased participation in the labor market (Goldin, 2006). It is also associated with beliefs in more equal gender roles.1Throughout Europe, the share of individuals who agree with statements such as “When a mother works for pay, the children suffer” and “A job is alright but what most women really want is a home and children” has decreased substantially since the European Values Study (EVS) first measured beliefs about gender roles in 1990. In less than thirty years, agreement with these statements dropped from 65% to 26% and 42%, respectively (seeFig. 1). Furthermore, more individuals tend to believe in equal gender roles in countries where enrolment rates inearly childhood educationand care services are higher (Fig. 2), and where the employment rates of mothers are higher (Fig. 3).Download :Download high-res image (222KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1.

The value of the Pearson correlation is 0.51 and is significant at the 5% level.The COVID-19 crisis reversed families’ ability to outsource household production, especially in the first months of the crisis. In early 2020, many governments implemented lockdown measures, which generally involved the closure of child-care facilities and schools. For many households, these lockdown measures led to an increase in household production constraints. Research conducted in France (Champeaux, Marchetta,Ducoudré, Périvier), Italy (Biroli et al., 2021,Del Boca, Oggero, Profeta, Rossi, 2020,Mangiavacchi, Piccoli, Pieroni, 2021), Spain (Farré et al., 2022), the United Kingdom (Golin,Hupkau, Petrongolo, 2020,Sevilla, Smith, 2020), and the United States (Biroli et al., 2021,Carlson et al., 2022) finds that lockdown measures significantly increased the constraints on households with young children, and that women took responsibility for the largest share of parental care, often by taking time off work (Albanesi, Kim, 2021,Alon, Coskun, Doepke, Koll, Tertilt, 2022,Alon, Doepke, Olmstead-Rumsey, Tertilt, 2020,Alon, Doepke, Olmstead-Rumsey, Tertilt, 2020).Did the reversal in families’ ability to outsource household production also lead to a reversal in beliefs about gender roles? Previous research has found that men and women tend to support more equal gender roles when household production constraints are removed (Pedulla and Thébaud, 2015). But what happens to men’s and women’s beliefs about gender roles when household production constraints are reinstated? In this paper, we study whether beliefs in gender equality are entrenched once acquired or whether they can be reversed.We study two channels through which the lockdown measures could have impacted beliefs about gender roles. The first channel relates to the increased time constraints that some households faced during lockdown. The lockdown measures were an exogenous shock on households’ ability to outsource household production, as well as on individuals’ ability to work. Depending on theindustryand occupation of partners, households differed in their availability for parental care: parents could be working from home, temporarily unemployed or still working outside the home if their employment was in a critical sector. If there is a relationship between the ability to outsource household production and individuals’ beliefs about gender roles, then individuals from the most time-constrained households—households with young children and where the partners were still working during lockdown—would be more likely to revert to traditional beliefs about gender roles.The second channel we explore relates to bargaining within couples over who should take care of the extra household production constraints during lockdown. Previous research has suggested that the work-related constraints of each partner are a determinant of who takes care of household production (Presser, 1994). According to the available time theory of householddivision of labor(Presser, 1994), the partner who is the least constrained by work is generally the one who spends the most time on household production. However, in households where both partners continued to work during lockdown, there was not always one partner who could “naturally” take care of the extra household production constraints.2If there is a relationship between bargaining over who takes care of household production and individuals’ beliefs about gender roles, then individuals from households where partners had to bargain—that is, households where both partners either worked from home or worked outside the home during lockdown—would be more likely to revert to traditional beliefs about gender roles. Indeed, beliefs in traditional gender roles can serve as a focal-point equilibrium in a noncooperativebargaining gamebetween partners (Lundberg, Pollak, 1993,Lundberg, Pollak, 1996).We study changes in beliefs about gender roles using data from a survey we designed during the first lockdown period in France. A survey institute collected data on a representative sample of 1000 individuals from the French working population. We measure beliefs about gender roles by asking respondents about their opinions on six statements from the EVS.3We examine changes in beliefs about gender roles by combining responses to our survey with the responses of individuals from the latest wave of the EVS for France.4We perform a Nearest-Neighbor Match on respondents’ observable characteristics from both surveys to estimate how the respondents to our survey would have likely responded before lockdown to the EVS questions about gender roles. We then use the predicted values to estimate changes in beliefs during lockdown.We find empirical evidence of a shift in beliefs towards traditional gender roles during the first lockdown period. This shift is concentrated among fathers of young children (12 years old or under). For instance, we find a significant increase in the percentage of men with young children who agree with the statement “A man’s job is to earn money; a woman’s job is to look after the home and family” (14.9 percentage point increase) and “All in all, family life suffers when the woman has a fulltime job” (14.1 p.p. increase). This result is consistent with a time-constraint channel, although only for men.We then focus our analysis on opposite-sex couples with young children living in the household. Our findings are consistent with the available time theory (Presser, 1994): when men were relatively more available at home than their female partner, they took responsibility for the largest share of the increase in household production.5When women were relatively more available at home than their male partner, they took responsibility for the largest share of the increase in household production. When both partners were equally available, they shared responsibility for the increase in household production. We find evidence that the shift in beliefs towards more traditional gender roles is concentrated among men from this third group. That is, we find that men were more likely to declare believing in traditional gender roles during lockdown when both partners were either working from home or still working outside the home. This result suggests that some men believe in less equal gender roles when a conflict may occur over who should take responsibility for household production. This result points to a role of gender norms in marital bargaining, as described in the seminal model byLundberg, Pollak, 1993,Lundberg, Pollak, 1996.Why might men be more likely than women to shift their beliefs towards traditional gender roles when household production constraints increase? Beliefs about equal gender roles may be guided by motivated reasoning (Epley and Gilovich, 2016). When public policies remove household production constraints, holding egalitarian beliefs is not costly for men. But when public policies reinstate household production constraints, holding egalitarian beliefs can become costly for men. Some men may then shift beliefs towards agreeing with more traditional gender roles to avoid taking more responsibility for household production. This interpretation is consistent with research showing that women have stronger preferences for equally sharing household production responsibilities when the couple has a young child (Auspurg et al., 2017). In previous research,Pedulla and Thébaud (2015)also found that women’s support for equal gender roles tends to be more elastic than men’s to the removal of household production constraints. Our results suggest that men’s beliefs in traditional gender roles are more elastic than women’s when household production constraints increase.Our results suggest that access to childcare relieves constraints on households and enables partners to hold egalitarian beliefs. In many European countries, this ability to outsource household production is related to household income. We discuss the relationship between household income and beliefs about gender roles, using cross-country data from the fifth wave of the EVS (pre-pandemic). We find that, throughout Europe, both men and women are more likely to believe in equal gender roles as they move up the income distribution. Our results from the lockdown period provide a potential explanation for the correlation that we find between household income and beliefs about gender roles: as income increases, households can outsource household production more easily, which could lead to more egalitarian beliefs. If so, egalitarian beliefs could be a type ofluxury good. However, our analysis does not rule-out an alternative explanation: women in more egalitarian households are more likely to work, which contributes to higher income in these households. We highlight the public policy implications of our findings: providing public services to outsource household production could lead to an increase in egalitarian beliefs in the population, and reduceincome inequalitiesacross households through increased femalelabor force participation.The paper is structured as follows.Section 2describes the data.Section 3provides descriptive evidence on beliefs about gender roles and household production constraints.Section 4presents the results of our estimates of changes in beliefs about gender roles during lockdown.Section 5discusses our results by studying the relationship between beliefs about gender roles and income.Section 6presents results of robustness checks.Section 7concludes.",Anne,Gloria,None
"1. IntroductionOver the past century, women’s labor force participation rates in high-income countries have increased substantially. This trend paralleled the adoption of many family friendly policies, among which paid maternity leave played a key role (Olivetti and Petrongolo, 2017). By the late 20th century, most high-income countries had adopted national mandates for paid maternity leave (Rossin-Slater, 2017). In contrast, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom introduced such mandates only at the dawn of the 21st century. In 2022, the United States remains the onlyOECDcountry without a federal provision for paid maternity leave, and even today paid maternity leave is not universally available to self-employed, domestic, part-time and casual workers in some other OECD countries.1Family leave policies aim to help parents of young children reconcile the demands of work and family. Considering their large costs to taxpayers and firms, a better understanding of how a short paid leave could support mothers to continue participating in the labor market is important. A rich literature documents the impact of these policies on female labor market outcomes, child outcomes, and fertility. However, most of these papers study the effects ofextensions in the durationof existing family policies,2and focus on labor market outcomes, while only a few study effects on fertility.3Therefore, we lack understanding of the value of paid maternity leave in the period right after birth, especially if the value of maternity leave varies substantially in the very early months of a child’s life. A too short leave right after birth may not help meet working parents’ needs, whereas a somewhat longer leave could be highly valuable, especially if the leave covers the period when finding alternative modes of care is very challenging.This paper studies the dynamic impact that introducing the first federal paid maternity leave had on women’s labor market outcomes around the birth of their first child and on their subsequent fertility in Switzerland. The mandate became effective from 1st July 2005 and provided 14 weeks of maternity leave benefits and job protection during pregnancy and the 16-week period following birth. Before the mandate was introduced, around 40% of employers already offered their female workforce access to paid maternity leave, but such leave was not universal and leave provisions differed enormously (seeGuillet et al., 2016andAeppli, 2012). The mandate aimed to provide a minimum level of paid maternity leave to all eligible women and thereby, reduceinequalitiesin coverage.Studying the Swiss mandate is interesting for several reasons. First, the total leave duration is short, and since there is no other parental leave mandate in Switzerland, the maternity leave mandate constitutes all such publicly provided leave.4However, the benefit level is fairly generous at 80% of previous earnings for most women. Most mandates in other European countries are longer and sometimes even more generous.5Second, the mandate was implemented in a context where about four out of ten firms already offered paid maternity leave. Thus, the mandate led to two different changes. Itintroduced a short, paid maternity leavein firms that did not offer this benefit, while itreduced costsfor firms and public administrations that already provided a similar benefit prior to the reform. Comparing the effects of the mandate across firms with and without prior leave, we provide evidence on these heterogeneous effects. Firms offering prior paid leave that is now superseded by a publicly-financed scheme could pass on their resulting cost-savings to their employees in the form ofsupport on the joborexpansion of family policiesover and above the mandated minimum, suggesting possible ”trickle-down effects”. Third, the Swiss labor market is characterized by high rates of part-time employment among mothers, indicating problems in reconciling the demands of work and family. We study complementarity of the maternity leave mandate with another family policy,early child care, by exploiting regional differences in the availability of early child care. Finally, the timing of the announcement of the new mandate and its implementation enable us to study both theanticipatory andtreatment effects.For our analysis, we compile a unique and rich dataset by linking several administrative registers. These include the social security register, which provides information on earnings andsocial security benefits, the vital statistics register, which provides information on life events, and the census. Our main population of interest are Swiss women who gave birth to their first child shortly before and after the mandate was introduced on 1st July 2005. We construct a dataset of women’s complete labor market and fertility histories at a monthly frequency starting from five years before birth to nine years after birth. Similar toLalive et al. (2013)andSchönberg and Ludsteck (2014), we employ a difference-in-differences approach where we compare the difference in outcomes of women who gave birth to their first child in the three months before and after the introduction of the mandate in 2005, with the difference in a control cohort of women who gave birth in the same three-month windows in the year prior to the reform. This identification strategy allows us to estimate the causal effects of being covered by the mandate around the time of birth of the first child. By including in our analysis pre-birth periods, we examine behavioral responses in anticipation of the mandate. We also investigate the heterogeneous effects of the mandate by the availability of early child care in the mother’s state (or canton) of residence at the time of birth of her first child and across firms with and without pre-mandate leave. As pre-mandate leave availability is not directly observed in the data, we identify firms with prior leave using information on the pre-mandate incidence of significant positive earnings immediately after birth when women are legally not allowed to work.Our empirical findings can be summarized as follows. First, our results reveal no or only small effects on most labor market outcomes. We do find increased job continuity with the pre-birth employer in the two to three years after birth but little or no effects on employment rates. In the long run, up to five years after birth, all labor market effects dissipate. Second, our estimates uncover sizeable anticipatory responses by women covered by the mandate at the intensive margin of labor supply. That is, the earnings of these women increase compared to the control group prior to the birth of their first child, reflecting a relative increase, or a smaller decrease, in the hours worked prior to birth. Third, we find a significant and persistent impact of the maternity leave mandate on subsequent fertility. An additional three out of 100 women exposed to the mandate gave birth to a second child in the long run, that is, in the nine years after the birth of their first child. Fourth, the mandate allows women to reconcile demands of work with those of family life: it raises the proportion of women who care for a young child while working a job with similar earnings as prior to birth.The effects of the mandate on fertility differs across regions with different levels of early child care availability. The mandate increases subsequent fertility in regions that offer above-median slots in early child care by four percentage points, but does not have a statistically significant impact in regions with below-median slots in early child care. This evidence suggests complementarity between the maternity leave mandate and the availability of early child care leading to the effect we see on subsequent fertility.Women who benefitted from paid maternity leave for the first time see improved labor market outcomes after returning from leave. Their employment rate increases slightly (albeit not statistically) between 18 to 30 months after the birth of their first child. Moreover, their monthly earnings after birth increase by almost 300Swiss francs. This corresponds to a 6% increase compared to the median pre-birth earnings and persists in the long run. After five years, these women have earned 16,000 Swiss francs more as a result of the mandate (i.e. 3.6 months of their pre-birth earnings). Introducing the mandated minimum thus boosts post-birth earnings, but does not affect subsequent fertility. Surprisingly, women employed in firms that offered paid maternity leave prior to the mandate also reacted sharply to the reform, yet in a very different way. Five in 100 of these women give birth to an additional child and subsequent fertility remains persistently higher throughout our observation period. The mandate only has a small overall financial impact, which dissipates after two years. Improvements in work-life balance instead are strong: job continuity increases significantly after birth and more women combine caring for a young child aged less than two years with earning around the same as prior to the first birth. Firms with prior leave available used some of the funds freed up by the mandate to expand family policies beyond the mandated minimum and made other adjustments to help women better balance work and family commitments.This pattern of evidence suggests that the value of maternity leave, in terms of improving work-life balance, evolves non-linearly throughout the ”duration” of maternity leave. Women working in firms that did not have prior leave experience improvements in the “work”-side of the work-life balance. They have higher earnings after returning from maternity leave, indicating that they are working a greater number of hours. Whereas women working in firms with prior leave see improvements in the “family life”-side since more of them go on to have a second child. Many of these firms implemented additional policies such as extended leave, higher maternity leave benefits, temporary replacement worker arrangements, and employer-provided child care - the trickle-down effects from the cost-savings resulting from the mandate - which all support the return to work of new mothers and reduce the costs of having additional children.6Our paper ties into a growing literature on the effects of maternity leave on female labor market outcomes and fertility in developed countries. A large part of the literature has investigated the impact of parental leave policies on female labor market outcomes (for excellent recent reviews, seeRossin-Slater (2017)andOlivetti and Petrongolo (2017)), while fertility has received less attention.7Analysing the recent Swiss mandate extends our understanding of how a short maternity leave affects work and fertility of mothers in four important ways.First, we include pre-birth labor market outcomes in our analysis to gauge if anticipatory behavioral effects are present and to determine their quantitative importance. Our results indeed reveal sizeable adjustments at the intensive margin of labor supply before birth. Such behavioral adjustments are likely to occur for other parental leave reforms as well (unless such reforms are announced very late or implemented ex-post) and should be taken into account when quantifying the overall effects of such reforms.8Second, our paper sheds light on the heterogeneous effects of a universal maternity leave mandate that supersedes prior employer-provided maternity leave for a subset of women. While these women were not directly affected by the mandate, since they had already been covered by employer-provided maternity leave, their employers see their costs of providing maternity leave reduced. This can in turn trickle down to female workers through extended maternity leave provisions, increased job continuity, more flexible work options, and employer provided child care. Our results highlight that such “trickle down” effects can be large and affect different outcomes than the direct effects of introducing a short paid leave.Third, our analysis also encompasses the effect of the maternity leave mandate on subsequent fertility. While labor market effects of a short maternity leave reform could be temporary and limited, this does not preclude sizeable and long-lasting impacts on subsequent fertility decisions as our findings show.Finally, our paper contributes to improve our understanding of how different family policies, such as parental leave and provision of child care places or child care subsidies, interact. As highlighted byOlivetti and Petrongolo (2017), family policies should not be analyzed in isolation, since the impact of a paid maternity leave could be determined not only by the duration and level of benefits, but also by the cost and availability of child care when the leave ends. Our heterogeneity analysis provides suggestive empirical evidence of such a complementarity between a short paid maternity leave mandate and higher availability of child care for younger children, at least in the subsequent fertility dimension and - to a lesser extent - in terms of post-birth earnings.9These four important findings warrant further attention from researchers and should inform policy makers on how to shape family policies to help women better reconcile the demands of work and family in the future.",Esther,Lena,Kalaivani
"1. IntroductionEver since Keynes’ famously predicted that new technologies would bring the disease of ‘technological unemployment’(Keynes, 1931), the process of technological change and its implications for the labor market has been a source of extensive economic research.In the last decades, the concern of labor-replacing technologies has been fueled by the progress in the use of computers (Autor et al., 2003), industrial robots (Acemoglu & Restrepo, 2020;De Vries et al., 2020), and artificial intelligence and mobile robotics (Brynjolfsson & McAfee, 2012;Frey & Osborne, 2017). Recent studies document evidence of risinginequalityfollowing serious structural change in the composition of skills (Acemoglu, 2002;Autor & Dorn, 2013), as well as a decrease in the labor share of income as a result of a slowdown in the creation of new tasks and in the reinstatement of displaced labor (Acemoglu & Restrepo, 2019).During the same period, most countries have also experienced a decline in unionization rates. While several authors have studied the erosion of unions in conjuncture with technological change, this work has mostly been concerned with answering how the two trends compete in explaining the surge in inequality and the fall of the labor share (Freeman, 1991;Card & DiNardo, 2002;Acemoglu et al., 2001;Piketty, 2014;Krueger, 2018;Guimarães & Gil, 2022). A few studies, however, investigate how technological change may explain variation in union density.Acemoglu et al. (2001)argue how skill-biased technological change (SBTC) could explain declining unionization rates, as larger wage gaps due to productivity differences undermine the coalition among skilled and unskilled workers in support of unions.Acikgoz & Kaymak (2014)demonstrate how SBTC may explain about 40 percent of the decline of unions in the US, both by reducing the incentives of skilled workers to unionize but also by weakening the firms’ incentives to hire low-skilled union workers.Dinlersoz & Greenwood (2016)also show how the patterns of unionization in the US during the 20th century may be explained by SBTC. While the surge in unionization rates during the first half of the century is shown to coincide with the diffusion of mass production during the Second Industrial Revolution, the rise of automation and computerization may explain the fall of unions during the second half of the century.Surprisingly, little effort has been put into understanding the reverse causation, that is how unions may influence the process of technological change. This is what we investigate in the current study. How are firms’ incentives to invest in automation altered by the presence of a union and how are unions to respond to this threat of replacing technology? Assuming unions lower profitability,1the gains in profits from investing in replacing technology in unionized firms should be higher than in non-unionized firms, all else equal. However, if the firm remains unionized, the classical holdup problem (Baldwin, 1983;Grout, 1984), where union rent seeking lowers thereturn on investmentsin the absence of binding contracts, still applies. Moreover, by exploiting itsbargaining powerand by influencing internal relations, unions may have a direct impact on the decision on whether or not to automate tasks previously conducted by labor. It is therefore not obvious whether unionized firms will be more or less eager to invest in replacing technology than non-unionized firms. This is, to a large degree, an empirical question.Using matched employer-employee panel data, comprising all Norwegian establishments and employees in the period 2000-2014, we exploit exogeneous changes in thetaxrules for union members to identify how structural changes in the occupational composition within workplaces are affected by variation in union density. In order to evaluate the technological direction of structural changes, occupations are measured by their estimated risk of automation according toFrey and Osborne (2017). As a test of robustness, we also apply the more widely acknowledged measure of routine-task intensity (Autor et al., 2003). The share of workers in routine occupations is used as a proxy for the technological maturity of workplaces, where a reduction in the share is interpreted as a technological advance. Our approach is therefore to estimate how the presence of a union influences changes in the share of workers in routine occupations.Our results suggest that unions contribute to raising the relative wage of routine workers over non-routine workers. As routine workers on average have lower earnings than non-routine workers, unions thereby contribute to compress wages at the workplace level. The direct implication of this policy is shown to reduce the relative demand for routine workers over non-routine workers. However, our results also suggest that unions influence the relative demand for routine workers,conditionalon relative wages. In other words, our study identifies two potentially opposing channels through which unions influence the process of technological change.While more empirical evidence on how unions alter technological change has been called for (Acemoglu & Autor, 2011, p. 1160), both of the two channels identified above are previously explored in the literature. On the one hand, there is a rich literature on how unions affect both the levels and distribution of wages. Themonopolybargaining power of unionized workers is widely recognized to add a union-premium on wages (Doucouliagos et al., 2017, p. 149). In isolation, a positive union wage premium implies stronger incentives to replace labor with new technology. Furthermore, unions are often believed to compress the distribution of wages, both within firms (Svarstad & Nymoen, 2022) and at the macro level in countries with a centralized or coordinated bargaining structure (Moene & Wallerstein, 1997;Haucap & Wey, 2004;Braun, 2011;Dale-Olsen, 2021). Wage compression contributes to making low-skilled labor relatively expensive and highly skilled labor relatively cheap. In line with theories of skilled-biased technological change, low-skilled labor is also more replaceable by automation technology, while high-skilled labor is more likely to complement this technology (Acemoglu, 2002).However, if unions are able to capture a share of the quasi-rents of investments in new technology, this can be shown to reduce firms’ optimal investments in absence of binding wage contracts (Baldwin, 1983;Grout, 1984). The risk of rent-seeking lowers the expected return and thus the level of investments.2This finding ledFreeman and Medoff (1984, p. 170) to conclude that the effect of unionization on technological advance is theoretically ambiguous. In a recent study of the Norwegianmanufacturing sectorbyBarth et al. (2020), higher union density is found to increase firm-level productivity, as measured by value added per worker. However, the authors also find that the union wage premium is increasing in value added per worker, which indicates rent-seeking behavior. In other words, while unionized firms may face stronger incentives to substitute labor for capital due to union wage premiums, union rent seeking may lower the returns on investments.On the other hand, unions may also alter a firm's investment decision directly through their presence in the organization. Indeed, local union representatives often work in close relationship with the management.3By exploiting its bargaining power and by influencing internal relations, unions may acquirede factoinfluence in the managerial strategic operations. This mechanism is part of whatFreeman and Medoff (1982)called the ‘relative inelasticity hypothesis’, which states thatlabor demandis less elastic in unionized firms.4In effect, unions ‘force employers off their demand curves’(Maki & Meredith, 1987). That is, not only may unions affect investments indirectly through their impact onlabor costs. They may also have a direct impact on the investment decisions.If unions influence firms’ investment decisions, the effect of unions on technological change will depend on the local union's attitudes to technology.Carmichael & MacLeod (1993)develop a simple model that illustrates how multiskilled workers may benefit from the productivity gains of new technology, while specialized workers lose as they are more difficult to relocate within the organization. In a related paper,Dowrick & Spencer (1994)examine the conditions under which unions will embrace or oppose technological change within a framework of oligopolistic competition in the product market. In their model, unions may rationally take the role as ‘Luddites’ if labor demand is sufficiently inelastic and if union preferences are weighted in favor of jobs. Building on a similar framework,Lommerud et al. (2006)show how globalization tends to make technology opposition from unions more likely, and that technology opposition is stronger in more technologically advanced countries.Based on a meta-regression of 20 different empirical studies,Doucouliagos et al. (2017, pp. 86-109)conclude that unionization seems to have a modest negative effect on physical capital formation. However, the survey documents a stronger negative association between unions andintangible capitalinvestments,5which may be a better indicator of union resistance to technology investments. Cross-country differences are found to be largely driven by labor market regulations, where union resistance to technology seems to be lower in more regulated labor markets. This finding is important in the Norwegian context, where the Working Environment Act together with centralizedcollective bargainingand firm level agreements form an important regulatory framework forindustrial relations(Svarstad & Kostøl, 2022).Our study adds an important contribution to the literature on the interactions between trade unions and technological change. While most previous studies have been concerned with how unions are affected by technology, we identify two mechanisms through which unions may influence the process of technological change within a simple efficient bargaining model. Moreover, we provide causal evidence of these mechanisms using rich panel data covering all Norwegian workplaces and working individuals in the private sector.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.Section 2develops a theoretical framework for analyzing how unions alter the occupational composition within workplaces. InSection 3, we present our empirical strategy and discuss issues of identification.

"1. IntroductionA growing research consensus links performance pay and poorer worker health. However, the behavioral changes that generate these links remain in doubt. We examine a common claim, that performance pay causes employees to work longer hours in pursuit of higher pay (DeVaro 2022;Andelic et al. (2023);Artz and Heywood 2015).As with other aspects of performance pay, one should anticipate both a behavioral response and a sorting response. Thus,Lazear (2000)found that performance pay increased worker productivity but also attracted more productive workers as performance pay rewards their inherent productivity.1Similarly, the hours of existing workers may respond to performance pay and workers inherently willing to work more hours may sort into performance pay to be rewarded for this effort. It is the first behavioral response that we focus on.Critically, there exists no theoretical or empirical agreement on the direction of this response to performance pay. While performance pay is designed to increase worker effort, work hours remain a poor proxy for this effort. Instead, the response may be working harder or smarter rather than longer. The additional earnings associated with performance pay represent an income effect suggesting fewer work hours. More generally, performance pay often replaces hourly wages that simply reward time on the job. This reduces adverse specialization in work hours (marginally productive contracted hours or even “face time” at an extreme). Also, performance pay that rewards groups is well known to create free-rider issues that likely undermine both effort and working hours. This can be overcome, and effort increased by profit sharing, if mutual monitoring is sufficient (Kandel and Lazear 1992). Yet, the literature suggests this effort increase may go into working more cooperatively rather than simply working extra hours (Drago and Garvey 1998). Added to this ambiguity, the very modest empirical literature which we will review presents both positive and negative associations between performance pay and hours.We use UK individual panel data to trace the influence of two measures of performance pay on hours of work. These measures imperfectly distinguish between individual and group rewards yet the pattern they present remains remarkably similar. The initial pooled cross-section indicates performance pay is associated with 2.4 additional hours per week for one measure and 1.7 additional hours for the other measure. These rough magnitudes remain robust to the inclusion ofpersonality traitsand controls for earnings. Despite extensive controls, we examine the role of worker heterogeneity and the associated sorting. The worker fixed-effect estimates continue to reveal statistically significant increased hours associated with the measures of performance pay. They become 0.7 and 0.8 additional hours for the two measures. This pattern offixed effectestimates being much smaller carries over to examinations of the probability of working long hours, for example, more than 50 hours per week. While the worker fixed effect estimates remain highly significant statistically, again they are small.We examine whether these significant but small estimates could be responsible for worse health by returning to a measure of self-reported good health used by others (Bender and Theodossiou 2014). We confirm that moving to performance pay is associated with an increased probability of dropping out of good health. We then control for total hours worked and demonstrate that the increased probability is virtually unchanged. This helps confirm that our small hours response is unlikely to be large enough to explain the poor health associated with performance pay. This moves attention away from increased hours, one of the most common suggestions, and toward other causes such as working harder, taking fewer breaks, taking greater risks on the job as well as facing uncertainty and stress over performance and earnings.",Colin,John,None
"1. IntroductionInternational students are among the largest flows of international migrants. In 2017, over 5.3 million postsecondary students studied abroad, double the number in 2003 (UNCESCO, 2020). The US has historically been the most popular destination. Through the F-1 student visa program, more than 1 million international students seek higher education in the US (IIE, 2019) and spend over 45 billion dollars each year (Chen, 2021). The F-1 visa brings more highly educated migrants to the US than any other immigration program.1Advocates of immigration and international education stress the value of international students, such as intellectual excellence and support for the skilled labor force. However, we know little about international students’ academic credentials and how immigration policies influence their decision to attend colleges in the US.After being admitted to a school, international students need to apply for an F-1 visa in order to legally enter the US. While the F-1 visa has no official cap, its issuance is far from certain. For examples, recent immigration policies and the COVID-19 pandemic have created massive uncertainty for obtaining student visas (Fischer, 2020). Before the pandemic, in the wake of trade tensions between the US and China, the Chinese government warned students about their prospects of receiving a visa (Redden, 2019).Fig. 1shows that the F-1 visa refusal rate is 27 percent worldwide in 2017, with substantial variation across regions and over time.2Because both applying to US colleges and visas are costly, changes in the expected chances of obtaining a visa may influence who iconsiders, applies, and enrolls in the US.Download :Download high-res image (541KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. Aggregate F-1 visa refusal rates.Note:Data are obtained from the US Department of State via Freedom of Information Act requests. The refusal rates are adjusted for denials that are later overcome or waived. VWP members are regions in the Visa Waiver Program (for B visas). Figure (b) includes data for 135 regions not covered by the VWP in 2017.In this paper, we provide the first evidence on whether the US attracts high academic ability international undergraduates, and how the F-1 visarestrictivenessaffects the college application process and enrollment. To address these questions, we compile a student-level dataset that contains information ondemographics, SAT scores, SAT score sends, and US college enrollment for the universe of international SAT takers between 2004 and 2015—many of which do not ultimately enroll in the US. We match our data with region-year visa refusal rates to measure visa restrictiveness.Understanding who comes to the US to study and why are of particular importance for higher education and high-skilled labor supply. First, international students usually pay full tuition, which subsidizes US institutions, especially those facing increased tuition and decreased state appropriations (e.g.,Bound, Braga, Khanna, Turner, 2020,Chen). Second, the answers to our questions are central to influence skilled labor force and have broad implications for immigration policies relating to brain drain and brain gain (e.g.,Docquier, Rapoport, 2012,Kerr, 2018). Even though many international students return home shortly aftergraduation(Chen, 2019), they have become the major supply of skilled foreign workers for US employers. In 2017, half of H-1B work visas approved for new employment were awarded to students on an F-1 visa, and most of them work in STEM jobs.3In addition, F-1 visa holders are eligible to work after graduation through the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program, which is cap-free and requires students to work in a field directly related to their major. The OPT issuance has well surpassed H-1B visa issuance in recent years (Amuedo-Dorantes et al., 2021). Hence, policies that affect the number or composition of international students can have more direct impacts on specific occupation/skill supply.Our paper begins by documenting the academic ability of international students who enroll in US colleges. We show that on average, international students have stronger credentials than domestic students on multiple measures of academic ability. For example, international students score 0.64standard deviations(SD) higher on the SAT, with 0.93 SD higher on the math section. The international-US SAT gap is driven by the fact that many top-sending regions have more academically prepared secondary students, based on the worldwide assessment,PISA, and the selection into who enrolls in US colleges is more positive among international students than US students. The SAT gap is consistent with that the graduation rate for international students is 10 percentage points (pp) higher than for domestic students.We also show that the expansion of international enrollment in the last decade is driven by high-scoring SAT international students. The ability distribution of international students has shifted over time. In 2015, international students in the US were 20 percent more likely to have an SAT score in the top quartile than in 2004. China is the primary driving force: Over 40 percent of high-scoring international students are Chinese in 2015 versus 2 percent in 2004. The rise of Chinese students coincides with a period of decline in its student visa refusal rate.To motivate our visa policy analysis, we show that many prospective international students who invest in the US college application process never come. Less than half of international SAT takers send test scores to US colleges, and fewer than 30 percent eventually enroll in the US.4Furthermore, although US enrollment probability increases in SAT scores, more than half of high-scoring international SAT takers do not end up enrolling in the US.Before international students can know whether they can enter the US on an F-1 visa, they have to pay significant psychological and monetary costs upfront to apply to US colleges and for visas. Hence an increase in expected visa restrictiveness can decrease the expected benefit of investing in the college application process, such as taking the SAT and sending test scores. We refer to this discouragement of action as the chilling effect. To assess the impact of anticipated F-1 visa restrictiveness on foreign investment in US college education, we study outcomes for SAT taking, SAT score sending, and enrollment. We measure expected visa restrictiveness with visa refusal rates faced by international students around the time of deciding whether to take the SAT and send scores.Our identification strategy addresses two potential biases that can prevent a causal estimate of the impact of F-1 visa refusal rate on college outcomes. First, simultaneity bias may arise because the refusal rate can be driven by changes in the supply of students (e.g., less qualified visa applicants) and not the restrictiveness of the visa policy. To address this, we isolate the variation in visa restrictiveness for US entry by instrumenting the F-1 refusal rate with the visitor visa refusal rate, which is not driven by student visa applicants.Second, both student and visitor visa refusal rates may be affected by region factors that also affect education decisions (e.g., the relation with the US). To address the potential omitted variable bias, we include region and yearfixed effectsto control for any region-specific factors that are time invariant (e.g., whether a US ally) and overall time trends (e.g., globalization of education). We also include a set of region-year-level controls, such as trade with the US and economic growth. Furthermore, when estimating heterogenoustreatment effects, we include region-year fixed effects to capture remaining unobserved region-year factors. In practice, the instrument makes an important difference to our estimates, but the controls for omitted variables do not. Our results are robust to a set of sensitivity checks.We find that a higher F-1 visa refusal rate discourages international students from taking the SAT and sending their scores to US colleges. On average, a 10 percent increase in the F-1 visa refusal rate decreases the number of international SAT takers by 7.4 percent and the probability of sending scores to a US college by 3.7 percent, conditional on taking the SAT. Furthermore, conditional on sending scores, students send scores to slightly more selective US institutions. Our estimates show that a 10 percent increase in the F-1 visa refusal rate leads to a 12.2 percent decrease in new international enrollment, with about 60 percent through the effect on SAT taking and 40 percent via the effect on score sending.Importantly, we find that students with higher SAT scores are more responsive to the expected visa restrictiveness. A 10 percent increase in the F-1 visa refusal rate decreases the median SAT score of international SAT takers by 0.04 SD and the share of takers above the 75th SAT percentile by 2 pp. The probability of sending test scores to a US college is reduced nearly double the amount for high-scoring students than for low-scoring students. Consequently, the enrollment impact on high-scoring students is larger than low-scoring students. We discuss potential explanations, such as differences in outside options and use of information, inSection 7.5.Our paper makes direct contributions to the literature oninternational migration. A large number of research has studied theories and empirical evidence on the determinants of brain drain (e.g.,Beine, Docquier, Rapoport, 2001,Beine, Docquier, Rapoport, 2008,Docquier, Rapoport, 2012,Kerr, 2018).Bertoli and Moraga (2013)find that the attractiveness of alternative destination (referred as “multilateral resistance”) is a key factor for migration. International education is a key channel for the brain drain of highly educated students and future workers.Kato and Sparber (2013)andShih (2016)find that a reduction in the chance of working in the US after graduation decreases the number international students who send scores to and enroll in US colleges.We examine how the decision on investing US education from international students responds to changes in the expected chances of obtaining a student visa.5Our student-level data allow us to evaluate the impact of F-1 visa policy on individual score-sending decisions and enrollment outcomes. We are able to create a measure of enrollment inflow instead of stock for our region-level analysis. From a policy perspective, if the US wants to attract more international undergraduate students—either for “brain gain” or to subsidize colleges—our results suggest that easing visa restrictiveness is a path to consider.Research on international students has been limited and traditionally focused on graduate students before the mid-2000s (e.g.,Bound, Turner, Walsh, 2009,Shih, 2017). There is rising interest in international undergraduates, likely as a result of their swelling numbers and new data efforts.6Studies find that reductions in state appropriations have led to increases in international undergraduates at public universities (Bound et al., 2020), and China’s trade liberalization is an important factor for driving Chinese student expansion in the US (Khanna et al., 2020). In addition, while international undergraduates subsidize in-state students and lead to an increase in domestic college graduates (Chen, 2021), they push domestic students from STEM majors to high-income social science majors (Anelli et al., 2023). Lastly,Chen (2019)finds that US-educated Chinese students face more labor market challenges than Chinese-educated when they return home. Due to data limitations, previous studies have only been able to provide statistics on enrollment levels and not on the composition of international students based on measures of academic ability.Our paper differs from prior work by compiling a rich student-level dataset to answer a different line of questions. Using various measures of academic ability, we provide the first evidence that the US has attracted high-achieving international students who provide potential benefits to campuses, such as peer quality, beyondfinance. In addition, unlike most of the immigration literature—which only observes migrants in the US—we also observe prospective students who have shown some interest in seeking a US education. We show that a large fraction of high-achieving SAT takers do not come, suggesting that there is some low-hanging fruit for US colleges and, perhaps, the labor market as well.InSection 2, we discuss our data sources and compare our data with the few external data sources on international students.Section 3presentsdescriptive statisticson the academic ability for international students in the US and compares them with those for US students. We also discuss why international students have higher scores and document trends in the ability distribution.Section 4documents our outcomes of interest for the visa policy analysis, andSection 5describes the relevant institutional backgrounds and variation in visa refusal rates.Section 6presents our empirical strategy to estimate the impact of visa restrictiveness, andSection 7presents the results and our discussion.Section 8concludes.",Mingyu,Jessica,Jonathan
"1. IntroductionThe labour market for academic economists, organised annually by the American Economic Association, is a crucial event for graduate students, their advisers, and hiring institutions (Coles et al., 2010). As with many labour markets, hiring institutions often face uncertainty regarding applicant quality (Chandrasekhar et al., 2020). This could be because hiring committees may not have the time or resources to thoroughly review all applications, or may struggle to assess certain intangible qualities such ascollegiality. This uncertainty can lead to suboptimal hiring. For example, since better ranked institutions are likely to get many applications, and are simultaneously likely to have a lower tolerance for candidate uncertainty, we may observe some good students being under placed.Smeets et al. (2006)show that top students from good programs often outperform the average student from elite programs. One reason why the former were not accepted to the elite PhD programs could be uncertainty regarding PhD applicant quality.Academic advisers can reduce uncertainty about student quality and ability via reference letters and phone calls (Athey, Katz, Krueger, Levitt, Poterba, 2016,Colander, 1997).Colander (1997)writes that “Recommendations from important people are extremely important” and “Informal contacts - and phone calls by your advisers and friends - are important”. In this paper, we show that an adviser’s connectedness in the coauthor network positively affects her student’s first placement after graduate school.Apart from the above mentioned direct channel, there are at least three indirect channels through which a more connected adviser may help her student secure a better placement: a) they spread information about their students in their academic network, b) an adviser’s network may be utilised by the student to write more and better papers, and c) hiring committees may (unconsciously) spend more time with the applications of students of well known advisers. Advisers advertise their students and their students’ job market paper among coauthors or at conferences. This information then diffuses further in their network via informal interactions. When student applications are examined, the students of well-connected advisers benefit from the lower uncertainty about their match.Baruffaldi et al. (2016)demonstrate such a mechanism for direct links. They show that PhD students who obtained their Masters degree at anaffiliationof their adviser’s coauthor are more productive than PhD students coming from a university to which their adviser has no links. The second indirect mechanism points out that hiring committees may reason that students have access to their adviser’s network and may therefore turn out to be more productive than students of less connected advisers. This would provide an edge to applications of students of well connected advisers, leading to them obtaining placements at better ranked institutions.1Finally, the third indirect mechanism suggests that if hiring committees spend more time on the applications of students of well known advisers then this can increase the probability of getting an interview/fly-out for those students.We use two different identification strategies and outcome variables to show that an adviser’s connectedness positively affects her student’s placement. First, we utilise the changes in the centrality of the adviser’s coauthors in the year of a student’s placement as an exogenous shock to the adviser’s Eigenvector centrality to show that higher centrality of an adviser leads to better placement outcomes for her students. Second, we use the death of Economists as an exogenous shock to show that the probability of a student being placed at a particular university reduces when the ‘social distance’ between her adviser and that university increases due to the death. In both settings, our coauthor network compromises up to 40,000 Economists based on joint publications.Our measure of connectedness in the first identification strategy is the adviser’s Eigenvector centrality score in the coauthor network. This captures the value of not just the adviser’s direct connections but also her indirect connections via the connectedness of her neighbours, and so on. The idea behind this measure is that people connected to more connected individuals are themselves more connected. Various studies demonstrate the importance of Eigenvector centrality (for examples - seeBanerjee, Chandrasekhar, Duflo, Jackson, 2013,Calvó-Armengol, Patacchini, Zenou, 2009,Cruz, Labonne, Querubin, 2017). We instrument an adviser’s Eigenvector centrality by the average Eigenvector centrality of her coauthors as measured in a network where we artificially removed the adviser. Changes in the connectedness of the adviser’s coauthors in the year of a student’sgraduationprovide the exogenous variation needed for identification. Our analysis indicates that a onestandard deviationchange in the centrality of the adviser leads, on average, to her student getting a placement at an institution with a 0.692 standard deviation higher score. The mean change in adviser centrality (year on year across all advisers in our sample) is around 0.013 standard deviations. This corresponds to an improvement in placement rank by about 6 ranks.The other identification strategy studies the effect of social distance on placement probability - are students more likely to be hired by an institution whose faculty members are close to their adviser in the coauthor network? Our identification utilizes unexpected distance increases caused by the deaths of authors in the coauthor network. We find that if the distance between an adviser and a university increases by one, the probability of that adviser’s student being placed at that university declines by about 0.2 percentage points.Generally, there are two channels through whichsocial networksaffect the labour market: learning about new job openings (Boorman, 1975,Calvó-Armengol, 2004,Calvó-Armengol, Zenou, 2005,Granovetter, 1973), and reducing uncertainty about the applicant (Burks, Cowgill, Hoffman, Housman, 2017,Dustmann, Glitz, Schönberg, Brücker, 2016,Montgomery, 1991). With the exception ofSan (2021), labour economists are usually unable to empirically distinguish between the two channels. Our setting, the academic job market for Economists, is special in that information frictions regarding job openings are (almost) absent due to Job Openings for Economists. Thus, our finding that social networks play a role in this market is likely because they help decrease the uncertainty about an applicant’s quality.Our study differs from previous studies on social networks in labour markets in another way. Prior work on social networks in the labour market are usually limited to the impact of direct links. For example,Kramarz and Skans (2014)look at the direct link between parents and children and establish that this connection is important for the job market outcome of the children.Burks et al. (2017)andHensvik and Skans (2016)show that workers recommended by current employees are often a better match for the firm, confirming the model ofMontgomery (1991).Dustmann et al. (2016)assume that the network of connections is along ethnic lines, by proxying referral hires by the share of workers in the firm with the same ethnicity as the applicant.San (2021)moves one step beyond direct links and finds that workers are more likely to work in firms where their parents’ past coworkers are working. In contrast to these studies, we construct a large network of connections using coauthor links and capture the effects of even distant indirect connections via the centrality of the adviser in this network.Note that even though there are no ‘advisers’ in other labour markets, we point out that links with more connected individuals are more valuable in a job search than links with less connected individuals. This message will ring true for any labour market with information frictions.Finally, we contribute to the understanding of the academic job market for Economists.Oyer (2006)points out that the first placement of graduate students has a significant impact on their careers. Our research demonstrates how an adviser’s connectedness can influence her student’s first placement. The role of the adviser has also been explored byKrueger and Wu (2000), who report a correlation between the (subjective) prominence of the student’s recommendation letter writer and the student’s placement. We show that even after controlling for ‘prominence’ (which we equate with a productivity-based measure), the connectedness of the adviser matters for her students’ placement.The rest of the paper is organised as follows. The data construction and description is inSection 2.Section 3presents a discussion of our empirical strategies and challenges. Our empirical analysis inSection 4proceeds in two parts - the first part examines the effect of adviser centrality on placement outcome, while the second part examines the effect of social distance on placement probability. InSection 5, we discuss various channels via which adviser centrality could influence student placement, andSection 6conclude our paper.",Michael,Suraj,None
"1. IntroductionMonth of birth affects one’s well-being in not only school, but also in adulthood, perhaps because it influences relative age in a grade cohort. Many papers have documented that relatively younger students in a given cohort perform more poorly in academic tests (Bedard and Dhuey, 2006), playing sports (Helsen et al., 2005), and other school activities (Dhuey and Lipscomb, 2008). In addition, some studies have reported that month of birth affects long-term outcomes including university enrollment (Bedard and Dhuey, 2006), labor earnings (Kawaguchi, 2011), and top management (Du et al., 2012) and political positions (Muller and Page, 2016).While the negative consequences of being among the youngest in class have been well documented, what remains less known is how children and their parents respond to disadvantages caused by being relatively young beyond delayingschool enrollment(known as redshirting). Do parents of a younger student in a cohort make a compensatory investment to catch up with the child’s peers? Teachers and peer students can also influence theskill formationof younger students. Do teachers provide younger students with a support so that younger students perform at their best? Do school peers help younger students or bully them instead? These questions are important for understanding how skill formation through own investment and influences from others varies by birth month.The objectives of this paper are to estimate the effects of month of birth on cognitive and noncognitive skills as well as high school quality, and to examine possible mechanisms for the finding that birth month is correlated with long-run outcomes. More specifically, we estimate the month-of-birth gaps in time use, prep school attendance, participation in sports, and the quality of relationships with teachers and peer students.Our analysis is based on longitudinal data of all fourth to ninth graders in public schools in the province1of Saitama, Japan in 2015–2018. The quality of our data is arguably superior to many data sources in the literature and hence strength of the paper. First, our data include noncognitive skill measures for more than one million student-year observations, which enables us to estimate parameters precisely enough to detect nuanced patterns. It is true that other administrative data sets are larger than ours, but they do not have noncognitive skill measures as far as we know. Second, because the data include all public school students, we have very little concerns about potential biases arising from attrition, which is often the case with panel data such as ECLS-K and NLSY.The timing of school enrollment in Japan is strictly determined by birth date, which differs from many countries, such as the USA, but is similar to institutions in England, Norway, and Iceland. Because redshirting is virtually impossible in Japan, only the month of birth determines whether a student is one of the youngest in his/her grade cohort. We estimate the month-of-birth effects by assuming that the month of birth is exogenous. We validate this assumption by showing that family socioeconomic status (SES) and birth outcomes such as birth weight are largely uncorrelated with the month of birth.Our estimation results indicate that the month of birth affects both cognitive and noncognitive skills. High school is not a part of compulsory education in Japan, and students must pass a competitive entrance exam to enter a high-quality high school. Consequently, there is also a significant gap in high school quality by birth month. The youngest students in grade four have test scores about 0.35standard deviationslower than those of the oldest students; however, these gaps in test score decrease to 0.13-0.18 by grade nine. Findings for noncognitive skills such as conscientiousness are particularly interesting. Consistent with existing psychological studies on adolescence, noncognitive skills tend to decrease with grade in our data. However, the youngest students in a given grade have noncognitive skills about 0.1 standard deviations lower than the oldest students in the same grade. Because noncognitive skills do not improve with grade, the gap between the oldest and youngest students in the same grade suggests that the month of birth influences the formation of noncognitive skills. In addition, this month-of-birth gap in noncognitive skills remains nearly constant over time, which is in contrast with the dynamics of the cognitive skill gap.We then examine how younger students and their parents respond to their disadvantages, and find that the youngest students in the ninth grade work 0.3 more hours per week outside of school than the oldest students. They also read for more hours and are more likely to attend a prep school. Overall, younger students and their parents make compensatory investment in cognitive skills; however, they spend 0.2 fewer hours per week on sports, arts, and music, which may lead to lower noncognitive skills, in light of the findings of psychological studies (Ishihara, Sugasawa, Matsuda, Mizuno, 2018,Moreno, Bialystok, Barac, Schellenberg, Cepeda, Chau, 2011). Another important factor that may influence children’s noncognitive skills isinterpersonal relationships. Our estimates indicate that the youngest students suffer about 0.06 standard deviations poorer relationships with their teachers and 0.09-0.12 standard deviations poorer relationships with their school peers, which may lead to lower noncognitive skills for younger children (Leary, Baumeister, 2000,Reitz, Motti-Stefanidi, Asendorpf, 2016,Wu, Hu, Fan, Zhang, Zhang, 2018). Poor interpersonal relationships may lead to persistent month-of-birth effects on noncognitive skills.This paper contributes to the literature on month-of-birth effects in two ways. First, we show a set of evidence for compensatory investment by younger students in a grade cohort, which has implications for efficiency and equity. Younger children and their parents seem to decide on skill investment through comparisons with exactly the same grade cohort; however, they will be compared with individuals not only in the same but also in a different grade cohort once they enter the labor market. Compensatory skill investment may be individually optimal given their environment, but it may not maximize children’s human capital in the long run. In this sense, the existing school cutoff date may distort students’ and their parents’ skill investment behavior. Our finding is also relevant for equity. Even though month-of-birth gaps may narrow over time, the cost of catching up with peers may be paid by younger students and their parents through their compensatory investment. Policies mitigating month-of-birth effects could correct the distortion in skill investment and improve equity.Second, taking advantage of the large data set with over 1 million observations, we provide precise estimates for the month-of-birth effects on noncognitive skills. Unlike academic test scores, evidence for the month-of-birth effects on noncognitive skills is relatively scarce despite the growing recognition of returns to such skills.Datar and Gottfried (2015)find that being relatively old in a kindergarten in the U.S. is associated with better social-behavioral outcomes during elementary school.Peña and Duckworth (2018)andPeña (2020)also showed that older children in a grade cohort score higher in grit, empathy, and decision-making among Mexican students at age 18. Our evidence from Japan complements the previous studies because the month-of-birth effects can vary across countries because of differentialeducation systems. In addition, our data are much larger than the previous studies, which gives added confidence in the results.Our results also provide a possible explanation for why month of birth has long-term consequences in some countries. For example,Kawaguchi (2011)finds that the youngest men in a grade cohort in Japan earn 4% less income when aged 30–34 years. Although month-of-birth effects on cognitive skills may disappear because of maturation and compensatory skill investment, less sports and music experience, as well as poorer interpersonal relationships with teachers and peers, may harm the long-term development of noncognitive skills, which might account for the lower earnings seen in adulthood. Although we do not observe noncognitive skills after grade nine in our data, this hypothesis is consistent with findings byChetty et al. (2011),Heckman et al. (2013), andBaker et al. (2019), who find that interventions during childhood affect noncognitive skills in adulthood.The rest of the paper is structured as follows. InSection 2, we provide a conceptual framework. InSection 3, we outline the empirical strategy to identify month-of-birth effects and validate our identifying assumptions. InSection 4, we describe our data. InSection 5, we estimate month-of-birth effects on skills and high school quality. InSection 6, we estimate month-of-birth gaps in time use and interpersonal relationships. InSection 7, we discuss the results in the context of the literature. We conclude inSection 8.

"1. IntroductionMany developing countries recently increased social protection spending, with targeted cash transfer programmes as a key anti-poverty tool (Barrientos and Hulme, 2009;Devereux and Sabates-Wheeler, 2004;Estevez-Abe et al., 2001). While transfers can improve education, health, and other welfare outcomes amongst poor households (Gerard et al., 2020;Hanlon et al., 2012;Norton et al., 2002), there may be reduced work incentives and a greater inclination towards informal employment (Blau and Robins, 1986;Borjas, 2016;Moffitt, 2002b). Protecting the poor and alleviating hardship during economic downturns through cash transfer may thus potentially undermine economic recovery if it hasdisincentiveeffects in labour markets. The disincentive effects of social assistance programs on employment are significant policy concerns influencing how these programs develop in the future. This paper measures the labour market impacts of Indonesia’s large-scale unconditional cash transfer (UCT) programs intended explicitly as crisis stimulus, with a particular emphasis on employment, job formality, and mobility.TheIndonesiangovernment launched its first large-scale cash transfer programme in 2005 in line with a significant reform of its fuel subsidy programme, reallocating a part of the fuel subsidy savings to poor and vulnerable households. Despite its success in administering the assistance at the right time to alleviate potential negative impacts (Bazzi et al., 2015), it is not clear how such cash transfers affect labour market behaviour (seeAl Izzati et al., 2020;World Bank, 2012for several earlier studies of UCT in Indonesia). Most early work examining the labour market effects of social assistance focused on developed countries, and tended to find negative impacts on negative labour supply and work effort, largely due to generous welfare systems (seeBurtless, 1986;Chan and Moffitt, 2018;Dague et al., 2017;Hoynes and Schanzenbach, 2012;Jacob and Ludwig, 2012;Moffitt, 2002). In the context of developing countries, empirical evidence is limited, and effects tend to be around zero (e.g.,Alzúa et al., 2013;Banerjee et al., 2017). Many programs studied to date only produce income effects because targeting relies on proxy-means tests that are rarely reassessed and exclude labour market outcomes (Gerard et al., 2021). Means-tested programs, in contrast, could potentially distort beneficiaries’ incentives to work through substitution effects, especially in the formal economy where earnings are verifiable (Bergolo and Cruces, 2021;Levy, 2010).By drawing on the case study ofBantuan Langsung Tunai(BLT) 2005, BLT 2008, andBantuan Langsung Sementara Masyarakat(BLSM) 2013, administered by the Indonesian government in a targeted manner, I examine the aggregate effects ofsocial transferson labour market outcomes by capturing both income and substitution effects. A standard labour supply model predicts that beneficiaries are less likely to seek out or maintain employment as a result of relatively higher unearned income (income effect). Beneficiaries may also experience a substitution effect, and be less likely to take on formal employment since higher formal earnings could render them ineligible for the transfers. Since formal sector income is more easily verifiable, beneficiaries may avoid formal employment due to the consequently non-zero marginaltaxrate. Thus, the targeting approach of cash transfer programmes determines the magnitude of any disincentive effects. However, since these UCTs essentially act as temporaryfiscal stimulus, negligible effects could be the case, especially in the long run.Due to the targeted nature of the UCT programmes, it is often difficult to obtain statistically equivalent treatment and control groups to analyse social assistance’s impacts. In practice, targeting was imperfect, with inclusion and exclusion errors abound. As a result, beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries should not differ based on observable features, and identification could exploit targeting errors. However, household andcommunitycharacteristics here are statistically different, including in ways that may be correlated with treatment assignment and labour market outcomes. Therefore, I use generalised difference-in-differences (DD) withpropensity score matching(PSM) to recover the effects of these UCT programmes. Since the UCTs are aimed at low-income households, specifically the poorest 30 percent, I complement the DD estimation with PSM to adjust my comparisons for any observable factors potentially determining treatment. The DD estimation is then carried out with individualfixed effectsand observations in common support. Individual-level annual panel data spanning over 14 years are constructed from the retrospective answers of employment from the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS)—waves 3, 4, and 5—which also allow me to conductevent studiesto explore dynamic effects and, in particular, whether any impacts are transitory or persistent.I find statistically significant evidence of disincentives on employment and job formality consistent with both income and substitution effects, especially for BLT 2008/BLSM 2013. For the BLT 2005, however, there is an increased likelihood of formal employment, albeit with a two-year lag. The mixed results across settings may be partly explained by the differences in targeting approaches used in BLT 2005 and BLT 2008/BLSM 2013. Compared to BLT 2005, which relied on a standard proxy-means test, BLT 2008/BLSM 2013 used a broader range of indicators, including information on employment and occupation combined with community-based targeting. Using a more detailed proxy-means test in conjunction with more recent, dynamic welfare data may have stronger disincentive effects if these criteria are known to potential beneficiaries. Indeed, these disincentives are small and account for only a 2-percentage-point decline in employment and job formality (2 and 8 percent decrease from the mean outcome, respectively). The delayed positive effect on job formality from BLT 2005 may be due to higherlabour demandin the formal sector, for example, due to local multiplier effects and alleviatedliquidity constraintsin searching for better jobs (Baird et al., 2018;Egger et al., 2022;Neri et al., 2013).1This paper closely relates toWorld Bank (2012)andAl Izzati et al. (2020), which also evaluate the impacts of UCTs in Indonesia.World Bank (2012)examines the effect of UCTs (in either BLT 2005 or 2008) using the National Socio-economic Survey (SUSENAS), a repeat cross-section, finding that UCT beneficiaries, on average, were not more likely to find or leave work. However, beneficiaries of BLT 2005 in the bottom three deciles were 10 percentage points more likely to report moving into employment.Al Izzati et al. (2020)use the main IFLS panel in the years 2000, 2007, and 2014 (i.e., not the annual retrospective data) to find that, amongst those already working, receiving the UCT has no statistically significant effects on working hours or activities in a farm or nonfarm business. Here, I additionally use IFLS’ retrospective responses, allowing evaluation with individual fixed effects and of short-term effects, a crucial but neglected dimension given the temporary nature of these crisis-response UCTs.This paper thus makes three main contributions relative to prior work. First, I incorporate job formality and mobility, two important dimensions receiving relatively little attention to date. In the context of social assistance programmes using means-tested targeting, it is particularly important to account for the aggregate effects of cash transfer, especially in the formal sector. Recent studies (seeBanerjee et al., 2017,Foguel and Barros, 2010;Galasso, 2006;Maluccio and Flores, 2005;Parker and Skoufias, 2000;Skoufias and Di Maro, 2008) tend to find little evidence of employment effect from cash transfers focusing mainly on the income effects, whereas the substitution effects—the margin of employment most likely affected from salient means testing—are often overlooked. Second, I add to emergent work focused on developing countries’ evidence based on rich, high-frequency longitudinal data with a good recall quality to examine whether any labour market responses to cash transfers are temporary or long-lasting. Third, I also provide a relatively novel exploration oftreatment effectheterogeneity, not only based on different types of beneficiaries but also the different types of UCT designs, including how different approaches to means-testing may affect various margins of adjustment.This paper proceeds as follows.Section 2discusses previous work and provides a background on Indonesia’s UCT programmes.Section 3andSection 4describe the data and empirical strategy.Section 5presents the main results, followed by heterogeneity analysis and robustness checks inSections 6and7.

"1. IntroductionTo many, Mandarin is often perceived as the only language in China, synonymous with ""Chinese."" This is actually not true. China is a linguistically diverse country with hundreds of local languages and dialects, which are not necessarily mutually intelligible. More importantly, the differences among these local languages are far greater than many would think. In fact, as noted byDovì (2019)andTang and van Heuven (2009), the mutual intelligibility (measured by word-intelligibility and sentence intelligibility) of the dialects in China can be as low as 2%, and does not surpass 50% on average.Not only did such great linguistic differences create communication barriers between people from different regions in China, but the Chinese government also considered them to have adversely affected economic progress and cultural exchange. As a result, the Chinese government has been promoting the standardization of the spoken Chinese language since the 1950s, gradually settling on Mandarin as the standard spoken language and describing it as a common speech with pronunciation based on the Beijing dialect. In 1956, the government issued The State Council Directive on thePromotionof Putonghua, which aimed to popularize Mandarin and promote its use in schools, and in many aspects of daily life and officialgovernment activities. In 2000, the use of Mandarin became law (Jiang, 2000), with Mandarin being further established as the official national language in 2010 by China's National Language Law.Because Mandarin essentially developed from a dialect, it is not necessarily well understood by many in China. Despite the great promotion effort, around 30% of the population is still unable to communicate in Mandarin, which led some scholars to conclude that ""for most Chinese people, Mandarin is somewhere between being a native language, an intelligible dialect, and an almost ‘foreign’ language."" (Dovì, 2019). Because of this, Mandarin should be considered as more of a lingua franca in the Chinese labor market, and its role should be similar to the role that English plays in the global economy or in those countries where English is one of the official languages (e.g., India). Proficiency in the official language of a country has been shown to be positively related to one's earnings. For example,Azam et al. (2013)found that in India, where English is one of the national languages but English proficiency levels remain low, there exists a sizable effect of English skills on wages, whereby the returns on English proficiency are even higher than the returns on education. This raises the question of whether Mandarin skills are similarly profitable in the Chinese labor market, especially for migrants, which is what we investigate in this paper.According to the literature on the economics of language, there are a few reasons why a higher level of language skills can be associated with higher earnings. First, the use of a common language can reduce the communication barrier and increase the quality of job opportunities, which could increase one's productivity in the workplace (Grogger, 2011;Yao and van Ours, 2019). Overcoming the communication barrier may also expand one'ssocial network, which is an important job search channel in China. Second, language skills can often serve as a signal of one's ability and thus increase their likelihood of employment, especially as they are more directly observable when compared to other skills.Dovì (2019)supports this statement by showing that a onestandard deviationincrease in Mandarin proficiency increases employment chances by 4% in the whole sample and by up to roughly 5% in only those individuals residing in urban areas of China.Both aforementioned reasons suggest a causal impact of language skills on earnings. However, the positive association between language skills and earnings may also be a spurious one, capturing the effects of omitted variables, or reflecting reverse causality. First, better language skills may be related to unobservable variables (e.g., quality of education) that are positively related to earnings. Effort and time spent on improving one's language skills can also diminish the resources spent on other productive skills which are not necessarily measured in the data (e.g., quantitative ability as reported byDovì, 2019). Second, the need for communication skills may be more prevalent in high-skilled or high-paying jobs, and language skills can improve in such a workplace, as employees have more opportunities to practice (Dovì, 2019).The key challenge faced by studies of the economic returns on Mandarin skills is indeed to isolate the causal impact of language skills. Common approaches to address this challenge include the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression,propensity score matching(PSM;Saiz et al., 2002), or theinstrumental variablemethod (IV;Ginsburgh and Prieto-Rodriguez, 2011;Wang et al., 2017). Both the OLS and PSM approaches rely primarily on the conditional independence assumption that requires language skills to be exogenous once the control variables are included in the model. The IV approach relies on the existence of an IV variable that is not only strongly correlated with language skills, but also uncorrelated with the unobservable determinants of earnings, and that does not affect earnings either directly or indirectly through any channels other than language skills. For example,Dovì (2019)utilized language use outside of the workplace and migration history as IVs.However, the independence or exogeneity assumption is often difficult to satisfy and cannot be directly tested in practice. Moreover, both OLS and IV approaches typically impose linearity on the relationship between language skills and earnings, hence assuming that the returns on language skills are homogeneous. While these challenges are well known, convincing solutions addressing them together have proven unsuccessful, thereby calling for alternative approaches. In this paper, we employ a nonparametric bounds analysis that relies on more transparent and weaker assumptions, which are in part testable. Since the approach is nonparametric, it also allows us to uncover variations in the returns on language skills across the levels of such skills.To perform our analysis, we utilize data from the 2016 wave of the nationwide China Labor-force Dynamics Survey (CLDS), which is a longitudinal survey administered by Sun Yat-Sen University. The CLDS dataset is nationally representative, designed to survey individual-, family-, as well as community-level characteristics with an emphasis on surveying labor market outcomes such as job conditions, income sources, and educational information (Wang et al., 2017). The 2016 survey wave represents the most recent available CLDS data, which specifically focuses on the labor market anddemographiccharacteristics of the respondents. One unique advantage of CLDS data is that each respondent's Mandarin proficiency was objectively assessed by the interviewers, which reduces the subjective measurement error of this variable. We do indeed find a Mandarin premium in the Chinese labor market, which is represented by higher wages. The positive effects are a result of better job matches and higher levels of productivity. In addition, we show that, while the returns on wages are positive for both male and female workers, highly proficient Mandarin skills benefit women more than men, which can potentially help narrow the gender wage gap. Finally, we show that the IV analyses usually result in high values and are sometimes overestimated.The rest of the paper is organized as follows.Section 2briefly reviews the literature;Section 3describes the data;Section 4presents and discusses the empirical methods that are employed;Sections 5and6present the results;Section 7discusses the potential mechanisms influencing the results;Section 8contrasts the nonparametric results with traditional parametric results; andSection 9concludes the paper.",Chen,Xiao,None
"1. IntroductionOver the last few decades a number of countries have witnessed a decline in income and social mobility that has strengthened the link between individuals’ origins and their socio-economic outcomes. At the same time, the shares in total employment of low- and high-paying occupations have increased at the expense of that of middling occupations, transforming the availability of jobs for workers. Existing work has proposed several explanations for the reduction in mobility, but little attention has been paid to the role of the changing structure of employment despite the fact that both phenomena have taken place roughly simultaneously.1Yet the timing of the two trends raises the question of whether individuals from less well-off backgrounds can still climb the social ladder as the middle rungs become scarce.This paper bridges the gap between the literature on social mobility and that on employment polarization. The question has recently been addressed in two closely related papers,Guo (2022)andHennig (2022), which focus on the impact that the structure of employment has on education decisions in the US. Their conceptual frameworks maintain that, when higher education is costly and borrowing tofinanceit is not possible, the disappearance of middling jobs results in a polarization of education which in turn leads to lower income mobility. We explore an alternative mechanism that does not rely on costly education, making it applicable to a broader range of economies. Our key hypothesis is that occupational transitions during an individual’s career are an essential aspect of inter-generational mobility. In fact, the UK data we employ indicate that about 30% of those starting in middling occupations and 40% of those starting in low-paying occupations experience upwardsoccupational mobilitybetween their mid-20s and their early-40s. Our analysis hence focuses on the role of middling jobs as stepping stones in the occupational ladder.We start by developing a model aimed at illustrating a simple mechanism through which polarization may affect occupational mobility. We consider a setup with two employment periods and three occupations, low-paying, middling, and high-paying. Individuals differ in parental income, which can be either low or high, and which determines first-period human capital, so that when individuals are young those with low parental income are randomly allocated to either low-paying or middling jobs, and those with high parental income to middling or high-paying jobs. During the first period, individuals may increase their human capital through on-the-job learning, which occurs with a given probability that depends on the occupation. In the second period, firms observe the human capital of mature workers and reallocate them across occupations.We make two crucial assumptions: first, that the probability of on-the-job learning is higher for middling than for low-paying occupations; second, that on-the-job learning is sufficiently strong for an individual from a low-income household to potentially have higher human capital than some individuals from high-income backgrounds. In this context, the availability of middling jobs is the key element determining the extent of mobility. When middling jobs are scarce, the majority of those from low-income backgrounds will start their careers in low-paying occupations. As a result, few of them have learning opportunities and thus only a few individuals with low-income parents will be promoted to high-paying jobs. Moreover, this implies that since few positions are left vacant in middling occupations, few of those who started in high-paying occupations will be demoted, even if they failed to learn. As a result, there is a lower degree of mobility when middling jobs are scarce than when they are plentiful.The core of our analysis is an empirical assessment of occupational mobility using data from two mature British cohorts, the National Child Development Study (NCDS58) and the British Cohort Study (BCS70). The surveys cover individuals born in, respectively, 1958 and 1970 for whom we have full activity histories along with parental income. These data have been widely used to examine the extent of mobility in the UK and existing work indicates that parent-child income mobility has declined for the younger cohort as compared to the older one.2We depart from existing work in two respects. First, because we are interested in the structure of employment, mobility is not defined in terms of income, as economists tend to do; rather, we focus on occupations and define occupational categories in line with the employment polarization literature.3Second, while existing work on inter-generational mobility focuses on the correlation between parental characteristics and the outcomes of mature children, we argue that it is important to disentangle changes in mobility that are due to theintra-generationalcomponent—defined as the transition between the entry job and the job when mature—from those due to the individual’s initial job. The data allow us to consider occupational outcomes both at the start of individuals’ careers, i.e. in their twenties, and when workers are mature, i.e. in their forties, and hence to consider occupations held at different stages of the working life.To disentangle changes in social mobility that are due to theintra-generationalcomponent—defined as the transition between the entry job and the job when mature—from those due to theinter-generationalcomponent, we proceed in two steps, estimating first the impact of parental income on the child’s first-period occupation and then the effect of first-period occupation and parental income on occupation at age 42.4We hence ask whether the decline in mobility observed over the period is due to a greater impact of parental background on entry jobs or if the change has occurred mainly through differences in transition probabilities over the child’s lifetime.Our focus is the comparison between the 1958 cohort and the 1970 cohort. Our data indicate that the polarization that has been observed at the aggregate level in prior work also appears when we consider the employment structure for each cohort. The change in the structure of employment has been particularly marked regarding first-period occupations. Those born in 1958 entered the labour market when middling jobs were plentiful, while those born in 1970 faced greater employment polarization, raising the question of whether intra-generational mobility was lower for the cohort who faced a lower share of middling jobs.To understand the relationship between polarization and mobility, we measure both at the regional level. We consider differences in the impact of parental income on occupational outcomes across large regions, and construct for each region a measure of employment polarization for each cohort. This measure is constructed as a shift-share based on national level changes, the intuition being that the regions where middling jobs were more prevalent before the period of analysis were also the regions where the increase in employment polarization has been the largest. We then regress regional changes in mobility on regional changes in polarization, using an IV approach in which we instrument changes in the share of the various occupations in the UK with those observed in other European economies.Our analysis provides three main results. The first concerns the fact that intra-generational mobility is an essential aspect of the observed correlation between parent and child outcomes. For both cohorts, we find that individuals face a large likelihood of changing occupational category over their career. Notably, around 23% (30%) of those initially in low-paying (middling) occupations are in high-paying occupations when they are 42. In fact, for those who started in low-paying and middling occupations, less than half remain in the same occupation as mature workers, with the probabilities both of moving upwards and downwards being large. Persistence is much higher for those starting in the best-paid jobs, but nevertheless, a third of them experience downwards mobility. Our results hence imply that it is important to understand career dynamics in order to explain the transmission of economic outcomes across generations.Second, we find that the increased impact of family background on children’s incomes identified in previous work also appears when we focus on occupations. Moreover, the reduction in mobility is apparent at all the stages that determine an individual’s occupation when mature. The effect of parental income on first-period occupation and that on the job when mature—controlling for initial occupation—have both become stronger for the younger cohort. These results raise the question of what are the implications of the disappearance of middling jobs for mobility. On the one hand, fewer individuals have access to those jobs when young, and those who do tend to come from better-off backgrounds; on the other, whether or not those in middling jobs move to high-paying occupations is more dependent on parental income for the younger than for the older cohort. The overall outcome are increased differences in intra-generational mobility according to family background. For those at the top of the parental-income distribution, upwards mobility during the working life has risen by about 5 percentage points, both for those starting in low-paid or middling jobs; in contrast, it has declined by around 8 percentage points for those from less well-off families, irrespective of the job initially held. That is, we observe that the possibility of career progression has become more dependent on parental background.Lastly, the regional dimension of our data indicates that employment polarization tends to decrease mobility. Using a shift-share IV strategy we show that a decline in the regional share of middling employment increased the impact of parental income on the child’s occupational outcome, indicating that mobility declined most in regions with greater polarization. This conclusion is supported by the finding, when using individual data, that the effect of parental income on occupational outcomes is stronger for individuals who—when young—lived in areas with greater job polarization.Our work is related to three strands of literature. First, it contributes to the literature on the determinants of inter-generational mobility which has extensively documented the parent-child dynamics in income andsocial class.5Much of the focus has been on how individual characteristics affect income dynamics across generations, notably education, non-cognitive skills,personality traits, and quality of the neighbourhood.6Yet, little attention has been paid to the importance of early labour market experiences. This paper thus provides a bridge between the literatures oninter-generationalandintra-generationalmobility by focusing on access to jobs at the beginning of the career and the subsequent career dynamics, and shows that understandingintra-generationalmobility is essential to understand an individual’s outcome when mature.The idea that lifecycle dynamics are important when examining inter-generational mobility has been explored by a body of work focusing on the bias resulting from the fact that we generally only have a snapshot of the child’s outcomes rather than their lifetime income; seeJenkins (1987).7This literature has explored the relationship between point-in-time and lifetime earnings and found that the estimated effect of parental background is larger the later in the lifecycle the child’s outcome is measured, as shown, for example, byHaider and Solon (2006). Similar results are obtained for the UK byGregg et al. (2017)using the same cohort data as we do. Our paper makes two contributions to this literature. Existing work has compared the impact of parental background on income at different stages of the child’s lifecycle, and we show that a similar result appears when we focus on occupations, which are usually deemed to be more stable than incomes. Moreover, our results help understand the source of the lifecycle bias as they highlight that parental income affects occupational transitions during the child’s early working years.Second, our paper is part of the recent literature in economics that has identified a decline in income mobility, notably in the US and the UK, and our contribution lies in showing that the increased importance of parental income also appears when we focus on the child’s occupational outcome. In doing so, we build a bridge between the approach followed by economists and that used bysociologists. The former have focused on the relationship between parent and child incomes, while the latter have examined the transmission of social class, itself based on occupations. The decline in income mobility identified by economists is less apparent when focusing on social class, as argued byGoldthorpe (2013)who maintains that when looking at the effect of parental class on the child’s class the main change in the late 20th century is a levelling out of the increasing rates of upwards absolute mobility observed in earlier decades. Our framework follows thesociologyliterature in seeking to explain the child’s occupational outcome, yet we use parental income as our key measure of family status, and when doing so we observe a decline in absolute mobility. Our results can be reconciled with the findings by sociologist if within anoccupational groupthe children of those with higher incomes have become more likely to experience upwards occupational mobility than they were in the past.The literature on the increased influence of parental income on children’s income in the UK has found that this effect operates largely through educational attainment. For example,Blanden et al. (2007), using the same data as us, find that the increase in the effect of parental income is mainly due to a strengthening of the effect of family background on educational attainment and on non-cognitive skills.8Our analysis complements this approach in two ways. On the one hand, we emphasize the importance of the structure of employment for mobility. As is well-established, both greater educational attainment and non-cognitive skills lead to better-paid occupations, which in turn determines incomes. We argue that the availability of employment opportunities is essential in order to turn these skills into higher incomes. On the other hand, such work has emphasized the growing importance of parental income for the acquisition of skills, which can be acquired at home or in the classroom; our analysis highlights the importance of initial occupations, which are themselves an additional potential source of learning and skill acquisition.Lastly, this paper adds to our understanding of the consequences of employment polarization. Economists have mainly focused on the distribution of earnings,9although there is some work on its impact on educational attainment or the labour supply (Spitz-Oener, 2006,Verdugo, Allègre, 2020). The task approach introduced byAutor et al. (2003)implies that biased technological change results in both the polarization of employment and a change in wages, and much work has been devoted to trying to understand to what extent polarization has driven observed increases in earningsinequality. Surprisingly, the question of whether employment polarization affects mobility has been largely ignored. To our knowledge, the only exceptions areArntz et al. (2022);Guo (2022);Hennig (2022)andBerger and Engzell (2022).Guo (2022)andHennig (2022)share a focus on educational decisions and how the disappearance of routine jobs affects the incentives to invest in education, which in turn results in a polarization of education and of wages, as well as in lower inter-generational mobility. These predictions are shown to be consistent with the cross-sectional correlation between polarization and local mobility measures, where the latter are those obtained byChetty et al. (2014a)for US commuting zones. Our analysis complements their work in several ways. First, in their setup the occupation of mature workers is determined exclusively by their educational choice; we add the analysis of job-to-job transitions and show that these transitions are essential to understand inter-generational mobility. Second, since these authors rely on the cost of education as a driver of the mechanism they study, their analysis is not suitable for economies where this cost is small or null, as is often the case in Europe. We hence provide a mechanism that is more widely applicable. Lastly, measures of income mobility pull together changes in occupational outcomes and in wages in the different occupations, yet these two have varied in different ways depending on the country. Notably, while in the US mature workers have experienced an increase in wage polarization, this has not been the case in the UK.10Our approach isolates the dynamics of occupations, thus providing a more direct link between the structure of employment and individuals’ labour market outcomes.Also related areArntz et al. (2022)andBerger and Engzell (2022). The approach inBerger and Engzell (2022)is close to that inGuo (2022)andHennig (2022). Using the same US data for commuting-zone income mobility, they find a negative correlation between the local use of robots and the extent of inter-generational income mobility.Arntz et al. (2022)focus on the wages of individuals with different parental backgrounds and how they are affected by technology. Their evidence for Germany indicates that, for individuals with higher education, an increase in the use of computer-controlled tools is associated with a smaller wage gap between those with high-income and low-income parents. This result indicates that technology can sometimes offset the effect parental background, in contrast to the results for the US, and highlights the importance of examining these questions for countries other than the United States.The rest of the paper is organised as follows. We start by presenting a simple model of the effect of employment polarization on occupational mobility inSection 2.Section 3presents the cohort data and describes the structure of employment for the two cohorts along with their occupational dynamics. Our empirical specification distinguishes between the effect of parental income on initial occupations and on the transition across occupations during the individual’s career, and the results are presented inSection 4, examining the changes that have occurred across the two cohorts.Section 5estimates mobility at the regional level and provides evidence on the correlation across regions between the extent of job polarization and changes in mobility.Section 6concludes.",Cecilia,Fabien,Tanguy
"1. IntroductionMost immigrants start their lives in the destination country at a substantial economic disadvantage, as measured by their employment rate or earnings relative to native born populations. The gap with natives gradually shrinks, but some immigrant groups never fully catch up.1A common interpretation for why immigrants’ labor market outcomes improve over time since arrival is the acquisition of host country human capital, most importantly language capital. In fact, one of the most consistent findings in the economics of migration is the strong positive correlation between language proficiency and the economic success of immigrants.2Recent papers have exploited exogenous variation in language training for adult immigrants to estimate the causal impact of language training on the labor market outcomes of the participants.3This paper contributes to this literature in two important ways. First, we use a novel identification strategy and show that a shorter commute to language training increases the total number of classes attended and language proficiency at the end of the three-year Integration rogram. Second, beyond analysing commonly used measures ofeconomic integration(discussed below), we show that more hours of language training makes refugees better integrated into their local community and less likely to move to the main cities of Denmark with large pre-existing immigrant populations. Specifically, we see that mobility out of the immigrants’ originally assigned municipality after the Integration Program and mobility to one of the main cities of Denmark decrease dramatically (by more than 50 percent of the sample mean). We think these are policy relevant outcomes because many countries have policies in place that distribute refugees evenly across the country, and these policies are often counteracted by substantial subsequent mobility.4Consistent withFoged et al. (2023), we find that language training increases enrollment ineducation programsin Denmark. Our estimates imply that additional 100 hours of language training increase the enrollment probability by 3 percentage points or 11 to 13 percent of the sample mean.5The impact we estimate on the employment probability is statistically insignificant but the magnitude and timing is interesting to compare to the existing literature. We find that an additional 100 hours of language training increases the extensive margin of employment by 1.1 to 2.8 percentage points (2 to 5 percent of the sample mean, statistically insignificant) in year 5 after program start. We also consider alternative employment measures but do not detect a significant effect.Foged et al. (2023)analyze a reform in Denmark in 1999 that expanded language training for adult immigrants. Their estimated impact on employment in year 5 after program start is in between our estimate (roughly 1.2) and also insignificant.6Foged et al. (2023)follow individuals 18 years and find that the impact on employment is marginally significant in the long run and accompanied by significantly higher earnings and a dramatic increase in the share working in occupations requiring good interpersonal communications skills.Lochmann et al. (2019)use a discontinuity in an initial language screening test in France to estimate the impact of additional hours of language training assigned to participants who fail the initial test. Their estimates imply substantial employment effects of 100 hours of language classes 3 years after the onset of treatment.7Heller and Mumma (forthcoming)use a lottery for places in the English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) program in Massachusetts and find that individuals who win a seat in ESOL are 3.4 percentage point more likely to have some employer-reported earnings in years 2 to 10 after enrollment.8Finally,Sarvimäki and Hämäläinen (2016)exploit a reform in Finland that restructured active labor market programs for immigrants to include more language training. The Finnish reform increased cumulative earnings over a 10-year period, but the authors did not find a robust effect on employment.Our population consists of individuals who were granted refugee status in Denmark between 2003 and 2013 (1999 to 2008 when we analyze the impact up to 10 years after asylum). Refugees are quasi-randomly assigned to municipalities in Denmark in proportion to municipal inhabitants. The assigned municipality is responsible for finding affordable housing for the refugee, for the provision of language training, and for other support as part of the Danish Integration Program that starts shortly after the individual is granted asylum (seeFoged et al., 2023). The ideal experiment that we aim to mimic with our empirical strategy is one where individuals are randomly assigned to identical locations with different distances to language training. Our most demanding specification compares refugees placed in the same neighborhood (zone) at different points in time and with different distances to language training due to the gradual expansion of language training and the opening and closing of language training centers. Another specification, using much more variation in the data, compares refugees within the same municipality. These comparisons include individuals, who are assigned to different neighborhoods in the same municipality (likely due to the availability of suitable housing at their date of arrival), and therefore, face different length commutes to get to language training. To alleviate concerns that these neighborhoods differ in dimensions that matter for our outcomes, we include measures of job opportunities,access to educationsand ethnic networks within the neighborhoods (zones). Our instrument istravel timeby public transport between very small geographical units in Denmark (zones used to study commuting behavior in Denmark, seeRich and Hansen, 2016).9We show that our instrument is as good as random for the individual refugees conditional on initial location. There is negative selection into attending more hours of language training (likely due to the substitutability between ability and hours of class in the production of language skills). Once we eliminate this selection using our instrument in a 2SLS estimation, we find a larger, positive effect of hours of class on language proficiency and education.Using our reduced form specification (impact of distance) and earlier arrival cohorts we also look into the effects up to 10 years after asylum. The estimated impact on mobility out of the initial municipality and into the largest cities of Denmark seems to shrink over time but remain large and significant. The effect on enrollment goes to zero by year eight after asylum. We do not detect significant changes in employment or unemployment within the 10 year time horizon. We also test the robustness of our results to alternative functional forms of our instrument (log distance and an indicator for distance above median) and use natives in a placebo test of the distance to language training instrument. These placebo tests confirm that job opportunities and proximity of further education are unlikely to drive our results.The next section describes the institutional setting and how the location of refugees and training facilities create exogenous variation in language training proximity.Section 3describes the data and the sample we use. Specifically, the high-quality data on language class attendance and language proficiency and our measure of distance to language classes. The empirical strategy and the identifying assumptions are discussed inSection 4, before we present our results insections 5to8and conclude the paper inSection 9.",Mette,Cynthia,None
"1. IntroductionA large part of the migration literature focuses on migrants’ proficiency in the language of the destination country. It has been shown that proficiency improves labor market and integration outcomes. Language skills increase earnings (see, e.g.,Chiswick, Miller, 1995,Dustmann, van Soest, 2001) and employment (Dustmann and Fabbri, 2003); the probability ofintermarriagebecomes larger and the likelihood of living in an ethnic enclave decreases (Bleakley and Chin, 2010). Given these benefits of language proficiency, potential migrants can be expected to consider language-related aspects in their migration decision and their location choice. Indeed, many studies show that language is an important determinant of migration.1The aim of this paper is to study the effect of the presence of language-learning opportunities on migration. We build a random-utility model. Individuals want to maximize expected utility of migration, of which the expected wage income net of migration costs is an important component. Acquiring language skills of the destination country can increase expected net wage income if the benefits, in terms of higher wages abroad, exceed the costs of learning the foreign language. For our paper, we focus on language learning of adults. We use a unique panel dataset for 69 countries for the period 1977 to 2014 with information about the presence of Goethe institutes collected from the annual reports of the Goethe-Institut (GI).2The GI is an important actor of Germany’s foreigncultural policy, which promotes Germancultureand language worldwide (Auswärtiges Amt and Goethe-Institut, 2004). Via its institutes, it offers language courses and standardized language exams as well as information on German culture and society in many different forms, such as cultural events and libraries.For the 46 countries in our sample with at least one institute, the number of course registrations has shown an increasing trend since 1995. In 2014, there were about 100,000 registrations with a yearly average of close to 70,000 for the period 1990-2014, for which we have registration data. In the same period, 375,000 migrants arrived in Germany from these countries on average each year.Based on fixed-effects (FE) estimations, we find evidence that the number of language institutes in a country is positively correlated with migration from that country to Germany. By distinguishing between institutes that offer language services and those which do not, we can show that the correlation is indeed driven by language-learning opportunities and not by other factors, such as the provision of information about German culture and society. The relation is stronger for poorer countries and for countries that are linguistically and geographically more distant from Germany.For the period 1990-2014, we predict that, on average, there were 16,360 more migrants to Germany every year (if we ignore the two outlier countries, Turkey and Poland3) compared to a hypothetical situation without any language institute. This corresponds to about 7.6% of the total number of migrants from these countries to Germany in that period. To assess the plausibility of our results, it is helpful to relate the predicted number of additional migrants to the number of course registrations in these countries, which amounts to 57,661 for the period 1990-2014.For a causal interpretation, we address the issue of reverse causality following two approaches: First, we consider the strategies and overall objectives of the GI. The GI and the Federal Foreign Office (FFO) jointly decide where to open and close institutes by a complex process.4Even though there are no indications that migration to Germany plays any particular role in this process, a possible impact cannot be fully ruled out. Therefore, second we also estimate migration flows to the German-speaking part of Switzerland. As migration flows to Switzerland do not have any impact on the decision to open or close institutes, the number of institutes can be considered exogenous to those migration flows. At the same time, it is possible that language-learning opportunities affect migration flows to Switzerland, at least to the German-speaking part. With this specification, we find similar results for the effect of the number of institutes on migration flows to the German-speaking part of Switzerland as to Germany. There are no effects on migration flows to the non-German-speaking part, however; this is confirmed by placebo-tests for three additional countries.Furthermore, we apply the common correlated effects estimator (CCE) byPesaran (2006)to control for multilateral resistance to migration (Bertoli and Fernández-Huertas Moraga, 2013). If migration flows do not only depend on characteristics of the origin and destination countries, but also on the attractiveness of alternative destinations, the FE-estimations are biased. In our case, this bias helps us to interpret the relationship between language-learning opportunities and migration flows in more detail, as it allows us to split the total effect into a direct and an indirect effect. We find that half of the effect is a direct effect on migration to Germany by individuals who would not have migrated otherwise. The other half is an indirect effect of redirected migration flows to Germany due to a relative decrease in the attractiveness of alternative destinations following the opening a language institute. There is some evidence that the correlation between language-learning opportunities and migration flows became smaller towards the end of our sample period. We attribute the lower demand for language courses and exams offered by the GI to changes in the composition of migrants and a reduced role of those offers for migration in recent years.Our paper contributes to the literature in several ways: First, our unique dataset provides new information on language learning for a long time period of 38 years and a large number of countries all over the world. Second, these data enable us to focus on language acquisition. To capture the linguistic relationship between the migrants’ mother tongue and the language of the destination country, the literature has often referred to measures of linguistic distance.Adserà and Pytliková (2015)andBelot and Hatton (2012)find evidence of a negative effect of linguistic distance oninternational migrationflows, based on different measures but, asBredtmann et al. (2020)show, this effect is reduced by a large ethnic network in the host region which constitutes a substitute for linguistic proximity. The concept of linguistic distance neglects, however, language acquisition of potential migrants before migration, which can alleviate or overcome the negative effects of linguistic distance.Third, these data further allow us to study language learning acquisition of adults in the context of migration. Language acquisition can happen at different points in time – during childhood or adulthood – leading to differences in terms of costs and direction of causality in the context of migration. If language skills are acquired during childhood or adolescence, the decision is more likely determined by factors outside the learners’ direct control like the schools’ offers of foreign languages. Language proficiency then often comes with few or no costs and might affect later migration decisions.Aparicio Fenoll and Kuehn, 2016,Aparicio Fenoll, Kuehn, 2019use compulsory language learning at school as a measure for language skills and relate it to migration flows. Language learning during adulthood, on the contrary, is more likely a decision of the learners themselves. This decision can be driven by different motives of personal or economic nature, like better job opportunities at home or abroad. In this context, migration decisions might lead to pre-migration language learning. The direction of causality for adult language learners can therefore be opposite to the direction when language learning takes place during childhood or adolescence.Uebelmesser et al. (2022)analyze determinants of German language learning of adults by using data from GI institutes and show that migration is indeed important determinants of language learning.This paper seeks to answer the question whether the provision of language-learning opportunities, possibly by a potential destination country, has an effect on adults’ language learning decisions in the context of migration. This is a topic of large policy relevance in general, and, more specifically, against the background of the new Skilled Immigration Act effective in Germany since March 2020, which aims at migrants from third countries and assigns an active role to the GI (Bundesregierung, 2018;Goethe-Institut, 2018). WhileJaschke and Keita (2021)have found that the presence of GI affects the self-selection pattern of immigrants related to their language skills and relevant labor-market characteristics at arrival, we show that the number of institutes not only affects the quality of immigrants but also their quantity.The remainder of the paper is structured as follows:Section 2describes the history of the GI, its institutional framework and its objectives. Furthermore, it explains the decision process of opening and closing institutes.Section 3presents the data and providesdescriptive statistics.Section 4describes the theoretical micro-foundation for individual migration decisions and presents the estimation strategy.Section 5presents our main results.Section 6, provides evidence to support a causal interpretation and deals with multilateral resistance to migration.Section 7concludes.",Matthias,Silke,None
"1. IntroductionEmpirical literature has shown that entering the labor force during a recession results in a negative wage disparity, called wage scarring, that can last decades (Oyer, 2006;Kahn, 2010;Oreopoulous et al., 2012). Inexperienced job-seekers often have more difficulty finding employment under adverse labor market conditions.Salarynegotiations also strongly favor employers as these individuals have fewer outside offers. As a result, they must accept lower initial wage offers. However, despite these initial disadvantages, it is unclear why a wage disparity persists years aftereconomic conditionshave improved. Two prevailing theories posit differences in human capital accumulation or job search friction as potential mechanisms. Focusing on the latter, I use Salary History Ban laws (SHBs) to test whether this wage disparity partially persists through an information mechanism. A negative wage disparity could persist for scarred workers if their job mobility is constrained by employers screening job applicants on prior wages. Alternatively, if SHBs encourage firms to add salary information to job postings, this could represent new information for scarred workers that incentivizes job switching.I find SHBs both increase job mobility for scarred workers relative to non-scarred workers and reduce the gap in hourly wages and weekly earnings between these cohorts. This finding contributes to the wage scarring literature because it represents the first evidence, to my knowledge, that wage scarring is partially caused by job search friction related to information disparities between employers and scarred workers. This study also offers a unique perspective to the SHB literature as it tests the implementation of these laws for a group that is disadvantaged, not explicitly discussed in the language of thelegislation, and arguably less observable to the firm. To that end, this study helps to better understand how SHBs would work ifdisadvantaged groupswere exogenously assignedlower wages.Several US states began passing SHBs in 2017. These laws explicitly bar employers from asking job applicants about prior or current compensation during the hiring process and in most instances were intended to address gender and racial wage gaps. If gender and racial wage disparities persist because employers use prior salary information to infer candidate quality, then these laws should help close these gaps. Alternatively, given that some job applicants may still volunteer this information, adverse selection could result in an unraveling of this effect (Agan et al., 2020).Agan et al. (2021)provide experimental evidence that employers make negative inferences about the non-disclosing candidates of salary history questions.An emerging empirical literature has provided mixed evidence regarding the effectiveness of SHBs in reducing gender and racial wage gaps.Hansen and McNichols (2020)find that SHBs, particularly California's, led to an improvement in the gender-earnings ratio.Bessen et al. (2020)find that SHBs both increased wage posting in jobadvertisementsand increased pay for job changers, in particular minority workers.Sinha (2022)finds SHBs narrow the gender pay gap by 2 percentage points, and that this is largely driven by an increase infemale earnings. Other studies provide evidence of potential harm from these policies.Sran et al. (2020)find that while SHBs increase wage posting in job advertisements and provide a modest improvement in the gender pay disparity, these laws also result in an overall decline in new hires.Davis et al. (2021)find that public sector SHBs lead to a 3% decrease in new hire wages for public sector workers.To estimate the overall effect of SHBs, I use a difference-in-differences (DiD) empirical strategy that exploits state-by-year variation in SHB enactment on a sample of working-age adults from the Current Population Survey (CPS). I then extend this analysis to account for wage scarring by splitting the sample between “scarred” and “non-scarred” workers using a method proposed bySchwandt and Von Wachter (2019). In DiDevent studieswith each group of workers, I find SHBs raise hourly wages and weekly earnings for scarred workers but have no statistically significant effect on compensation for non-scarred workers. I also find SHBs increase job mobility for scarred workers but reduce job mobility for non-scarred workers. This reduction in job mobility is plausible if higher-paid individuals are less able to use their higher wages as a signal in the labor market after SHBs are enacted (Meli and Spindler, 2019). It is also important to note these job mobility estimates represent relative changes in job switching. If the total number of jobs switched is much higher for non-scarred workers than scarred workers prior to the implementation of SHBs, then a relative decline in job-switching rates for non-scarred workers could still reflect an absolute advantage for non-scarred workers in total jobs switched.1Finally, these event studies also confirm parallel pre-trends for compensation and job mobility both within and between scarred and non- scarred worker groups.For my main analysis, I directly estimate the differential effect of SHBs between workers affected by early-career job-market conditions by using a difference-in-differences-in-differences (DDD) empirical strategy. This model fully interacts the state-by-entry-year unemployment rate2with the original DiD model. For workers who started their careers during a moderate recession, or a 5 percentage point higher state unemployment rate, I find SHBs increase job mobility by 0.6%, hourly wages by 2.65%, and weekly earnings by 5% relative to workers who graduated in baseline labor market conditions. Additionally, I show these estimates represent a 80 to 90% reduction in the original scarring effect for workers with one to five years of experience.Given that SHBs originated with gender and racial wage disparities in mind,3I also test the effect of SHBs on wage scarring between men and women and between whites and non- whites. This represents another contribution to the wage scarring literature as the scarring effect has been found to differ acrossdemographics(Schwandt and Von Wachter, 2019). After splitting the sample between male and females, I use the aforementioned DDD estimation strategy and find that SHBs increase job mobility, hourly wages, and weekly earnings for scarred men and women relative to non-scarred men and women, with a smaller effect observed for men. In a separate analysis, I split the sample between whites and non-whites and find that SHBs have a small effect on wage scarring for whites but substantially raise hourly wages and weekly earnings for scarred non-whites. Additionally, I find that both scarred whites and non-whites increase job mobility relative to non-scarred whites and non-whites. Finally, I observe increased unemployment-to-employment transitions for scarred whites relative to non-scarred whites.This study is also the first to my knowledge to explore a potential policy intervention for wage scarring. Traditionally, wage scarring has been thought of as a catch-up scenario. In a perfectly competitive labor market with perfect information, scarred workers transition to higher-paid positions as the economy improves. Policies that target increased job switching therefore might prove useful (Oreopoulos et al., 2012). However, I provide evidence that an additional information channel may inhibit this process. Although banning salary history disclosure increases job mobility for scarred workers relative to non-scarred workers, much larger relative effects are found with wages and earnings. If compensation growth is partially path dependent through disclosure, then it may not be as simple as scarred workers switching jobs. Each subsequent job switch would still yield less of an increase in wages than their non-scarred counterparts. Absent changes in salary disclosure behavior, compensation parity between these cohorts may require even more job switching by scarred workers. This study also examines how wage scarring estimates can be affected by accumulated experience, trend in the state-by-entry-year unemployment rate, and functional form assumptions.",Joshua,None,None
"1. IntroductionAdverseeconomic conditionshave long-lasting impacts on individuals, especially when experienced during decisive moments in their lives. Individuals who lose a job or enter the labor market when unemployment is high experience persistent declines in earnings (e.g.Altonji, Kahn, Speer, 2016,Aslund, Rooth, 2007,Davis, von Wachter, 2011,Kahn, 2010,Liu, Salvanes, Sørensen, 2016,Oreopoulos, von Wachter, Heisz, 2012,Schwandt, von Wachter, 2019). Recessions also induce increases inhuman capital investmentsin the form of higher post-secondary enrollment (e.g.Atkin, 2016,Barr, Turner, 2015,Barr, Turner, 2013,Betts, McFarland, 1995,Charles, Hurst, Notowidigdo, 2018,Clark, 2011,Dellas, Sakellaris, 2003,Johnson, 2013,Méndez, Sepúlveda, 2012,Sievertsen, 2016), and shifts in choices of college major towards higher-earning fields (Blom et al., 2021). Macroeconomic conditions experienced during early adulthood have also been shown to have a profound impact on people’s risk aversion, expectations, and preferences (Cotofan, Cassar, Dur, Meier, 2023,Malmendier, Nagel, 2011,Malmendier, Nagel, 2016).In this paper, we explore whether the labor market outcomes of college graduates vary systematically according to the economic conditions that they experienced during their late teenage years, around the time when they enrolled in college. We perform the analysis using data for U.S. college graduates from nearly 40 enrollment cohorts. Using an empirical strategy that flexibly controls for cross-cohort differences at the national level and exploits regional variation in economic conditions for identification, we find that individuals who enrolled in worse times have higher annual wage andsalaryearnings than those who enrolled in better times. For both men and women, this arises due to an increase in hourly wages, while women also experience an increase in labor market attachment. The positive impact that we identify is not driven by selection into employment or by economic conditions at the time of labor market entry. Differential sorting across fields of study or into post-graduate education also cannot explain the above-average earnings of those who enroll during periods of high unemployment. Up to one third of the documented effect is accounted for by sorting into higher paying states. We argue that the results are consistent with a behavioral change that leads to greater effort being exerted by people who experience bad economic times at the beginning of their studies.Our analysis uses data for college graduates from the AmericanCommunitySurvey (Ruggles et al., 2020). Following previous literature (Blom, Cadena, Keys, 2021,Schwandt, von Wachter, 2019), we proxy the economic conditions at the time of college enrollment using state-level unemployment rates at the time when individuals turned 18. To account for unobserved differences across cohorts, we identify the impact of economic conditions on future labor market outcomes by exploiting within-cohort variation in local economic conditions across U.S. states – a strategy that is similar toOreopoulos et al. (2012). We focus on cohorts who enrolled in college between 1976 and 2014.We find that U.S. college graduates who experience adverse economic conditions at the time of enrollment have higher earnings than those who enroll during expansionary periods. Specifically, our estimates imply that a 6 percentage point difference in the deviation from the long-run average state unemployment rate at the time of college enrollment – roughly the difference between the deviations in Louisiana and Michigan in 2009 at the peak of theGreat Recession– increases annual earnings by about $1,100 for both women and men.For men, the improvement in annual earnings is mainly due to a rise in hourly wages. For women, it is the result of higher hourly wages, more weekly working hours, and more weeks worked per year. Our results are not driven by selection into employment: graduates who enroll during bad times are more likely to be working later in life relative to those who enroll during good times. The pool of college graduates who enroll in bad times is larger, suggesting that it is unlikely that this group is more positively selected on ability. Moreover, this group is disproportionately composed of students from traditionally underrepresented groups, suggesting that it is unlikely that they are more positively selected in terms of socioeconomic background factors which could drive the higher earnings. Controlling for economic conditions at the time of labor market entry does not eliminate the positive relationship between future earnings and unemployment at the time of enrollment.Previous evidence suggests that U.S. college students who experience economic downturns during their early college years tend to sort into higher-paying fields of study (Blom et al., 2021). We consider changes in the composition of fields of study and differential sorting into post-graduate education as candidate explanations for the wage differentials that we identify. We find that controlling for post-graduate education choice does not reduce the estimated effect of unemployment at college entry on earnings. Field of study choices, meanwhile, explain less than 10% of the estimated differentials conditional on educational attainment, implying that the overall earnings gains (conditional on educational attainment) experienced by people who enrolled during recessionary times are more than ten times greater than the wage bonus that can be attributed to the changes in the choice of major documented inBlom et al. (2021). The choice of state of residence, meanwhile, accounts for up to one third of the estimated effect on earnings.We argue that our results are consistent with a behavioral change in terms of the effort exerted by students who experience bad economic times during their late teenage years when they begin their college studies. Increases in effort in response to adverse economic conditions have been identified in various contexts (e.g.Griffith, O’Connell, Smith, 2016,Lazear, Shaw, Stanton, 2016,Mukoyama, Patterson, Şahin, 2018). Furthermore,Cotofan et al. (2023)show that people who experience recessions during their teenage years give greater priority to income, relative to job meaning, for the rest of their lives. In related work for the U.K., we find that students who enroll during downturns are not more positively selected at the time of college entry (in terms of their GCSE results, a measure of pre-enrollment ability), but perform better in terms of their college grades (Bičáková et al., 2021). All of this evidence suggests that an increase in effort is a very plausible candidate explanation for the pattern that we have documented. An increase in effort may enable individuals who enroll during downturns to obtain higher-earning jobs – in part by choosing more rewarding majors and by relocating to higher paying locations, but also conditional on these choices. It is also consistent with the documented increase in labor market attachment among female college graduates, and with the increased probability of obtaining a college degree among individuals who experience worse economic conditions at the age of 18.Our paper provides several important contributions to the literature. We present new evidence for the U.S. on the long-term earnings consequences of entering college during a downturn. Despite the finding that enrollment in post-secondary education tends to increase during recessions, relatively little is known so far about how individuals who enroll during downturns ultimately perform in the labor market. The results are crucial to our understanding of the long-term impacts of recessions that operate through changes in human capital investment decisions. Our findings complement previous research on the effects of entering the labor market during a recession (or “scarring effects”; seevon Wachter (2020)for a survey of this literature) by showing that economic conditions at the time of enrollment are also important in determining future earnings of college graduates, especially in the case of women. Our analysis also builds on the literature that highlights the important formative role of economic conditions experienced during early adulthood. Our results show that the impacts on preferences for monetary job attributes documented inCotofan et al. (2023)are also reflected in labor market outcomes.To our knowledge, this is the first paper to explore the influence that the economic cycle at the time of college enrollment exerts on future wages in the United States. The only other evidence for a similar nexus comes from our earlier work, which focuses on British college graduates (Bičáková et al., 2021), and from the work ofBlom et al. (2021), which shows that cohorts exposed to higher unemployment during their school years tend to select majors that earn higher wages. Compared toBlom et al. (2021), we show that the earnings gains experienced by people who enroll during adverse economic times extend well beyond what is predicted by the change in major choices documented in their paper. The results are consistent with a behavioral adjustment in effort that induces individuals not only to choose higher-paying majors, but also to obtain higher-paying jobs conditional on their major choice. Relative toBičáková et al. (2021), a key contribution of the analysis in this paper is to study the link between unemployment at enrollment and subsequent labor market outcomes using a much stricter identification strategy than what was feasible for the U.K. Specifically, we are able to flexibly control for unobserved differences between cohorts and exploit only within-cohort variation in local economic conditions for identification, while the analysis inBičáková et al. (2021)relies primarily on between-cohort variation for identification. Using the within-cohort differences across regions of birth and simultaneously controlling for the current regions of residence allows us to assess the importance of geographic mobility, revealing that up to one third of the estimated earnings gap is driven by the fact that individuals exposed to worse economic conditions at the time of college enrollment tend to sort into states with higher-paying jobs aftergraduation. The U.S. data also allows us to study the impact of adverse economic conditions not only on hourly wages but also on labor market attachment (hours worked per week and weeks worked per year – two margins that turn out to be quantitatively important in the case of women). Finally, focusing on the U.S. context is also of interest given that there are key institutional differences between the U.S. and the U.K. For example, the choice of college majors is much more flexible in the U.S. than in the U.K., and there is also much stronger evidence of scarring effects in the U.S. context relative to what has been found for the U.K.",Alena,Guido,Jacopo
"1. IntroductionIt is well known that experiences in early childhood are critical to children’s cognitive and noncognitive development (Carneiro, Heckman, 2003,Cunha, Heckman, Lochner, Masterov, 2006,Knudsen, Heckman, Cameron, Shonkoff, 2006). A large body of research has shown that both targeted and universalearly childhood educationand care (ECEC) programs have positive effects on a wide range of child outcomes.1In recent years, the focus of policy makers has shifted from simply improving access to ECEC to the importance of quality aspects of ECEC institutions. As a result,OECDcountries such as the United States or Germany have adopted policies (i.e., theZero to Five Planand theGute-KiTa Gesetz(Act on good early childhood education and care)) that explicitly address quality issues such as better-qualified staff and better-equipped facilities.The positive impact of ECEC found in previous studies is often explained by the fact that disadvantaged children would experience worse care if they were not enrolled in such an institution (Cascio, Schanzenbach, 2013,Cornelissen, Dustmann, Raute, Schönberg, 2018). Similarly, the most advantaged children show no or even negativetreatment effects, because they would receive high-quality child care even without ECEC (Felfe et al., 2015). Therefore, it is important for policy makers to understand which aspects of ECEC institutions and counterfactual care arrangements are most effective in promoting child development in order to design appropriate policies.This paper exploits a unique feature of the Japanese preschool system to estimate the causal effect of an education-oriented against a care-oriented preschool on children’s cognitive and socioemotional development in adolescence. Before children go to elementary school, almost all of them attend either an education-oriented or a care-oriented preschool. In contrast to most studies examining the effectiveness of targeted and universal ECEC programs, we can compare two high-quality preschool institutions and therefore know exactly the features of the counterfactual preschool setting.2Education-oriented preschools are half-day facilities that provide about four hours educational instruction per day, while care-oriented preschools are full-day facilities that provide care for parents who are unable to provide care for their child for work or other reasons. Evaluating treatment effects of this differential preschool enrollment allows us to draw more precise conclusions about the specific features of ECEC that are responsible for developmental gains.Because OLS estimates are likely to be biased due to selective enrollment, we exploit plausibly exogenous regional and temporal variation in the availability of preschools to identify the treatment effect of attending an education-oriented against a care-oriented preschool usinginstrumental variable(IV) methods. In particular, treatment effects on mathematical and linguistic ability scores, as well as on the socioemotional measure of behavioral problems SDQ, derived from the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (Goodman, 1997), and a quality of life (QOL) measure, based on the KINDLRquestionnaire (Ravens-Sieberer et al., 2006), will be examined using unique Japanese survey data. By further estimating the marginal treatment effect (MTE), we are able to identify the subpopulation that benefits the most from enrollment in an education-oriented preschool, allowing us to better understand the mechanisms through which these developmental gains operate.To identify the causal effect, we instrument the preschool decision with the relative availability of preschool slots in an IV approach.3We ensure conditional exogeneity of the instrument by controlling for an extensive set of child, parental, and municipality characteristics, as well as regionalfixed effects, cohort fixed effects, and region-specific linear time trends. We also discuss in detail potential threats to identification and show that the historical development of preschools in Japan is independent of the regional distribution of skills and human capital (Cameron and Taber, 2004), selective migration between municipalities is not a threat in our context (Kawarazaki, 2022), there are no unobserved municipality characteristics that could affect our instrument, internal migration of parents and demand for child care does not drive the (relative) supply (Kawarazaki, 2022), and there are no compositional changes in enrollment patterns over time. This extensive discussion demonstrates that the relative availability of preschool slots is a valid instrument for the preschool decision.Our results show that enrollment in an education-oriented instead of a care-oriented preschool is associated with strong developmental gains in linguistic achievement. These estimates are robust to the exclusion of ability proxies (i.e., parental education and income), the use of a stricter treatment definition, and the use of an adjusted version of the instrument that is less susceptible to potential demand-side influences. Implementation of permutation tests followingBertrand et al. (2004)for the reduced-form estimates further supports the finding of significantly positive effects. In assessing treatment effects at different ages, we find that cognitive gains (i.e., mathematical and linguistic) materialize at a later stage of compulsory schooling (aged 12 to 15), which seems surprising in the light of previous research. In particular,Currie and Thomas (1995)show that the cognitive benefits from Head Start fade early, rationalizing this finding with the worse environment which treated children would return after completing the program (see alsoCurrie and Thomas, 2000). Although this explanation makes sense in the context of Head Start, schools in Japan are more homogeneous and of similar quality. This implies that disadvantaged children who enrolled in an education-oriented preschool face the same school and neighborhood conditions as their advantaged peers. Within this equal environment, positive effects from early investments are more likely to lead to long-lasting improvements, as suggested by the theory of dynamic complementarities (Cunha and Heckman, 2007).In the next step, we extend our analysis by estimating MTE curves (Björklund, Moffitt, 1987,Heckman, Vytlacil, 1999,Heckman, Vytlacil, 2001,Heckman, Vytlacil, 2005,Heckman, Vytlacil, 2007) to allow the treatment effects to vary with unobserved characteristics that are responsible for children being less likely to attend an education-oriented preschool (i.e., distaste for treatment,Cornelissen et al., 2016). These MTE curves show an increasing pattern, suggesting substantial heterogeneity: children who are least likely to attend an education-oriented preschool benefit the most from it. By decomposing this inverse selection pattern into the unobserved parts of the outcomes when untreated and treated, respectively (Brinch et al., 2017), we find that all children benefit similarly from attending a care-oriented preschool with respect to linguistic ability and the QOL score, while returns to enrollment in an education-oriented preschool are positive only for high-resistance children. This finding suggests that characteristics of education-oriented rather than care-oriented preschools explain the results. In an extensive discussion, we then argue that the educational orientation, shorter operating hours and thus a reduction in maternal labor supply which allow for more interaction with the mother, and stronger peers are the most likely channels.Our study contributes to the literature in several ways. First, previous literature has examined quality aspects of schools that are conducive to children’s development, such as smaller class sizes (Angrist and Lavy, 1999), stronger peers (Bifulco, Fletcher, Ross, 2011,Burke, Sass, 2013,Hanushek, Kain, Markman, Rivkin, 2003,Sacerdote, 2011), and better-qualified teachers (Kane, Taylor, Tyler, Wooten, 2011,Rivkin, Hanushek, Kain, 2005,Rockoff, 2004). In contrast, studies on the effectiveness of such aspects in preschools are still scarce. Evidence from project STAR suggests that smaller class sizes in preschool have a positive short-term impact on test scores, but also improve long-term outcomes such as the likelihood of college attendance, while teacher characteristics seem to play a minor role (Chetty, Friedman, Hilger, Saez, Schanzenbach, Yagan, 2011,Krueger, 1999). Using a reform in the German child care system,Felfe and Zierow (2018)find that a switch from half-day to full-day care is associated with negative effects on socioemotional well-being. In contrast, attending preschool together with high-ability peers seem to have positivespillover effects(Henry, Rickman, 2007,Neidell, Waldfogel, 2010). In addition,Claessens et al. (2014)find that advanced content covered in preschool benefits all children’s school readiness.4Although we cannot quantify the contribution of these aspects to our treatment effects, our analysis confirms that previously studied quality aspects of preschools also play a large role in our context. The institutional setting in which we know all characteristics of the treatment but also the control institution allows us to interpret our treatment effects as results stemming from differences between the two preschools, suggesting that educational orientation, shorter operating hours, andpeer effectsexplain our results.Second, we add to the literature by estimating longer-term effects of universal preschools for children aged 6 to 15. While many studies assess short-term outcomes prior toschool enrollment(e.g., school readiness,Cornelissen et al., 2018), there is limited evidence on the durability of such effects.Berlinski et al. (2008)estimate the effect of preschool attendance on the educational attainment of children aged 15 in Uruguay.Felfe et al. (2015)estimate the impact of an expansion of high-quality child care in Spain on reading achievement and grade retention among children aged 15. Similarly,Gupta and Simonsen (2016)find positive effects of center-based child care on the linguistic achievement for children aged 15 to 16. In contrast,Kuehnle and Oberfichtner (2020)do not find any effect of earlier enrollment in day care for children aged 15 in Germany, andFort et al. (2020)even find negative effects of day care in Italy on a measure of intelligence andpersonality traitsfor children aged 8 to 14.5We add to these studies by estimating the impact for different age groups to obtain a complete picture of the evolution of gains in adolescence. Since this period is critical for acquiring the skills needed to succeed in the labor market, it is important to evaluate the effectiveness of earlier investments not only in the short run but also in the long run.6Third, to our knowledge, we are the first to examine differential effects of the two preschool institutions in Japan on child development. In a recent paper,Yamaguchi et al. (2018b)find positive effects on behavioral aspects of enrollment in care-oriented preschools at early ages compared to home care. Because these outcomes are measured at age 3.5 and enrollment in education-oriented preschools is generally limited to children aged 3 to 5, differential effects between education-oriented and care-oriented preschools are not considered. In addition,Kawarazaki (2022)examines the long-term effects of attending preschool at age 4 and shows that the positive effects on future earnings are mainly due to an increase in educational attainment. We complement these studies by estimating the differential effects of preschool institutions on cognitive and socioemotional development in adolescence. We provide a more detailed picture of the features of the Japanese preschool system that contribute to a child’s development in recent years, which complements the short-term analysis ofYamaguchi et al. (2018b)and the long-term analysis ofKawarazaki (2022).The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. InSection 2, we describe Japan’s preschool system in more detail and explain the institutional background of education-oriented and care-oriented preschools. InSection 3, we describe the data sources used for the empirical analysis. In particular, the cognitive and socioemotional measures are presented, and the instrumental variable as well as the control variables are described.Descriptive statisticsare also provided. InSection 4, we introduce our estimation strategy and discuss the identifying assumptions. InSection 5, we present the results from our first-stageProbit regression, OLS and 2SLS regressions, and MTE estimations. InSection 6, we discuss possible channels and mechanisms that could explain our results. Finally,Section 7concludes.",Hideo,Tim,Chizuru
"1. IntroductionThe value a firm derives from a job match depends on how productive a particular employment relationship is relative to the next-best option for the worker and the firm. Labor economists have long recognized that the presence of match value can help explain important empirical facts, including the life-cycle pattern of job mobility (Neal, 1999,Topel, Ward, 1992), the wage-tenure profile (Farber, Gibbons, 1996,Jovanovic, 1979), the existence of task- or firm-specific human capital (Gibbons and Waldman, 2004) and the costs of job displacement (Lachowska, Mas, Woodbury, 2020,Lalonde, Jacobson, Sullivan, 1993). If match value is a significant feature of the labor market, the end of a job will be damaging for the worker, the employer, or both. As either party can unilaterally destroy a job match notwithstanding potential losses, job destruction can be inefficient when there are barriers to bargaining (Farber, 1999). However, it is not clear how many matches are, indeed, worth preserving, and whether – often expensive – policies designed to preserve job matches are worthwhile.In this paper, we provide evidence that firms likely derive substantial value from even their lowest-level and lowest-paid jobs, and that preserving those matches is beneficial to their growth and survival. Our analysis is based on novel survey and administrative data from Denmark collected in the context of the sudden and far-reaching labor market disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Ordinarily when a job match ends, outcomes are endogenous to changes in the value of the match for the worker or the firm. The nature of the COVID-19 induced economic shock — an abrupt and acute risk to public health — was unique in that, unlike most recessions, nothing fundamental seemed to have changed about the economy. Job matches that were valuable just before the pandemic would continue to be just as productive in the absence of the pandemic. However, millions of workers were idled as workplaces closed and social distancing brought economic activity to a halt. There is evidence that the pandemic did not substantially affect jobseeker’s motivation for job search (Adams-Prassl et al., 2023), but those at the lowest rungs of the job ladder were more likely to be “stuck” in their occupational categories (Carrillo-Tudela et al., 2023). Further, early dynamics in the US were primarily driven by layoffs and recalls (Forsythe et al., 2022) but other countries had substantially different labor market policies of government-subsidized furloughs and grants to firms that kept workers in payroll.Denmark, as other European countries, focused on policies that would save job matches by heavily subsidizing furloughs. Workers furloughed under the program were barred from working, but the Danish government would pay 75 percent of wages for salaried workers and 90 percent for non-salaried, up to a cap of 30,000 (∼4800 US$) DKK per month. The primary outside option was to fire workers. In Denmark, there are no explicit firing costs, but firms are required to give notice in advance of termination, which has much the same effect as a mandatory severance payment. For white collar workers, mandatory notice periods are determined relative to a worker’s tenure and can be several months long. However, for blue collar workers, implied severance costs are quite low. We show that when firms furloughed white collar workers, it would almost always have been much more costly to fire them. However, for the majority of blue collar workers, firms anticipated furlough costs were higher than the cost of simply firing them and paying their wages through the mandatory notice period. From this set of facts, we infer that firms perceived non-trivial value in preserving those jobs.We next address the question of whether, or to what extent, furlough aid was necessary to maintain job matches. Given their lengthy notice periods, firms might have chosen to hoard their white collar workers and possibly some portion of their blue collar workers, too. To consider this, we assess the extent to which the program increased furloughs and reduced layoffs. Because Denmark’s aid programs were open to all firms and there was no randomization of aid, addressing selection into take-up is challenging. We estimate the average effect of aid on aid-takers using two approaches: a conventional model of selection on observables, and by comparing actual layoffs and furloughs to planned layoffs and furloughs firm managers anticipated making immediately before aid became available. We were able to elicit the latter counterfactual choices because our survey was conducted during the first wave of lockdowns. As such, managers were answering our survey precisely when they were making layoff or furlough decisions and waiting to see what type of aid packages might become available. A growing body of evidence shows that managers are excellent at forecasting changes in the inputs and outputs of their own firms under difficult circumstances (Bachmann, Carstensen, Lautenbacher, Schneider, 2021,Barrero, Bloom, Davis, 2020,Bloom, Brynjolfsson, Foster, Jarmin, Patnaik, Saporta-Eksten, Van Reenen, 2019) and we provide supplementary evidence that Danish managers counterfactual forecasts are reliable using data from administrative records.Under both models, we find that firms that took aid increased the share of workers they furloughed by about 24 percentage points. The key question is what firms would have done with those workers otherwise. Using our model of selection on observables, we find the policy reduced layoffs by about 3 percentage points. However, this result is largely an artefact of the negative selection into furlough aid. Our survey data show that firms who took labor aid anticipated layoffs that were 16 percentage points higher than firms that did not. With this correction, the program appears to have reduced layoffs by 24 percentage points; nearly identical to the increase in furloughs. While both models have limitations, we argue that the latter model is likely closer to the true estimate and that the majority of workers furloughed would have been laid off otherwise.By having firms partially responsible for furlough costs, the Danish policy was reasonably cost-effective. The cap on furlough payments nudged firms toward furloughing their lowest-paid workers. Our data show that firms responded to those incentives: the incidence of furlough and the number of furlough days are both decreasing in the worker’s monthly salary. Additionally, the Danish program was relatively well-targeted: most aid was taken up by firms that experienced severe shocks to their revenue and employment. Conversely, we see little change in the revenues of firms that did not take up aid, even among those that were eligible. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the net additional cost to the Danish government (relative to paying unemployment insurance) was approximately US$15 per furlough day for a part time worker, and US$120 for a full time worker.We would expect firms to generally only act to preserve job matches through the furlough program if they thought it would benefit the bottom line. We find that this was indeed the case. To address the endogeneity of take-up, we construct instruments based on the incentives built into the program, which make the total cost savings from furlough substantially higher for some workers than for others. In particular, firms that before the pandemic had relatively high fraction of white collar and highly-paid workers will find furlough more attractive than those that can fire their workers at relatively low cost, all else equal. As the composition of the workforce in each firm was chosen prior to and without anticipation of the pandemic, we use the share of workers eligible for the implied two-week severance pay as an instrument for the decision to take up furlough aid. The IV results suggest that regression estimates are biased downward. The decision to take up furlough aid led firms to be more likely to survive by the end of 2020, to have higher employment growth, and higher sales in December 2020 than they would have otherwise.Our paper contributes to a growing body of evidence suggesting that firms derive considerable value from their low-paying blue collar jobs, and that helping firms preserve those matches can support their recovery from severe, but temporary, shocks to revenue. A job’s value to a firm corresponds to what it would lose if a match were suddenly to dissolve without any other changes to the economic environment. Recent work has shown that firms find it difficult to hire replacement workers when their employees suddenly depart due to death (Jäger and Heining, 2019) and leave-taking (Schmutte and Skira, 2022), and that this is the case even when those workers have less education or are employed in less skill-intensive occupations. Here, we show more directly that firms were willing to pay to hold onto low-paid workers. Our findings thus complement research documenting the difficulty of rebuilding match-specific capital after workers are laid off (Friebel, Heinz, Hoffman, Zubanov, 2019,Lachowska, Mas, Woodbury, 2020). It is also consistent with the observation ofMercan et al. (2020)that recessions may be prolonged when many unemployed workers are trying to match with many vacant jobs.Our paper is also relevant for policy. This is not a new idea in Europe: firms have been engaging with “short time work” policies for decades, andGiupponi and Landais (2022)show that, as long as temporary shocks don’t become persistent, there is evidence these are good policies. However, in the early days of the pandemic, some in the United States felt that providing direct payroll support was unnecessary because low-wage jobs could easily be refilled once the crisis passed (e.g.Zwick, 2020). At least in Denmark, firms seem willing to pay to preserve match-specific capital in such jobs. The value in doing so would be to make it easier to recover. Using U.S. data,Gallant et al. (2021)show that the expected speed of recovery depends on the share of workers that were laid off with the expectation of being recalled. While a full assessment is outside the scope of this paper, we compare the performance in 2020 of labor markets in Denmark and the United States. A key difference between the two countries is that the Danish furlough policy focused much more on preserving existing job matches. Both countries experienced similar levels of labor market slack during the shutdown, but the unemployment rate in Denmark recovered more quickly.1Our results suggest this was a consequence of firms being able to quickly bring furloughed workers back on the job as economic circumstances improved.2We conclude that preserving job matches should be carefully considered as part of the policy response toolkit, especially as disruptive events (including climate and health crises) are expected to intensify (e.g.Jia et al., 2022).",Morten,Birthe,Ian
"1. IntroductionCausal machine learning (CML) methods are new in the toolbox of economists (see, e.g.,Athey and Imbens, 2019, for a review). They are promising for the estimation of heterogeneous policy effects conditional on exogenous covariates, which are often labelled conditional averagetreatment effects(CATEs). Compared to more conventional estimation methods, CML methods have three potential advantages. First, they make it convenient to incorporate many covariates that are potentially responsible for effect heterogeneity. Several conventional estimation approaches also make it possible to incorporate many covariates, but CML methods can avoid in a data-driven way the potential risk of overfitting and are computationally feasible even when the covariate space is very large. Second, CML methods are relatively flexible when dealing with the covariates. Some CML methods incorporate nonlinear and interaction terms automatically. Third, the systematic CML algorithms make it less likely to overlook important effect heterogeneity. However, judiciously conducted conventional approaches may also find important heterogeneity margins. Furthermore, CML methods are largely black-box approaches, which is certainly a disadvantage. Accordingly, it is unclear how much value CML methods can add to economic applications compared to more conventional estimation methods.In this study, I revisit the effects of Connecticut’s Jobs First welfare experiment on the labor supply. Well-established labor supply theory provides clear predictions about the heterogeneity margins of this experiment (see, e.g.,Kline and Tartari, 2016, for a comprehensive summary). However,Bitler et al. (2017)document the limitations of a conventional CATE estimator in terms of its ability to provide evidence for these theoretical predictions. This is puzzling becauseBitler et al. (2006)show that quantile treatment effects (QTEs) can uncover evidence for the theoretical labor supply model. It appears that the Jobs First data contain relevant information that can support labor supply theory, but how to uncover the appropriate heterogeneity by means of conventional CATE estimators is not straightforward.This study contributes to the aforementioned literature in at least three ways. First, I investigate whether CATEs estimated with CML methods can provide evidence supporting the theoretical labor supply predictions of the Jobs First program, which would clearly represent value added compared to conventional CATE estimators. Second, I reveal modeling restrictions that prevent the conventional CATE estimators from revealing more effect heterogeneity. Third, I test whether the estimates of the CATEs and QTEs are nested.Bitler et al. (2017)consider local constant models, which are one of the workhorse methods used to estimate CATEs in empirical economics. Local constant models stratify the sample into different groups defined by the covariates and report subgroups’ average treatment effects. Local constant models uncover effect heterogeneity across groups but report constant effects within groups. There are three potential reasons why local constant models fail to support labor supply theory. First, the choice of the subgroups could be suboptimal. Second, constant effects within groups do not accurately approximate the possibly continuously distributed treatment effects. Third, the covariates used in the local constant models may be insufficient for explaining effect heterogeneity.1Suitable CML methods can overcome all three possible disadvantages of local constant models.2It is essential to understand why local constant models fail to support theoretical predictions in the Jobs First case because these models are widely used, hence, the disadvantages may carry over to other applications.For the main analysis, I use the double machine learning approach proposed inChernozhukov et al. (2018a). This is a generic approach that can incorporate many different machine learning estimators. Accordingly, it is suitable to compare machine learning estimators with different modeling restrictions. I consider the “tree” and the “random forest” machine learning estimators (see, e.g.,Hastie et al., 2009). Tree estimators split the data into mutually exclusive groups defined by the covariates and report effect heterogeneity as the subgroups’ average treatment effects. Similar to local constant models, tree estimators uncover effect heterogeneity across groups but report constant effects within groups. However, tree estimators employ data-driven algorithms to select subgroups, whereas for local constant models, subgroups must be manually selected. Both methods could, in principle, incorporate many covariates. However, it is more convenient to use tree estimators when the covariate space is large. In particular, trees can automatically incorporate different subgroup definitions (based on covariates and interactions between covariates) without precoding. Random forest estimators are ensemble methods. They estimate many trees based on different subsets of the data and covariates and then report the average of the different tree estimates. These features imply that random forest estimators additionally relax the restriction of constant effects within subgroups. Accordingly, the tree and random forest estimators are suitable for relaxing, in a stepwise fashion, the modeling restrictions of local constant models.The results suggest that random forest estimators can provide evidence for the theoretical labor supply model when they incorporate many covariates. This suggests that including many relevant covariates and allowing for continuously distributed treatment effects are important ingredients for establishing a match between theoretical predictions and empirical results in the Jobs First application. Using solely data-driven methods of selecting subgroups, without incrementing the covariates and flexibility of the model, does not seem to improve the matches.Furthermore, the results provide evidence that the CML estimates of the CATEs and QTEs provide disparate sets of information for evaluating the Jobs First case, suggesting that the estimated CATEs do not uncover all of the inherent effect heterogeneity of the Jobs First experiment. Both CATEs and QTEs have advantages and disadvantages. CATEs could be useful to design welfare schemes that optimize the labor supply response of specific target groups or to create assignment rules. QTEs enable the study of the responses of the entire labor supply distribution (in a fully flexible way), but it is difficult to assign these responses to specific groups.Using case studies to demonstrate the capabilities of new methods is common in economics. Recently,Kleinberg et al. (2018)illustrate how predictive machine learning methods can improve human decisions, using the example of bail decisions made by judges.Doriey et al. (2018)launched a causal inference data analysis challenge. Contributors received real-world data to estimate the effects of birth weight on child’s IQ. The real-world data were slightly calibrated such that the ground truth was known by the organizers of the challenge. Their main conclusion is that flexible methods with fewer modeling restrictions perform better, which is coherent with my findings for the Jobs First application.The number of economic applications using CML methods to predict CATEs is rapidly increasing.Davis and Heller (2017)estimate the heterogeneous effects of summer jobs on the probability of committing a violent crime.Taddy et al. (2016)investigate the heterogeneous effects of A/B experiments in online-auctions (eBay) on customer responses.Bertrand et al. (2017),Cockx et al. (2020), andKnaus et al. (2018a)investigate the heterogeneous effects of labor market programs.Farbmacher et al. (2021)estimate heterogeneous impacts of financial circumstance on cognitive performance.Andini et al. (2018),Cagala et al. (2021),Haushofer et al. (2021), andKnittel and Stolper (2019)develop CATE-based targeting rules for economic policies.In the next section, I provide some background information about the Jobs First welfare experiment.

"1. IntroductionDespite apparent progress in civil rights for African American individuals in the United States, the labor market outcomes of Black men deteriorated significantly compared to White men in the last three decades of the 20th century. As depicted inFig. 1, both groups experienced a decline in employment rates during this period, but the decline was more severe for Black men.1One proposed explanation for this phenomenon is that sectoral reallocation of economic activity over this period was especially detrimental for Black men.2This disparate impact could stem from Black workers being more exposed to sectoral shifts due to being overrepresented in declining sectors or being excessively located in areas with a concentration of declining sectors.

Employment and population are calculated for Black and White men between the ages of 25–55 who are not in the armed forces and do not reside in institutionalized group quarters.In this paper, we quantify the extent to which sectoral reallocation can explain the divergence in the employment rates of Black and White men over 1970–2010.3Furthermore, we examine the extent to which the differential impact of sectoral shifts between the two groups can be attributed to differences in exposure versus differences in adjustment to these shifts. In order to accomplish these goals, we first exploit regional variation in exposure to sectoral shifts for each group to uncover differential patterns of labor market adjustment. In particular, we estimate the race-specific elasticity of the local employment rate and population with respect to local labor demand shifts. We then provide a framework that enables us to aggregate the local employment rate responses while accounting for population movements across locations. Lastly, we conduct counterfactual analyses to measure the contribution of population movements and initial sectoral and regional composition of Black and White workers in explaining the predicted increase in the aggregate disparity.We use decadal data from the United States Census to measure changes in our outcome variables at the level of commuting zones (CZs). We create a race-specificshift-sharemeasure for changes in local labor demand by combining lagged local employment shares by sectors for each group and national changes in sectoral employment (followingBartik (1991)). Our measure for local labor demand shifts varies by race due to differences in the initial sectoral composition of Black and White workers within local markets. As a result, the estimated elasticities capture responses to comparable shocks for both groups.4We document that the local employment rate and population vary positively with local labor demand shifts for both groups of workers. In our preferred estimates, we find an elasticity of 0.22 for Black men relative to 0.08 for White men for the employment rate. Although we observe significant changes in population in response to labor demand shifts for both groups, we find limited evidence for lower mobility among Black workers. The estimated elasticity of population for both Black and White workers is around 0.7 in our preferred specification.5The large population responses highlight the importance of accounting for such movements when considering the aggregate impact of sectoral shifts on employment. In particular, one needs to account for individuals who have relocated and potentially secured employment in other locations. In order to do so, it is necessary to impose some structure on how shifts in labor demand in one region affect the population in other regions. To this end, we set up a location choice model where individuals have idiosyncratic preferences for different locations. In this model, we incorporate matching frictions in local markets following the approach ofKim and Vogel (2021). Hence, our model incorporates mobility frictions across markets and matching frictions within markets. The model implies that changes in local employment rates and population in response to local demand shifts depend on the structural parameters that govern these frictions, which can vary across different groups of workers. We show that the parameters of the model can be inferred directly from our estimated elasticities. Further, we use the model to derive a relationship between aggregate changes in employment rates for each group and the estimated local responses. The framework implies that the aggregate employment rate gap depends on howemployment changeswithinlocal markets and how population adjustsacrossmarkets for each group.6The contribution of both of these margins of adjustment to the aggregate employment gap rate depends on the initial composition of workers across locations and sectors, which determines how exposed workers of a particular group are to demand shifts.Combining the estimated local elasticities with our aggregation framework, we find that sectoral reallocation can explain a 2.5 percentage point decrease in the employment rate for Black workers and a 1.2 percentage point decrease for White workers, resulting in a widening of the employment rate gap by 1.3 percentage points. In our sample, the employment rate gap between Black men and White men increased by 7.3 percentage points over 1970–2010. Therefore, our results imply that sectoral reallocation accounts for about 18% of the increase in the aggregate Black-White employment rate gap over this time horizon.In order to understand the forces driving the change in the aggregate gap, we conduct several counterfactual analyses. First, we investigate whether population movements mitigate the overall decline in employment rates compared to a scenario without such movements. When we disable population responses for White workers, we observe no significant change. However, for Black workers, the predicted decline in the employment rate slightly increases from 2.5 to 2.8 percentage points. Consequently, we conclude that the overall change in the employment gap was only minimally influenced by population movements.7Finally, we consider counterfactuals where the initial distribution of employment across sectors and locations was similar for both Black and White workers, resulting in identical exposure to sectoral shifts. Surprisingly, our findings indicate that if this were the case, the employment gap between the two groups would have been even wider than the realized gap. Therefore, the initial employment composition of Black men did not place them at a disadvantage compared to White men. Hence, we conclude that the main factor driving the aggregate gap is not differential exposure to sectoral shifts but rather the differential responses of the two groups within local labor markets.8To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first paper to formally quantify the role of sectoral shifts in widening the aggregate employment rate gap between Black and White men. Our reduced-form findings contribute to an existing body of evidence regarding the differential impacts of local labor demand shocks on the two groups (Batistich, Bond, 2019,Bound, Holzer, 2000,Gould, 2020).9However, none of these existing studies jointly analyze local employment rate and population responses, with the aim of aggregating the local responses to draw definitive conclusions about the overall trends in employment rates for Black and White men.10In contrast, our study not only examines the aggregate impact of sectoral shifts but also explores the role of differential sectoral or locational composition in explaining the disparate aggregate impact between the two groups.In order to aggregate the local responses, we develop a framework that explicitly incorporates spatial links resulting from population movements across regions. Our framework provides an intuitive approach for aggregating local employment rate responses in the presence of migration dynamics. In doing so, our paper aligns with the expanding body of literature inmacroeconomics(Beraja, Hurst, Ospina, 2019,Mian, Sufi, 2014,Nakamura, Steinsson, 2014) andinternational trade(Adão, Arkolakis, Esposito, 2021,Kim, Vogel, 2021) that employs causal evidence derived from local responses to shocks in order to understand the impact of these shocks on aggregate outcomes.Finally, our paper contributes to the literature that seeks to understand the dynamics of racial disparities. An extensive literature on the wage gap between Black and White workers has traditionally attributed a portion of the wage gap to observable characteristics of workers and explained the remainder through theories oflabor market discrimination.11However, given that over the 20th century, measures ofracial prejudicedeclined steadily (Lang and Lehmann, 2012) and the skills gap converged (Card, Krueger, 1992,Neal, 2006), this approach has trouble capturing the persistence of economic disparities by race. Two recent studies byBayer and Charles (2018)andHurst et al. (2021)focus on slowed convergence in the earnings and wage gaps, respectively, since the 1970s–1980s and propose that the effects of decreased discrimination and increased educational attainment among Black workers were offset by increasing returns to certain types of skills that disproportionately benefited White relative to Black individuals. Our paper is complementary to these studies in the sense that we consider a different dimension of changes in labor demand—sectoral—rather than skill-specific, but share their emphasis on explaining stalled racial progress over this time horizon. Furthermore, while these authors consider trends at the level of aggregation of skill or occupation, we leverage the spatial dimension of the sectoral reallocation patterns that occurred during the 20th century by using local labor markets as our unit of analysis. Our findings indicate that while sectoral shifts do play a considerable role in accounting for the gap, there are other factors at play, as a large portion of the gap remains unexplained by sectoral shifts.The rest of the paper is structured as follows.Section 2discusses the data we use in our analysis and how we construct our measure of shocks to local labor demand.Section 3presents our empirical analysis. In this section, we provide details on the methodology we use to estimate the relationship between local labor demand shocks and employment rate and population outcomes by group. We also provide detailed robustness checks of our main empirical results. InSection 4, we outline a model of labor market frictions andregional mobilitythat delivers key predictions about how employment rates and population respond to changes in labor demand for different groups. We show how the parameters of the model can be recovered from our estimates presented inSection 3.Section 5derives a framework based on this model to analyze the aggregate effect of local labor demand shocks on the employment rate gap between Black and White workers. We also use the framework to compute several counterfactuals that shed light on the relevant margins of labor market adjustment in response to sectoral shifts.Section 6concludes.",Div,Carter,None

"1. IntroductionPublic subsidies to private business are an important instrument through which governments sustain employment levels and economic development. While they are on top of the political agenda in many countries in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and the energy crisis, there is great uncertainty regarding their effectiveness. One relevant concern is that public subsidies might end up financing projects that would have been undertaken anyway (i.e., they have no “additional” effect). This would be the case of programs that do not effectively target firms constrained by frictions or market imperfections, a typical example in this respect being small businesses.Small firms make a significant contribution to economic activity and employment opportunities, generating disproportionately more new jobs relative to their employment share.1At the same time, small firms are more likely to miss available growth opportunities, as they depend more on externalfinance(due to limited internal resources and higher volatility of earnings) while having at the same time less access to that (due to greater information and transaction costs, low availability of collateral etc.).2Against this background, however, it is unclear whether public interventions targeting small firms may address these constraints,3and, importantly, whether it is more cost-effective than targeting other firms.In this paper, we quantify the effects and the cost-effectiveness of subsidies targeting firms of different size and age within a large program of public support to private business implemented in Italy for more than 10 years. The analysis leverages an idealregression discontinuity design(RDD), as firms’ applications for subsidies were ranked on quantitative indicators of project quality and funded until the exhaustion of available funds. Comparing applicants ranked just above and just below the cutoff for being funded, we estimate that obtaining the subsidy increases firm employment by 17 percent over a period of six years. When we distinguish applicants by size, smaller firms generate larger percent increases in employment than large firms - respectively, +22 and +8 percent. However, given the difference in the initial size, these percent increases translate into a greater increase in the number of new jobs for large firms than for small firms - respectively, +5 and +0.7 jobs per subsidized applicant. Therefore, thecost effectivenessof the subsidy - in terms of euros transferred to the firm per each newly-created job - is higher for large firms than for small firms close to the cutoff. Specifically, the cost of a new job surviving six years into the program is 866 thousand euros in the case of small firms, as opposed to 159 thousand euros in that of large firms. However, these estimates are only valid across firms close to the cutoff and, as such, they do not allow us to compute the overall cost-effectiveness of the policy.We address this limitation following the approach ofAngrist and Rokkanen (2015), who provide a method for extrapolating RDD estimates away from the cutoff. In a nutshell, their method leverages on the RDD to test (i) ignorability of treatment assignment and (ii) common support conditional on a vector of observable characteristics. The average cost of a new job estimated across all large and small (inframarginal) firms away from the cutoff (121 and 633 thousand euros, respectively) is lower than the cost estimated across marginal firms close to the cutoff. On the other hand, the average cost across all inframarginal firms is slightly higher than the cost estimated close to the cutoff due to a different composition by size. These results highlight the importance of estimating policy effects – whenever possible - over a larger population than only marginal units close to the cutoff. In any event, all estimates confirm that large firms are more cost-effective than small firms. Echoing the findings byHaltiwanger et al. (2013), we also document that, conditional on size, young firms generate larger percent increases in employment and are more cost-effective than old firms.These findings stand in contrast with previous evidence on heterogeneity of subsidy effects by firm size.Criscuolo et al. (2019)document significant employment effect of investment subsidies in the UK and attribute them to the activity of small firms (i.e., up to 50 employees). Interestingly, such effect does not seem to be driven by (the removal of) financial constraints, as young firms also respond less to the policy.Bronzini and Iachini (2014)also find that R&D subsidies in one Italian region only induce an increase in investment by small firms, fully displacing private expenditure in the case of large firms. On a more general note,Denes et al. (2022)find that the crowding out of smallest firms (i.e., up to 20 employees) from a US subsidy program (the Small Business Act) led to lower employment growth, a higher probability of unemployment, andlower wages. Closer to our findings, several works find that the removal of preferential treatment for small firms in India led to increases in profits, employment, and output (Banerjee, Duflo,Martin, Nataraj, Harrison, et al., 2017,Rotemberg, 2019). We contribute to this literature by leveraging on an ideal research design to estimate the effect of an important subsidy program along the firm size distribution.In the next section we describe the institutional context;Section 3and4introduce the data and empirical strategy, respectively;Section 5presents the results, andSection 6concludes.",Federico,Filippo,Paolo
"1. IntroductionAccording to theEuropean Agency for Safety and Health at Work,European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, 2.8 million deaths worldwide occur for work-related reasons every year, corresponding to 67.8 million years of life lost. Additionally, non-fatal work-related injuries and diseases cause 55.5 million years lived in disability. When valued by the average production of a worker, the estimated economic costs of fatal and non-fatal incidents sum up to 3.9% of global GDP.1Besidesthe loss in output, work-related injuries and diseases increase financial pressure on public health care systems and social security systems inaging societies. Consequently, safety and health at the workplace have been recognized as keys to longer working lives andhealthy aging, resulting in broad policy initiatives like those of theEuropean Commission,European Commissionas well as actions specifically targeted at protecting workers from COVID-19 (Biden, 2021).From a normative perspective, policy intervention in occupational safety provision can be socially desirable since the level of safety measures arising from the interplay of firm and worker incentives is likely to be inefficient (Henderson, 1983). This is due to the presence of asymmetric information about health risks, psychological biases in the individual perception of risk, as well as externalities on co-workers and society that individual firms and workers fail to take into account.2A distortion that so far has not been considered in the context of occupational safety provision are labor market frictions that slow down the matching of unemployed individuals to job openings. These can potentially shift safety levels in either direction. On the one hand, stronger frictions increase the time thatunemployed personsneed to find and take up a job. The less frequently they get the opportunity to work, the higher may be their willingness to accept jobs with low safety standards. On the other hand, frictions also increase the time that firms need to fill a vacancy. The longer it takes them to fill an open position, the higher their incentive should be to protect worker health once a match has been formed. Due to these opposing effects, the impact of search frictions on occupational safety isa priorinot clear and deserves formal investigation.This paper studies the provision of occupational safety in the presence of search frictions as featured in the workhorse model of modernlabor economics, the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides (DMP) model. Since occupational safety ultimately affects workers’ mortality, I extend the basic DMP model(Pissarides, 2000, Ch. 1)for mortality shocks. The mortality rate of employed individuals is endogenously determined and the main variable of interest. I solve multiple versions of the model to identify (i) the mortality effect of search frictions and (ii) the mortality effect of externalities relating to matching and bargaining.By solving the planner’s problem with and without search frictions, I demonstrate that search frictions unambiguously increase the socially optimal mortality rate. The planner essentially compares the current costs of safety measures with their long-term benefits. The latter accrue from a worker’s higher life expectancy, which translates into higher lifetime production and utility. Search frictions cause phases of involuntary unemployment, which reduce lifetime production and utility and hence the long-term benefits of safety measures. Therefore, it is optimal to reduce safety measures and accept higher mortality than in a frictionless labor market.If safety measures are not centrally mandated but determined bilaterally between workers and firms, mortality may be further elevated due to two externalities. First, private agents do not take into account that a deceased worker is not just lost for her former employer but for the economy as a whole, reducing aggregate labor supply. I show that Nash bargaining generally achieves to internalize this externality, but also present counterexamples. Second, even if the labor supply externality is internalized, the mortality rate is still affected by the matching externalities common to the DMP framework. In this regard, deviations from the familiar (Hosios, 1990) condition are found to further increase workers’ mortality rates, revealing that both too low and too highbargaining powerare detrimental to occupational safety.I also study the potential of policy to increase occupational safety. While implementing a mortality rate below the one chosen by the constrained planner inevitably lowers aggregate output, I demonstrate how to attain a desired mortality rate at the lowest cost. With such an optimal policy, the aggregate output loss essentially equals the costs of additional safety measures. Detrimental equilibrium effects onjob creationcan be neglected as long as the mortality rate targeted by the government is close to the constrained planner’s optimal rate.The decentralized version of the model predicts a positive relationship between the equilibrium unemployment rate and the occupational mortality rate. I verify this prediction by combining mortality data from the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI) and employment data from the Current Population Survey (CPS). The marginal effect of unemployment on occupational mortality is identified using variation across US states within occupations and age groups. The point estimates obtained from several regression specifications indicate that a one percentage point higher unemployment rate is associated with a 2.0–2.7% higher mortality rate from occupational injuries. Extrapolation of this result suggests that the occupational fatality rate may be 10–15% lower in absence of search frictions.Related literatureMortality shocks have previously been introduced into frictionallabor market models, mainly to achieve a better fit to the data (Postel-Vinay and Robin, 2002). They are an important ingredient in quantitative overlapping generations models such asde la Croix et al. (2013);Marchiori and Pierrard (2012), andSchuster (2021)to match the age and employment distribution in the population. In any of these occurrences, the mortality rate is treated as exogenous. However, deaths are typically neither an unpredictable random event nor are they unpreventable.3Furthermore, none of these papers allows the mortality rate to differ between employment states, while there is ample empirical evidence that mortality increases after a job loss (Browning, Heinesen, 2012,Eliason, Storrie, 2009,Sullivan, Von Wachter, 2009). This paper provides a first effort to extend the search and matching literature for endogenous mortality of employed workers.Health economists have long acknowledged the endogenous nature of death and that socio-economic variables like education,wealth, and earnings affect individual health behavior (Dalgaard, Strulik, 2014,Grossman, 1972,Grossman, 2000). While these variables are interconnected through the labor market, most theoretical contributions to this literature focus only on labor supply.Labor demandis either perfectly elastic (Capatina, 2015,Galama, van Kippersluis, 2019,Strulik, 2022) or stipulates that firms hire in a competitive labor market (Frankovic and Kuhn, 2019). Two recent papers,Galama and van Kippersluis (2019)andStrulik (2022), explicitly consider work-related mortality. In these papers, individuals are rewarded for higher “job-related health stress” by receiving a higher wage according to a function specified by the authors. While my model gives rise to a similar gradient between mortality and wages at the individual level, this emerges endogenously from worker-firm negotiations. The resulting equilibrium mortality rate then balances worker and firm incentives, which is the traditional view in the literature on occupational health and safety (Pouliakas and Theodossiou, 2013). By contrast, the work-related mortality rate is fully determined by the worker inGalama and van Kippersluis (2019)andStrulik (2022).4Workplace safety is an important non-wage amenity of a job that has been considered in the literature on compensating wage differentials and hedonic wages for many decades (Thaler and Rosen, 1976). However, only a few papers have studied non-wagejob characteristicsin a labor market with search frictions.Blau (1991);Bonhomme and Jolivet (2009);Pinheiro and Visschers (2015);Sullivan and To (2014), andJarosch (2023)estimate job search models where the amenity of a job is drawn from an exogenous distribution. Endogenous provision of amenities has been discussed byDey and Flinn (2005);Flabbi and Moro (2012);Hall and Mueller (2018);Hwang et al. (1998);Lang and Majumdar (2004), andBobba et al. (2022). While some of these papers consider workplace safety among the provided amenities, none takes into account its consequences on life expectancy or mortality.5The paper proceeds as follows.Section 2solves the planner’s problem for the socially optimal mortality rate in a frictionless labor market.Section 3introduces the search frictions and solves the planner’s problem in the frictional labor market, before turning to the decentralized economy inSection 4. InSection 5, the main testable model prediction is verified using data on fatal occupational injuries from the US, and the quantitative effect of search frictions on work-related mortality is estimated.Section 6concludes.

"1. IntroductionFinancial support to families with children comes in many appearances: tax credits, deductions, conditional and unconditional cash transfers. The primary aim of child benefits is to promote the well-being of children, but it is also widely acknowledged that the design matters for femaleempowerment(Duflo 2012;Woolley 2004;Fiszbein et al. 2009). A common policy view is that transfers to families with children should be targeted to mothers, because control over money strengthens the economic independence of mothers, and, additionally, leads to more investments in children.1Recently,Almås et al. (2018)showed that poor married mothers indeed are willing to accept a lower total transfer to the family in exchange for controlling the money. But gender targeted transfers can also be criticized from a gender equality perspective. The argument goes that mothers and fathers share responsibility for their children and, therefore, both should receive child benefits as a signaling device.The latter line of reasoning was central when Sweden in 2014 went from a gender-targeted to a gender-neutral system ofchild allowances, which is the most important cash-transfer to families with children in Sweden.2Conditional on the number of children, the allowance is a universal lump-sum transfer (on a monthly basis) independent of the parents’ income,wealth, and other characteristics. Public spending on this transfer program is considerable, and especially for low-income single mothers, the monthly allowance is an important source of income.Before the reform, up to March 1, 2014, mothers (under normal circumstances) were entitled to the entire child allowance. In the new gender-neutral system, parents are equally entitled to the allowance, and the default disbursement option is a 50/50-split between the mother and the father. The transition from the old to the new system created a unique quasi-experimental setting where thedefault disbursement optiondepended on the child's birth date (before/after March 1, 2014). Mothers of children born prior to March 1 were entitled to the entire child allowance up to this date, and these mothers therefore by default received the first allowance(s). By contrast, mothers of children born after March 1 instead received 50% of the allowance by default. The entitlement structure after March 1 was the same irrespectively of whether the child was born before or after the reform: parents who were living together were entitled to 50% each of the child allowance, and a lone parent was entitled to 100% of the allowance if the child primarily lived with him/her. Parent couples with a 50/50-entitlement were free to actively change benefit recipient whenever they desired. Other important features of the choice environment, like the total benefit level, were held constant. Thus, after March 1, the only difference between the two groups lies in the default benefit recipient.The purpose of this paper is to estimate the causal effect of the default transfer recipient on the long-term division of child transfers and other outcomes related to gender equality in a setting where entitlements are held constant. We consider the 100%-to-the-mother default as the treatment or thenudge, which we evaluate relative to the 50/50-default.3The purpose of the paper is, hence, not to evaluate the reformper se.4Instead, we evaluate a hypothetical policy that offers a compromise between the traditional gender-targeted system and the completely gender-neutral system that is currently in place in Sweden. We have a special focus on separated and on lone parents (when the child lives with only one of the parents): in those cases, the division of child allowances is more likely a high-stake choice.5Firstly, we study the causal effect of the 100%-to-the-mother default, relative to the 50/50 default, on actual long-run disbursements inthe entire population of parent couples. We find that the 100%-to-the-mother default had a huge and persistent impact on child allowance disbursements. One year after childbirth, the share of parental couples allocating 100 percent of the transfer to the mother was 55 percentage points higher when exposed to the 100%-to-the-mother default. The “power of default”, caused by individuals’ tendency to remain passive, has earlier been documented in several other contexts, e.g., retirement savings (Madrian and Shea 2001) and organ donations (Johnson and Goldstein 2003), but never in the context of family cash transfers. Note, however, that a shift in disbursement from the father to the mother does not necessarily imply a change in the two parents’economic conditions, because parents can always transfer money between them, and may hold joint bank accounts. Even though previous studies suggest that Swedish couples do not perfectly pool their incomes (Cesarini et al. 2017;Gelber 2014), it is in general difficult to tell to what extent the reallocation of disbursements represents a real resource transfer to women.Secondly, we estimate the effect of the default option onthe population of separated parents.6These parent couples are arguably more interesting than non-separated couples, because they are unlikely to pool their incomes. We find that the default option had a significant effect on divorced parents at all income levels, including low-income parents for whom the child allowance constitutes a significant share of the disposable income.7These findings suggest that the 100%-to-the-mother default shifted resources from separated fathers to separated mothers, also when stakes were high. The salient response among separated couples indicates that there are substantial costs (e.g. psychological) of claiming the allowance at the expense of the ex-partner.Thirdly, we estimate the effect of the default option on a particularly interesting subgroup, namely separated parent couples where the mother receives child support payments from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency (SSIA). In this subsample, where we can be sure that the child solely lives with the mother, mothers are fully entitled to the entire child allowance, and the allowance is important to theirliving standards. Still, we document a causal effect from the default option on disbursements.8The share of mothers receiving 100% of the allowance increases from just above 90% under the 50/50-split default to 100% under the 100%-to-the-mother default. Hence, almost 10% of mothers fail to claim the allowance they are entitled to when they only receive 50% by default. One potential explanation is that eligible mothers are reluctant to upset their ex-partners. Another factor could be that mothers confuse the initial disbursement with their entitlement. In any case, this result highlights that the default option is far from being a curiosity in this context.Returning to the entire population of parents, we show that a substantial fraction (40 percent) of parents of new-born children in the 50/50-regime choose to actively redirect the entire allowance to the mother. Active parents are on average more gender traditional, and they have lower income and education than parents who follow the default of an equal split. For example, mothers in active couples take the lion's share of the paid parental leave. This evidence is in line with the results presented inAlmås et al. (2018)showing that especially low-income mothers prefer controlling the transfer.Finally, using our birthday discontinuity, we estimate thecausalimpact of the default on outcomes related to gender equality. An explicit intention of the 2014 reform, including the 50/50-default, was to signal shared responsibilities for the children.9However, exploring the exogenous variation in default disbursement, we find no significant causal effects on the division of earnings, temporary paid parental leave, and regular paid parental leave.10The lack of causal effects is consistent with the recent analysis ofArmand et al. (2020)who also found zero effects on time allocation outcomes of introducing gender targeting ofconditional cash transfersin the Republic of North Macedonia.The paper unfolds as follows. In the next section, we present the institutional setting and data. InSection 3, we outline our empirical strategies and inSection 4we analyze the effects of the default option on the long-term allocation of child allowance disbursements. InSection 5, we focus on outcomes related to gender equality, andSection 6concludes the paper.",Erica,Olof,Håkan
"1. IntroductionThroughout the twentieth century, earnings and labor market participation rates of men and women converged alongside economic development in many middle- and high-income countries (Goldin, 1995). A large share of women moved from unpaid production in the home or in family businesses to being wage-earners in the labor market. With the inflow into paid employment, women have also become directly exposed to labor market shocks, such as job loss. While a large literature has established that job loss leads to persistently lower earnings and higher unemployment rates in the long run (e.g.Huttunen et al. (2011);Ichino et al. (2017);Jacobson et al. (1993);Lachowska et al. (2020)), an understanding ofgender differencesin labor market recovery following job loss remains unexplored.This paper investigates what are the effects ofwomen’sandmen’sjob loss on future labor market outcomes. The literature provides several potential explanations for why there may exist gender gaps after job loss. One important factor is the constraint that child care may impose on women’s labor market recovery. Much evidence shows that the arrival of children drives a wedge between men’s and women’s labor market trajectories (Harkness and Waldfogel (2003);Angelov et al. (2016);Kleven et al. (2019b);Lundborg et al. (2017)). Women are likely to change jobs into more family-friendly workplaces around the arrival of their first child (Hotz et al. (2017);Nielsen et al. (2004)), and gender differences in willingness to commute and search-behavior increase with parenthood (Bütikofer et al. (2020);Le Barbanchon et al. (2021)). These factors may affect labor market outcomes following job loss. Another important source of overall gender gaps is differences in human capital, broadly defined to include education, occupation, and other types of sorting in the labor market (Card et al. (2015);Gallen et al. (2019);Goldin (2014);Goldin and Katz (2016);Petersen and Morgan (1995)). Such differences might affect disparities in labor market recovery. In this paper, we will try to disentangle the roles these two channels play for recovery following job loss.To do so, we rely on full population employer-employee matched data from Denmark. The main advantage of our setting is the high quality of the Danish administrative data. In addition to relevant worker and firm-level information, we have linkable background information on each individual, such as their labor market experience, education, and family characteristics. Beyond estimating gender gaps following displacement, we are able to decompose the gender gaps into child-relatedinequalityand inequality related to labor market experience.To identify the effect of job loss on labor market outcomes, we use variation in job displacement from plant closures. As this is initiated by a firm-level shock, it makes the job loss and the timing plausibly exogenous to the individual. Our treatment group consists of men and women, who are employed at the closing plant within manufacturing at least one year before the first year of closure and have experienced one plant closure between 1995 and 2006. We defined the control group as workers matched on sociodemographic characteristics employed in a plant that is not closing. Our identifying assumption of the displacement effect is that the labor market outcomes of the individuals in the displacement and control groups would have evolved similarly over time in the absence of the displacement. We verify this parallel trends assumption by examining the leads to the event. We compute the gender gaps following displacement as the differences in labor market trajectories of men and women following the plant closure, which can be understood as the unconditional gender gap in displacement. To account for gender differences in confounding factors, we perform matching of men to women providing us with a new sample containing men similar to the women on observable characteristics. This allows us to compute the conditional gender gap. While the unconditional gap is the policy relevant estimate, the conditional gap is important for understanding the source of persistent gender gaps.We find substantial gender gaps in the risk of unemployment following job loss. For both men and women, job loss leads to a reduction in earnings and an increase in unemployment for at least six years. Women on average experience a 14.2 percentage point increase in the probability of unemployment over the first two years, while for men this is lower at 9.8 percentage points. This amounts to a relative gender gap of 45% in the risk of unemployment. Over time, the gender gap in unemployment risk decreases and closes four years after job displacement. Women also experience a larger relative loss in earnings. In the first year, the unconditional relative gender gap in the change in earnings is 44% (8.6 percentage points), as men lose on average 19.6 % of their earnings while women lose 28.2 % of their earnings. In the fourth year following displacement, the gender gap disappears. We don’t find a gender gap in participation rates.Heterogeneity analysis shows that workers with little formal training face the most adverse labor market trajectories after job loss with a large relative gender gap. Meanwhile, there is little or no gender gap among workers with vocational training or higher education. While women are worse off across all age groups, older women face the greatest absolute risk of unemployment and the biggest drop in earnings. However, the relative gender gaps are greatest among workers between ages 35 to 50. We also show that the relative gender gap increases by 2.5x from 33% in households without children to 80% in households with children. To disentangle why women are consistently worse off, we turn to the relative importance of human capital and the role of child care. The conditional gender gaps, controlling for differences in human capital, are smaller but never fully closed. Subsequently, we perform aKitagawa (1955)-Oaxaca (1973)-Blinder (1973)decomposition. We show that gender differences in human capital explain 1/3 of the gap in unemployment and 2/3 of the gap in earnings. Child care is an important contributor to the residual gap. If men and women were equally affected by the presence of small children, the gender gap in earnings would have been halved and the gender gap in employment would have been reduced by 1/3. Finally, we show that initial sorting across occupations and sectors does not affect the gender gap in unemployment following displacement.The main contribution of this paper is to address a shortcoming in the existing literature on adverse outcomes following job loss: the almost complete absence of women. In this literature, it is common to purely focus on male workers (e.g.Oreopoulos et al. (2008);Sullivan and Von Wachter (2009);Browning and Heinesen (2012);Davis and Von Wachter (2011);Halla et al. (2020);Huttunen et al. (2011);Seim (2019)).1Even among the studies that include women in their sample, they seldomly address gender differences (e.g.Eliason and Storrie (2006);Jung and Kuhn (2018);Lachowska et al. (2020);Rege et al. (2009)). This tradition implies that conditions and constraints that are particularly important for women have not been identified and investigated. The paper closest to ours is the work byIlling et al. (2021)who use German data to compare men and women and find that women’s earnings losses are about 35% greater than men’s upon displacement. This is partly driven by women being more likely to take up part-time work and mini-jobs, but also by lower earnings in full-time jobs.2We contribute with an explicit analysis of gender gaps in labor market outcomes following displacement and explore the circumstances under which gender gaps are mitigated or exacerbated. We decompose the gender gaps and show that men are better able than women to recover as a result of higher levels of human capital and by not being constrained by child care.Existing evidence shows that trade-pressure has led to an increase in labor market polarization (Autor et al. (2015);Hummels et al. (2014)) alongside a rise in service-based employment and has reduced gender gaps in labor market opportunities and outcomes (Ngai and Petrongolo (2017);Petrongolo and Ronchi (2020)). However, there is little evidence of how this transition affects gender gaps among workers in declining sectors.3In our sample, women constitute 30% of the exposed workers. We focus on closing plants in manufacturing and document that, within goods production, women are worse off.Our paper also contributes to the literature on gender gaps and parenthood. It is well-established that women’s labor market trajectories drop dramatically at the onset of parenthood (Angelov et al. (2016);Berniell et al. (2021);Daniel et al. (2013);Delecourt and Fitzpatrick (2021);Ejrnæs and Kunze (2013);Harkness and Waldfogel (2003);Kleven et al. (2019b);Lundborg et al. (2017)). This is partly attributed to reduced labor supply and employment in more flexible settings (Hotz et al. (2017);Kleven et al. (2019b);Nielsen et al. (2004)). When the responsibility of child care falls disproportionately on women, it likely imposes a barrier to labor market recovery.4We document that having children increases the gender gap following job loss, regardless of mothers’ characteristics. This provides insights into the mechanisms of the child penalty. Even after going back to work post birth, mothers’ ability to adjust to labor market shocks is constrained by child care responsibilities.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the institutional background, data, and the definition of plant closures. Section 3 presents the research design. Section 4 contains the results along with robustness checks, and Section 5 discusses the mechanisms behind it. Section 6 concludes the paper.",Ria,Anne,None
"1. IntroductionDespite a considerable decline in the gender pay gap over the last decades, pronounced differences between women and men remain a salient characteristic of many labor markets (Blau and Kahn, 2017). A large share of pay differences is explained by different job profiles with respect to occupation,industry, and extent of work. However, it is less clear what mechanisms drive these differences. Labor market outcomes are eventually determined in equilibrium by the choices of both workers and firms. While female and male workers might make different choices, it is also possible that selective hiring decisions of employers contribute to the observedgender differences. Disentangling these supply and demand factors is difficult with conventional labor market data such as employment records andlabor force surveysbecause the data often only contain realized labor market outcomes but provide little information on channels and mechanisms.This paper exploits a unique combination of different data sources to obtain new evidence on gender differences in the job-search process. We supplement unemployment registers from Austria with detailed data on vacancies and job referrals made to jobseekers. When registered at the public employment office, Austrian jobseekers are assigned caseworkers who refer them to suitable vacancies in their database. Using detailed records of these applications allows us to compare the application success rates of women and men while accounting for differences in vacancy types.We find that women and men are equally successful in getting hired via such a referral even though male jobseekers receive more referrals. Women also need longer to get hired through a job referral, contributing to longer unemployment spells. Next to overall gender differences, we estimate a strong positive age-gradient in hiring rates for women, whereas differences by age are only modest for men. Looking separately at firm and worker rejections as reasons for unsuccessful referrals, we find that the gender-age differences are driven by firm rejections.Because employers in Austria are required to specify at least a base wage in job ads, the vacancy data also allow us to evaluate the pay prospects of referred jobs. We find that younger women (below age 35) are less likely to be hired for higher-paying jobs, suggesting that differential success rates during the search process widen the gender pay gap.A potential explanation for these observed differences in referral rejections is the hiring discrimination of young women. If workers (temporarily) go on leave, employers must search for and train a replacement. To avoid additional costs, they might refrain from hiring women in their fertile age. Recent studies provide evidence for substantial replacement costs of firms related to worker absence and turnover, in general, (Jäger and Heining, 2022), and in connection with parental leave (Ginja, Karimi, Xiao, 2023,Huebener, Jessen, Kuehnle, Oberfichtner, 2022,Schmutte, Skira, 2022).Using administrative records on paid parental leave spells in Austria, we illustrate differences in future leave-taking between male and female jobseekers at different ages.1Fig. 1shows that about 30 percent of the 25- to 30-year-old women start a parental leave spell (of at least 6 months) within 5 years after the start of their job search spell. By age 45, women’s parental leave take-up has steadily declined to 0. For male jobseekers, the estimated shares are close to 0 at all ages. Given these stark differences in leave probabilities, employers might prefer to hire men, or older women, to minimize the risk of having to replace their hires again in the near future.Download :Download high-res image (212KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. Parental leave probabilities by gender and age.Note: This graph shows the share of female and male jobseekers who took paid parental leave spells for at least six months within the first 5 years after the start of their job search spell. The shares are computed based on all job search spells in our estimation sample that started between 2011 and 2013 (1,333,335 observations).Moreover, we estimate that gender-age differences in hiring rates are more pronounced for permanent jobs and occupations with longer average job duration, which serve as proxies for worker replacement costs. On the contrary, differences are smaller in tighter labor markets. If there are few jobseekers relative to job openings, employers might have limited scope for discrimination when needing to fill vacancies.Our study connects to various strands of the literature on gender differences. A closely related study byFluchtmann et al. (2021)examines the job search process of UI benefit recipients in Denmark. Tracking job applications and vacancy characteristics, they estimate large gender differences in potential wages of jobs to which unemployed workers applied, which account for 70 percent of the eventual gender wage gap. A few recent studies use job board data to infer the hiring preferences of employers.Kuhn and Shen (2013)document that Chinese job ads used to specify gender preferences, especially when hiring for low-skilled jobs. When explicit gender preferences were banned from job ads, successful callback rates of the previously excluded gender substantially increased (Kuhn and Shen, 2021). Similarly,Card et al. (2021)estimate large effects of a ban on gender preferences in Austrian job ads. Despite a substantial increase in diversity, they do not find evidence for an impact on future labor market success as proxied by wages and job duration. In contrast to our study, these papers reveal idiosyncratic gender preferences of employers but do not focus on gender-age differences and the potential impact of future fertility on hiring success.To examine discrimination in the labor market, many studies rely on correspondence tests (Baert, 2018). By randomly assigning key worker characteristics to otherwise similar job applications, it is possible to quantify the effect of these characteristics on callback rates. Previous studies find some evidence for discrimination against women in their fertile ages, although the degree often differs by type and extent of advertised jobs (Baert, 2014,Becker, Fernandes, Weichselbaumer, 2019,Correll, Benard, Paik, 2007,Petit, 2007).Petit (2007)uses age, marital status, and the number of children to signal the probability of future childbearing and find that callback rates of jobs requiring higher qualifications are lower for young women relative to young men. Employing a comparable correspondence test, a recent study byBecker et al. (2019)finds similar effects for part-time job vacancies. While these correspondence studies allow a clear identification of causal effects, they can only focus on the impact on callback rates. Discrimination could also occur at later stages of the application process, which often involves a personal job talk that allows further screening of applicants. Even when employers initially do not consider parental-leave risk as an exclusion criterion, they might instead choose a male over a female worker if the screening of applicants results in multiple qualified candidates. Consequently, the full extent of hiring discrimination would not be reflected in callback differences.Next to hiring decisions, expected future childbearing might also inhibit women’s advancement within a company. Using data from the Austrianmicrocensus,Winter-Ebmer and Zweimüller (1997)document unequal treatment of men and women, but they cannot find evidence that the probability of future fertility explains observed gender differences in jobpromotions. Finally, our study relates to the growing literature onmotherhood (or child) penalties, which quantify the career costs of childbearing in the labor market (Angelov, Johansson, Lindahl, 2016,Bütikofer, Jensen, Salvanes, 2018,Hotz, Johansson, Karimi, 2018,Kleven, Landais, Posch, Steinhauer, Zweimüller, 2019). Comparing changes in earnings after the birth of the first child,Kleven et al. (2019)find that substantial decreases can only be observed for women and that the effect is particularly large in Austria. We argue that gender differences can already arise before parenthood if employers anticipate future leave decisions of workers. As such, these costs can also be seen as a form of motherhood penalty that applies to all women regardless of their future fertility choices.",Omar,Lennart,None
"1. IntroductionMany developed countries have advanced access to flexible working arrangements during the last decades, often by easing the transition between full-time and part-time employment through statutory rules (Hegewisch et al., 2009). However, actual take up of part-time employment remains strongly gendered: One in four women in theOECDworked part-time in 2021, but fewer than one in ten men.1One reason explaining the gap between availability and take up of part-time work is the negative stigma associated with part-time employment (‘flexibility stigma’, seeChung, 2020,Williams et al., 2013). Workers associate part-time work with negative career outcomes, including lower chances ofpromotion(Chung, 2020), as well as short-term (Schrenker, 2023) and long-term wage penalties (Boneva et al., 2021).In this paper, we study whether workers form expectations about the consequences of working part-time based on misguided causal inference. Previous research shows that individuals often struggle to distinguish between correlation and causation.2Causal misperceptions can result in behavioral distortions (Spiegler, 2020a), and agents who confuse correlation and causation can be systematically fooled (Horz and Kocak, 2022,Spiegler, 2020b). One particular challenge when inferring from correlational information is the presence of data selection. Individuals may neglect that they only observe a selective sample when they observe the outcomes of other individuals (‘selection neglect bias’), which can lead to biased expectations about their own outcomes (e.g.Barron, Huck, Jehiel, 2019,Jehiel, 2018,Koehler, Mercer, 2009,López-Pérez, Pintér, Sánchez-Mangas, 2022).In the context of part-time employment, individuals may try to learn about the consequences of working part-time by observing the career outcomes of other part-time employed workers. However, part-time and full-time workers differ substantially in their characteristics, as well as labor force attachment and work experience (e.g.Blundell, Costa Dias, Meghir, Shaw, 2016,Fernández-Kranz, Paul, Rodríguez-Planas, 2015), so observable differences in pay between part-time workers and full-time workers are strongly driven by worker selection and systematic sorting (e.g.Fernández-Kranz, Rodríguez-Planas, 2011,Manning, Petrongolo, 2008). Existing research documents large raw gaps in pay between full-time and part-time workers in the range of 20 to 30 percent (seeSchrenker, 2023, for an overview), whereas estimates of selection-corrected part-time wage penalties are usually much smaller (e.g.Aaronson, French, 2004,Gallego-Granados, 2019,Hirsch, 2005,Manning, Petrongolo, 2008,Matteazzi, Pailhé, Solaz, 2014,Paul, 2016,Schrenker, 2023). Hence, workers who infer from observed pay gaps about the consequences of switching between full-time and part-time work may substantially overestimate the true penalty or premium of working different hours, which may lead to suboptimal labor supply choices.To examine if workers wrongly draw causal conclusions from average full-time/part-time pay gaps, we ask three research questions. First, do workers believe full-time and part-time workers earn differenthourly wage rates? Second, what is the perceived causal effect of switching between full-time and part-time employment for a given worker? Third, how do perceived causal effects relate to perceived raw gaps in pay between full-time and part-time workers, and do beliefs reflect selection neglect?To answer these questions, we implement a survey module combined with an information experiment in the Innovation Sample of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP-IS) between 2016 and 2019. The SOEP-IS is an annual panel survey representative of German households with high quality data collection and face-to-face interviewing.In the non-experimental part of the survey, we elicit workers’ beliefs about the mean hourly wage rate earned by full-time workers in their occupation, as well as the mean hourly wage rate earned by part-time workers in their occupation. We use these measures to quantify respondents’ beliefs about the perceived difference in hourly pay between full-time and part-time workers. Furthermore, we measure workers’ beliefs about the causal part-time wage penalty. We define the causal part-time penalty as the change in hourly pay that a given worker experiences when switching between full-time and part-time employment. Specifically, we ask respondents to consider a hypothetical scenario of switching between working 40 h per week and 20 h per week,ceteris paribus, and then provide an estimate of the expected change in hourly wage rates associated with this transition. Respondents provide three different estimates for this hypothetical scenario: i) the predicted wage change for an average full-time worker in their occupation switching to a part-time position, ii) the predicted wage change for an average part-time worker in their occupation switching to full-time, and iii) respondents’ self-expected wage change when switching between full- and part-time employment, which depends on the current employment status of the respondent (full- or part-time). The non-experimental survey data allow us to quantify the perceived raw difference in hourly pay between full-time and part-time workers, as well as the perceived causal effect of switching between full- and part-time work. To study selection neglect, we analyze descriptively whether workers distinguish between correlation and causation by examining whether they expect causal effects that are quantitatively similar to the raw wage gap they believe exists between full-time and part-time workers. To test for selection neglect more formally, we further design and implement an information experiment, described next.The experiment allows us to causally estimate whether workers infer from average pay gaps about the causal part-time penalty. It consists of two treatment groups who receive different information, and one control group who receives no information. Participants are randomly allocated to one of the three groups with equal probability. The first treatment group receives information about the average gap in hourly pay between full-time workers and part-time workers in the German population. We elicit self-beliefs about the causal part-time penalty post treatment, using the same survey instrument as in the non-experimental questionnaire, and exploit the experimentally induced variation in beliefs between the first treatment group and the control group to analyze if individuals draw causal conclusions from correlational information.We further use the experimental design to study the role of de-biasing and to test whether selection neglect persists when individuals are informed of the data generating process (DGP), as shown in some laboratory settings (Barron et al., 2019) but not others (López-Pérez et al., 2022). To this end, we provide the second treatment group with an alternative information treatment that also reports the average pay gap between full-time and part-time workers, but additionally educates subjects about the selection mechanism driving the observed wage gap. Specifically, the second information treatment points out that observed pay gaps between full-time and part-time workers can largely be explained by differences in work experience.Finally, we analyze some behavioral implications of worker beliefs about part-time pay. Exploiting the longitudinal dimension of the SOEP-IS, we study descriptively how worker beliefs relate to planned and realized transitions between full-time and part-time employment.The empirical analyses generate five main findings. First, respondents underestimate the difference in hourly wage rates between full-time and part-time workers in their occupation. Second, workers predict small causal wage penalties for a given worker switching between full- and part-time employment. Third, perceived raw and causal wage gaps are significantly correlated. Fourth, providing correlational information strongly affects beliefs about causal effects. Fifth, de-biasing effectively reduces selection neglect. Taken together, the results provide empirical evidence of causal misperceptions in the context of the part-time wage penalty. Although individuals do not naïvely equate average pay gaps with causal effects, they seem to account only insufficiently for worker selection. In addition, we show that beliefs about part-time pay gaps are predictive of labor supply choices, necessitating the prevention of causal misperceptions to avoid behavioral distortions.The remainder of the paper is structured as follows:Section 2informs about the existing literature and how this paper relates to it.Section 3provides background information about part-time wage gaps in Germany.Section 4presents the conceptual framework and the empirical design.Section 5.1contains results from the non-experimental analyses,Section 5.2presents results from the information experiment.

"1. IntroductionThe Covid-19 pandemic triggered an unprecedented labour market shock whose consequences on the labour force are not yet fully understood. Whilelabour demandsuddenly froze as the pandemic hit, the massive use of job retention schemes (OECD, 2021) significantly contained the potential wave of job destruction, but benefitted more employees on permanent contracts. The pandemic shock had therefore highly heterogeneous consequences, hitting employed and job seekers with different intensities, and potentially inducing a significant process of labour reallocation.The main contribution of this paper is to investigate several dimensions of such heterogeneity. In particular, we investigate who were the most affected workers in the early stages of the pandemic, whether the subsequent recovery favoured their reallocation, and, if so, towards which sectors or employment contracts.To address these questions, we exploit very rich Italian administrative data on a large random sample of work relationships that have undergone a labour contract event, namely activation and termination. We then construct a panel of workers – about 13 per cent of the Italian workforce – for whom we observe each job and its main features (length, detailed sector and occupation) from January 2018 until December 2021. We analyse three groups of workers defined as those that between January and April 2020 (i) were continuously employed, which we define as the workers with most stable employment; (ii) those who lost their job; and (iii) those who were not employed (either new entrants or with previous work experiences). Comparing them with similar groups of workers in previous years, we uncover several important facts. In the months following the pandemic onset, workers with stable jobs fared better than those who lost or did not have a job in the first four months of 2020, thanks also to the unprecedented use of employment protection schemes and a partial layoff ban on permanent contracts, in place in Italy for most of 2020 and 2021 (Bank of Italy, 2021). The health emergency amplified existing differences in the duration of employment by affecting two margins: the job survival probability for those already employed (which increased relatively to the past) and the probability to find a job for non-employed workers (which decreased). Migrants, young and low-educated workers suffered most from such an increase in the between-group differences in employment status. In addition, we do not find evidence of significant cross-firm and cross-sectoral reallocation for any of the groups we analyse.Last, we provide suggestive evidence that our results depend relatively more on the demand rather than on the supply side of the labour market. To this end, we use the pre-pandemic period separations (namely, endings of fixed-term contracts and layoffs – related to the demand side –, and voluntary quits – related to the supply side) to show that the reduced firms’ turnover seems to explain most of the reduction in worker flows.Our focus is on Italy, which represents an ideal case to study how the pandemic affected labour market dynamics. First, Italy was the first Western country where Covid-19 was, unexpectedly, discovered at the end of February 2020: this allows us to focus on the consequences of the pandemic, ruling out anticipation effects and cross-country economicspillovers. Second, the Italian labour market resembles in most ways that of all other major European countries with its extensive use of job retention schemes and a dual structure of permanent and temporary jobs (Garibaldi and Tealdi, 2013).1Third, the timely and rich administrative data available in Italy represent an advancement in the measurement of job transitions with respect to those traditionally used in the literature (Fujita et al., 2020) as they record all jobs and their detailed characteristics for a large random sample of workers.This paper contributes to the recent literature that analyses labour market flows to understand adjustments following the Covid-19 pandemic (Aaronson et al., 2021;Cortes and Forsythe, 2022;Lafuente and Ruland, 2022) and to the literature on theoccupational mobilityacross the business cycle. With respect to the former contribution, of particular interest for us is the work byCasarico and Lattanzio (2022)that uses the same data sources and shows that, at the very initial stage of the pandemic, hires slowed down for all workers, but more so for women, young, low-educated workers, and those with fixed-term contracts. We innovate with respect to their paper by analysing the job flow dynamics over a longer horizon, informing on the labour market opportunities at the outbreak of the pandemic and throughout the following recovery. Differently from their approach, we compare labour market trajectories before and after the pandemic of workers with stable jobs and those who lost their job, analysing their reallocation probabilities towards other firms or sectors besides their employment status. The focus on reallocation is, in particular, an innovation with respect toCasarico and Lattanzio (2022); it also complements the analyses conducted on other countries, which show that, after an initial spike, reallocation and labour market mismatch have been quite limited (e.g., seePizzinelli and Shibata (2023)for the US and the UK;Forsythe et al. (2022)for the US;Goméz and Lattanzio (2023)for Spain). Our analyses are consistent with those inLafuente and Ruland (2022), who show a marked increase in employment-to-non-participation flows during the pandemic usinglabour force surveydata for some European countries, including Italy. More specifically, they find that the hiring margin, and not separations, is the driving force behind Covid-related employment losses, possibly an effect of layoffs restriction policies. Similar to us, they also find lower conversion rates to open-ended contracts and more employment losses amongst temporary workers. With respect to their paper, we contribute by analysing a longer time period and by distinguishing separating workers from employed and non-employed individuals at the onset of the pandemic. Moreover, although their paper can distinguish non-employment from non-participation, the administrative data we use allow us (i) to monitor worker transitions across employers, as they report firm identifiers, and (ii) differentiate between quits, layoffs and fixed-term contract terminations.As for the mobility across the business cycle, a large economic literature studies the role of job transitions as an indicator of the health status of the economy. Labour reallocation is generally associated with a rise in productivity and growth, both determining innovation advancements and driving the business cycle (Shimer, 2001;Davis and Haltiwanger, 2014; for a review, seeMoscarini and Postel-Vinay, 2018). Studying job flows is thus informative of the status of the labour market recovery post-Covid-19 and of the extent of perspective labour reallocation, productivity and wage growth.2While we do not observe earnings in our dataset, our analysis can still be informative to study unemployment (Carrillo-Tudela and Visschers, 2023) and the employment and vacancy dynamics during the recovery (Eeckhout and Lindenlaub, 2019).Finally, several papers advanced the hypothesis that the pandemic could have triggered a permanent cross-sectoral reallocation process due to changes in consumers and workers’ preferences, and a swift increase in technology adoption – based on the observation that the duration of the pandemic was ex-ante uncertain.Barrero et al. (2020),Barrero et al. (2021)andAnayi et al. (2021)show that the degree of potential reallocation has been rising since the Covid-19 shock, especially in favour ofindustrieswith remote workable occupations. Such hypothesis, however, needs to be tested empirically: although cross-employers transitions are procyclical in the US and the UK (Moscarini and Thomsson, 2007;Carrillo-Tudela et al., 2016;IMF, 2021), the specificity of the pandemic and of the policies implemented during the first waves may have triggered different responses during the current recovery (with respect to other non-pandemic recoveries). Our analysis indicates that, over a time horizon of almost two years after the pandemic onset, job mobility across firms and sectors has been limited, confirming that such reallocation forces did not prevailed, at least in the short-term. Our result is confirmed by similar findings on Italy byCitino et al. (2023), who show only a slight increase in between-sector reallocation in 2021.",Gaetano,Domenico,Salvatore
"1. IntroductionAbsenteeismmay severely depress the output firms produce, particularly when production involves teamwork. Output loss due to absenteeism occurs through two channels, one direct and one indirect. First, the firm may be unable to hire or assign an equally productive worker to replace the absentee, resulting in a direct loss of production (Herrmann and Rockoff, 2012). Second, there is an indirect production loss if remaining co-workers of the absentee produce less because their productivity depends on their absent (and perhaps replaced) co-worker (Bartel et al., 2014). In this paper, we decompose the total effect of a worker’s absence into this direct and indirect component. We first focus on the indirect effect by analyzing the impact of a worker’s temporary absence and replacement on the output of the remaining co-workers in their production team. We then compare the production of the absentee with the production of their replacement worker and show how much these two effects contribute to the total output loss at team level.In the economic literature on absenteeism, most studies focus on the causes of absenteeism (see e.g.,De Paola et al. (2014);Godøy and Dale-Olsen (2018);Markussen et al. (2011)). By contrast, we focus on the consequences of absenteeism for production, which has attracted far less academic interest to date.Herrmann and Rockoff (2012)show that student grades obtained under the supervision of regular teachers are significantly higher than grades obtained under temporary replacements. As such, they document the direct production loss of replacing a regular worker by a temporary replacement.Bartel et al. (2014)evaluate the production effects of composition disruptions in nursing teams, finding negative effects from nurse departures or new hires on team production. We connect these two insights by disentangling the decrease in team production into the effect of productivity losses of the remaining co-workers (as inBartel et al. (2014)) and the direct productivity loss from replacing absent workers by less able replacements (as inHerrmann and Rockoff (2012)).1Our analysis fits in the literature on co-worker effects of absenteeism and turnover. This literature has extensively documented several plausible mechanisms for the co-worker effects we identify:peer effectsdue to complementarities in the production function (Arcidiacono, Kinsler, Price, 2017,Azoulay, Graff Zivin, Wang, 2010,Gould, Winter, 2009), productivity gains from co-working experience between workers (Berman, Down, Hill, 2002,Shamsie, Mannor, 2013) and productivity losses associated with the onboarding costs of replacement employees (Kuhn and Yu, 2021).2Our empirical strategy addresses the issue of endogenous staffing changes by exploiting quasi-random co-worker injuries in sports teams as a source of temporary absences and replacements. To this end we use data from the National Hockey League. In this regard, our paper builds on previous work using injury data from professional athletes to examine health shocks in the labor market. For example,Carrieri et al. (2020)calculate the wage loss Italian football players incur when they suffer an injury,Stuart (2017)evaluates the team productivity effects of injuries for different types of injured players,Gregory-Smith (2021)uses injuries to examine whether National Football League players are paid according to their marginal revenue product andFischer et al. (2022)investigate the productivity effects of COVID-19 on the performance of top league football players in Germany and Italy.The contribution of our analysis is threefold. First, we estimate the effect of an absence on the productivity, working time and output produced by the remaining co-workers. Second, we distinguish between two types of absent worker, those who perform the same task as the remaining co-workers (substitute co-worker) and those with a complementary task in the production team (complementary co-worker). The absence of both types has a negative impact on the productivity of the remaining co-workers, as they produce less output per minute worked. In case a substitute worker is absent, the remaining co-workers compensate for this productivity loss by increasing their working time. The increase in working time counteracts the loss of worker productivity. An increase in working time does not occur when the absentee is a complementary co-worker. Therefore, the absence of a complementary co-worker has a more severe impact on the resulting output produced per remaining worker than the absence of a substitute co-worker. Third, we show how the indirect co-worker effects combined with the direct effect of the lower average ability of replacement workers impacts the total production of the team.InSection 2we discuss the institutional features of the National Hockey League and explain how we exploit these to identify the impact of absences. We then discuss the construction of our data set inSection 3and empirical strategy inSection 4.Section 5presents the main results of our analyses, followed by a set of robustness checks inSection 6.

"1. IntroductionConsistent across a large body of work on negotiations is the finding that men and women differ in their behavioural outcomes. Specifically, women often ask for less than men do insalarynegotiations (see e.g.,Dittrich, Knabe, Leipold, 2014,Dreber, Heikensten, Säve-Söderbergh, 2022,Hernandez-Arenaz, Iriberri,Roussille,Säve-Söderbergh, 2019). This gender gap in negotiation behaviour has been shown to arise as early as childhood (Arnold and McAuliffe, 2021) and has a pernicious effect as it compounds over the course of women’s careers (Babcock and Laschevar, 2003). Because asking for less is likely to result in less—when outcomes are conditional on requests—this gender gap in negotiation behaviour is one potential mechanism behind the persistent gender gap in labour market outcomes (Bertrand and Duflo, 2017). Moreover, related research finds that women have lower earnings expectations than men, even before embarking on their careers (e.g.,Filippin, Ichino, 2005,Kiessling, Pinger, Seegers, Bergerhoff,Wiswall, Zafar, 2018). One implication of this may be that women enter negotiations with the expectation to earn less, and these expectations lead women to request less, ultimately affecting the negotiation outcome. Recent research also highlights this link between expectations, beliefs and women requesting less in negotiations than men (Dreber, Heikensten, Säve-Söderbergh, 2022,Kiessling, Pinger, Seegers, Bergerhoff,Roussille).In light of these findings, we explore if a simple intervention prior to a negotiation can reduce this gap, focusing on the salary requests that women—and men—intend to make. We test potential interventions using a pre and post design in a survey experiment with a simple reminder of the relatively disadvantaged position of women in negotiation outcomes compared to men over the prior five year period.In designing our intervention, we turn to work examining differences in women’s and men’s attention to pay levels. Compared to men, women have been found to have a higher number of life goals (Gino et al., 2015), often sacrificing opportunities to earn a higher salary to support other goals, such as being closer to their family (Le Barbanchon et al., 2020). This research characterises genderinequalityin salaries as a function of this division in attention, where women spend relatively less time and attention on their careers than men do (Diekman, Brown, Johnston, Clark, 2010,Gino, Wilmuth, Brooks, 2015). Because all humans face limits in terms of the amount of information that they can process at any one time (Simon, 1955), the broader set of women’s life goals when compared to men suggest that small but repeated attentional gaps lead women to miss relevant information, such as their relative progress towards equality (Lee and Kray, 2021). Thus, our research tests whether a simple intervention may help overcome this attentional deficit brought about by holding a broader set of life goals.Our research also leverages the growing literature examining the effects of status competition (Edelman, Larkin, 2015,Garcia, Tor, Gonzalez, 2006), where individuals compete regarding their relative social position. We do so because salary remains a widely acknowledged signal of one’s relative status, suggesting that highlighting one’s relative position may tap into the common psychological motivation to seek status (Anderson et al., 2015). According to the status competition hypothesis, individuals place significant value not just on occupying higher positions, but their upward drive is motivated when in proximity to meaningful standards of rank (Garcia, Tor, Gonzalez, 2006,Garcia, Tor, Schiff, 2013).We argue that status competition is important for two reasons. First, it explains motivation within hierarchies, such as specifically avoiding being ranked at the bottom of social hierarchies (last place aversion:Buell, 2021,Kuziemko, Buell, Reich, Norton, 2014). Although women may be aware that they are not compensated at the same level as men in certain contexts or situations, we posit that presenting them information prior to a negotiation—reminding them that they rank at the bottom of the gender hierarchy—would motivate them to intend to request higher salaries.1Second, we suggest that status momentum is an additional driver of the motivation to improve one’s relative status. Status momentum describes a phenomenon whereby individuals are motivated by historical changes in status position, beyond their current position (Pettit, Marr, 2020,Pettit, Sivanathan, Gladstone, Marr, 2013). Though some studies have been successful in helping women perform better relative to men (seeKray et al., 2002), historical perceptions of women’s stereotypical role continue to negatively impact women’s performance (Bordalo et al., 2019) particularly in negotiation contexts (Amanatullah, Morris, 2010,Bowles, Babcock, Lai, 2007,Kray, Kennedy, Van Zant, 2014). In other words, while women may find themselves in an inferior position in terms of negotiated salaries, any progress towards reducing this gap may be motivating as women begin to extrapolate about unrealised, but implied, futures.Though woman may be motivated by changes in actual or potential position, so too may men. Thus, we take care to note that status momentum may have an adverse effect on achieving equity in certain contexts, especially those where women’s status momentum may motivate men to adopt avoidance strategies to prevent status loss (Kakkar et al., 2019), highlighting the dynamics inherent to progress towards gender parity. We therefore use different experimental interventions which increase attention to information regarding a gender gap—making the meaningful standard of gender parity salient—suggesting that this will motivate women to request higher salaries.We explore our intervention in two subsequent preregistered studies (osf.io/3jh54) that build on each other. In Study 1, we use a difference-in-differences (DID) experimental design on a sample of business school students (n=991) to explore two types of status-based interventions. Between subjects, we show information of (a) a stable gap (11%) or (b) a closing gap (11% to 4%) in historical intended salary requests from similar individuals (i.e., from the same business school) and compared these interventions to (c) a control condition. Displaying the gender gap in itself is aimed to tap into psychological motivations of last place aversion while the difference in the gap being stable or closing was designed to motivate additional sentiments regarding one’s status momentum.2To further test what Study 1 found, we proceeded with Study 2 using the same, or deliberately altered, reminders as in Study 1—again in a DID design, but on a sample of gig workers (n=3346). This was motivated to provide complementary evidence and address alternative explanations to the effects found in Study 1, thus outlining the robustness of our effects in a different context.Across all interventions and samples, our research shows that reminding women of their relatively disadvantageous position in salary negotiations leads to statistically significant and economically meaningfully increases in women’s intended salary requests. For women, just being informed of a gender gap was enough to increase intended requests, lending support to the idea that women are influenced by status motivation, particularly that based on last place aversion. On the other hand, male business students lowered their intended requests when being reminded of women’s disadvantageous position in salary negotiations. However, when the reminder showed that women were making progress in reducing the gap, male business students increased their intended salary requests compared to those reminded of a stable gap, suggesting that any help men might offer in reducing the gap wanes as women approach parity in outcomes. Thus, we find suggestive evidence that women’s status momentum (Pettit et al., 2013)—the appearance that women may surpass men in future negotiations—could have an adverse effect on the salary gap as male business students respond by requesting higher salaries compared to if there is no status momentum. Neither of these effects were found among gig workers.Our findings relate to a larger literature on gender gaps both in negotiation and in earnings expectations (e.g.,Briel, Osikominu, Pfeifer, Reutter, Satlukal, 2021,Dittrich, Knabe, Leipold, 2014,Dreber, Heikensten, Säve-Söderbergh, 2022,Fernandes, Huber, Vaccaro, 2021,Filippin, Ichino, 2005,Hernandez-Arenaz, Iriberri,Kiessling, Pinger, Seegers, Bergerhoff,Manzi, Rosen, Rosenzweig, Jaffe, Robinson, Litman,Reuben, Sapienza, Zingales, 2015,Roussille,Säve-Söderbergh, 2019). We contribute to this literature by showing a sensitivity among women to information on their status may ultimately contribute to reducing gender inequalities in negotiations. However, we note that it would be important to follow up on subsequent behaviour in any setting outside of our surveys to understand how this increase in intended requests map on to outcomes. Moreover, since our work is exploratory—aimed at testing if and how we could trigger women to change their intentions before entering a negotiation—we relied on various historical differences in salary outcomes. As only one scenario can be factually correct and this may vary over contexts, it is important to note that our experimental design is limited in this regard. We therefore debriefed all participants regarding the historical differences we sampled and that the information we provided was partially fictitious. Nevertheless, our intervention may show a fruitful avenue for future research.The remainder of the paper is organised as follows.Section 1describes the experimental design and data of Study 1 and Study 2.Section 2outlines the results. Finally,Section 3provides a discussion of our findings and concluding remarks.",Emelie,Jenny,Richard
"1. IntroductionThe compatibility of labour market participation and childcare still represents a serious challenge for women. While in the past having a career and having a family were deemed as mutually exclusive choices, i.e, opting for one would imply giving up on the other, today, most women in developed countries aim to have both a family and a successful career (Doepke et al., 2022). The combination of career and family has led to a substantial change in the life cycle of women’slabour force participationfor the most recent cohorts, which looks relatively high and fairly flat, similar to that of men’s (Fernández et al., 2004), but with a lower and squishier middle in their 30s (Lafond et al., 2021). In this paper, we use the burst of COVID-19 pandemic, which appears as an exogenous and potentially symmetric shock, to analyse the factors affecting the attachment to the labour market of women, in particular those between the age of 30 and 39.For decades policymakers and researchers have been interested in the determinants of female labour force participation (Goldin and Katz, 2002). Labour force participation increased significantly during the last century; many reasons have been identified behind this phenomenon, ranging from the diffusion of the contraceptive pills, the electricity revolution, the relative change in returns to experience compared with the male’s, the decrease in the gender wage gap, and the discovery of the infant formula (Albanesi, Olivetti, 2016,Goldin, Katz, 2002,Greenwood, Seshadri, Yorukoglu, 2005,Jones, Manuelli, McGrattan, 2015,Olivetti, 2006). The levelling off of female labour force participation in the late 1990s has been attributed to the lack of appropriate policies to support families (Blau and Kahn, 2013), the diffusion of long-hour occupations (Goldin, 2021) and the marriage patterns of women to highly educated and high-income husbands (Albanesi and Kim, 2021). The recent ‘sagging middle’ life cycle seems to be ascribable to the lack or ineffectiveness of “family-friendly” policies (Blau, Kahn, 2013,Olivetti, Petrongolo, 2017) and the rise in “greedy jobs”, which are increasingly dominant among highly educated workers (Goldin, 2021). The literature points to a number of factors which could facilitate the combination of career and childcare responsibilities, among which: (i) policies in support of families, such as longer maternal and paternal leaves, reduction of childcare costs, increased availability of pre-school opportunities (Andresen, Havnes, 2019,Barua, 2014,Bettendorf, Jongen, Muller, 2015,Compton, Pollak, 2014,Givord, Marbot, 2015,Huebener, Pape, Spiess, 2020); (ii) favourable social norms, such as the equal gender division of housework and childcare (Del Boca, Oggero, Profeta, Rossi, 2020,Myong, Park, Yi, 2021); and (iii) labour markets which are sufficiently flexible (Da Rocha, Fuster, 2006,Del Boca, 2002). However, the overlapping of various policies in support of families, heterogeneous socio-cultural factors, and region-specific economic factors makes it difficult to quantify the contribution of each single determinant to the labour force participation of women (Cascio, Haider, Nielsen, 2015,Olivetti, Petrongolo, 2017).We investigate the attachment of women to the Italian labour market, specifically those in the 30–39 age category, in the period 2013–2020, i.e., before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, by estimating transition probabilities to and from inactivity. The COVID-19 shock appears well-suited for our aim as it was (i) unexpected and (ii) potentially symmetric, thus fit for the analysis of its impact as purified by potential inter-temporal effects linked to the business cycle and long-term planning of individuals.1Moreover, the Italian labour market displays large heterogeneities, with vast and persistent regional disparities: industrial activities are mostly concentrated in the North, while agriculture and commerce are prevalent in Southern regions (Tables 13and14inAppendix GandOECD, 2019). Italy also ranks among the weakest ofOECDcountries regarding job quantity, defined as employment, unemployment and underemployment (OECD, 2018), reflecting persistently large gender employment gaps, with a remarkably low female labour force participation in the South (Agovino et al., 2019). Specifically, while in the North the labour force participation of 30–39 females ranges between 75% and 80%, in line with the US rate (Lafond et al., 2021, Fig. 1), in the South it is as low as 52%, despite a comparable totalfertility rateof 1.3 in the North and 1.25 in the South (ISTAT, 2019).Table 1.

In the South, instead, where female labour force participation was already very low, we do not find any evidence of such phenomenon. Despite the data availability being limited to the four quarters of 2020, the identified effects appear large and persistent, in particular if compared to males in the same age cohort. We argue that while in the North the combination of economic, social and cultural factors allows for an easier combination of career and family, this exposes women in this area to a high risk, i.e., the female labour market attachment is weaker. Such explanation seems to be strongly anchored to the different regional female socio-cultural factors.The rest of the paper is organized as follows.Section 2illustrates the data and the methodology used.Section 3provides evidence of large heterogeneity in the Italian labour market before the COVID-19 pandemic, whileSection 4analyses the determinants of the changes in female labour force participation due to the pandemic.

"1. IntroductionAfter dropping steeply at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, aggregate employment and hours worked have bounced back substantially. However, a still outstanding question is whether all important underlying dimensions anddemographicsof the labour market have been recovering similarly. In particular, the trajectories of employment and inactivity for men and women in and after the pandemic do not appear to display substantial differences, neither in the US (Goldin, 2022) nor in most European countries (seeBluedorn et al. (2023)for international comparisons, andFig. 1in this paper for Spain).Download :Download high-res image (332KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. Employment to Population Ratio (excl. self-employed) of 20-65yo and 30-40yo, by gender. Notes: Employment over population ratio of their respective demographic group, excluding the self-employed from employment in the numerator. Source: Spanish LFS (EPA)..This fact may appear somewhat at odds with the literature on the differential effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on men and women, which typically emphasizes the unequal burden borne by women. While much of the literature focuses on the time that the pandemic most restricted life (2020, with e.g. lockdowns and prolonged school closures), in this paper we are also interested in what happened in 2021 and beyond – after many of the alleviating labour market measures, such as short-time work schemes, were phased out.The nature of the Covid-19 pandemic has been documented to put severe additional time constraints on households with children, stemming from increased demands of childcare at home and other household production. Within households, these demands typically have not been met equally by both partners. (See e.g.Farré et al. (2022a)andMartinez-Bravo and Sanz (2021)for Spain,Sevilla and Smith (2020),Adams-Prassl et al. (2020)andAndrew et al. (2022)for the UK).1While this may spill over directly into the labour market, with a temporary reduction of working hours, it may have also resulted in job loss, which has the potential for more substantial and long-lasting effects. (See e.g. the aforementioned references,Blázquez et al. (2022),Dolado et al. (2021)andHupkau and Ruiz-Valenzuela (2022)for Spain,Fiaschi and Tealdi (2022)for Italy,Alon et al. (2020),Hupkau and Petrongolo (2020),Albanesi and Kim (2021),Lim and Zabek (2021),Oreffice and Quintana-Domeque (2021),Cortes and Forsythe (2022),Fairlie et al. (2021),Goldin (2022)and many others – who focus typically on observations early in the pandemic). Female labour market interruptions have been linked, in general (before the pandemic), to a variety of persistent gender gaps, from wages (seeLeung et al. (2016),Kleven et al. (2019)andDe Quinto et al. (2020)) to pensions in contributive social security systems (Vara (2013)), and it is no stretch to wonder whether the Covid disruptions would have similarly persistent effects.Some have taken the temporary nature of the pandemic’s drop in employment rates for both women and men as indicative of the absence of any longer-lasting labour market damage done by the pandemic. Looking at these more aggregate outcomes can obscure the different outcomes of prominent subsets, such as mothers, who may already be suspected to be more at risk, for the reasons outlined above. Hence, we study mothers, fathers, and men and women without children separately. A focus on employment alone, however, also leaves aside damage done to thequalityof employment. Here, we investigate the latter along two dimensions, usingLabour Force Surveydata from Spain.2First, we look at employment by labor contract type; second, we examine changes to the distribution of job tenures, across the four (gender×parental status) groups.The type of labor contract is an important dimension of employment in the context of a historicallydual labour market, such as in Spain. There, employment in open-ended (“permanent”) contracts has been typically very desirable (from an individual worker’s perspective), with high employment protection and union coverage, but hard to get into. To reach a permanent contract often needed to go through a sequence of temporary contracts before landing a permanent one. In fact, in any given month (up to a reform in 2022) more than 90% of new hires are into temporary contracts.Lafuente et al. (2022)show that the loss of permanent jobs is a major driver of the employment loss during Covid-19 in Spain. In this context, one can ask whether permanent employment has been bouncing back in equal measure for women as for men, for mothers as for fathers.Indeed, we find that the loss of these ‘good’ jobs, and the potentially lasting damage that this entails may not be spread evenly across workers, and it is especially mothers who appear to do worse. Relative to the 2016–2019 trend, mothers lose about 3 percentage points of their permanent employment rate in 2021.3For comparison, averaged over the entire sample period, their permanent employment rate is about 0.40, so this is quite a nontrivial change. While a 2022labour market reformincreased hiring in permanent contracts in general, the rise of mothers’ permanent employment rates (relative to the trend) keeps lagging about 5 percentage points behind women without children, even at the end of 2022 (our most recent data point). In 2021 and 2022, mothers also faced larger negative permanent employment deviations from trend than fathers, with this ‘gender gap’ declining from about 4 percentage points in 2021 to about economically still rather meaningful 2.5 percentage points. Hence, it appears that mothers face slowly declining scars in terms of quality of employment.In a similar vein, long-term employment with the same employer tends to be associated, with a revealed preference argument, with a higher quality of employment as well.We find relatively larger losses of jobs over a wide range of higher tenures (4–12 years) for mothers, when compared to fathers or women without children, over the Covid-19 recession and its aftermath, into 2022. Interestingly, like permanent employment, these relatively higher losses of high and moderate tenure jobs become visibleafterthe initial shock of 2020, only in 2021.These dynamics of the tenure distributions are markedly different from theGreat Recessionand its aftermath (2008–2013). Here we saw the median and 75h percentile of the job tenure of employed workers move up, while during the Covid pandemic these moved down, most visibly so for mothers. Comparing this behaviour across parents, we see that the median and upper quartile indeed moves down more for mothers than fathers – and this occurs across the vast majority ofindustriesand occupations, and remains visible in 2022.Overall, the loss of jobs with a permanent contract, after a substantial number of years with the same employer, can constitute a serious economic loss. Recovering from these losses is not necessarily easy or quick, and indeed we see that much of the relative losses of mothers in contracts or tenure persist in 2022. Given this, we argue that –even with the worst of the pandemic in the rearview mirror– attention should be devoted to studying the post-pandemic labour market outcomes of mothers, and the scope of policy to address adverse outcomes. We suggest a few inSection 5.The rest of the paper is structured as follows:Section 2examines the institutional background, the timeline of Covid-19 and its response by the Spanish government;Section 3looks at employment and non-participation probability;Section 4explores the impact of the pandemic on the tenure distribution;Section 5considers the potential impact of Covid-related policies in our results and what can we learn from it;Section 6concludes.",Cristina,Astrid,Raül
"1. IntroductionPolicy-makers have widely recognized the importance of evaluating the effectiveness of higher education using metrics such as costs per student andgraduationrates. However, despite an average spending of $10,351 per full-time student in 2017 byOECDcountries (OECD, 2020, pp. 208 and 275), only two out of three students graduate within three years of their expected graduation date. The direct costs of dropping out, both to individuals and society, are substantial, compounded by indirect costs such as lost tax revenues for the state and delayed entry into the labor market for students. For example, in the Netherlands, the annual total cost of dropping out and study switching has been estimated to be 5.7 billion euros (Borghans and Golsteyn, 2006).Given these significant costs, there is a pressing need to identify and address the factors that contribute to low graduation rates. While extensive research has been conducted on the drivers of university dropout rates, including uncertainty in educational decision-making (e.g.,Manski, 1989), personal characteristics (e.g.,Almås et al., 2016), socio-economic background (e.g.,Aina, 2013), financial pressure (e.g.,Castex, 2017),peer effects(e.g.,Arulampalam et al., 2005), cognitive and non-cognitive skills (e.g.,Hanushek, Woessmann, 2008,Heckman, Rubinstein, 2001), learning about one’s own abilities (e.g.,Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner, 2013), and a lack of information (Conlon, 2021,Wiswall, Zafar, 2015), our understanding of the specific preferences that drive voluntary dropout decisions remains limited.Recent work byConlon and Patel (2022)suggests that occupational preferences for the typical career associated with the major is often the driver of major choice. Additionally, students may overestimate the likelihood of achieving these careers after degree completion or misperceive the careers that a major can lead to, resulting in costly adjustments inhuman capital investments. However, empirical evidence on whether students revise their human capital investments when their chosen major is unlikely to lead to their aspired career is still lacking in the literature.In this study, we utilize unique longitudinal data from the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS) in Germany to examine the impact of occupational preference-major mismatches on university dropout rates. By following uppersecondary school studentsbeyond their tertiary education choices, we can observe occupational preferences prior to university enrollment and the majors chosen upon enrollment, minimizing the risk of ex-post rationalization of occupational preferences. We develop a measure of mismatch by creating a crosswalk of majors to occupations using data from the German Graduate Panel (DZHW) and cohorts of graduates from 2009 and 2013. This measure allows us to determine the extent of the mismatch between occupational aspirations and chosen university majors.Consistent with prior research (e.g.,Dasgupta, Sharma, 2022,Wiswall, Zafar, 2015), we find that male and female students tend to sort into different majors, with the dropout rate varying by gender-major combination (averaging 29%). We demonstrate that our measure of mismatch is highly predictive of dropout rates, with a 9-percentage-point increase in dropout likelihood for students with a mismatch, even after controlling for a student studying the preferred major and a range of personal characteristics and cognitive and non-cognitive skills. Notably, we observe a larger coefficients for female students, who are 13 percentage points more likely to drop out if they experience a mismatch, while no such relation is evident for male students.We find that our results are highly robust across various specifications. First, we test the robustness of our findings by including older cohorts of graduates in the analysis. We use data from the DZHW for the cohorts of 2001 and 2005 and find that the results are quantitatively similar to those from the 2009 and 2013 cohorts. Additionally, we find similar results when we use older cohorts from the NEPS to generate major-occupation crosswalks instead of the DZHW data. Furthermore, we test the sensitivity of our measure of occupational mismatch by using an index of occupational similarity rather than a simple binary indicator of mismatch. We find that a one-point increase in the index of occupational similarity decreases the dropout rate by approximately 5 percentage points. Finally, we make a distinction between study switch and definitive drop out from university and show our findings really are driven by the relation between a major occupation mismatch and drop out.In addition to examining the simple dropout decision, we also analyze the timing of dropout of students and find agender differencein the timing of university dropout in relation to the mismatch between majors and occupational preferences. Specifically, we find that males with a mismatch tend to drop out in their first year than those without a mismatch, while no such pattern is observed for female dropouts. This suggests that female dropouts are more likely to make an early adjustment to their university program regardless of the mismatch, whereas males tend to drop out later in their study program but are more likely to make an early adjustment when they have a mismatch between their major and occupational preferences.The observed pattern of findings can be attributed to three potential explanations, which we examine in our paper. First, we investigate the possibility of informational misperception, which refers to the lack of knowledge about which majors lead to which occupations. To test this, we use occupational preference-major preference match as a proxy for informational accuracy prior to university enrollment and only include students with a match in our analysis. We find that the estimates remain consistent with our main results. Furthermore, we provide compelling evidence that students who drop out and have a mismatch are less likely to switch to a major that aligns with their pre-university occupational preferences than students who drop out and have a match. These findings speak against informational misperceptions as a potential explanation as has been suggested in other related studies (e.g.,Wiswall and Zafar, 2015b).Second, it is possible that students enroll in university without a clear idea of their career preferences, hoping to use their time there to explore their options and eventually settle on a suitable major. Our analysis suggests that this indecisiveness is a common experience among students, as evidenced by our data. Interestingly, we find that the difference in dropout rates is not significant within gender-mismatch groups but rather between them. Moreover, the difference in dropout rates is particularly pronounced for females with and without a mismatch. To investigate possible coping strategies, we analyze whether selecting occupationally broad majors could reduce dropout incidence. We find that males benefit from choosing broad majors when they have a mismatch or no clear preferences, while females only seem to benefit from broad majors when they have not reported clear preferences. For both males and females, we find that dropping out is unrelated to the breadth of majors when their occupational preference matches their chosen major.Third, it is possible that students modify their occupational preferences after enrolling in university, as their new environment and peers shape and influence their aspirations (e.g.,Chevalier et al., 2020). Our analysis suggests that changes in occupational preferences can increase dropout rates if they result in a mismatch between the student’s occupational preference and university major. Interestingly, we find significant gender differences in the impact of these changes. Females exhibit lower dropout rates when their occupational preference and major match both before and after enrolling in university. In contrast, males exhibit a lower dropout rate when their occupational preference and major match after enrolling in university, regardless of their prior mismatch status.We make two contributions to the literature. First, our study contributes to the literature on university dropout decisions by exploring the connection between labor market preferences and educational choices. We take a novel approach by investigating the mismatch between occupational preferences and majors and how it relates to the decision to drop out, an aspect that has been overlooked in previous studies (see, e.g.,Aina, Baici, Casalone, Pastore, 2018,Aina et al., 2022, for extensive summaries of the dropout literature). In particular, our study builds on recent research byBlom et al. (2021)andActon (2021)which suggests that prospective students consider the current labour market situation when choosing their major, and argues that occupational preferences play a crucial role in shaping major choices (Conlon and Patel, 2022). Importantly, unlike previous studies that only surveyed students at the time of their enrollment (e.g.,Conlon, Patel,Zafar, 2013), we capitalize on the longitudinal nature of our data to measure preferences before university enrollment, hereby eliminating any ex-post rationalization in preferences. By doing so, our study provides essential insights into the factors that influence the decision to drop out of university, filling a critical gap in the literature.Second, our study contributes to the literature on gender differences in educational preferences and enrollment decisions (e.g.,Wiswall, Zafar, 2018,Zafar, 2013). As shown byCroson and Gneezy (2009), significant differences exist between genders in risk preferences and competition behavior, which also influence gender differences in the choice of majors (Reuben et al., 2017). While we utilize a more generalized measure of preferences through stated occupational preferences, our study provides gender-specific evidence on the dropout behavior of students who experience a mismatch between their occupational preference and major choice. By focusing on this specific aspect, our study adds valuable insights to the literature and highlights the importance of considering gender differences in educational decision-making.The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.Section 2describes the data and empirical strategy.Section 3provides the main results including some moredescriptive statistics.Section 4presents potential mechanisms andSection 5concludes.",Didier,Pascal,None

"1. IntroductionMost states in the United States implemented Stay-at-Home orders (SAHOs) in the spring of 2020. These policies had a profound impact on thework environmentalmost overnight, causing half the U.S. workforce to switch to home-working by the first weeks of April 2020 (Brynjolfsson et al., 2020). The pandemic and the experience of living under the SAHOs made many firms believe they have to constantly be prepared for “everyone who can must suddenly work from home” (Kirby, 2020). The scope and suitability of workplace transformation following the COVID-19 recovery is a widespread trend among firms accompanied by vigorous debates in the media.1Does thelabor demandgo back to the pre-COVID scenario or does it change in the long run? How do firms manage employees amid a turbulent situation? Answering these questions gives us important and up-to-date perceptions of the labor market and insights on how firms manage labor. In this paper, we contribute to the discussion by studying the effect of SAHO duration variation on firms’ demand for skills within occupation after the orders are lifted.In the spring of 2020, 40 states and the District of Columbia issued SAHOs. State-level SAHO duration ranged between 28 and 97 days with a raw average of 44 days. A firm’s location determines how long it is affected by the SAHO and affects the magnitude of its labor demand change. While firms exposed to short SAHOs may choose to pause their pre-COVID functioning and go back to the old routine after orders are lifted, those affected by longer SAHOs may be more willing to seek alternative work arrangements to keep the firms running amid COVID restrictions. After the SAHOs are lifted, these firms could stick to the new way of working and demand a different set of skills when hiring, making the impact of SAHO persistent. The variation allows us to quantify the marginal effect of SAHO duration on the demand for skills and separate the effect of SAHOs from the homogeneous impact of COVID.Studying the effect of SAHOs on labor demand through online job ads is important for understanding employment amid the pandemic and has attracted researchers’ interest. A growing empirical literature argued that SAHOs were likely to have substantial and potentially long-run negative disruption to labor markets in the United States. The orders accounted for about one-quarter of new unemployment insurance claims between March 14th and April 4th, 2020 (Baek et al., 2021). A study on the SAHO and employment in California showed the tradeoff between policy duration and labor market disruption (Friedson et al., 2021).Ali et al. (2021)show that the impact of SAHOs on job postings in early care and education is 16 times larger than their impact on education hiring broadly. In addition, households living in regions with an earlier enactment of SAHOs hold more pessimistic views of the future path of the economy (Coibion et al., 2020b). However, there is still relatively little direct evidence on how firms modify employment in the face of the pandemic and the subsequent SAHOs.In this paper, we investigate how SAHOs have changed the demand for skills. This is not a straightforward question to answer since the changes in advertised job skill requirements could plausibly be attributed to a multitude of factors other than SAHOs that occurred at the same time. For example, the pandemic worsening may cause economic uncertainty or growing demands for medical personnel. We disentangle the local effects of SAHOs from the broader economic disruption brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors affecting all states equally by taking advantage of the cross-sectional variation in the duration of SAHOs across geographical areas. The correlation between SAHO duration and the difference between pre-COVID and post-SAHO skill requirements helps us pin down the effects of SAHOs. Moreover, considering the COVIDcontainment policiesmay be endogenous to local social and economic factors, we employ twoinstrumental variables, i.e., the number of ICU beds and the population density, for SAHO duration to identify the causal impact of SAHOs on skill demands. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to document that SAHO duration has heterogeneous effects on the labor skill demand after the orders have been lifted.We use a micro-level dataset collected by Burning Glass Technologies (BGT), a labor market data company, that contains the near-universe of electronically posted job vacancies in the United States from January 2018 to April 2021. The BGT data records the skill requirements in job postings. To study the change in demand for skills, we classify 98.84% of all skill requirements in job postings into 19 representative categories. Identifying skills describing personal characteristics and self-management ability allows us to capture the demand for employee characteristics. Separately defining people management, project management, and operational management skills enables a discussion on the change inmanagement styles. We construct a panel data of statistics on skill requirements in job postings, SAHO duration, and local medical and demographic statistics for each occupation and metropolitan statistical area (MSA). We compare the demand for skills from the pre-COVID period, i.e., up to December 2019, and from the post-SAHO period, i.e., after the SAHOs are lifted, because neither period is constrained by the SAHO order.2Exploiting the spatial variation in SAHO duration and using two-stage-least-square (2SLS) regressions to handle endogeneity, we establish the following new facts:We find that the effect of SAHO duration on skill requirements is more about the way of working than the content of work. First, firms that experienced longer SAHOs change their management orientation from people to the operation. To achieve this change, firms demand more skills in operational management, administration and languages, and less on people management, personality and self-management. Second, SAHOs motivate firms to shift the focus of interpersonal skills from specific communication, such as customer services, to general communication, such associal skills.We find heterogeneous effects by the varying capability to work from home (WFH) of the occupation. Skill demands in occupations with very low capacity to WFH are hardly affected by the SAHO duration. For occupations with high WFH capacity, SAHO duration promotes specialization in these occupations by lowering the extensive margin demands and raising the intensive margin demands. The most dynamic effects are observed in occupations with partial WFH capacity. The large effects on management and work process-related skills suggest that longer SAHOs incentivize firms to explore the WFH potentials of these occupations by diminishing the necessity of in-person supervision.This paper is related to a number of important literatures. Our paper contributes to the large literature on the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on the labor markets. Empirical research using household surveys (e.g.,Adams-Prassl, Boneva, Golin, Rauh, 2020,Carrillo-Tudela, Comunello, Clymo, Jäckle, Visschers, Zentler-Munro), the Nielsen Homescan data (Coibion et al., 2020a), the administrative payroll data (Cajner et al., 2020), the Homebase and Earnings data in the private sector (Chetty et al., 2020), and vacancy data (e.g.,Costa Dias, Johnson-Watts, Robert, Postel-Vinay, Spittal, Xiaowei,Forsythe, Kahn, Lange, Wiczer, 2020) all document substantial impacts of the unprecedented pandemic. Researchers have provided evidence that workers in low-work-from-home jobs are more vulnerable to COVID-induced job losses (e.g.,Adams-Prassl, Boneva, Golin, Rauh, 2020,Mongey, Pilossoph, Weinberg, 2021). COVID-19 caused a reallocation of job opportunities across occupations (Barrero, Bloom, Davis, 2021,Carrillo-Tudela, Comunello, Clymo, Jäckle, Visschers, Zentler-Munro). As a result, there have been changes in where individuals search: workers target their job search direction in favor of occupations that are more resilient to the pandemic (e.g.,Carrillo-Tudela, Comunello, Clymo, Jäckle, Visschers, Zentler-Munro,Hensvik, Le Barbanchon, Rathelot, 2021). In complementarity with the evidence on shifts across occupations, we study the intra-occupational margin to enrich the story about the heterogeneous impacts of COVID on occupations and document the diversified impacts of COVID on skill requirements across occupations.Another strand of research studied the labor market impacts of the COVID-19 related policies. For example,Adams-Prassl et al. (2020a)construct a representative survey in the U.K. to investigate the characteristics and behavior of workers during the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which allows employers to reduce employees’ hours rather than firing them.Bartik et al. (2020)andFinamor and Scott (2021)analyze the effect of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Stimulus Act, a temporary unemployment insurance expansion scheme in the U.S., on employment.Mongey et al. (2021)estimate the heterogeneous impact of COVID on workers bydemographicsand show that economically and educationally disadvantaged workers are affected to a greater extent. Most studies on this topic have analyzed the changes in labor supply or employment. We add to this research topic by providing the effect of SAHOs from the labor demand perspective.Third, we contribute to a growing literature exploiting the BGT data to measure skill requirements.Deming and Kahn (2018)study the link among firm performance, the pay of jobs, and skill requirements using keywords-based skill categories.Hershbein and Kahn (2018)show the magnitude of changes in skill requirements during the recovery following theGreat Recessionacross the MSAs depends on the intensity of the recession on the local economy. Our paper is the first to study the quantitative change in skill requirements caused by the recent pandemic containment policies.Lastly, literature has shown that firms use recessions as opportunities to adjust management structures.Hall (1991)argues that firms may restructure employment in a recession because of a decline in the opportunity cost. The model developed byKoenders and Rogerson (2005)shows that firms postponeorganizational restructuringuntil the end of an expansion and shift managerial attention from growth to efficiency during recessions. Our paper adds to this literature by showing that COVID, as an incident similar but more complex than an economic recession, also induces changes in the restructuring of employee composition and management styles.The paper proceeds as follows.Section 2describes the data, the definition of skills, and the key variables.

"1. IntroductionLabour market shocks do not only entail economic costs for the affected individual, for example losses in earnings, health or well-being. They might also induce significant spill-overs to other members of the family. When parents lose their jobs or suffer earnings losses, this can negatively impact their offspring’s well-being (Nikolova, Nikolaev, 2018,Powdthavee, Vernoit, 2013), health (Lindo, 2011), educational success (Rege, Telle, Votruba, 2011,Ruiz-Valenzuela, 2020a,Stevens, Schaller, 2011) and even long-term career outcomes (Fradkin, Panier, Tojerow, 2019,Hilger, 2016). There are also damaging effects of father’s job insecurity on children’s educational outcomes (Ruiz-Valenzuela, 2020b).1Affected children might be scarred far beyond the contemporary labour market shock. During the labour market crisis following the spread of Covid 19, extensive closures of schools andnurserieshave likely aggravated thesespillovers.Against this background, this paper analyses spill-over effects of parental labour market shocks at two different points in time during the pandemic: right after its onset in April 2020, and then again in January 2021, almost a year into the Covid-19 pandemic. We analyse spill-over effects on parental investments, time devoted by the child to school work, and child-parent interactions. We further ask whether the effects of negative labour market shocks have changed as the crisis unfolded. We analyse changes in financial difficulties and mental health as mechanisms through which negative parental labour market shocks translate into changes in the investments in children.We base our estimations on UK data from the Understanding Society Covid-19 Surveys (University of Essex Institute for Social and Economic Research, 2021), which provide information on parental labour market experiences during and before the pandemic. The data further provides detailed information on child level parental investments. From the data, we classify parents into a hierarchy of three mutually exclusive categories based on how the pandemic changed their earnings: (1) earnings remained constant/increased, (2) earnings reduced or (3) earnings reduced to zero. We relate this hierarchy of labour market experiences to outcomes describing parental investments and parental andoffspringwell-being.To mitigate the influence of unobservable differences between workers who suffer negative labour market shocks during the Covid-19 pandemic and those who do not, we exploit two features of the data: First, we include lagged dependent variables, constructed with pre-pandemic information from the regular Understanding Society Survey (University of Essex Institute for Social and Economic Research, 2021). These control for pre-pandemic differences in outcomes between individuals experiencing different adverse labour market effects during the crisis. Second, we use thewealthof information of the USoC data on predetermined child and parental background characteristics, and firm characteristics. We do so in a sequential manner, in order to check the stability of the coefficients to the inclusion of these covariates and potential confounders. Finally, we show that pre-pandemic levels of parental investments are unrelated to pandemic-related negative shocks, further alleviating concerns about selection into adverse labour market shocks driving our results. Yet, we acknowledge that the Covid-19 crisis does not provide scope for fully-fledged quasi-experimental approaches given the lack of unaffected control groups. As a result, causal interpretations of the results should be made with caution.The results on the intergenerational impacts of negative labour market shocks during the Covid-19 pandemic suggests that negative labour market shocks have substantially larger impacts when suffered by fathers than by mothers. We find that children of fathers that suffered the most severe labour market shocks (i.e. earnings dropping to zero) are the ones that are consistently impacted. During April 2020, children of fathers whose earnings dropped to zero were 10 percentage points less likely to have received additional paid learning resources. Also, and perhaps due to families compensating for this drop in paid resources, fathers whose earnings dropped to zero were spending about 30 more minutes per day helping their children with school work (always compared with those not suffering negative labour market shocks). However, nearly one year into the pandemic, this association turned negative: Children whose fathers’ earnings had dropped to zero in January 2021 were receiving about 25 minutes less help per day, which translates into a lower overall amount of time spent by these children doing school work.This sign reversal might be due to the fact that those (still) suffering negative labour market shocks in January 2021, when things were getting better for most, may have faced persistently worse consequences than those hit by negative labour market shocks only at the onset of the pandemic, in April 2020. In our analysis of potential mechanisms, we find that from May through November 2020, households in which the father has zero earnings are almost 20 percentage points more likely to experience financial difficulties. We also see a worsening of mental health for those fathers whose earnings dropped to zero. Perhaps as a result, the initial reduction in quarrelling with children that we see at the beginning of the pandemic for fathers whose earnings dropped to zero is reversed by January 2021.These results connect to four strands of the literature. First, to a growing literature that describes the scope of job loss and reduced hours and earnings worldwide as a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic, e.g. for the US byAdams-Prassl et al. (2020);Bartik et al. (2020),Cajner et al. (2020),Chetty et al. (2020), for Germany byAdams-Prassl et al. (2020);Bauer and Weber (2020). For the UK,Witteveen (2020)andBlundell et al. (2020)describe economic hardship experienced during the pandemic across different socio-economic groups, the former using the same data as our study. We show that the profile of those suffering negative labour market shocks changes as the pandemic evolves.Second, we relate to an extensive literature documenting how parental job loss and job insecurity transmits to children’s well-being and educational outcomes, as reviewed byRuiz-Valenzuela (2021). Our results are in line with this broad literature, showing that negative labour market shocks borne by fathers (as opposed to mothers) are more consistently related to parental investments and child outcomes during a pandemic.Third, we add to the literature on the importance and determinants of parental inputs.Parental involvementis a major determinant of children’s academic achievement (Houtenville and Conway, 2008).Meta studieshave shown that parental involvement at home plays an especially influential role (Hill and Tyson, 2009), leading to potential long-term effects on performance (Barnard, 2004). Our results complement those inAgostinelli et al. (2022), who find that the support parents can offer during periods of school closures varies dramatically across families’ socioeconomic status.2Finally, we connect to other recent contributions that describe the unequal experiences of children during school closures.Werner and Woessman (2021)review this emerging literature and find substantial losses in cognitive skills, particularly for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. For the UK,Andrew et al. (2020)reportinequalitiesin children’s time use during the first national lockdown in the first half of 2020. We contribute to this literature by exploring impacts across two lockdown periods where schools remained closed (i.e. the lockdown starting in March 2020, and the one imposed in January 2021).The results have important implications for the economic evaluation of the costs of lockdowns. On the one hand, lockdowns induce direct costs through reduced economic activity and related labour market disruptions. On the other hand, they imply indirect costs through school closures. These have negative consequences in the long run, as learning losses negatively affect expected life-long income. Our results suggest that these negative effects might be further aggravated by the interaction between parents experiencing economic distress and having to simultaneously care for their children when formal care is shut down.The rest of the paper is structured as follows:Section 2describes the data.Section 3presents the empirical strategy.

"1. IntroductionMigration flows and the share of the foreign-born population have increased substantially in recent decades – both in the traditional immigration countries like Australia, Canada, or the United States but also in other advanced economies. As a result, many host countries in Europe now have a sizable foreign-born population: the share is 16.1% in Germany, 14% in the United Kingdom and 12.4% in France – comparable to the 13.6% in the United States (OECD, 2022). This trend is likely to continue in the face ofdemographic ageingand scarce labor in host countries coupled with population growth and adverse conditions in some origin countries.The increasing diversity of the population has brought the question of immigrant integration to the top of the political agenda. Without integration, whether economically, politically or socially, the immigrant population may remain marginalized and unable to take advantage of the opportunities in the host country. For the host country, failure to integrate immigrants imposes severe challenges ranging from fiscal costs toghettoizationand even social tensions if immigrants are not well integrated or perceived by the native population as a threat to jobs, housing or the localculture, for instance.Integration is clearly a complex phenomenon that is not easily captured with a single measure (e.g.,Hainmueller et al., 2015). Most scholars distinguish between economic, social, or political integration.Economic integrationincludes integration in the labor market, but also in the housing market, education or training.Social integrationmay include the intensity of interaction with natives, engagement in local clubs and organizations, but also covers long-run decisions like partner choice, marriage behavior, and fertility. Political integration captures interest and actual participation in political processes and organizations as well asvoting behavioretc. In addition, some scholars conceptualize integration in terms of identity, language, and norms or values, which captures how much immigrants feel as part of the culture and customs of the host country. The dimension may be labeled as cultural integration (Algan et al., 2010) or linguistic and psychological integration (Hainmueller et al., 2015). Clearly, integration along these various dimensions depends on immigrants’ preferences and choices; but we argue that they depend just as much on the opportunities the host country offers to support and encourage integration.Such opportunities are shaped in part by policies to facilitate immigrant integration. Among those, the option to become a citizen of the host country plays a prominent role. Citizenship is the most important privilege a host country can bestow on its immigrant population. Becoming a citizen and hence, a full member of the host society has obvious benefits in terms of political rights and standing for high political offices. But do these benefits also reach beyond the political realm? Some think that the importance of citizenship for integration has declined as the rights of other titles like permanent residency have expanded over time.1In many countries, permanent residents have security of residence and some protection against expulsion: they also enjoy many of the same benefits and access to public transfers as citizens, for instance. And yet, it is only citizens that enjoy the full protection and support by the host state; and citizenship facilitates sponsoring and securing citizenship for family members.If one accepts the idea that citizenship matters even today, the question arises how to design citizenship policies: who has access, when and which criteria have to be fulfilled? The design of citizenship policies is often shaped by two opposing views on the role of citizenship. The first one, popular in the political and public debate, argues that citizenship is the crown for a successfully completed integration process. Viewed from this perspective, the requirements for naturalization should be strict, such as long residency requirements, mandatory language orcivicknowledge tests, in order to reward integration efforts and select the immigrants most willing to invest in integration. Once immigrants are awarded citizenship, they have reached the end point of their integration process.A very different perspective argues that citizenship acts as a catalyst for immigrant integration. In this perspective, obtaining host-country citizenship promotes the subsequent integration of immigrants, because it inspires them to invest in a future in the host country, changes the role models they aspire to or because it reduces discrimination by natives, for instance. If citizenship is a catalyst, very long residency requirements delay integration and possibly deter subsequent investments as would stringent language or civic knowledge tests.Yet, research on whether, how and for whom citizenship matters, and which citizenship policies work, comes with specific methodological challenges. Immigrant-native achievement gaps in school or the labor market are typically lower for traditional immigration countries with liberal citizenship rules like Canada or Australia than for countries with more restrictive citizenship policies like Germany or Switzerland (Sweetman and Van Ours, 2014). While this comparison is suggestive, there are many other differences across countries with more liberal and more restrictive policies that could explain the differential outcomes for immigrants. These other cross-country differences are likely to influence the immigrant selection, the environment immigrants find themselves in, and hence, the choices families with a migratory background make. Access to citizenship sometimes varies within a country: children with one native and one foreign-born parent obtain citizenship automatically, for example. Yet, selection into mixed marriages is likely to create a different family environment than in families with two foreign-born parents (Meng and Gregory, 2005). Moreover, not all immigrants have an interest or see any net benefit in obtaining the passport of the host country. Hence, the integrative power of citizenship further depends on who decides to take up the opportunity and how that decision is shaped by eligibility rules.The early literature on citizenship relied on cross-sectional data comparing naturalized citizens with other immigrants who were either not eligible or did not apply for naturalization (e.g.Chiswick, 1978,DeVoretz, Pivnenko, 2005for North America;Bevelander and Veenman, 2008for the Netherlands;Bevelander, Pendakur, 2011,Scott, 2008for Sweden; andFougère and Safi, 2009for France). More recently, studies have employed panel data to study the relationship between naturalization and subsequent labor market performance using individualfixed effectsto control for selection effects (Bratsberg, Ragan, Nasir, 2002,Bratsberg, Raaum, 2011,Steinhardt, 2012). While insightful, this literature faces some limitations. The variation comes from the migrant’s decision to naturalize and the estimation relies on observable controls and possibly fixed effects to address the selection into naturalization. It is unclear whether panel approaches are enough to eliminate any selection bias. Moreover, rational expectations would imply that some decisions like investments in human capital or the selection of a spouse might be undertaken even before the person actually naturalizes. In addition, the literature does not provide answers to several important questions: who actually benefits from more liberal access to citizenship? And which citizenship policies work? The literature has largely focused onlabor market integration, while the discussion above showed that integration is multidimensional and goes well beyond the labor market.Recent research has made substantial progress in illuminating the effects of citizenship by leveraging large-scale reforms in several European countries. Such reforms offer a unique opportunity to deepen our insights about how citizenship works, for whom it works and which rules matter. There is much to learn from these quasi-experiments and field experiments about the integration process, the take-up decisions of immigrants and the eligibility rules that matter. This paper surveys the main insights the recent literature exploiting citizenship reforms and experimental variation has generated for immigrant integration.",Christina,Julio,None
"1. IntroductionIn the present paper, we examine how a policy-induced increase in the number ofelderly workershas affected labor productivity and age-specificlabor demandwithin existing firms. Our analysis is based on a quasi-natural experiment in Norway: In 2011 a pension reform radically improved economic incentives for staying employed after the age of 62 for roughly half of the elderly private sector workers. We show that the reform yielded significant exogenous variation in the age structure of employees within and across firms, enabling identification of a crucial and policy-relevant causal relationship between the employees’ age composition and labor productivity.There is obviously no such thing as a universally valid true causal relationship between age and productivity. The influence of age is likely to vary across occupations,industries, and individuals, and also to change over time due to changes in the capital stock, technological innovations, improvements in health conditions, and changes in the relative supply of labor of different ages (Sharpe, 2011;Gordo and Skirbekk, 2013;Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2018). Hence, it is impossible to interpret an effect of age-composition on firm productivity without explicit reference to the source of variation used to identify it. In particular, the variation in age-structure across firms generated by differences in their optimal choices of labor inputs will have other implications for firm productivity than the variation caused by changes in the relative supply of age-specific labor.Our analysis of the relationship between age and productivity is based on the margin of variation that arguably is the most policy relevant of all, namely the variation that results from public policies designed specifically to increaselabor force participationamong the elderly. Such policies are discussed and/or have already been implemented in virtually all advanced economies, most often in the form of pension reforms raising the retirement age and/or removing earnings tests. These reforms influence the age composition of the workforce by raising the amount of elderly workers’ labor supply in a similar fashion as the aging of populations itself (Coile et al., 2018). Hence, they hold the key to understanding the fundamental relationship between the age composition of a country's labor force and its overall labor productivity.Thepolicy reformexploited in the present paper drastically improved work incentives for employees aged 63–67 who worked in firms affiliated to a supplementary early retirement program covering roughly 50% of private sector workers in Norway. The program is organized by employer and employee organizations, with part of the cost covered by a public subsidy. Up to 2011, the program provided a pension similar to the public pension over the age span 62–67, but subject to a strict earnings test. In 2011, the public pension became available from 62, conditional on a certain level of accrued pension entitlements, and the supplementary program was transformed into a life-long top-up pension at a correspondingly lower level, both without any earnings test. The reform had a large and immediate influence on the share of 62–63-year-olds that chose to continue in employment (Hernæs et al., 2016;Andersen et al., 2021). Cohorts born after 1948 were subjected to the new system, whereas cohorts born earlier maintained the old system; hence, given that the supplementary early retirement program covered a five year period, the reform's overall influence on the age-specific employment patterns were gradually phased in over five years. The resultant rise in participation rates increased the number of older persons in firms affiliated to the early retirement program, but not in other firms. The reform's influence on the number of mature workers also varied considerably across affiliated firms due to differences in the initial age composition of their workforces. Hence, by exploiting the differences between “treated” and “non-treated” firms as well as the differences between treated firms with different initial age structures within a difference-in-differences framework, we can identify the causal impacts of exogenous (policy-induced) changes in the number of elderly employees on various firm outcomes, without having to rely on common trends for either firms with and without elderly employees or for firms with and withoutaffiliationto the early retirement program.We use administrative register data, which cover a description of all limited liability private sector firms’ labor inputs, wage costs, profits, sales, and value added over the period from 2002 through 2018, with information on participation in the early retirement program from 2007. For each year 2007–2018 we use the predicted share of (fulltime-equivalent) “treated” workers as an instrument for the firm's actual share of age 63–67 labor input, with the prediction based on the workers’ age composition five years before. In theregression analyses, we control for separate time (year) effects by early retirement program affiliation and by the fraction of workers belonging to early retirement age, and identify the causal effect through the interaction of program affiliation, age composition, and time. The identification strategy hinges on the orthogonality of this interaction term and the residual shocks to the outcomes, conditional on the separate time-trends and other controls, including firm-fixed effects. We examine the validity of the identification strategy throughevent studies(including “placebo” outcome years) and the inclusion of alternative control functions.Examining labor productivity at the firm level entails some serious measurement problems. Our primary measure of labor productivity at the firm level is based on annual accounts, and defined as the value added (total wage costs plus profits) divided by total labor input (the number of person-years). This can only be a crude proxy for productivity, however, as the timing of realized profits may deviate substantially from the timing of actual value creation. Hence, as a supplement, we also use measures based on reported sales and wage costs. To complicate the analysis, we expect measurement error in the quantities of annual labor input, and also outlier problems related to skewed distributions of key variables, including firm size and profits. These data and measurement challenges are inherent in empirical analyses of firm-level productivity, and inevitably imply that subjective choices must be made regarding, e.g., sample inclusion criteria, outlier treatment, and functional forms. Ideally, such choices should be made strictly prior to the actual data analysis (in order to avoid data-mining). Yet, in practice, it is difficult to fully identify and understand the actual data problems, and thus to choose the appropriate remedies, without having examined the data to some extent. Our solution to this dilemma is to be as transparent as possible regarding the criteria used to adapt the data, and then to assess the consequences for the results of modifying each criterion.These data challenges also imply that the relationship between age and productivity is estimated with considerable uncertainty. With this caveat in mind, we provide results indicating that overall labor productivity is most likely positively affected by a higher share of age 63–67 workers triggered by postponed retirement due to improved work incentives. The estimated impact on the average wage level is also positive, reflecting that individual wages typically grow with experience and tenure, either due to higher productivity or due to incentive contracts. The estimated effect on total employment is uncertain, but point estimates indicate a negative overall effect. A more detailed analysis of age-specific labor demand patterns shows that the demand for younger (below age 30) workers is significantly reduced. This effect is fully accounted for by reduced hiring of new workers. The employment effect appears to be heterogeneous though, and in industries where we expect the degree of complementarity between young and old workers to be considerable we do not find any displacement effect on younger workers.Our paper relates to an existing literature examining how particular skills develop over the lifecycle, showing that some skills tend to deteriorate with high age (e.g., physical strength, adaptability, fluid cognitive ability) whereas others are stable or improve (e.g., experience-based knowledge, crystalized cognitive ability), with large variations across individuals (Skirbekk, 2008;Sharpe, 2011). The consequences of aging for labor productivity thus depend on the way the elderly are sorted into and out of jobs, and on how their skills match the skills of other workers. The degree to which workers of different ages are substitutes or complements in the production process plays a key role, as also reflected in our results.There is a large empirical literature examining the relationship between labor productivity and the age-composition of workers at the firm level. Although some cross-sectional studies find indications of a declining (or hump-shaped) relationship between average age and labor productivity (e.g.,Grund and Westergaard, 2008;Lallemand and Rycx, 2009), analyses based on panel data essentially indicate that productivity does not decline with the fraction of elderly employees; see, e.g.,Cardoso et al. (2011),van Ours and Stoeldraijer (2011),Göbel and Zwick (2012), andMahlberg et al. (2013). However, this literature focuses on how the actually chosen age-composition of labor inputs affect firm productivity, given the prevailing labor force participation patterns among the elderly and given the existing age-specific sorting into jobs. It cannot say much about the expected effects of changes in the age structure generated by exogenous changes in the overall supply of mature labor.A recent paper that does say something about the impacts of exogenous changes in labor supply, and hence is more closely related to our own contribution, isCarta et al. (2021). This paper uses a pension reform in Italy to identify the short-term effects of a policy-induced increase in the supply of workers above 55 years. Not far from our results, they find that the rise in the participation of mature workers did not significantly affect average labor productivity. However, in contrast to us, they estimate a positive impact on the demand for younger workers. Hence, older and younger workers appears to be complements in the firms they study, and they conclude that rising institutional retirement ages can help firms retaining valuable older employees. Interestingly, another paper using exactly the same pension reform to identify causality (Boeri et al., 2022) reaches a conclusion more similar to ours, namely that postponed retirement caused a reduction in the demand for other age groups.",Erik,Tom,Simen
"1. IntroductionThe economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have been distributed unequally across age groups. Sectors that typically employ young workers were hit the hardest, and there is evidence that employment losses have disproportionately been borne by younger people (Eurofound, 2021). As a result, the crisis led to a decrease in students’ outlook for financial security and may have affected their expectations about the employment prospects of different occupations, in turn altering their demand for different fields of study. Survey evidence byAucejo et al. (2020)suggests that college students were indeed quick to reconsider their education decisions as economic disruptions became evident during the early stages of the pandemic: as early as mid-2020, US undergraduates began to switch from lower- to higher-paying fields.The existing literature on how economic disruptions affect field-of-study choices primarily focuses on highereducation levels. In contrast, we consider the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on program choices at the high school level, and to the best of our knowledge, our work is unique in this respect. This is an important contribution because the choice of high school major can have significant consequences for adult earnings and labor market prospects (Altonji, Blom, Meghir, 2012,Dahl, Rooth, Stenberg, 2023,SCB, 2017). Moreover, the vast majority of individuals in a birth cohort make field-of-study choices in high school,1while a much smaller subset of the population with above-average socioeconomic status makes this choice at the college level. Our evidence comes from the Swedish context, where high school students apply to field-specific programs that can be characterized as either academic (e.g., Natural Science) or vocational (e.g., Building & Construction) in nature. However, our results have broader relevance, given that high school students make similar choices in the majority of other European countries.2To study how program demand changed in response to the COVID-19 crisis, we use a difference-in-differences strategy exploiting the fact that admission to Swedish high schools consists of two rounds. In the preliminary round, applicants rank their preferences for specific programs and submit their initial choices to a central admission authority by mid-February. After preliminary admission decisions are released, students have until mid-May to alter their preference rankings for the final admission round. As shown inFig. 1, the timeline of the two rounds provides unique pre- and post-crisis snapshots of the 2020 admission cohort’s study choices. It is essential for our identification strategy that the crisis had not yet hit Sweden and was still considered an epidemic in Asia when applicants submitted their initial preference rankings. However, by the final admission round, the epidemic had turned into a pandemic and had spread to and within Sweden. This allows us to identify the immediate effect of the crisis on program demand by estimating the change in the number of top-ranked applications to specific programs between the admission rounds in 2020 as compared to the change between the rounds in the previous year.Download :Download high-res image (213KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1.Timeline of COVID-19 cases, pandemic-related restrictions, and high school admissions in Sweden during spring 2020.Notes: The shaded region depicts the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in Sweden from February to June 2020 based on data from the Public Health Agency of Sweden. The vertical lines labeled “Preliminary” and “Final” indicate the dates that preliminary- and final-round high school applications were due. The other vertical lines indicate pandemic-related restrictions that were imposed at the national level.In order to conduct our study, we built a unique data set on applicants’ program choices in the preliminary and final admission rounds in 2020, as well as several years before the crisis. Sweden’s official individual-level registry data does not contain any information on preliminary choices; however, most high school admission centers compile aggregate statistics for each program offered by a school. We contacted the admission centers and requested these statistics for all rounds from 2016 to 2020, collecting data for almost 700 schools and covering over 90% of applications nationwide. At the school level, we observe the number of applicants who list a particular program as the top-ranked choice on their application: we argue that this measure captures students’ demand for programs more accurately than admission or enrollment outcomes, which might be constrained by the availability of places. In addition, we link our data set to publicly available data on time-varying school-level characteristics of the student body and teaching staff from the Swedish National Agency of Education. In our main model, we exploit variation within a school over rounds and time and include schoolfixed effectsas well as time-varying school-level controls that may affect the desirability of schools.Our results show that the arrival of the pandemic led to a decline in top-ranked applications to some of the vocational programs, whereas none of the academic programs were affected. The effect of the outbreak was particularly striking in the Hotel & Restaurant program, where demand between the rounds dropped by more than 100% compared to the change between the rounds in the previous year. In addition, we find a decline in demand for the Child & Recreation program. In both of the affected programs, the effect is robust throughout and non-trivial, amounting to an 8% and 6% drop, respectively, in relation to the mean number of applications to these programs. In contrast to papers showing that college enrollment increases in response to recessions, there is no indication that students systematically shift towards programs that tend to lead to higher-paying jobs or to programs that grant eligibility university studies after finishing high school. However, we note that graduates of the two programs where we find effects are among the lowest paid and have a slightly lower likelihood of finding a stable job upongraduationrelative to graduates of other programs. Thus, our findings are in line with the interpretation that high school majors with poorer average job prospects become less attractive in economic downturns. Moreover, the decrease in top-ranked applications to the Hotel & Restaurant program is in line with responses to sector-specific shocks, and reflects that the decline in employment and vacancies was largest in the Accommodation & FoodServices sector.3We perform several sensitivity analyses to support our findings. First, we show that the main estimates are essentially unchanged when we estimate our model without school fixed effects or time-varying school-level controls, suggesting that changes in the desirability of schools are unlikely to bias our results. Second, we use our model to estimate whether the pandemic led to adjustments on the supply side. Supply-side adjustments may be rather limited given that we study the immediate effects of the crisis, but one motivation for Sweden’s two-step admission process is that schools have the possibility to adjust program capacity between rounds and can even remove programs from their offer list if necessary. Thus, we use the difference in the number of offered places per program between rounds as an outcome in order to show that distortions in the supply of available places do not explain our findings. There is also no evidence that distortions in the internship component of vocational programs explain our results.4Our paper contributes to a large literature on how economic downturns affect human capital decisions. With regard to the length of education, there is ample evidence of the existence of a countercyclical pattern with regard to high school and college enrollment in the US and the UK, though the strength of the relationship varies widely (see, for instance,Betts, McFarland, 1995,Card, Lemieux, 2001,Clark, 2011,Rice, 1999). For Norway,Reiling and Strøm (2014)find that completion rates at the upper secondary level are countercyclical, in particular for students enrolled in vocational tracks. There is also a growing literature showing that students alter their choice of college majors to higher-paying fields when faced with a depressed labor market (Blom, Cadena, Keys, 2021,Bradley, 2012,Liu, Sun, Winters, 2018). However, other studies find that sector-specific shocks can deter college students from generally well-paid or prestigious majors in the affected sectors (Han, Winters, 2020,Weinstein, 2022). Our study is one of the few that provides results for students who apply to vocational programs and generally come from families with a lower socioeconomic background.5There is little direct evidence on how vocational field-of-study choices are affected with the exception ofActon (2021), who shows that local occupation-specific employment variations affect related field-of-study choices at the community college level and that students tend to switch between vocational programs that require similar skills.The rest of the paper is structured as follows.Section 2provides key institutional details about the Swedish school system, the two-step admission process that we exploit for identification, and the early impact of the COVID-19 crisis in Sweden.Section 3describes our self-collected data and empirical model.Section 4presents our main results, including a discussion of the parallel trends assumption.Section 5reports several robustness checks of the main findings.Section 6concludes the study with a discussion on the interpretation of our results and their policy relevance.",Aino-Maija,Dagmar,J.

Employment rates differ substantially by race and ethnicity. They are highest for non-Hispanic white respondents (75 percent), dropping to 65 and 63 percent for Hispanic and black respondents, respectively. Rates are lower for those without a college degree. By construction, the initial employment rate is 100 percent in the last three columns, as these are based on a wage criterion.Hourly pay (in 2019 dollars) averaged $21 over the sample period, $0.7 higher for (non-Hispanic) white workers versus $4.7 and $3.1 lower for Hispanic and black workers. These differences do not persist within the low-wage group, e.g. Hispanic workers earn more than their white counterparts in the<1.5MW sample. This difference in patterns between the bottom group and the average could result from the equalizing effects of minimum wage policy at the bottom.QWIThe Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) dataset, which is based on administrative Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics data, has employment stocks and flows for most U.S. states.10In recent years the QWI has incorporated race, gender and ethnicity variables. The dataset is available through different endpoints, which split the data into differentpopulation groups. We start from the ‘rh’ endpoint, which splits workers by their race and ethnicity. We define hiring, separation and turnover rates as perDube et al. (2016), where each rate is defined as the new flows divided by employment at the start of the quarter (Et0), e.g. the quarterly hiring rateHt=hirestEt0and the separation rateSt=separationstEt0. The turnover rate is the average of the hiring and separation rate. We restrict the QWI-based analyses to the foodservices sector(NAICS 722) as the minimum wage is considerably more binding in that sector than in the overall economy. Around 25% of all minimum wage workers are active in the food services sector (Wursten, 2020).Table 3provides descriptive QWI statistics for 1990–2020. The average state employed about 26 thousand black workers, 34 thousand Hispanic workers and almost 116 thousand non-Hispanic white workers in the food services sector (with large standard deviations). Quarterly hiring and separation rates are high among white workers (36 percent) and higher still among Hispanic (40 percent) and particularly black workers (48 percent), suggesting considerable workforce churn in this sector.11Average weekly earnings for black workers are also considerably lower than for their Hispanic and white coworkers.Table 3.

"1. Tertiary education expansion and job opportunities: theoretical considerations and hypothesesThe availability of a new type of high-skilled workers (such asUASgraduates) may have two effects on job opportunities: (a) firms create new jobs with tasks suited for the skills of that new type (as first-order outcomes) and (b) firms restructure the task allocation in jobs for other types of workers (as second-order outcomes). This restructuring can take the form of either crowding out skilled tasks (i.e., downskilling) according to assignment models (e.g.,Acemoglu and Autor, 2011;Rosen, 1978;Sattinger, 1975) or adding skilled tasks (i.e., upskilling) to better match existing jobs with the newly created jobs according to organizational models (e.g.,Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg, 2006;Lazear, 1999; orMcCann et al., 2015). The direction of the effect on second-order outcomes thus remains theoretically ambiguous.1.1. Crowding outIn assignment models of comparative advantage, firms maximize overall output by partitioning tasks among different types of workers, with each type of worker performing a bundle of tasks called a “job” (for a comprehensive survey of the literature, seeSattinger, 1993, andDupuy, 2008). As the optimal allocation of types of workers to tasks follows the logic of comparative advantage, firms assign types of workers to tasks for which these types are relatively more capable (Acemoglu and Autor, 2011;Dupuy, 2008,2012;Sattinger, 1975;Teulings, 1995,2005). Therefore, after a high-skilled labor supply shock, firms seek the new high-skilled workers for high-skill tasks (first-order outcome). However, in a static model, these tasks stem partly from a reallocation of tasks originally allocated to less-skilled workers (Costrell and Loury, 2004). The restructuring and reallocation of tasks to high-skilled workers thus result in a crowding out of those tasks and downskilling for less-skilled workers (second-order outcomes).Applied to the effects of the establishment of UASs, the graduates of these institutions have a comparative advantage in high-skill R&D-related tasks, for which firms would therefore seek and employ them (as first-order outcomes). In a static model, firms would thus reallocate the tasks of middle-skilled workers and assign them to fewer of these high-skill tasks (second-order outcomes). In this case, we thus expect a crowding out of skilled tasks, such as contributing to R&D processes, and downskilling for the middle-skilled workers.1.2. UpskillingOrganizational models assume that the combination of tasks for producing output requires different workers to coordinate and communicate (for an overview, seeGaricano and Rossi-Hansberg, 2015). Workers encounter frictions when working in teams and combining tasks (Deming, 2017;Lazear, 1999), with communication and coordination necessary for overcoming those frictions (McCann et al., 2015;Morris and Shin, 2007). Therefore, exploiting complementarities (e.g., from different sources of knowledge) and realizing the gains from comparative advantage (e.g., from different skill sets) requires different types of workers to be able to effectively communicate with one another (Garicano and Wu, 2012;Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg, 2006,2004;Lazear, 1999). Some types of workers may be particularly qualified for this communication task, e.g., by being either bilingual in occupation-specific terminology or well-versed in different cultures (socioeconomic or departmental) or fields of work (technical or administrative) (Lazear, 1999).Educationally diverse teams can benefit from complementarities but may also create additional costs if communication difficulties cannot be solved (Kurtulus, 2011). Applying this reasoning to the situation before and after the establishment of UASs, we expect the following effects. Before the establishment of UASs (i.e., in a situation without UAS graduates), larger educational gaps existed between high-skilled workers (academically trained) and middle-skilled workers (with vocational education). Both groups underwent education in two completely separate systems with their own educational conventions, professional languages, and work styles. This gap caused non-negligible communication and coordination costs for teamwork, particularly in R&D processes which require both groups’ knowledge and experience for reaching optimal outcomes.The UASs introduced a new educational career path for middle-skilled workers, which builds on and complements their preexisting skill set from their vocational background with applied research skills. UAS graduates therefore have an education that overlaps both that of academic graduates and vocationally trained workers. This overlap enables UAS graduates to act as bridge builders and communicators between the two groups, reducing communication and coordination costs in teams.After the establishment of UASs, firms can then hire the new graduates to bridge the gap between vocationally trained workers and academically trained university graduates for their R&D processes. UAS graduates help to promote teamwork across different educational levels in the R&D process and facilitate the creation of new R&D-related tasks among vocationally trained workers such as building testing devices or prototypes (for case studies, seeBackes-Gellner and Pfister, 2019). The presence of UAS graduates thus enhances the overall efficiency of R&D processes, enabling firms to expand their R&D efforts. Empirical evidence supports such efficiency gains by showing that the UAS establishment had a positive impact on (A) R&D efforts by firms (Lehnert et al., 2020), (B)patentnumbers and patent quality (Pfister et al., 2021), and (C) firm profits and regional development (Schlegel et al., 2020).According to this dynamic explanation, the presence of UAS graduates raises the innovation and R&D efforts by firms, resulting in more skilled tasks even for middle-skilled workers without a UAS degree (as second-order outcomes). Following this reasoning, we expect upskilling for middle-skilled vocationally trained workers after the establishment of UASs.While the assignment and organizational literatures derive unambiguous theoretical predictions for the first-order outcomes (i.e., firms seeking UAS graduates for high-skilled tasks such as R&D-related tasks), the predictions for the second-order outcomes are contradictory, i.e., task restructuring may lead to either a crowding out or an addition of skilled tasks to the jobs offered to vocationally trained workers. To solve this puzzle empirically, we require detailed information from job ads on the tasks for which firms want to hire workers before and after the establishment of UASs.",Tobias,Curdin,Ann-Sophie
"1. IntroductionHigh schoolgraduationhas long been considered a key marker of human capital development. The U.S. led the world in high school graduation through the 1960s (Murnane, 2013), which helped drive decades of economic growth throughout the first two-thirds of the twentieth century (Goldin & Katz, 2008;Gordon, 2015). However, this was followed, in the 1970s through 1980s, by slower graduation rate growth (Mishel & Roy, 2006) or perhaps even declines in graduation (Heckman & Lafontaine, 2010). The rest of the world has also been catching up and the U.S. graduation ranking has declined from 1stto 13th(out of 19 countries) in theOECD(Murnane, 2013).While there remains some debate about the graduation trends prior to 2000, there is no question that U.S. graduation rates began to climb quickly afterwards. The national graduation rate, calculated from Current Population Survey (CPS) workforce surveys shown inFigure 1, increased by 10 percentage points between 2000 and 2016 (OECD, 2012;Murnane, 2013). Data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) suggest an even larger 18 percent point rise over this period.1President Obama and Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, touted these as important accomplishments (Duncan, 2018).Download :Download high-res image (205KB)Download :Download full-size imageFigure 1. High School Graduation Rate TrendsNotes: The solid line reports the CPS status completion rate for adults aged 18-24, based on household surveys. The dotted NCES lines reports the average graduation rate constructed from data reported by states to the U.S. Department of Education. Given that the CPS reports graduation for adults in the 18-24 age range, we also adjusted the NCES line to be a rolling average of the prior six years for comparability, presented in the long-dashed line.One obvious potential contributor has been a change in federal policy that roughly coincided with the graduation rate increase.No Child Left Behind(NCLB) became law in January of 2002 and is well known for its focus on test scores (Dee & Jacob, 2011). Less recognized is that the original law also required accountability for high school graduation. At first, states were only required to improve graduation in some fashion; they could set any target and improvement rates they wished, but those schools that did not meet these goals were threatened withsanction. Starting in 2010, the U.S. Department of Education (USDOE) started pressuring states to set higher graduation rate goals (all states set their thresholds above 80 percent graduation) and requiring that states generate substantial improvement for schools and districts.2The timing of these policy changes, during 2002-2010, roughly coincide with the high-stakes graduation rate increases inFigure 1, suggesting that accountability helped cause the change. A key purpose of this study is to understand the overall effect of accountability on graduation rates, and to what degree this might reflect an increase in students’ human capital versus strategic behavior of schools.One potential effect is that the NCLB-induced pressure led schools to improve educational practice in ways that led students to stay in school longer. For example, other evidence suggests that NCLB affected teacher quality and other aspects of educational practice school efforts (Hanushek & Rivkin, 2010;Reback, Rockoff, Schwartz, 2014;Rouse et al., 2013).3These steps might have led students to stay in school longer.Strategic behavior is an alternative explanation. Ample evidence suggests that test-based accountability has led schools to teach to the test (Koretz, 2009), cheat (Jacob, 2005), and even alter cafeteria food and caloric intake around testing time to artificially boost scores (e.g.,Figlio and Winicki, 2005), none of which would increase human capital. Consistent with this story, low-stakes NAEP scores have been increasing much more slowly than high-stakes scores (Koretz, 2009). The same distortions could have arisen with graduation rates when they, too, became high stakes.Two general forms of strategic behavior are possible with graduation rates: those that make is easier to graduate (pertaining to the numerator of the calculation) and those reduce the pool of students who are counted as potential graduates (pertaining to the denominator). Regarding credential quality, schools have discretion over the content of their courses, the standards required to pass them, and, more generally, what constitutes graduation. Teachers may be under pressure from school principals to inflate grades and make it easier to pass courses. Students can also choose between regular diplomas and General Educational Development (GED) credentials. Even if they do sometimes seem to benefit certain subgroups on certain outcomes (Murnane, Willett & Tyler, 2000;Jepsen, Mueser, & Troske, 2016,2017), GEDs are widely considered to have less labor market value than diplomas (Cameron & Heckman, 1993;Heckman, Humphries & Mader, 2011).Another more recent development is the availability of online “credit recovery” programs that help struggling students earn credits for courses they have failed, to stay on track to graduate. In some of these programs, students can receive course credit simply by passing a state competency-based test, without meaningful instructional time, similar to the GED (Heckman & LaFontaine, 2006). Recent evidence suggests that online courses in high school increase high school graduation, but with limited influence on academic achievement (Heinrich et al., 2019). Graduation accountability might therefore have induced more students to take credit recovery courses and reduced credential quality.The second potential distortion involves the graduation rate denominator. Schools control which students count toward their graduation rate calculation through the exit codes. Since schools themselves assign these codes, they can remove students from their accountability metrics by inaccurately assigning certain codes. For example, a recent audit in Louisiana (Louisiana Department of Education, n.d.) was unable to confirm large numbers of exit codes for students who were listed as having transferred to private or out-of-state schools, or to home schooling, which removed them from schools’ potential dropouts. These exit codes are more difficult for the state to verify than most other exit codes.With both forms of strategic behavior—changing graduation requirements (numerator) and changing who counts as a potential graduate (denominator)—the key observation is that the data used to calculate performance are being created by the schools being held accountable for those measures, with relatively little oversight. Anecdotal evidence points to manipulation of graduation data and other forms of strategic behavior as a real problem in cities like New Orleans (Jewson, 2019), Prince Georges County (St. George and Bui, 2017), San Diego (Huntsberry, 2018), and Washington, DC (McGee, 2018;St. George, 2018).In this paper, we test the size and nature of graduation accountability effects using various types of difference-in-differences (DD) analysis: First, we construct national district- and state-level panel data sets that go back to several years prior to the initiation of the federal accountability requirements. We identify each state's graduation accountability threshold, each district's graduate rate, and which districts are below the threshold.4Our results suggest, first, that graduation rates increased more in states that had more districts threatened by sanction and in districts (within states) that were more seriously threatened with sanctions. In addition, we find that the effects were largest in states that did not have test-based accountability pre-NCLB. A possible explanation for this pattern is that the increase in graduation from graduation accountability was partially offset in some states by new test-based accountability from NCLB that reduced graduation rates.Taken together, the above analyses suggest that NCLB increased high school graduation rates. However, given prior evidence of strategic responses to test-based accountability, and the partial divergence of the labor data and school-reported metrics inFigure 1, we have suggestive evidence that not all of the increase in graduation rates has reflected human capital improvement and may involve accountability-induced strategic behavior. To provide more evidence on the source of graduation rate increases, we carried out four additional analyses.First, we identified data on national trends in regular high school diplomas versus GEDs. Federal graduation accountability guidelines generally exclude GEDs and, perhaps partially as a result, the number of GEDs is consistently smaller post-NCLB than pre-NCLB (NCES, 2010;Barshay, 2018). This could also partially explain the slower increase in CPS completion, which includes GEDs.Second, we provide descriptive analysis of the trends in state graduation rates by whether states have graduation exams (or experienced changes in graduation exam policies during the panel period). If the rise in graduation rates was entirely due to strategic behavior, we would expect that the states without graduation exams experienced larger increases in graduation rates. But we see the opposite, suggesting that the upward trend in high school graduation is not because schools lowered their academic standards to make graduation easier.Third, panel data from Louisiana allow us to impute credit recovery courses for individual students and to test whether the trends in these credit recovery courses differed before and after accountability pressures in Louisiana increased. We see almost no evidence that credit recovery explains the overall graduation rate increases.Fourth, given that the above analyses focus on strategic behavior in the numerator, we address potential distortion in the denominator using detailed Louisiana microdata to analyze the exit codes that schools used to identify graduates and to exclude students from graduation calculations. We see some evidence that graduation rates increased the use of hard-to-verify exit codes, but these effects are statistically insignificant and very small relative to the size of the graduation rate increases in Louisiana and nationally.5Also, most of these distortions cannot affect the specific graduation measures shown inFigure 1, so even the small distortions in exit codes we observe cannot explain the upward national graduation trend.In short, all of the above analyses suggest that graduation rates increased substantially, that this rise reflects human capital improvement, and that graduation accountability is a principal cause. We continue, in Section II, by discussing how different data and methods of calculating graduation rates are applied in our analysis, and potential distortions that arise with each measure, which is necessary later in the interpretation of results. In section III, we outline our difference-in-differences methods. Section IV discusses the results for the effects of graduation accountability on graduation rates, while section V analyses potential strategic behavior. Section VI concludes.",Douglas,Lihan,Nathan
"1. IntroductionThe government is a major employer of qualified workers, hiring more than 25 per cent of all college graduates in mostOECDeconomies. However, in the public sector, the returns of education are lower. On average, the public sector pays higher wages than the private sector but the premium is higher for workers without a college degree.1Our objective is to study how public-sector employment and wage policies, heterogeneous across education groups, influence incentives to invest in formaleducation and employmentof workers with and without college.We set up a search model with a private and a public sector. Employment and wages in the private sector are determined through the usual channels of free entry and Nash bargaining. In the public sector, by contrast, employment and wages are policy variables and, hence, taken as exogenous. We incorporate an education decision. Prior to entering the labor market, individuals decide whether to invest in education. Doing so is costly but yields returns, as highly-educated workers benefit from higher job-finding rates and wages in both sectors. Workers are heterogeneous with respect to their education costs. Thus, only a fraction of individuals – those whose benefits exceed the costs – invest in education.We find that wage andemployment policiesaffect the educational composition and unemployment rate of skilled and unskilled workers. The mechanisms and the quantitative effects depend on the labour market structure - segmented markets or random search. Under segmented markets, workers choose a career in a particular sector and might face an entry cost for public-sector jobs. Under random search, unemployed workers apply randomly to jobs in both sectors, and do not face an entry cost in the public sector. We argue that the two sectors are segmented when barriers to entering the public sector exist. These barriers may represent national entry exams or jobs that are restricted to workers with political capital. We think this assumption portrays a realistic mechanism of selection into the public sector in several countries, documented empirically byNickell and Quintini (2002)or experimentally byBó et al. (2013)lying at the heart of current policy discussions. High wages attract many unemployed to queue for public-sector jobs. Conversely, if wages are too low, few unemployed search in the public sector, which then faces recruitment problems. In several countries, like France or Spain, the general rule is thatcivil servantsare recruited through competitive exams early in their careers which clearly suggests that markets are segmented. However, we also examine the scenario where workers search randomly for jobs in both sectors. This could be a realistic assumption for some types of public-sector jobs or for some countries, where there are no barriers to entering the public sector. In the US, for instance, the majority of federal government jobs are filled through an examination of the applicant’s background, work experience, and education, not through a writtencivil servicetest. While this in itself does not rule out that markets are segmented, it is consistent with unemployed workers not specifically searching for a public-sector job, but getting one by chance.If the two sectors are segmented, an increase of skilled public-sector wages has a small positive impact on the proportion of highly educated and a larger negative impact on skilled private employment. If search across the two sectors is random, it has a large positive impact on both education and skilled private employment. In segmented markets, when skilled public-sector wages increase, more people queue for these jobs. The consequent decrease in the job-finding rate partially offsets the extra gains of education. However, if workers search randomly for jobs in both sectors such offsetting decrease in job-finding rate is not possible. The value of education goes up by more, leading to larger increases in the proportion of high-educated in the labor force. As unemployed search randomly for jobs, a higher pool of educated workers leads to a higher level of skilled private employment, but a lower level of unskilled private employment. Quantitatively, in the model calibrated to four economies - United States, United Kingdom, France and Spain - a 10 per cent increase in skilled wages raises the number of educated workers by 0 to 0.18 per cent under segmented markets, and by 2.5 to 6.9 per cent under random search. Our results are consistent with a recent empirical paper bySomani (2021)that exploits a public-university expansion in Ethiopia together with a shift of demand of public organizations from workers without college to workers with a college degree. Education attainment increased after the expansion, but only in districts where the public-wage premium is large. We also consider a third labour market structure with segmented markets, but in which a worker can choose the sector to apply to whenever in unemployment. This structure allows movements of workers between sectors and shares features of both the segmented markets and random search models.In policy discussions over public-sector pay, it is frequently argued that the jobs offer compensating benefits, like job-security. We highlight the usefulness of our model by quantifying the value of job security in the public-sector, for workers with and without college. We calculate what fraction of their wage would private-sector workers sacrifice for the job-separation rate of the public sector, or conversely, how much would public-sector workers have to be compensated in order to have the job-security of the private sector. As our model is populated by risk-neutral workers, this is a lower bound for the value of job security. We find that these premia vary across countries and across workers. It is larger in countries where unemployment is more persistent and the unemployment benefits are low, and it is larger for unskilled workers. The job-security premium in the US varies between 0.5 to 1.1 per cent for skilled workers and between 1.5 to 5.9 per cent for unskilled workers. In Spain, the values range from 2.3 to 7.8 per cent.We contribute to the recent literature that analyzes the role and effects of public employment and wages. Some papers assume that the two sectors’ labor markets are segmented, and that the unemployed choose which of the sectors to search in, depending on the government’s hiring, separation and wage policies.Hörner et al. (2007)study the effect of turbulence on unemployment when wages in the public sector are insulated from this volatility.Quadrini and Trigari (2007)show how different exogenous business cycle rules affect unemployment volatility.Gomes (2015)emphasizes the role of public-sector wages in achieving the efficient allocation, whileAfonso and Gomes (2014)highlight the interactions between private and public wages.Chassamboulli and Gomes (2021)study the role ofnepotismin public sector hiring. In a model with workers heterogeneous in ability,Geromichalos and Kospentaris (2022)study how workers’ selection into the public sector affectsmacroeconomicaggregates.Other papers assume that the unemployed search randomly across sectors, and, hence, policies affect the equilibrium through the outside option of the unemployed and their reservation wage.Burdett (2012)includes the public sector in a job-ladder framework where firms post wages.Bradley et al. (2017)further introduce job-to-job transitions between the two sectors to study the effects of public-sector policies on the distribution of private-sector wages.Albrecht et al. (2017)consider heterogeneous human capital and match specific productivity in a Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model.Michaillat (2014)shows that the crowding-out effect of public employment is lower during recessions, giving rise to higher government spending multipliers. These papers’ objective is to determine how public employment and wage policies affect private employment, the unemployment rate and private wages.Feng and Guo (2021)focus on employment of state-owned enterprizes in China. Because there is no clear reason why one assumption is more relevant and their relevance might vary across countries, we compare the results under the two structures.With the exception ofAlbrecht et al. (2017), none of these papers consider heterogeneity in education, an oversight, given that the government predominantly hires workers with college degree and that the premia it pays vary with education. Two papers consider this dimension of heterogeneity in a search and matching model.Gomes (2018)examines the effects of a public-sector reform that eliminates the wage premium for all workers.Navarro and Tejada (2022)study the interaction between public employment and the minimum wage. Other papers model this heterogeneity in a frictionless labour market.Domeij and Ljungqvist, 2019study how the public-sector hiring of skilled and unskilled workers in Sweden and the US can explain the diverging evolutions of the skill premium in the two countries.Garibaldi et al. (2021)document that underemployment is more salient in the public sector in OECD countries and disentangle whether the higher education intensity in the public sector is due to technology, wage compression or a higher level of underemployment. In a model ofoccupational choice,Gomes and Kuehn (2017)analyze the effects of skill-biased hiring in the public sector on the occupational choice of entrepreneurs and on firm size.Wilson (1982)studies public-sector employment within a neoclassicaloptimal taxationmodel. With the exception ofWilson (1982)andNavarro and Tejada (2022)who formalize the education decision but do not analyse it in detail, all other papers take the education endowment as exogenous. By endogenizing the choice of education and showing under which conditions and how government employment and wage policies affect it, we contribute to the literature on the determinants of education that started with the seminal contributions ofMincer (1958),Ben-Porath (1967),Weisbrod (1962)andBecker (1975).

"1. IntroductionWhen compared to other EU countries, Italy is still lagging in the integration of women into the labor market. According to Istat, the gender participation gap, defined as the difference between ratios of men and women of working age that participate in the labor force, was 18,2% in 2020, the second highest value in the European Union (after Malta). This gap has been declining in the last decades, with a decrease of 16,6% since 1971 (always according to Istat data), but it still remains a complicated and yet unsolved issue characterizing this country. The factors that led the peninsula to this situation of deep genderinequalityare complex and multifaceted, from discouraging characteristics of thelabor demand(such as the gender wage gap) to cultural reasons involving strict and long-standing social norms. We focus here on explaining Italian contemporaneous rates of the gender participation gap by looking at a new possible determinant:endogamyrates. We define endogamy as “marriage within the community”, so a marriage between two individuals that belong to the same so- cial group, live in the same location, and share the same traditions and customs. We argue that endogamy generates two mechanisms limiting a community's female labor supply. From a first perspective, endogamy increases communities’social isolation, which helps preserve and reinforce traditional social norms and a more conservative role of the woman inside the household. In addition, endogamous unions are characterized by higher costs of dissolution with respect to exogamous ones, given the stronger social ties of the former communities. As a consequence, the probability of divorce is lower and this decreases incentives for wives to look for jobs, given the reduced need to have an “outside option” providing economic stability in case the marriage ends1. Keeping in mind these two mechanisms, our prediction is that if a custom of in-marriage is persistent in an Italian municipality (which is identified as acommunityin our analysis), it will exhibit lower contemporaneous levels of femalelabor force participationand larger gender participation gaps with respect to more “exogamous” municipalities. When we focus on how to technically evaluate this prediction, we encounter two identification issues: first, how to measure the intensity of endogamous marriages within a community, and second, to what extent we are able to detect a causal effect of endogamy on the gender participation gap. We decide to measure the past intensity of endogamy within a community through the diversity of its residents’ surnames, exploiting the indexes byBuonanno and Vanin (2017). To address endogeneity concerns, namely omitted variable bias and reverse causality, we make use of aninstrumental variablestrategy: municipalities’ intensity of in-marriage is instrumented by the degree of ruggedness of itsterritory. Here, the underlying logic is that the geographic fragmentation of a municipality's surface contributes to its isolation and augments the frequency of in-marriage, as it is confirmed by our first- stage regressions. The main concern of using this instrument is the validity of the exclusion restriction, since it has been demonstrated that ruggedness has direct and negative effects on economic activity (Nunn and Puga, 2012) and it could therefore generate a scarcity of jobs. To support the validity of our instrumental variable strategy, we extensively discuss the inclusion of controls in our specification preventing ruggedness from directly impacting our outcome of interest. In addition, in the online Appendix D we present a placebo analysis supporting the validity of the exclusion restriction assumption. However, even after control- ling for observables and performing this placebo, ruggedness could still be suspected to be an imperfect instrument: this is why in the online Appendix E we show that the effect of endogamy on the gender participation gap is robust even if we relax the exclusion restriction assumption, following the approach suggested byNevo and Rosen (2012)2.Our main results show how the past intensity of endogamy within a community contributes to enlarging gender participation gaps across Italian municipalities in 2001. These results, confirmed by a series of robustness checks, shed light on a new perspective linking marriage patterns and female labor supply, providing a new explanation for the gender-unbalanced Italian labor force.The paper is organized as follows: inSection 2we discuss the related literature, with the contribution given by our work. InSection 3we illustrate the problematic integration of women into the Italian labor force and explain how endogamy could have contributed to generating the current large gender participation gap in the peninsula.Section 4describes our data and identification strategy, with a comprehensive discussion of the instrumental variable validity.Section 5focuses on the main empirical results with the link between en- dogamy and the gender participation gap, andSection 6discusses the channels that could have generated these results. We then perform a series of robustness checks inSection 7, confirming the soundness of the main results. Finally,Section 8concludes.",Giovanni,None,None
"1. IntroductionRecent migration flows from non-Western countries to Europe have intensified the discussion around effective integration policy (2016;OECD 2016). Most of the relevant academic literature focuses on the effects of immigration on the labor market outcomes of natives, theeconomic integrationof immigrants (see e.g.Dustmann et al. 2017andPeri 2016for overviews), and opportunities and school outcomes of native and immigrant children (Gould et al., 2004,2009;Geay et al., 2013;Figlio and Özek, 2019). In the long run, however, the development of countries with large immigrant minorities will also depend on natives’ attitudes, preferences and behavior towards minorities.In this paper, we ask whether childhood exposure to ethnic minority peers in school affects natives’ future interaction with minority group members. Future contacts with the minority group could be affected through a change of attitudes (Allport, 1954), or simply because childhood exposure might imply more meeting opportunities or deteriorating economic opportunities of natives.We focus on long-run outcomes that are observed in register data and capture revealed preferences for interacting with the minority group. Our main outcome of interest is an indicator variable equal to one if a native-born individual in the future has a child with a person of non-Western origin, which we view as a proxy for inter-ethnic family formation. As suggested byKalmijn (1998)andFryer (2007), integration in the most intimate spheres of life, such as cohabitation and marriage, truly reflects the majority's attitudes towards minorities, and shows that members of different groups accept each other as social equals.1We also study how childhood exposure to individuals with immigrant background affects future neighborhood and workplace composition as well as the ethnic composition of the schools to which parents send their children. That is, does the experience of immigrant peers in school affect parents’ revealed preferences for their own children's interactions with immigrants at school? In addition to capturing revealed preferences for interacting with minority group members, these outcomes constitute broad measures of the joint integration of immigrants and natives in a society, which reflect inter-group contact opportunities and social and economic integration.We find that exposure to minority peers in school increases natives’ probability of having a child with a partner with non-Western background. Exposure to minority peers can affect future inter-ethnic contact through changed attitudes towards immigrants, but there are also other possible channels. In this study, we address two alternative mechanisms: First, a mechanical relationship due to an increase in meeting opportunities (the “opportunities” mechanism). Second, effects on human capital related outcomes, which in turn may impact both the treated individual's attractiveness in the marriage market, and the future peer group and meeting opportunities throughout theeducation systemand working life.In addition to the overall effect of being exposed to immigrant peers, we followMerlino et al. (2019)and rely on the theoretical assumption that social contacts among young students mostly occur within gender, i.e., girls (boys) interact more with other girls (boys) than with boys (girls).2In accordance with this assumption, same-gender interaction may be more conducive toattitude changesthan opposite-gender exposure. Our specification follows this theoretical reasoning and allows for different effects from exposure to same- vs. opposite sex minority peers.The setting is Sweden, a country where 19% of the population is foreign-born. This group is predominantly made up of refugees and family members of refugees, today originating primarily from the middle-East (Iran, Iraq and Syria) (2019). The study population is native-born students exposed to idiosyncratic variation in school-cohort peers with non-Western origin in grade 9. Because of the strict enforcement of residence-based school assignment in Sweden in the early 1990s, we can use within-school variation across cohorts without being concerned that natives respond to immigrant inflows by changing schools (c.f.Dustmann and Preston 2001). We rely exclusively on register data which allows us to study observed behavior, and therefore circumvent the problem of misreporting bias in survey-based studies on attitudes.3Our results are in line with evidence from the U.S. byMerlino et al. (2019)andShen (2018)and show that peer influences affect inter-group family formation also in a European context where we study relationships between natives and immigrants with non-Western origin. This finding is important, since inter-ethnic relations in Europe often cross religious barriers, and mating patterns for some immigrant groups are influenced by “third party interference” by e.g. family members in the selection process (Kalmijn, 1994;1998).4However, our estimated effect is much smaller than that of exposure to black peers on future interracial romantic relationships found in the US (Merlino et al., 2019), and our results suggest a more complex explanation for the main effect: First, we do not find that same-gender interaction matters most: in our context it is instead opposite-gender interaction that drives the effect. Second, it seems like exposure to non-Western peers affects educational choices, which may in turn affect the probability of ending up in a mixed-ethnic relationship. Taken together, we cannot exclude that attitudes have changed due to exposure to immigrant peers during school, but our results also suggest alternative and partly complementary explanations.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant literature. Section 3 presents data anddescriptive statistics, and Section 4 lays out the details of the empirical strategy. Section 5 presents the results and Section 6 concludes the paper.",Helena,Erica,Sara
"1. IntroductionImmigration raises many concerns in mostOECDcountries and the integration of immigrants has come under scrutiny. Integration includes two distinct but complementary dimensions: the cultural assimilation and theeconomic integrationof immigrants. According toDustmann and Preston (2007), each of these processes heavily affects natives’ attitudes toward immigration. Over the last two decades, Germany has amended its immigration policies to encourage both the cultural assimilation and the economic integration of immigrants.1To understand the interactions between these two processes, this paper studies the relationship between the cultural assimilation process of immigrant workers and their integration into the German labor market.In this paper, I first study the relationship between initial cultural differences and log hourly wages of immigrants over years spent in Germany. I exploit the heterogeneity of immigrants’ origins recorded in the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) to measure cultural distance from Germany at the country level. I successively consider religious, linguistic, and genetic distances, which are the main bilateral indices from the trade and migration literature. I also document the association between immigrants’ individual cultural assimilation and wage growth. I approximate the cultural assimilation of immigrants relative to natives at the individual level by measuring the distance in social concerns between each immigrant in each year and comparable natives via a set of questions repeatedly asked over years in the GSOEP.Measuring cultural differences between individuals is particularly challenging. A widespread strategy involves comparing immigrants who have successfully assimilated to those who have not. Researchers usually rely on proxies such as interethnic marriages, the origins of the names immigrants give to their children, or comparisons of immigrants who have acquired the citizenship of their destination country with those who have not (Abramitzky, Boustan, Eriksson, 2020,Fouka, Mazumder, Tabellini, 2022,Gregory, Meng, 2005). Such a strategy is relevant for assessing the benefits of successful assimilation. However, it is not well suited for observing the assimilation process itself or the initial cultural differences between these immigrants. In this paper, I adopt two distinct strategies to approximate initial cultural differences and the cultural assimilation process of immigrants.The first approach builds on bilateral indices to measure the cultural differences experienced by immigrant workers in Germany. I successively examine religious, linguistic and genetic distances between Germany and immigrants’ countries of origin, which depend on the history of religions, languages and populations across countries. According toSpolaore and Wacziarg (2016), cultural differences “include language and religion but also a broader set of norms, values and attitudes that are transmitted intergenerationally and therefore display persistence over long stretches of time”. The first index is based on the family tree of religions (Fearon and Laitin, 2003), which reflects their successive divisions throughout history. Within this tree, religions are first grouped into broad categories and then broken down into more precise classifications. The religious distance index constructed bySpolaore and Wacziarg (2016)depends on the number of ramifications shared by each pair of religions. Linguistic and genetic distances follow the same logic (Spolaore and Wacziarg, 2016). All three indices measure cultural differences at the country-pair level. They depend on the relative representation of religions, languages and genes in each country.The second approach approximates immigrants’ cultural assimilation instated preferencesat the individual level. Cultural assimilation refers to the process through which immigrants progressively converge toward native behaviors, values, beliefs, and concerns. I followJaschke et al. (2021)and select all questions on social concerns asked in each year in the GSOEP. For each question for each year, I compute the distance between the answer given by each immigrant and the average answer given by natives belonging to the same age group and living in the same region. I then aggregate the results from each question using an index of Euclidean distance. In this paper, I use this index measured at the individual level over years to document the cultural assimilation process and its relationship to wage growth.Using bilateral indices, I document that immigrants from countries with a cultural distance that is onestandard deviationlarger earn, on average, 4% to 10% less per hour when they enter the German labor market. These wage differences between immigrants diminish over years spent in Germany. I show that the wage gap associated with a one standard deviation difference in religious and genetic distance disappears after 15 to 20 years. Using the individual index of distance in social concerns, I investigate the role of cultural assimilation in this dynamic pattern. I provide evidence that immigrants who experience a greater increase in cultural assimilation experience more wage growth as well. This paper adopts a descriptive approach and does not make a causal claim. Nevertheless, this series of results shows that the cultural assimilation process is associated with thelabor market integrationof immigrants.This paper contributes to the literature on the economic assimilation of immigrants. Since the seminal work ofChiswick (1978), this stream of research focused on determining whether wage assimilation patterns have resulted from immigrants’ economic integration or from selection mechanisms (Abramitzky, Boustan, Eriksson, 2014,Borjas, 1985,Dustmann, Görlach, 2016,Lubotsky, 2007) changing the composition of immigrant populations. My results bring additional evidence from the German context to this debate. They show that the cultural and social assimilation of immigrant workers also helps explain wage assimilation patterns.This paper also relates to the literature measuring the cultural assimilation of immigrants.Abramitzky et al. (2020)andFouka et al. (2022)rely on several proxies including the names immigrants give to their children, naturalization and interethnic marriage to document immigrants’ efforts and success in assimilation.Bertrand and Kamenic (2018)andDesmet and Wacziarg (2021)use survey responses on values, concerns and habits to measure cultural convergence over time across different groups of individuals. Similarly,Jaschke et al. (2021)compare survey responses between natives and refugees to measure the cultural assimilation of the latter in stated preferences. In this paper, I use this methodology to approximate the cultural assimilation of immigrants in Germany.Finally, this paper relates to the part of this literature specifically focusing on the relationship between cultural and labor market integration. One approach consists of comparing the labor market outcomes of immigrants who have successfully assimilated to those of others (Costanza, Corrado, Zahra, 2017,Gregory, Meng, 2005). Another approach compares labor market outcomes of immigrants who differ by their attachment to their originalculture.Battu and Zenou (2010);Bisin et al. (2011);Casey and Dustmann (2010);Mason (2004), andIslam and Raschky (2015)show that immigrants reporting a stronger ethnic identity have poorer employment prospects. Other studies document how outward signs of cultural assimilation affect labor market outcomes.Bleakley and Chin (2004);Chiswick and Miller (2012);Dustmann and Fabbri (2003);Dustmann and Soest (2002);Guven and Islam (2015);McManus et al. (1983)andLochmann et al. (2018)report consistent evidence indicating a negative effect of language deficiency on employment and wages. A last approach specifically focuses on the relationship between naturalization and labor market outcomes.Bratsberg et al. (2002);Felfe et al. (2020);Gathmann and Keller (2018);Gathmann and Monscheuer (2020), andGovind (2021)document several channels through which naturalization benefits the economic integration of immigrant workers.My paper contributes to several aspects of this literature. First, it documents the relationship between wages and the cultural assimilation process itself. Most papers focus on either the labor market implications of successful assimilation or ethnic identity. My paper provides evidence showing that the process itself is associated with higher wages. This dimension is particularly relevant from a policy perspective. Finally, this work also complements the assimilation literature by showing that the different measures of cultural differences are complementary and give results that are consistent with each other.Section 2of this paper presents the data used.Section 3studies the relationship between initial cultural differences and differences in wage levels across immigrants by the number of years spent in Germany.Section 4focuses on the relationship between cultural assimilation and wage growth.Section 5concludes.",Morgan,None,None
"1. IntroductionIn recent years, identity has become a key topic in the public debate on immigrants’ integration. On the one hand, the observed persistence of pronounced origin country identities, even among the second and third generation, is often considered a problem for economic andsocial integration(e.g.,Economist, 2017). On the other hand, it is argued that a lack of opportunities and acceptance in the destination countries may affect identity. Immigrants who do not feel welcome may orient back towards their country of origin and develop a strong origin country identity—with potential additional consequences for integration or return migration. Accordingly, identity has become a dimension of immigration policy in several countries, since different policies aim to improve integration by influencing the norms, values, and ultimately the identity of immigrants (e.g.,Casey and Dustmann, 2010).2The economics literature indeed proposes different theoretical arguments why the national identity of immigrants may affect integration. A pronounced origin country identity will make immigrants more likely to rely on ethnic networks, leading to lower incentives to invest in country-specific human capital, and access to less productive information on the labor market (e.g.,Battisti, Peri, Romiti, 2022,Battu, Mwale, Zenou, 2007,Dustmann, Glitz, Schönberg, Brücker, et al., 2016). Importantly, this may have negative consequences for the school and labor market performance of the children of immigrants, as their investments in (country-specific) human capital partly depend on the incentives and information provided by their social environment when growing up (Bisin and Verdier, 2011).3Despite the increasing public attention and the apparent policy relevance, little is known about the effects of immigrants’ national identities on integration trajectories. The few existing studies that analyze the link between national or ethnic identity and the integration of first and second-generation immigrants, are mostly limited in their causal interpretation and show a wide range of results (e.g.,Bisin, Patacchini, Verdier, Zenou, et al., 2011,Casey, Dustmann, 2010,Constant, Zimmermann, 2008,Schüller, 2015).4This paper contributes to the debate on integration by providing causal evidence on the link between national identity and long-term integration. Specifically, I focus on the origin country identity of immigrants and study its effects on integration outcomes of the second generation. The analysis relies on data from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey (CILS) in the U.S., one of the few data sets that provide a large sample of immigrants and their children (Portes, Rumbaut, 2001,Portes, Rumbaut, 2008). The data comprise rich information on immigrants’ emotional attachment to their country of origin, which I exploit to construct a composite measure of origin country identity. This measure is then used to analyze the effect of parents’ origin attachment on children’s integration in the dimensions ofsocial networks, national identity, language use and skills, andschool performance.5The major challenge for identifying causal effects of immigrants’ origin attachment on integration outcomes lies in its potential endogeneity. First, reverse causality may bias this relationship, since experiences in the destination country are likely to affect the attachment of immigrants to their origin country. Second, immigrants with a strong origin attachment may differ systematically in other characteristics that favor or impede integration.This paper’s empirical approach relies on a novel IV strategy inspired by the epidemiological approach.6The instrument for immigrants’ origin attachment is based on the observation that the importance of national identity differs persistently across countries due to, for example, historical and cultural reasons (e.g.,Smith and Kim, 2006). Using data from the Integrated Values Survey (IVS), I construct an aggregate measure of average national pride in the origin countries of immigrants, which serves as an instrument for their origin attachment. As first-generation immigrants were socialized according to the norms in their origin countries, those originating from countries with a strong average national pride may be more likely to have a pronounced origin identity as well. The key advantage of the instrument is that it is unrelated to individual-level experiences in the destination country that might make immigrants more or less origin-oriented. The IV strategy would fail if the average level of national pride in immigrants’ origin countries affects the integration outcomes of their children through omitted variables. This concern is addressed in several ways. Importantly, the main specification controls forfixed effectsfor broader regions of origin such that the instrument only exploits variation in national pride across relatively homogeneous origin countries. Moreover, the rich data allow to control for many characteristics on the level of the parents, children, and origin countries. Finally, several specific threats to the exclusion restriction are examined in detail in the robustness section.The results of the first stage confirm that immigrants from countries with high national pride are substantially more attached to their origin countries. Astandard deviationincrease in the origin country’s average national pride increases the measure of immigrant parents’ origin attachment by 27% of a standard deviation.When turning to the second stage, results are consistent with theoretical expectations. First, I find that immigrants’ origin identity affects their network choices and thus determines their children’s social environment at adolescence. Children whose parents are strongly attached to their origin country are more likely grow up surrounded by compatriots and have less contact to natives. One standard deviation increase in parents’ origin attachment raises their children’s probability of having only foreign friends at age 17 by 33.4 percentage points. Second, immigrant parents further transmit their origin identity to the second generation, as children are significantly more likely to identify by their origin nationality if their parents are strongly attached to their origin country. On the contrary, parents’ origin attachment is not found to affect their children’s host country identity.Third, children of parents with strong origin attachment invest less in country-specific human capital. I find that children whose parents are strongly attached to their origin country speak English less frequently with their friends and family; furthermore, their English language skills are significantly lower. Finally, results indicate that the national identity of immigrant parents impedes their children’s school performance. Both test scores and grade point averages of second-generation immigrants decrease with increasing origin attachment of their parents.I conduct a wide range of robustness checks. Most importantly, I discuss and investigate different threats to the exclusion restriction. First, I do not find evidence for the concern that the results could be driven by aggregate differences between countries that might be taken up by the instrument. Controlling for different aggregate measures ofeducation,economic conditions, and culture does not affect the results.7Similarly, results are robust when including control variables for the size, education, and labor market situation of the potential network of compatriots in the destination city. Next, I investigate whether my instrument is related to selective migration. Using country-pair data on emigrant stocks and rates by education from 195 origin countries to the U.S. (Docquier et al., 2009), I do not find evidence for negative skill-selection of immigrants from countries with high national pride. Moreover, selection with respect to the migration motive appears not to affect my results. Finally, I analyze the sensitivity of my results to deviations from the exclusion restriction via the local-to-zero approach ofConley et al. (2012). It shows that more than 50-70% of the total effect of the instrument would have to come through other channels than parents’ origin attachment to render the IV results insignificant. In additional specification checks, I show that all results are highly robust to alternative samples, alternative channels, and alternative measures of national pride.Finally, I find consistent results with respect to education outcomes when estimating the reduced form in a representative sample of second-generation immigrants in the Current Population Survey (CPS). Additional results from the CPS suggest that a stronger origin identity leads to disadvantages in the labor market for male second-generation immigrants as they have a higher risk of being unemployed and earnlower wages.The analysis in this paper contributes to three strands of literature. First, it is closely related to the growing literature on identity in economics (Akerlof and Kranton, 2000). In particular, this paper contributes to the literature on ethnic identity, its intergenerational transmission, and its effects on school or labor market performance. A couple of theoretical studies analyze the link between ethnic identity and education or labor market outcomes. Their main focus lies on the formation of oppositional identities among ethnic minorities, and on potential trade-offs between a pronounced ethnic identity and school or labor market opportunities (Austen-Smith, Fryer, 2005,Battu, Mwale, Zenou, 2007,Patacchini, Zenou, 2016, e.g.,). Empirically, a few papers study the relationship between ethnic identity and labor market outcomes of immigrants, using variables such as ethnic self-identification, language use, number of same-origin friends, or attachment to religion as proxies for ethnic identity, and producing ambiguous results on its link with labor market outcomes (Battu, Zenou, 2010,Bisin, Patacchini, Verdier, Zenou, et al., 2011,Casey, Dustmann, 2010,Nekby, Rödin, 2010, e.g.,). While some find penalties for having a strong ethnic identity (Bisin et al., 2011, e.g.,), others do not find negative effects (Casey and Dustmann, 2010, e.g.,). Again other papers focus on the formation of the destination country identity rather than the origin country identity (Manning and Roy, 2010, e.g.,).8Most of this literature is limited in its causal interpretation as it acknowledges the difficulty to address the potential endogeneity of ethnic identity (Casey, Dustmann, 2010,Schüller, 2015). Two more recent papers in this literature are particularly related to the present study as they analyze similar questions and attempt to address the endogeneity of ethnic identity. First,Schüller (2015)studies a similar research question as she analyzes the effect of immigrants’ ethnic identity on their children’s school track choice in Germany. Using data from the GSOEP, she finds a systematic positive relationship between origin country identity of immigrant fathers and their children’s probability to be placed in a higher secondary schooling track. To address the endogeneity of ethnic identity, an extension of her specification includes family fixed effects and exploits variation within parents over time for different siblings. While this identification strategy controls for unobserved factors, it is less effective in addressing time-dependent sources of endogeneity, such as assimilation, discrimination, or other experiences in the destination country. Second,Islam and Raschky (2015)use data from the Canadian ESC survey to study the effect of ethnic identity on the labor market outcomes of immigrants. Their empirical strategy relies on aninstrumental variablesapproach, where they use a measure of genetic distance between origin countries and Canada to instrument immigrants’ origin and destination ethnic identity. Their 2SLS estimates indicate that a strong origin country identity can have negative effects on immigrants’ employment probability. However, these effects are not very robust.The main contribution of this paper to this literature is that it employs a novel IV strategy. It exploits variation in the importance of national feelings across origin countries to estimate the causal effects of immigrants’ national identity on integration outcomes, and transparently and extensively discusses potential threats to identification. The fact that the results are very robust to a large battery of robustness checks strengthens their causal interpretation—extending the literature on ethnic identity in this respect. Second, the paper contributes to the understanding of inter-generational effects of immigrants’ identity. It adds to the analysis ofSchüller (2015), who focuses on one outcome—the school track choice at about age 10—, by analyzing the question more broadly for several integration outcomes that are theoretically motivated. Third, it uses a novel concept of ethnic identity, namely the attachment of immigrants to their origin country. By focusing on the attachment of immigrants to their origin country, the concept employed here is somewhat narrow, since it covers a particular part of the ethnic identity—the orientation towards the origin country. However, this measure of ethnic identity has the advantage that it represents effectively the idea of identity that is present in public debates on immigrants’ identity. Especially in many European destination countries, debates on long term integration have highlighted that immigrants may develop a strong orientation towards their origin countries in response to a lack of perspective and acceptance in the destination countries. While there has been the fear that this backward orientation may come at costs with regard to their further integration success, its effect is obviously hard to disentangle due to reverse causality. Analyzing this measure of ethnic identity and employing the IV strategy therefore informs this debate, since it allows to identify how a strong attachment to the origin country may causally affect integration. A fourth contribution of this paper to this literature is that it investigates the effects of national identity on the integration of immigrants in the U.S., whereas previous research on ethnic identity in the U.S. has focused on explaining racial achievement gaps.9However, studying the role of national identity in the process of long-term integration is also an important question in the United States, as the changing composition of immigrants since the 1960s is also reflected in a larger heterogeneity in assimilation patterns among more recent immigrant cohorts.10Second, this paper contributes more broadly to the literature on the assimilation of second-generation immigrants by focusing on outcomes of this population (Borjas, 1992,Borjas, 1993,Card, 2005,Dustmann, Glitz, 2011,Sweetman, Van Ours, 2014). Furthermore, it is related to the literature on ethnic capital and ethnic networks, since the social networks of parents are found to depend on their national attachment (Battisti, Peri, Romiti, 2022,Bisin, Patacchini, Verdier, Zenou, et al., 2011,Borjas, 1992,Cutler, Glaeser, 1997,Dustmann, Glitz, Schönberg, Brücker, et al., 2016).Finally, this paper is related to a fast growing literature that assesses the economic effects of culture (Alesina, Giuliano, 2015,Blau, Kahn, Papps, 2011,Fernández, 2011,Fernández, Fogli, 2009,Figlio, Giuliano, Özek, Sapienza, 2019,Giuliano, 2007, e.g.,). A mostly empirical strand in this literature relies on the epidemiological approach and investigates how the culture of the country of origin influences outcomes like female labor supply (Blau, 1992,Blau, Kahn, Papps, 2011,Fernández, Fogli, 2009), fertility (Fernández and Fogli, 2009) or living arrangements (Giuliano, 2007) in the host country among second- or third-generation immigrants (seeFernández, 2011, for a survey). In a recent application,Figlio et al. (2019)analyze the effect of long-term orientation on the school performance of immigrant children in the U.S., and show that children from countries with long-term oriented attitudes perform better in school than those from cultures that do not emphasize the importance of delayed gratification. Similar to their study, the present paper focuses on children’s outcomes, and investigates the role of parents in explaining how origin-country characteristics affect children’s school success.A main contribution to this strand of literature is that the IV-strategy in this paper allows to narrow down the channel through which culture works. Specifically, I exploit a similar type of variation as papers that employ the epidemiological approach, namely variation in an aggregate measure across origin countries of second-generation immigrants, but use it to instrument parents’ origin attachment. At the same time, the survey data provide rich information on the parents such that I can control for important characteristics that are omitted in many applications of the epidemiological approach (e.g., parents’ education and years since migration).11The paper proceeds as follows. The next section introduces a theoretical model on acculturation and the intergenerational transmission of identity to discuss theoretical mechanisms through which parents’ national identity could affect the integration of their children.Section 3describes the data sources as well as the empirical strategy.Section 4discusses the empirical results.

"1. IntroductionThe opioid epidemic is one of the most pressing public health issues for local, state and federal policymakers and its consequences have been widely documented. The epidemic is often characterized by the rise of prescription opioid use. Between 1992 and 2011, the number of opioid prescriptions in the U.S. increased nearly three-fold from approximately 75 million annually to 220 million annually (Manchikanti et al., 2017). At its peak in 2010–2012, the Opioid prescription rate was 80 per 100 persons in the U.S., although only about 20% of the population had one or more prescriptions (CDC 2018b). Since 2010, the opioid prescription rate has continued to decline, and in 2020, the dispensing rate had fallen to the lowest in the 15 years, to 43.3 per 100 persons in 2020 (CDC 2021). The second prominent fact used to characterize the opioid epidemic is the rise in prescription opioid-related mortality. Between 1999 and 2019, the rate of prescription opioid overdose deaths increased from just over 1 per 100,000 to just over 15 per 100,000 in 2019 (NCDAS, 2020). Finally, the rise in non-prescription opioid (e.g., heroin and fentanyl) deaths are also often included to document the epidemic. The rate of non-prescription opioid (heroin and fentanyl combined) deaths increased from approximately 1 per 100,000 in 1999 to 2 per 100,000 in 2010. After this date, non-prescription opioid deaths began to increase markedly rising to 15.8 per 100,000 by 2019 (NCDAS 2022).While the sheer magnitude of opioid prescriptions and the mortality consequences of the opioid epidemic have garnered most of the research and public policy attention, the rise in prescription opioid use may have had other serious consequences. For example, outcomes that may be plausibly affected by opioid use, both medical and non-medical use, include marriage, earnings, and receipt of social welfare benefits (Duenas et al., 2016;Gustavsson et al., 2012;Turk et al., 2016). There have been relatively few studies of the effects of prescription opioids on these outcomes. There are several studies of opioids and employment, but several were observational and did not use a credible research design (Aliprantis et al., 2019;Currie et al., 2019;Krueger, 2017;Harris et al. 2019). Results from these observational studies are mixed. In terms of quasi-experimental studies,Beheshti (2022)examined the effect of Hydrocodone's reclassification into a schedule II drug (a higher risk category) on employment. Beheshti 2022 has a setup that is unique in that Hydrocodone received a higher schedule and in the same year Tramadol another popular opioid is demoted into a lower schedule drug. The author finds that these changes increased employment. However, recently (Gupta, 2020showed that Tramadol increases almost entirely substituted for the decreases in Hydrocodone “leading to no statistically detectable short-run reduction in total opioid prescriptions”. There are also studies that examined the effects of Oxycontin reformulation on earnings (Powell, 2020) and on disability claims (Park and Powell, 2021). In these studies, the emphasis is on substitution to illicit markets once Oxycontin was reformulated in 2010.In this study, we examine the effect of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) and pill mill statutes on employment and earnings, and explore heterogeneity by age that is correlated with misuse vs medical use of opioids. We also examine two other outcomes: marriage, and receipt of social welfare benefits (Duenas et al., 2016;Gustavsson et al., 2012;Turk et al., 2016). There have been no studies of the effect of prescription opioid use on these outcomes other outcomes.1We exploit plausibly exogenous variation in PDMPs and “pill mill” statutes.While there are a variety of types of PDMPs that vary with respect to features, we focus on PDMPs that have been characterized as “modern”. Unlike earlier electronic PDMPs that require data to be sent infrequently, such as monthly, and use magnetic tapes or computer disks to transfer records, modern PDMPs can be readily accessed by any authorized user (e.g.: physician or pharmacist). Our classification differs from some prior research focused on mandated PDMP – those where physician or pharmacist is required to consult the PDMP before prescribing or dispensing an opioid. We show (seeAppendix Table 2) that all mandated PDMPs are modern, but that its mainly the modern aspect of the PDMP that accounts for reductions in opioid quantities The other policy we study, Pill Mill laws, which target prescribers who account for a disproportionate share of opioid prescribing. Pill Mill laws include legal provisions establishing state inspection authority or specific training requirements for Pill Mill owners or associated physician.Results of our analysis of the effect of modern PDMPs and pill mill laws on opioid prescriptions indicate that the adoption of a “modern” PDMPs decreased all opioid prescription sales by between 5% to 10% and decreased sales of hydrocodone and oxycodone (the top two prescriptions) by between 7% and 20%. Pill mill statutes had even larger effects; decreasing all opioid prescription sales by between 14% and 28% and decreased hydrocodone and oxycodone prescriptions by 20% to 48%. This evidence is consistent with several prior studies.2The variation in prescription opioid sales, and presumably opioid use, caused by the state policies provides exogenous variation in prescription opioid use that we use to assess the effects of prescription opioid use on socioeconomic outcomes. We also estimate the effect of these states policies on mortality.An important conceptual and empirical contribution of our analysis is the stratification of the sample by age and gender. This stratification is motivated by evidence suggesting that most prescription opioid use is medical and that rates of non-medical use, and the ratio of non-medical to medical use of prescription opioids differs significantly by age, gender and to a lesser extent education (seeTable 1). For example, approximately 15% of females ages 35 to 64 reported that they had a prescription opioid in 2002–2006, but only 3% reported non-medical use.3These figures suggest that this group of females has a relatively high rate of prescription opioid use that is mostly medically prescribed. There is relatively little purposeful misuse of prescription opioids, or use of illegal opioids, among thisdemographicgroup, and women in this age group have relatively little use of other illegal drugs (5%) excluding marijuana. In contrast, among men ages 18 to 34, only 7% reported having a medical prescription for opioids in 2002–2006, but 10% also reported non-medical use. For this group, much of prescription opioid use is misuse and this group has a relatively high rate of illegal drug use (17%) excluding marijuana. Given these differences in opioid use, it is plausible that changes in prescription opioid use due to state policies had different effects on mortality and socioeconomic outcomes of these demographic groups. For groups with high rates of misuse, curtailing prescription opioid use may be health improving whereas for groups with mainly appropriate medical use of prescription opioids, limiting such use may have adverse health effects. We develop this point in more detail below.Table 1.

The reductions in prescription opioid sales associated with these state policies were, in general, not associated with statistically significant effects on mortality, although the adoption of a “modern” PDMP had a consistently negative association with drug- and opioid-related mortality and the effect sizes for opioid-related mortality were approximately 8%. These figures suggest a relatively large elasticity of opioid-related mortality with respect to prescription opioid use. Pill mill statutes were also associated with a consistent, negative decrease in opioid-related mortality, but magnitudes of estimates varied across demographic groups and were relatively imprecise. We found consistent evidence that, across all demographic groups, the adoption of a “modern” PDMP was associated with small, but statistically significant reductions in employment of 1% to 2%; reductions in earnings that were not statistically significant and similarly small; marginally significant increases in receipt of public assistance, particularly for women; and a significant, but small (1%) decline in the probability of being married among females. In contrast, pill mill laws were, in most cases, positively associated with employment and earnings, but effect sizes were small and, in most cases, not statistically significant. Pill mill laws were associated with a significant, but small (1%) decline in the probability of being married among all demographic groups.Overall, while state policies were associated with a substantial reduction in prescription opioid sales (and presumably use), the impact of this decline and these policies on mortality and socioeconomic outcomes has been quite modest at the population level. This is an important finding and policy relevant. However, population level estimates suggest that effects at the individual level may have been substantial because only a portion of the population was likely affected by the policy. For example, estimates indicate that adoption of a “modern” PDMP was associated with a 1% to 2% reduction in employment. If we assume that 20% of sample used opioids and that adoption of a “modern” PDMP decreased that use by 10%, then it suggests that for every person who was deterred from using prescription opioids—2% of population–there was a large decrease in employment of 1% to 2%. These are crude calculations of the effect of treatment (“modern” PDMP) on treated (opioid users) and should be viewed cautiously, but they illustrate that small reduced form effects may mask large treatment-on-treated effects. We discuss these issues again in our conclusion.",Robert,Engy,None
"1. IntroductionEntrepreneurs, in particularsmall business owners, are commonly viewed as the engine of economic growth and prosperity. They play a disproportionately large role injob creationand destruction, and hold a substantial portion of the U.S.wealth. For instance,Fairlie et al. (2019)find that startups create approximately 3 million jobs per year with 2.9 million of these jobs persisting five years later. Further,De Nardi et al. (2007)report that more than half of self-employed business owners fall in the top wealth quantile. Therefore, understanding the nature of entrepreneurship and identifying factors that affect it has always been of interest to governments, policymakers, and researchers.Self-employment has been considered as the “simplest kind of entrepreneurship” (Blanchflower and Oswald, 1998), and a large body of research documents that individuals’ decision to engage in entrepreneurship changes witheconomic conditions.1In this paper, we contribute to this literature by investigating how localized boom and bust cycles, induced by oil and gas activity, impacted self-employment in the U.S. over the past two decades. This time period provides a unique opportunity to study self-employment dynamics, as it was dominated by plausibly exogenous fluctuations in oil and gas production from shale geological formations. These “boom towns” experienced boom and bust cycles induced by a combination of external factors including oil and natural gas prices, resource availability, and differences in the oil to gas ratio of hydrocarbons produced that naturally varies spatially within individual basins and across basins. As a growing recent literature documents, these areas experienced employment growth throughout a broad group of sectors of the economy. Although our analysis will focus on the entire U.S. (not just these shale areas), we will show that much of the fluctuation during the time frame of our analysis (2005–2019) was driven by activity in “shale boom” areas.We utilize data on self-employment from the U.S. Census AmericanCommunitySurveys (ACS), and further distinguish between incorporated and unincorporated self-employed workers, as these have been shown to have starkly different traits and income profiles (Levine and Rubinstein, 2017). We aggregate self-employment to commuting zones (CZs), which represent clusters of counties that have strong commuting ties between workers and businesses (Tolbert and Sizer, 1996). To identify the causal effect of oil and gas activity on self-employment, we use detail well-level oil andnatural gas productiondata for more than one million wells in the United States. For each county and month, we calculate the value of production from new wells (i.e., wells began production within the preceding 12 months). These monthly county values are then aggregated into yearly CZs.Our main findings can be summarized as follows. First, we find that oil and gas activity has a positive contemporaneous impact on self-employment. Lagged effects of oil and gas activity on self-employment are negative and imply that once the boom subsides, self-employment adjusts closer to the pre-boom level. Together, this suggests that self-employment is pro-cyclical, i.e. it increases during a business cycle expansion and reduces during a business cycle contraction. Second, we estimate the sensitivity of total employment to new oil and gas production and then decompose the share of the employment adjustment that stems from self-employment. Point estimates suggest that about 11% of the employment adjustment can be explained by self-employed workers, a group which makes up about 9% of total employment. Finally, our industry-level analysis indicate that the effects on self-employment are driven primarily by individuals in non-mining industries. About two thirds of the adjustment in self-employment comes fromservice sectors. Notably, prior studies have found that overall employment effects from the shale boom have been concentrated in mining, construction and transportation (Feyrer, Mansur, Sacerdote, 2017,Marchand, 2012), thus this research reveals that theindustryof adjustment for self-employed workers might be very different than the economy as a whole.This paper first contributes to a large literature that examines the role of external factors affecting the choice to become entrepreneur. The literature has considered factors including access to credit (Asiedu, Freeman, Nti-Addae, 2012,Cagetti, De Nardi, 2006,Hurst, Lusardi, 2004), inheritance and gifts (Blanchflower and Oswald, 1998), globalization (Dinopoulos, Unel, 2015,Eren, Onda, Unel, 2019), immigration (Fairlie, Meyer, 2003,Pekkala Kerr, Kerr, 2020), and government policies (Beland, Unel, 2019,Cullen, Gordon, 2007), among others. A few papers empirically investigated the nexus between self-employment and the economy wide business cycle (Fossen, 2020,Levine, Rubinstein, 2018).This paper also contributes to a growing body of work that quantifies the economic effects of localizednatural resourcebased booms.2While this literature began before the specific shale oil and gas booms of this past decade (Allcott, Keniston, 2018,Black, McKinnish, Sanders, 2005), this new era of shale has created a significant resurgence in part because of the clean empirical identification afforded by the nature of the shock. Previous studies have investigated the impact of shale boom on various outcomes, and paper is more closely related to studies that have investigated the effects of resource booms on labor-market outcomes.Agerton et al. (2017);Feyrer et al. (2017);Green et al. (2019);Marchand (2012)find a positive effect of oil and gas activity on employment and wages.3Our analysis complements and extends these studies by considering self-employed workers who are not included in establishment based labor-market data.Our paper relates most closely to two recent studies at the intersection of oil & gas booms and entrepreneurship activity:Tsvetkova and Partridge (2017)andBellon et al. (2021). The former examines the impact of employment growth in oil and gas industry on self-employment growth in the U.S. over the 2001–2013 period. They find that oil and gas sector expansion crowds out self-employment, which stems from a large reduction in self-employment in non-mining sectors. Our analysis differs from theirs in several aspects. Most notably, we use oil and gas production fromnewwells, which depends on preexisting geology and the recent drilling technology. We refer to “new wells” as those that began production within the preceding 12 months.4These monthly county values are then aggregated into yearly CZs. Unlike employment growth, new production is plausibly exogenous to other shocks occurring in the region, and more appropriate for identification. Results of our analysis do not corroborate conclusions from theirs.Using data on unexpected payments to individuals from the shale boom in Texas,Bellon et al. (2021)investigate the effect of wealthwindfallson self-employment decisions. They find that individuals who received large wealth shocks have higher self-employment rates relative to others who received smaller or no wealth shocks. Our study documents the net effect of the shale boom on entrepreneurship, and does not focus on individual decisions based on specific royalty payments. We therefore viewBellon et al. (2021)as complementary to our work.The rest of this paper is organized as follows.Section 2introduces the data on labor markets and oil and gas production along with measurement and construction of key variables.Section 3describes our estimation strategies.Section 4presents our results and discuss their implications.Section 5investigates the robustness of our findings, andSection 6concludes the paper.",Bulent,Gregory,None

"1. IntroductionThe relationship between labor markets and educational attainment is widely studied, in part due to the difficulties in disentangling causal estimates from selection bias. In his seminal model of human capital,Becker (1962)notes that individuals invest in schooling to increase their marginal product of labor, which in turn increases their expected future wages. The effects of schooling on future wages are well-documented, though not yet entirely settled.1Far less studied is the effect of local labor market conditions on educational attainment – how a student’s opportunity cost of continuing her education affects her decision to drop out or stay in school. In this paper, we study a massive, largely exogenous shock to local labor market conditions in China – the implementation of the Open Door Policy in late 1978 – as an extreme example of how rapidly changing local labor markets affect the opportunity costs of remaining in school.From 1975 to 1982, the total value of Chinese exports increased from 6.2 billion to 20.4 billion US dollars, and the export share of total Chinese GDP grew from 3.79% to 9.95% over the same time period.2This tripling of export value was one of the major driving factors behind the rapid growth in manufacturing employment, a 39 percent increase from 53 million manufacturing workers in 1978 to 74 million in 1985 (Banister, 2005). The large increase inlabor demandbrought relatively high-paying jobs to Chinese workers, but it also increased the opportunity cost of remaining in school.Fig. 1suggests that students in China may have responded to these new jobs by dropping out of school; students born between 1961 and 1964 would be in high school when the Open Door Policy was implemented in 1978, and the national high school completion rate decreased by 16.7 percentage points between cohorts born in the early 1960s and the late 1960s. Similarly, students born between 1965 and 1968 would be in middle school when the Open Door Policy was enacted, and the national middle school completion rate decreased by 10.2 percentage points between cohorts born in the early 1960s and the late 1960s. And strikingly, the declines in middle school and high school completion happened to different birth cohorts; high school completion rates fell beginning with the 1962 birth cohort, and middle school completion rates fell beginning with the 1964 birth cohort. The late 1960s birth cohorts completed their education after the end of China’sCultural Revolution(1966–1976) during a time when education quality and access was improving (Giles et al., 2019); that educational attainment declined so substantially during this period suggests trade and manufacturing growth were the major driving forces.Download :Download high-res image (147KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. School Completion Rates across Cohorts, Census. This is a connected scatter plot of average completion rate at the four types of school by birth year. Data are from China’s 2000 Census. The sample includes birth cohorts 1940–1980.Our primary interest in this study is to investigate this enormous, unusual decline in Chinese educational attainment across the 1960s birth cohorts, estimating whether and how much of the aggregate decline in educational attainment in China was caused by export growth after the Open Door Policy’s implementation. To accomplish this, we aim to causally identify the relationship between local labor market export exposure and the educational attainment of teens living in those labor markets. We construct Bartik-style measures of local labor market export exposure at the prefecture level, analogous to the import penetration measures used inAutor et al. (2013)and many following works. Using within-prefecture, between-birth cohort variation in export exposure measured over each cohort’s potential schooling years (ages 6 to 18 for each cohort), we find that the mean level of export exposure caused people born in 1965–70 to be 5.6–13.3 percentage points less likely to complete high school than people born in 1960. These results suggest that about 79.6 percent of the decline in high school completion over the 1960s birth cohorts can be attributed to the rise in local labor market export exposure.3Middle school completion, however, appears to be unaffected by export exposure; using the same within-prefecture, between-birth cohort variation in export exposure, we find precisely estimated null effects on middle school completion rates.4,5We also can rule out internal migration as the cause of these changes in educational attainment; migration between prefectures and especially provinces was heavily restricted by thehukousystem before the 1990s in China. An empirical test we perform of the association between local export exposure and changes in the youth population from 1982 to 1990 shows no relationship between export growth and internal migration during the 1980s. In this time period, high school graduates were the primary source of high-skilled labor in China, so our results demonstrate a decline in high-skilled labor and a corresponding increase in low-skilled labor occurred in the most highly export-exposed prefectures in China in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This is especially important from a national growth and development perspective, as China’s rapid initial growth created incentives for its population to reduce their educational attainment, creating ambiguous effects on the future growth and development of the Chinese economy.6The paper proceeds as follows.Section 2discusses the relevant literature to this paper and clarifies our contribution.Section 3provides a historical background of China’s Open DoorPolicy reformsin 1978, as well as an overview of majoreducational policychanges in the 1970s.Section 4describes the data andSection 5explains the estimation strategies used.Section 6presents the empirical results of the Open Door Policy’s effects on educational attainment andSection 7concludes.",Xuan,Kendall,Jiatong
"1. IntroductionWage bargaining between workers and firms and job-to-job transitions of workers are inherent features of the labour market. Both received substantial empirical support1and are intensively studied in search andmatching theorydating back to the seminal contributions byMortensen and Pissarides (1994)andBurdett and Mortensen (1998). However, if a worker is paid below the marginal productivity and moves from one job to another a natural question to ask is whether this job transition is efficient and leads to a job with a more productive employer or not. In order to address this question and study the extent of output losses from inefficient transitions we develop a model with wage bargaining and on-the-job search where workers use their current employment as an outside option when negotiating with a new employer. One difficulty associated with this approach originates from the path-dependence of wages. This means that bargaining a higher wage with the current employer puts a worker on a higher earnings trajectory in the future which a worker with rational expectations should perfectly foresee and take into account in the bargaining process. In this study we explicitly acknowledge that workers’ rationality and foresight may reach a limit in a complex environment with path-dependent wages and consider a setup with boundedly rational workers. More precisely, workers in the model use adaptive learning based on past statistical information to form expectations about future wages.When modeling adaptive learning we follow the approach summarized inEvans and Honkapohja (2001);Hommes and Sorger (1998)andHommes (2013)and characterize a Restricted Perceptions Equilibrium where workers use adaptive learning mechanisms and base their forecasts ontime seriesdata. More specifically, the data on wages and productivities is collected and processed by the central statistical agency and the summary of this analysis is released to workers in the form of a recursive OLS regression. Workers use this regression to update their beliefs over time as new data becomes available. In the steady state some workers are overoptimistic about their situation and disappointed by thelow wage. Other workers are pessimistic in the beginning and positively surprised by the successful outcome of bargaining. Nevertheless, the expectations of workers are “self-confirming” in the equilibrium in the sense that the data guiding workers’ expectations leads them to take actions that reproduce this data (Rotemberg, 2017).As a starting point, we consider a benchmark model where workers obtain a fixed proportion of the job surplus. The advantage of this setup is that the model with rational expectations yields an explicit analytical solution for the wage equation, so the equilibrium outcomes can be directly compared to the outcomes of a model with boundedly rational agents and adaptive learning. In order to follow workers’ transitions over time with the corresponding changes in wages and productivities we rely on a simulation approach which is widely used for the analysis of learning mechanisms in dynamic models, for a summary seeDawid and Gatti (2018);Neugart and Richiardi (2018)andDelli Gatti et al. (2018). We find that our solution concept based on adaptive learning provides a very close approximation of the equilibrium with rational expectations, such that the differences in output and in the intensity of job-to-job transitions are negligibly small even though there is a minor wage penalty on the side of workers equal to0.5%associated with imperfect foresight. To the best of our knowledge adaptive learning was not applied before in a search and matching setup with job-to-job mobility, so it is a novel methodological contribution of our study2.22Further, we extended the model with adaptive learning by endogenizing wages following a generalized Nash bargaining approach. In this setup the share of surplus accruing to workers is not constant since the marginal gains from a higher wage are not identical for workers and firms making the equilibrium with rational expectations analytically intractable. Assuming a decreasing productivity density function (Gaffeo et al., 2003), we are able to derive the analytical expressions for the value functions of workers and firms, which yields an implicit analytical solution to the Nash bargaining problem. For a restricted set of parameters, we can show that the bargaining solution is unique and the actual wage is increasing in the employer’s productivity and the current wage of the worker. We show numerically that these properties hold for a wider range of parameters.Our model with adaptive learning and endogenous wages captures the empirical evidence that the earnings distribution is unimodal and positively skewed33and that unemployment is followed by a lower trajectory for future wages after re-employment.44The former property is due to the interaction between decreasing firms’ productivity density and on-the-job search by workers making jobs with higher productivity more stable. The latter property is because workers use their current employment contract as an outside option when bargaining with new employers, thus, wages depend on the past transition history of the worker. One new finding which can guide future empirical research is that wages become more dispersed and the positive skewness of the wage distribution becomes stronger with a higherbargaining powerof workers.In addition, our model delivers two new insights concerning output and wageinequalityin a setting with job-to-job mobility. First, we study output losses and wage gains associated with inefficient transitions of workers. Even though workers’ job changes are always efficient from the individual perspective as workers only change the job if they get a higher wage, some transitions are socially inefficient since workers are moving from more productive employers to less productive ones. Intuitively, inefficient transitions arise from the fact that workers are paid below their (marginal) productivity, so there is a gap between the output produced by the worker and his/her wage. In this study we direct our attention to labour markets without counteroffers. Hence, if the new employer’s productivity falls within the gap a socially inefficient transition takes place. We find that a higher bargaining power of workers is associated with a lower overall frequency of job-to-job transitions and a lower fraction of inefficient transitions among them. Hence, output losses from inefficient transitions fall with a higher bargaining power due to the more efficient allocation of workers to more productive employers. For a stylized parameter setting we find that the losses amount to[1.5…3.9%]of output, while the associated wage gains of workers vary in the range[1.2…2.8%]. This shows that inefficient transitions allow workers to exploit their status quo employment to a larger extent and reduce the average profits of firms by raising wages and reducing output.This finding has implications for policy analysis. It suggests that promoting wage counteroffers to a wider range of (occupational) labour markets characterized by wage bargaining may lead to certain output gains and efficiency improvements provided that the costs of making counteroffers are small. Several studies with job-to-job transitions and Nash bargaining allowing for wage counteroffers are developed inPostel-Vinay, Robin, 2002a,Postel-Vinay, Robin, 2002bandCahuc et al. (2006). These studies describe labour markets where employers match the outside offers of their employees (typical, for example, in academic job markets) preventing the inefficient transitions of workers to less productive employers and eliminating the corresponding output losses. Realistically, one can expect that some firms respond to the outside offers of their employees, whereas others do not. In this intermediate case some job-to-job transitions are inefficient. Thus, our estimates can be seen as an upper bound on output losses from inefficient transitions.Second insight follows from the implications of bounded rationality in our model. In particular, we consider a market where workers are heterogeneous with respect to their bargaining power. However, this heterogeneity is unobservable by the statistical agency, so the data from different worker groups is pooled together and revealed to workers in the aggregate form. Such differences in the bargaining power could be explained by lower self-confidence or self-esteem and/or worse negotiation, presentation andargumentation skillsof some worker groups. Also differences in time preferences/patience can lead to different bargaining powers, see recent evidence inFalk et al. (2018). Another example could be fine-grained ethnic or racial groups with weak bargaining power, whose types are not contained in the official statistics. We show that in this setting adaptive learning is likely to reduce the gap in wages between heterogeneous worker groups. The reason is that aggregate statistical information raises (reduces) wage expectations of workers with low (high) bargaining power, which leads to a lower gap in bargained wages. So our results suggest that information collected and revealed by central authorities may have a strong impact on labour market outcomes of boundedly-rational agents by influencing their expectations, which is not the case in a framework with rational expectations.1.1. Literature reviewEmpirical studies show that job-to-job transitions and wage bargaining are important features of labour markets.Nagypal (2008)documents that almost50%of all job separations in the US are explained by job-to-job transitions.Hall and Krueger (2008)find that both wage posting and bilateral wage bargaining are equally important in the American labour market. Their survey data shows that the wage is determined by posting for 25 to35%of workers, while it is determined by wage bargaining for around 34% of workers.Brenzel et al. (2014)show similar results for Germany with more than one third of hirings being characterized by bargaining. Another empirical study is conducted byJolivet et al. (2006). They use panel data for individuals covering 10 European countries and the USA. Both job-to-job and job-to-unemployment transition rates vary across countries. Whereas the fraction of job-to-job movers is relatively low in Italy, France and Belgium, it is high in Ireland, Denmark and the UK.In the past decades this empirical evidence was incorporated in the theoretical models of frictional labour markets. The seminal study providing a detailed characterization of wage ladders and job-to-job mobility is (Burdett and Mortensen, 1998), who developed a canonical on-the-job search model with homogenous workers and firms, where the wage is determined by a wage-posting game.Flinn (2010);Mortensen (2003);Pissarides (2000)andGautier et al. (2010)extended this model with Nash bargaining over wages and employer heterogeneity. In a recent study (Gottfries, 2018) incorporated the idea of infrequent wage renegotiations. If firms always renegotiate wages the model byPissarides (1994)is recovered as a special case. In contrast, if renegotiation is prohibited, the model byMortensen (2003)appears in the limit.One assumption underlying these models is that the outside opportunity of bargaining workers is always unemployment irrespective of the worker’s current employment situation and wage. This means that workers can not improve their current wage even if there is a positive surplus to be shared with a new less productive employer. Even though this simplification proved useful in multiple settings, an alternative approach with the current employment contract as an outside option in bargaining should not be neglected. One empirical implication of this alternative pursued in our study is that workers entering a new job after the spell of unemployment suffer from a lower wage compared to those entering the same position following a job-to-job transition. This implication is compatible with the empirical evidence that unemployment is followed by a lower trajectory for future earnings after re-engagement.55Even though there exist multiple explanations for this phenomenon ranging from the depreciation of human capital to the problem of adverse selection the true reason for the lower wage upon re-entry is not fully clarified. Our model delivers a complementary explanation stemming from the deterioration of the outside option associated with the state of unemployment. This property of the model is new in comparison to the studies assuming unemployment as a permanent outside option, where workers receive the same wage irrespective of their previous employment status.Another approach to modeling wages was proposed byPostel-Vinay, Robin, 2002a,Postel-Vinay, Robin, 2002bwho developed a new on-the-job search model in which heterogeneous employers are allowed to respond to workers’ outside offers. Hence there is aBertrand competitionamong firms in order to hire a worker. When a worker receives an outside offer his/her current employer can make a counter-offer, so the worker will either enjoy a wage increase and stay or move to the new employer. This idea is further extended byCahuc et al. (2006)and more recently byCai (2020)who derives an efficiency condition for a general class of models with on-the-job search and wage bargaining allowing for counteroffers of the current employer. Even though employer counteroffers is a realistic assumption for academic labour markets and top management positions it is rather rare in many other professions and occupations. For example,Fujita (2010)concludes that the evidence that firms make a counteroffer in response to a workers’ outside offer is scarce and that wage outcomes at the time of job-to-job transitions are closely linked to the worker’s outside option. Moreover, this approach is based on the assumption that less productive firms persist in making wage offers to workers employed in more productive firms even though there is no chance of poaching them. If making job offers was associated with some costs, no matter how small, this behavior would not be optimal. Another restriction of this approach is that firms have to commit to keeping the wage forever after the counteroffer has expired (Gottfries, 2018). In a broader sense our analysis suggests that the gains and costs of wage counteroffers should be weighted against each other in the design of optimal policy.Our approach based on relaxing the over-sophistication of workers allows us to study the relationship between the bargaining power, wage gains and output losses associated with inefficient transitions. This issue received little attention in the existing literature. The reason is that both types of models described above avoid the problem of inefficient transitions: either workers can not exploit their current employment status to gain a wage increase or this wage increase is granted by the current employer. To the best of our knowledge there is only one other study that investigated the extent of inefficient transitions, this is (Flinn et al., 2017). However, their model requires a simultaneous presence of firms with two different wage strategies – those who post and never negotiate over wages and those who always negotiate and match outside offers. In this respect our setting is less restrictive since inefficient transitions take place even if all firms follow the same strategy.More generally, the expectation formation plays an important role in economic models. The reason being that agents’ current expectations affect the actual outcomes, and the actual outcomes affect their expectations in the next period (Hommes, 2013). In the search and matching framework the focus of earlier studies was on expectation formation in the presence of asymmetric information and learning. For example,Jovanovic (1979)andMortensen (1986)consider a setting where workers searching for jobs are not fully informed about the distribution of productivities. In this situation “the worker acts as aBayesianforecaster by using observations to date to make predictions concerning the job’s true but unknown characteristics. As new information arrives, the forecast is revised... ” (Mortensen, 1986, p. 877).Among the more recent studies (Rotemberg, 2017) shows that systematic differences in beliefs between the two groups of workers can lead to persistent differences in wage outcomes even if workers are homogeneous, which makes beliefs “self-fulfilling” in the equilibrium. To the best of our knowledge, the most recent study analyzing the implications of workers’ expectations in a search and matching model is byPace et al. (2021). The authors developed a search and matching model where wages are negotiated period by period with the assumption of rational expectations being replaced by adaptive learning. This study finds that the model with statistical learning can solve the unemployment volatility puzzle discovered byShimer (2005)by capturing the systematic over/underprediction of wages over the business cycle. However, this model can not be directly compared to ours since it does not allow for on-the-job search.More distantly our study is related to the literature on learning mechanisms in various markets which can be divided into two strands. The first strand of literature shows that there are learning mechanisms such that model outcomes can asymptotically converge to the rational expectation outcomes. An earlier study byFourgeaud et al. (1986)provides the necessary and sufficient condition for convergence to the rational expectations equilibrium. Further studies include (Böhm, Wenzelburger, 1999,Bray, Savin, 1986,Evans, Honkapohja, 1994,Evans, Honkapohja, 1995,Evans, Honkapohja, 2001,Marcet, Nicolini, 2003,Marcet, Sargent, 1989,Tuinstra, Wagener, 2007) etc. In our model there is a similar convergence to the rational expectations equilibrium as long as workers are ex-ante homogeneous. Yet, we show that bounded rationality has implications for the equilibrium outcomes if workers are heterogeneous with respect to their bargaining power. In a broad sense this second finding is inline with the second group of studies emphasizing the point that convergence to the rational expectations equilibrium depends on the learning mechanism and is not always guaranteed. For example, there can be new chaotic equilibria as inBullard (1994)andSchönhofer (1999)such that the forecast errors of agents never vanish.The paper proceeds as follows. InSection 2we explain the economic environment and derive the value functions for workers in a setting with adaptive learning. InSection 3we introduce two wage-setting mechanisms: linear surplus sharing and the generalized Nash bargaining. InSection 4we explain the simulation strategy, compare the models with adaptive learning and rational expectations and summarize our results.Section 5includes an extension with two groups of workers heterogeneous in the bargaining power.Section 6concludes the paper.",Erdenebulgan,Anna,None
"1. IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic shock generated very unequal economic effects across individuals, with members of some worker groups suffering disproportionately (Chetty et al., 2020;IMF 2021). Several recent studies have attempted to investigate differences in the effects of the COVID-19 crisis between men and women, with many arguing that the crisis has caused a “she-cession,” where women's labor market outcomes and prospects have deteriorated more than men's (Albanesi and Kim 2021;Alon et al., 2020;Alon et al., 2021;Caselli et al., 2020;Fabrizio et al., 2021, andShibata 2021, among others). This pattern contrasts with the “he-cession” observed after the global financial crisis for the United States, in which men's employment was much more heavily impacted than women's (Wall 2009;Hoynes et al., 2012).1There has been vigorous debate on why the COVID-19 crisis could be hurting women's labor market outcomes more, with several factors cited. First,women's employmentshares are generally higher in more contact-intensive sectors which have been more severely affected by the pandemic (Mongey et al., 2020;Albanesi and Kim 2021). Second, women tend to carry a higher childcare burden when schools are closed, as many were due to COVID-19-related lockdowns (Adams-Prassl et al. 2020;Fuchs-Schündeln et al., 2020;Hupkau and Petrongolo 2020;Russell and Sun 2020;Zamarro and Prados 2021). Third, women are more often employed in temporary and part-time jobs that are typically more at risk of termination in an economic downturn (Petrongolo 2004;Bahn and Sanchez Cumming 2020).While most of these recent studies of the pandemic's consequences by gender focus on the United States or only a few, selected other advanced economies, we examine the labor market impacts of the COVID-19 crisis by gender for a large panel of 30 advanced economies (AEs) and 8 emerging market economies (EMs) with cross-country comparable data at quarterly frequency, making three key contributions. First, we document the extent and persistence of COVID-19 crisis-related she-cessions across countries during 2020. Specifically, a country is classified as being in a she-cession in a given quarter if the employment rate for women in that quarter has fallen more than that for men, relative to their respective 2019 levels. Second, we quantify the role of the composition of sectoral employment by gender in driving differences in labor market outcomes between men and women. Third, we further elaborate on recent labor market dynamics by gender, investigating the relative importance of unemployment versuslabor force participationmargins in drivingemployment changesby gender.We find that about two-thirds of the countries in the sample experienced she-cessions when the COVID-19 shock hit in the second quarter of 2020. By contrast, only about 8 percent of the countries in our sample experienced a she-cession during the depths of the global financial crisis (2009:Q2). Moreover, the COVID-19 crisis she-cessions were short-lived, with the share of countries in the sample experiencing she-cessions dropping below half already by the third quarter of 2020.When we examine the sectoral composition of the changes in the employment gender gap during COVID-19 crisis (for the sub-sample of countries for which we have sectoral employment by gender at quarterly frequency), we find that the incidence of she-cessions predominantly reflects greater declines in women's employment shares than men's within each sector, rather than the greater employment of women by sectors that were more adversely affected by the pandemic. In other words, she-cessions are explained more by an overall larger negative effect on women's employment than they are by women's being employed more in harder-hit sectors.Unpacking the employment she-cessions, they appear to be more attributable to women's larger declines in labor force participation rates compared to men than a greater rise in their relative unemployment rates. The average narrowing of the she-cession gender gap changes in employment seen in 2020:Q3 appears to arise from both greater relative improvements in labor force participation by women than men and a shrinking of differences in their unemployment rates. In other words, both the participation and unemployment margins are at play in she-cessions.Although the broad patterns point to the high incidence of short-lived she-cessions with the COVID-19 crisis, there is a wide degree of heterogeneity in the details, including policy responses, across countries. For example, Colombia had a severe she-cession, reflecting in part the preponderance of women working in the hard-hit informal sector (Alvarez and Pizzinelli 2021;García-Rojas et al., 2020). In the case of the United States’ she-cession, mothers with young children saw much larger employment drops with lockdowns, partly due to the lack of access to child-care alternatives (Fabrizio et al., 2021). On the other hand, the United Kingdom did not have a she-cession, likely as a result of its more favorable job retention and other support measures for women.Adams-Prassl et al. (2020)document that mothers were more likely than fathers to initiate furloughs in the United Kingdom, while no such gender gaps were found among childless workers. Moreover, the United Kingdom explicitly allowednurseriesand early childcare centers to remain open to minimize labor market disruptions (UK Government 2021;Pizzinelli and Shibata 2022).Our paper is related to contemporaneous work byAlon et al. (2021), which takes a similar cross-country approach, but focuses on the cyclicality of women's and men's hours-worked and employment.Alon et al. (2021)find significant differences in the pandemic impact across countries. They find that the pandemic generated a substantial gender gap in hours-worked in the United States and Germany. Relatedly, they also find a substantial gender gap in employment opening up in the United States, but not in Germany. These differences indicate that policy responses (such as more extensive furlough and short-time work schemes in Germany) were important in reinforcing women's labor force attachment in the wake of the crisis.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the data and the definition of she-cession used throughout the paper. Section III presents the baseline results on employment rates by gender. Section IV explores sectoral employment differences as a driver of COVID-19 she-cessions. Section V examines employment gender gaps along the alternative margins of labor force participation and unemployment. Section VI presents additional robustness checks to the findings. Section VII concludes.",John,Francesca,Niels-Jakob
"1. IntroductionThe Central African Republic (CAR) is home to one of the world's most dramatic humanitarian crises. More than 600,000 people are internally displaced (UNHCR, 2022), and just over half of its citizens need assistance after years of civil unrest and conflict that resulted in high levels of destruction and many human lives lost. Starting in 2013, violence erupted along ethno-religious lines, which led to a de facto partitioning of the country and proliferation of non-state armed groups who are in control of large portions of the country'sterritoryand key sectors of the economy.1The conflict in CAR is the result of several unresolved and structural shortcomings, including uneven geographic distribution of public investments, limited state presence outside Bangui (the capital), chronicpovertyand weak institutions. Consequently, welfare outcomes are poor and access to basic services, health, education, sanitation and clean water is limited (World Bank, 2019). According to the United Nations Development Program's Human Development Index from 2020, CAR ranks 188 out of 189 countries in the world.2Public works programs(PWPs) are a common policy response tomacroeconomicshocks and are increasingly implemented in fragile and conflict-affected contexts such as CAR to fight chronic poverty and un(der)employment. These programs are meant to support the most vulnerable populations by offering short-term employment that provides a basic safety net and eventually helps beneficiaries transition to more permanent, gainful livelihoods. These were also some of the main objectives of the Londö PWP implemented in CAR starting in 2015 in most regions of the country, including areas that the government does not control.3A growing body of research is studying the effectiveness of such PWPs on improving a wide range of outcomes and in diverse contexts. In Argentina, theJefes y Jefasprogram was designed to counter the economic crisis of 2001.Galasso and Ravallion (2004)find that the program reduced aggregate unemployment by attracting people who were unemployed and those who were otherwise out of the workforce. In India, the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) of 2005 caused an increase in private sector wages which translated into large welfare gains by the poor even if they did not directly take part in the program (Imbert and Papp, 2015). Other studies of this program also document an increase inreal wagesandlabor force participation(Azam, 2012) as well as higher household food consumption and non-financial asset holdings (Deininger and Liu, 2013).Ravi and Engler (2015)also find increases in non-food expenditures, food security and the probability of holding savings. In addition to the above, see alsoDaidone et al. (2019)for a study that summarizes the evidence from seven evaluations of the impact of unconditional cash transfer programs on productive outcomes in Sub-Saharan Africa andGehrke and Hartwig (2018)for a review of the effectiveness of PWPs.Nevertheless, not all evidence suggests that PWPs are effective. For example,Beegle et al. (2017)find no evidence that Malawi's large PWP (the MalawiSocial ActionFund) increased beneficiaries’ food security. In another example from Sub-Saharan Africa,Bertrand et al. (2021)find no lasting impacts on employment and only limited impacts on earnings for a PWP in Côte d'Ivoire. There are also concerns about PWPs’ cost-effectiveness, especially when programs are poorly targeted (Murgai et al., 2016). Another common criticism is that PWPs crowd out other income generating activities.Bertrand et al. (2021)find such crowding-out effects from a PWP in Côte d'Ivoire as there was a shift in the composition of employment toward better-paidpublic workswage jobs.Datt and Ravallion (1994)study how these crowding-out effects of public employment schemes interact with time allocations at the household-level in India.Ravallion (2019)compares PWPs with programs that provide conditional or unconditional cash transfers as alternatives that are less prone to such crowding-out effects as alternatives and concludes that the question of whether guaranteed employment or guaranteed income is the preferred policy option varies with the setting. For India's NREGA,Alik-Lagrange and Ravallion (2018)document sizable welfare losses from work requirements and show that incorporating these losses in evaluating benefits switch the policy ranking in favor of unconditional cash transfers over workfare.Against this background, using cross-sectional data from more than 6000 respondents, we evaluate the Londö PWP which provides temporary employment to vulnerable households through a workfare scheme. Beneficiaries selected through large public lotteries receive salaries for 40 days of work as well as a bicycle to commute to the worksites.4In this way, the program was designed to provide the most vulnerable with the means to escape extreme poverty, improve public infrastructure and rebuild social cohesion. Ultimately, the pay from the workfare scheme was expected to increase beneficiaries’ economic opportunities beyond the duration of the program by allowing them to start new, or intensify current, livelihoods.Leveraging the random selection of program beneficiaries through lotteries, we find positive impacts of Londö on beneficiaries’ productivity beyond the immediate gains from the program. Monthly earnings increased by around 10 percent, along with a modest increase in the number of days worked in the past week. This improvement seems to result from diversification of income generating activities for women, who increasingly engaged in trading, and intensification of agricultural production for men. We also find positive impacts on households’ productive assets,durable goodsand livestock holdings, along with an increase inresilience. The program also improved mobility, albeit only for male beneficiaries. We attribute this pattern to gender gaps in skills and norms associated with riding a bicycle. Higher levels of reported happiness and satisfaction of program beneficiaries mirrored these tangible gains. We do not find significant improvements in outcomes that are proxies for social cohesion.Finally, we study the distributional impacts of Londö on householdwealth. The average increase in wealth masks distinctly different distributional impacts for individuals of different wealth levels, particularly for female participants. Women at the lower end of the distribution were not able to translate project participation into lasting economic gains.Our study makes three main contributions to the literature. First, we provide further evidence of the impact of productive social protection programs in poor and fragile economies such as CAR. In this way, we add to existing studies such asStoeffler et al. (2019)who evaluate a cash transfer program in Niger andAl-Yriani et al. (2015)who review the success behind a large safety net program in Yemen. Compared to cash transfer programs, PWPs can be administratively complex and challenging to implement which raises concerns if the institutional capacity of the implementing agency is low. Yet, these are the contexts in which PWPs may be needed the most.Second, we contrast impacts by gender. CAR has the second lowest score on the United Nations Development Programme's GenderInequalityIndex of all countries in the dataset. Identifying potential avenues to improve women's (economic)empowermentis critical. Doing so, we add to a series of other studies that sex-disaggregate welfare impact estimates. For example,Azam (2012)finds that public works in India increase labor force participation at a higher rate for women than for men. We show that women use the proceeds from the PWP to make different investment choices than men by diversifying their income sources. We also document an impact on gender norms related to household behaviors.Additionally, we study how a PWP that provides bicycles as part of the compensation package affects mobility. Gender gaps in mobility are found around the world (Uteng, 2012), ranging from constrained mobility, which women and girls disproportionately bear, in the slums of Nairobi (Salon and Gulyani, 2010) to fewer girls than boys biking to school in the US (McDonald, 2012). The use of bicycles is particularly interesting because cycling was considered to be a part ofwomen's liberationby offering women not only the opportunity to break into traditionally male spheres, but also a physical challenge to male dominance and gender norms (Hanson, 2010). Gender norms continue to influence the use of bicycles by men and women and are often attributed to traditional household obligations (Emond et al., 2009). Adequate policy responses to women's mobility constraints often fall short, with policies and programs frequently failing to incorporate gender issues concerns because of a lack of contextual understanding and difficulty operationalizing higher-level objectives (Riverson et al., 2006). Our study provides insights into women's ability to overcome mobility constraints by gaining access to bicycles.Third, one rationale motivating the use of PWPs in fragile and conflict-affected settings is the claim that they can double as behavioral interventions.5We provide novel evidence of the effectiveness of PWPs to impact norms, social cohesion and attitudes toward institutions. This is important as these programs often require men and women with different religious or ethnic backgrounds to work together which may challenge prevailing norms in some settings. In many cases, these programs also impose strict rules and worksite codes of conduct that may change behaviors in the longer-term. The Londö PWP also required participants to interact with the government in a context in which contact with formal institutions is largely absent.Evans et al. (2019)provide evidence on how aconditional cash transferprogram induced trust in the government in Tanzania. Overall, however, empirical studies that demonstrate the ability of programs promoting employment to strengthen social stability is limited (Blattman and Ralston, 2015).The paper is organized as follows.Section 2provides details on the Londö program.Section 3describes the research design, the data and the estimation model we use to measure the program's impacts.Section 4summarizes the results for the impacts at the mean and distributional impacts.Section 5contains robustness checks, examinesspillover effectsand provides a simple cost-benefit analysis.Section 6concludes.",Arthur,Niklas,Markus
"1. IntroductionThe empirical literature on labor supply often makes the implicit assumption that labor supply responses to wage increases are the same as those for equivalent wage decreases (Bargain et al., 2014;Blundell and MaCurdy, 1999;Meghir and Phillips, 2010). In other words, wage increases and wage decreases of equal magnitude are assumed to have the same effect onlabor supply decisions(though with opposite signs). This assumption implies that labor-supply elasticities with respect to wages do not depend on the sign of the wage variation. However, various theoretical approaches predictasymmetric responsesto wage increases and decreases. Although this result has important implications for the empirical literature, there is little direct empirical evidence regarding the symmetry of the effect of wages on labor supply.In this paper, we investigate the symmetry of labor-supply responses to wage changes. Our precise research question is: do wage increases and decreases of equal magnitude have symmetric effects on the supply of labor by employees to their current employer?1Answering this research question requires a set-up that introduces (quasi-)randomly assigned wage increases and decreases at the same time for comparable individuals. Finding such types of experiments in a “natural” setting is difficult, if not impossible, and thus may partly explain the sparse literature on the symmetry of labor-supply responses to nominal wages.We address this empirical challenge using a real effort experiment implemented in an online labor market, where we randomly assign wage increases and decreases of equal magnitude to workers. Specifically, we set up a real effort task and invite workers to work on this task in an actual online labor market, namely Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (henceforth mTurk). Our task requires workers to transcribe pictures with scanned German-language text. We announce a piece rate of $0.15 per transcribed picture and workers complete a batch of six transcriptions for the announced wage. Workers are randomly assigned to one of three groups: (i) the wage increases by 20%, (ii) the wage decreases by 20%, or (iii) the wage remains constant (control group). We present these updated piece rates to workers after having transcribing the first batch of images. Workers can then select to either stop working on our task or keep transcribing pictures. We identify the symmetry of labor-supply responses by comparing working behavior between the three randomly assigned groups.Our results can be summarized as follows. First, we find that wageincreaseshave a positive effect on labor supply whereas wagedecreasesreduce labor supply in our task. This finding provides clear support for a positive relationship between labor supply and wages. Second, labor-supply responses to wage increases and decreases are asymmetric; workers react more strongly to wage decreases than wage increases of equal magnitude (in absolute terms). We find clear statistically evidence of asymmetry using non-parametric tests for the equality of the distributions comparing (i) absolute differences between the control and wage-increasegroup to (ii) absolute differences between the control and wage-decreasegroup, respectively. Using conventional Wald-tests, we further find statistically significant evidence on the extensive margin, which we define as the share of workers who quit our task immediately after seeing the treatment notification.2Workers in the wage-decrease group have a 18%phigherprobability to quit the labor task (compared to the control group), while workers in the wage-increase group are 8.5%plesslikely to quit (relative to the control group). Third, our results further show that neither wage increases nor wage decreases have an effect on the average time spent per transcribed picture or the quality of transcriptions, which is around 97 percent in all groups.Our results are consistent with a simple standard labor supply model where utility is concave in consumption. We also discuss various alternative mechanisms behind our results, none of which is able to explain all of our empirical findings. In particular, we argue that models of reservation wages, dynamic models with learning about effort costs, and models with reference-dependence in consumption or reciprocity concerns are only partly in line with our results while some key predictions are at odds with the data.Contribution to the Literature.We make the following contributions to the literature on labor-supply effects of wage changes. First, we contribute to the general labor-supply literature (seeKeane, 2011, for a survey). Many of the existing studies use panel-data and pool upward and downward variation in wages to estimate the wage elasticity of labor supply. Because the elasticity estimated by these studies represents an average of responses induced by wage increase and decreases, our results suggest that existing estimates likely overstate the effect of wage increases while understating the effect of wage decreases. Our results thus raise questions about the comparability of labor-supply elasticities across studies that differ in the sign of the wage changes used for identification. It cannot be concluded from the estimated elasticities that workers are more responsive in the one setting relative to another without knowing whether the sign of the wage changes is the same. This is especially important for meta-analysis studies on labor supply (e.g.,Evers et al., 2008).3Second, our paper is related to three studies investigating potentially asymmetric responses. Most importantly,Kube et al. (2013)conduct a field experiment with students working in a library for a given period of time. They find that wage cuts decreases work effort whereas wage increases have no effect. While these results are broadly consistent with our findings, our setup differs from theirs in the design of the experiment as well as the labor market institution, which has important implications for the interpretation and application of our findings. We pay workers for each transcribed picture instead of for a predetermined number of hours; this implies that we study a situation where workers have less scope to shirk as a means of punishing their employer. In addition we allow workers to quit the labor task whenever they choose to do so. While they are in a gift-exchange setting, our task offers little room for either positive or negative reciprocity. Another related paper isFalk et al. (2006)who find in a laboratory experiment that reservation wages respond asymmetrically to the introduction and removal of minimum wages. More broadly, we explicitly test for asymmetry in behavioral responses, and thereby relate to a recent paper byBenzarti et al. (2020)who use observational data to document that increases invalue added taxeshave larger effects on prices than VAT reductions.Third, we add to the experimental literature on the effect of wages on effort and labor supply. These studies provide credible randomized evidence in the absence of (discrete) work-time constraints, something which is difficult to obtain using observational data. Papers based on laboratory experiments provide robust evidence that labor effort and wages are characterized by a positive relationship (see the survey byCharness and Kuhn, 2011), which is consistent with our findings. However, laboratory experiments are subject to the usual concern that they cannot easily be generalized to real-world situations. Field experiments with higher external validity find mixed effects regarding the relationship between wages and effort. While some field experiments find a positive effect of wages on effort/labor supply (DellaVigna and Pope, 2018;Fehr and Goette, 2007), other studies find either no relationship (Hennig-Schmidt et al., 2010), short-run temporary effects which do not make a difference for final work outcomes (Gneezy and List, 2006), or (positive) effects for only certain types of workers (Cohn et al., 2015). Our results add to the (ongoing) discussion on the wage-effort relation by providing evidence of a positive relationship between wages and labor effort in online labor markets.The paper is organized as follows.Section 2describes the real labor task and its implementation in Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. We present the empirical analysis and the results inSection 3. We discuss the potential economic mechanisms behind our findings, as well as their implications and generalizability, inSection 4.Section 5concludes.",Philipp,Denvil,Max
"1. IntroductionThe life-cyclepermanent income hypothesis(LCPIH) posits that consumers should make consumption decisions based on their permanent income, saving or borrowing to adjust temporal consumption patterns. In his seminal work,Friedman (1957)highlights the key empirically testable hypothesis that the transient components of income and consumption are uncorrelated but cautions that consumption should not be measured by expenditures alone but rather by the value of services received. Significant empirical work has tested this hypothesis, with some evidence supporting the LCPIH and numerous studies documenting “excess sensitivity” of consumption to transient income variation. That literature has proposed various explanations for these anomalies, withcredit constraints(also raised by Friedman) and behavioral phenomenon as leading explanations. In particular, many of the apparent violations of the LCPIH occur in settings where consumers have poor access to credit or where the magnitude or frequency of income variation are insufficient to justify the mental costs of optimization.Characteristics of student life at the United StatesAir ForceAcademy (USAFA) serve as a natural experiment revealing how college students change behavior due to monthly income variation. Student are paid a fixed monthly stipend (except for annualinflationadjustments) and cannot adjust their stipend by increasing or decreasing their labor hours. Net student pay, however, varies from just over $100 to over $1000 depending on date and seniority due to mandatory charges. Variation in pay both over time and across class years enables us to estimate plausibly causal effects of pay on recreational departures from campus. In addition to a difference-in-differences approach to measure the effect of the magnitude of monthly pay, we also examine how within-month variation in recreational departures from campus relates to the timing of pay. Given that students do not have the ability to change their pay by adjusting labor hours, we argue that these departures from campus reflect substitution of time-intensive leisure with goods-intensive leisure rather than alabor supply effect.We find that students show excess sensitivity to both the amount and timing of pay in their leisure choices. First, we find that students leave campus more in months that they have higher income: a monthly stipend increase of $100 induces an additional 1.8 hours away from campus and 0.08 trips longer than 12 hours. Furthermore, more frequent departures from campus coincide systematically with the timing of monthly pay. We argue that these findings are uniquely informative due to the novel outcome measure and the setting of the study, which limits the potential impacts of imperfect information and credit constraints. The results are consistent with larger costs of budgeting to optimize consumption than have been recognized.",Aaron,Nathan,None
"1. IntroductionDuring times of crisis, the demand for timely data may rise, and social science surveys must be developed and fielded at speed. In particular, earnings and income can be tracked with brief summary questions in web surveys. Many such surveys were fielded during the COVID-19 pandemic and continue to be analysed by economists (see, for example,Adams-Prassl et al. (2020);Belot et al. (2020);Bundervoet et al. (2022);Crossley et al. (2021);Institute for Social and Economic Research (2020)). These rapid surveys are important because administrative data sources (such astaxreturns) may be available only at annual frequency, and official household income surveys may also lack timeliness, or may have been disrupted (e.g.,Ward and Edwards (2021)). Earnings and income data are also collected with a small number of summary questions in surveys that prioritise other content domains. Examples include the US General Social Survey, the Gallup HealthwaysWellbeingIndex, the European Social Survey, and the Health Survey for England. Data from these surveys are used extensively in economic research.In contrast, the best practice approach to collecting earnings and income data in a household survey is with a detailed set of questions that ask each household member about each individual income source, and then, post fieldwork, to aggregate over sources and then over individuals in the household (United Nations, 2011). In the crisis context, or where a survey prioritises other content domains, practice necessarily deviates from this ideal. Demands on interview space push data collectors towards fewer summary questions that ask about earnings and income totals, rather than going source by source. Where field work periods are compressed, it may not be possible to interview all household members, and one individual may need to report household totals. Given the importance of earnings and income data to research and policymaking, it isimperativeto understand the quality of the data collected in such cases.In this paper, we study the quality of earnings and income data collected with summary questions in a series of surveys fielded during the COVID-19 pandemic - theUnderstanding SocietyCOVID-19 Study. We link individuals who were interviewed twice in a short-time period - with a set of detailed earnings and income questions in the main annualUnderstanding Societysurvey, and in the COVID-19 Study. As the gap between interviews is very close, we can use the more detailed survey to learn about the error properties of the data from the shorter one. We exploit the individual-level linkage between the two surveys to describe the differences in reports at an individual level. We then interpret those differences through the lens of an estimated model of measurement error. That model does not impose that the validation source (here, theUnderstanding SocietyMain Study) is error free, but it does allow us to compare the quality of the two sources.We have three main findings. First, the summary questions in the COVID-19 Study produce very reliable data on individual earnings; second, household earnings and income is systematically under-reported in summary questions; and third, measurement errors in the COVID-19 Study household income measure is largely uncorrelated with true values, but there is a mild correlation for household earnings. The latter means that, reassuringly, that aninstrumental variablesapproach can correct for measurement error in a regression context.A growing literature has looked at the misreporting of earnings and income in household surveys. Validation studies can be distinguished by whether two measurements – the measurement of interest and the validation measure – are available for a given individual or household unit (a “micro” study in the terminology ofBound et al. (2001)); or those measures are available on separate samples (a “macro” study in the terminology ofBound et al. (2001)) so that only differences between distributions can be studied. Validation studies can further be distinguished by the nature of the validation data (a high-quality survey, or administrative records), and whether it is a broad population sample or a more narrow set of records (such as the payroll records of a single firm). Finally, validation studies differ in what is assumed about the validation data (in particular, whether is assumed to be error free).Micro validation studies of earnings and income data in surveys have typically linked survey responses to administrative records (payroll, social security, or tax records). Early micro vaidlidation studies often used narrow validation samples, and assumed the administrative data was error free (see, for example,Bound et al. (1994);Pischke (1995)). However, more recent papers have linked to more broadly representative data sets such as social security records (Gottschalk, Huynh, 2010,Meyer, Mittag, 2019) and allowed for errors in the validation source, or linkage error, or both (Abowd, Stinson, 2013,Bingley, Martinello, 2017,Jenkins, Rios-Avila, 2020,Kapteyn, Ypma, 2007,Wilhelm, 2018).Whilst the validation literature has assessed data from income-focussed surveys with detailed earnings and income questions, there is little evidence on the performance of summary income and earnings questions. This is a surprising fact given their widespread use. Two rare exceptions areMicklewright and Schnepf (2010)andHan et al. (2020).Micklewright and Schnepf (2010)perform several macro validations, comparing responses to a single summmary income question in one survey to data derived from a more detailed set of questions in a benchmark survey. The authors conclude that distributions compare less well for household income than for individual income.Han et al. (2020)also find thatpovertyrates and income percentiles estimated on data from global questions of the monthly Current Population Survey (CPS) fall below those estimated on more detailed equivalents from the Annual Social and Economic Supplement of the CPS.Our design is unusual in that we conduct a micro validation study that draws validation data from a high-quality survey. We are able to work with a large nationally representative sample, but we do not need to worry about linkage error because the COVID-19 Study was launched directly from our validation source (theUnderstanding SocietyMain Study). Like other recent studies, we do not assume our validation source – the more detailed survey – to be error free. Among studies of summary earnings and income questions, we differ fromMicklewright and Schnepf (2010)andHan et al. (2020)in that we directly estimate measurement error models and are not limited to simple aggregate comparisons of distributions from different surveys. For example, we can quantify the bias of OLS and IV estimated on data from the summary questions.The rest of the paper proceeds as follows.Section 2describes our data sources and lays out our research design.Section 3provides a descriptive comparison of our two data sources before presenting our estimated measurement error models.Section 4concludes.",Thomas,Paul,Omar
"1. IntroductionA massive wave of highly educated immigrants arrived in Israel from the Former Soviet Union (FSU) during the period 1989–1995. The labor market outcomes of the female immigrants in this wave in Israel were inferior to those of the males. Even after a number of years in Israel, there was still a substantial gender gaps in both wages and employment. The aim of this paper is to explain the sources and consequences of this gap. One common explanation is that labor market returns differ by gender. Another explanation, which we consider here, is the potential mismatch between the family’s residential location and the wife’s labor market opportunities.Following the literature, we assume that the household chooses its residential location by concentrating on utilizing the husband’ s human capital. Based on this assumption, we develop and estimate a dynamic programing model in which married women make choices about participation and commuting, while taking the residential location of the family as given. We also estimate a model for married men (an extended version of the model that was developed inBuchinsky et al., 2014; hereafter BGL). In this model, as in BGL, men make decisions not only about participation and commuting, but also about the family’s residential location. The two models make it possible to investigate the potential impact of the aforementioned assumption on the gender gaps in wages and employment among immigrants. We use a retrospective longitudinal dataset of male and female engineers who arrived in Israel from the FSU between 1989 and 1995. The male and female engineers had very similar human capital upon arrival (in terms of education and experience). This unique sample of two groups of immigrants with similar background help us to investigate the sources of the observed gender gap.It is important to note at the outset that we do not possess the data needed to directly investigate the family’s joint decisions. Therefore, we estimate separate models for men and women. Nonetheless, the dataset includes detailed information about the individual’s choices and outcomes, together with limited information about their spouse’s labor market outcomes.In BGL, we examined the migration patterns of male immigrants using the same survey. Since the sample provided very little information about the labor outcomes of the individuals’ spouses, it was necessary to assume that the family chooses its residence solely based on the husband’s labor market opportunities. Consequently, the family’s decisions about the wife’s labor supply are made only after the residential location decision. Given this assumption, the model provided very strong predictions and an excellent fit to the data, which provides support for the assumption. In the current study, we focus on labor market outcomes of married female immigrants in Israel, while maintaining the assumption that the household chooses its residential location based on the husband’ s husband’ s human capital.Given this setting, we decompose the differences in labor market outcomes between men and women into their various underlying factors. This is done on the basis of a number of illuminating counterfactual simulations. The simulations also provide circumstantial evidence that the assumeddecision making processwithin the family is supported by our data.For this study we estimate two dynamic programing models: one for men and other for women. We assume, as in BGL, that the family’s residential location decision is based solely based on the husband’s husband’ s human capital. Based on this assumption, in the first model (only men), we allow the individual to make optimal choices in every six-month period with respect to: (a) residential location; (b) employment; and (c) region of employment. We refer to this model as theaugmented labor supply model(or ALSM). In the second model (only women), we assume that the family’s residential location is taken as given, and therefore the individual can optimize only with respect to (a) employment and (b) region of employment. We refer to this model as thelabor supply model(LSM). In both models, an individual can choose to work in one region and reside in another, but then he/she incurs commuting costs.Both models also take into account the potential effects of regional amenities, differences in regional housing prices, and existingsocial networks. We also incorporate stochastic job offers and job terminations. Finally, we control for unobserved heterogeneity in a manner similar toKeane and Wolpin (1997), namely through the presence of individual types.One of the study’s main goals is to quantify the factors–those based on behavior versus those based on the labor market–underlying the pronounced gaps in labor market outcomes between male and female immigrants in Israel. We therefore decompose the overall effects accordingly. This is achieved by means of counterfactual simulations in which we decompose the overall differences between the outcomes of men and women. We use several alternative combinations of the model’s parameters and the data, thus providing a comprehensive decomposition in the spirit of the Oaxaca decomposition.The simulations clearly show that gaps in labor market outcomes between spouses are not a result of differences in observed human capital. Rather, if women had the same labor market returns and the same preferences as men, their outcomes would have been similar to those of men. Moreover, we conduct a simulation in which we didn’t change the job market parameters, but we allow women to make decisions regarding residential location. The results of this counterfactual suggest an increase of more than 100% in the proportion of women working in white-collar occupations and a much lower proportion in the non-employment status. This counterfactual indicates that, even without any changes in their labor market conditions, women would have gained in terms of both job quality and wages if the residential location of the family was decided based on their human capital.The rest of the paper is organized as follows:Section 2presents the data and in particular thegender differencesin the data.Section 3surveys the literature on the labor market participation of women and particularly married women.Section 4describes the basic model and its various alternatives.Section 5presents the results, including a number of important counterfactual simulations.Section 6concludes.",Moshe,Chemi,Osnat
"1. IntroductionIt is well known that different sectors of the economy react differently to the business cycle. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted this feature very clearly.1For example, the pandemic and related lockdown measures applied in the UK meant that, by the end of 2021, the Accommodation and Food industry lost close to 20% of its pre-pandemic employment. At the same time, Public Administration employment grew by about 8%. A similar feature occurred across occupations. Elementary occupations lost about 10% of their pre-pandemic employment, while Administrative occupations gained 10% (seeFig. 4, below). These differences left a large number of individuals, mostly from the worst affected sectors, unemployed or at risk of unemployment. As evidenced by the labour shortages afflicting many economies after the pandemic, the speed and strength of the economic recovery not only depends on renewed vacancy creation but also on workers’ willingness and ability to reallocate from harder hit sectors to those that are booming, as well as firms’ willingness to hire them.2In this paper we investigate how workers adapted to the rapid structural shifts in demand from differentindustriesand occupations during the COVID-19 pandemic. We tackle two questions in turn. Did workers adjust their job search during the pandemic and target jobs in expanding occupations and industries? Did any adjustment translate into labour reallocation across sectors? A key contribution and innovation of the paper is that we collected data, through the COVID-19 Study of the UK HouseholdLongitudinal Study(UKHLS), on which occupations and industries job searchers were targeting during the second half of 2020 and January 2021. Since we collected data at different points during the pandemic, these data allow us to investigate the extent to which job seekers were reacting to the evolving occupation and industry differences arising from the pandemic and lockdown policies. A further advantage is that we are able to merge for each individual surveyed rich information about the previous labour market history of respondents. Thus our main analysis takes into account not only observable but also unobservable individual characteristics. We complement these data with the UKLabour Force Survey(LFS) in order to investigate the evolution of aggregate job search during the first two years of the pandemic as well as the likely implications of individuals’ job search behaviour for aggregate reallocation flows.Our starting point is to document the heterogeneity in the shocks to employment by occupation and industry, before turning to the responsiveness of job search to these shocks. We observe large heterogeneity inemployment changesacross occupations during the pandemic in contrast with that seen during theGreat Recession, where occupations experienced less dispersed employment changes. Moreover, occupation shocks are not simply a reflection of underlying industry shocks. We show that declining occupations saw employment falls for occupation specific reasons which were not driven by changes in between-industry composition. These shocks have tended to accelerate the longer term trends in the labour market by industry and occupation. An important question is therefore whether workers adjusted their job search to the specific nature of the shocks during the pandemic, or based their search on longer-term trends.At the extensive search margin, we observe that unemployed workers from declining sectors were more likely to quit their job search in the first half of 2020 and were more likely to resume job search as the economy recovered. At the intensive search margin we document three novel facts. (i) Workers changed their direction of search in favour of expanding occupations and industries as the pandemic progressed, which suggests job searchers were responding to occupation-wide and industry-wide conditions.3Nevertheless a large proportion of workers continued targeting declining occupations and industries. (ii) The individuals most likely to target declining occupations were those at the margins of the labour market: those with the lowesteducation levelsand, most significantly, those coming from declining occupations and industries due to attachment to previous jobs. (iii) There is also a substantial mismatch between targeted and realised transitions. Among those targeting an occupation switch, the proportion of workers actually making an occupation transition into expanding occupations was substantially lower than the proportion of job seekers targeting a switch into an expanding occupation, particularly for those individuals coming from declining occupations. This suggests substantial impediments to reallocation across occupations during the pandemic.Our analysis further shows that worker reallocation was occurring at an aggregate level, evidenced by the large rise in net mobility across industries which was double the level observed during the Great Recession. This finding is important in light of the Job Retention Scheme (or “furlough”) introduced by the UK Government at the start of the pandemic.4Some commentators raised concerns that the furlough scheme, which mediated the nature of the pandemic shocks on occupations and industries in the UK, was going to hold back Schumpeterian forces of “creative destruction” associated with labour market churn and reallocation.5The balance of evidence suggests the furlough scheme had a stronger impact in limiting job destruction than in holding backjob creationor mobility across industries.Across occupations this dynamism, however, was much more subdued. We find that net mobility flows across occupations remained broadly stable in line with the experience during the Great Recession. This is driven mainly by a combination of workers in declining occupations continuing to target their previous occupation, and not being able to access targeted jobs in expanding occupations. This suggests a pattern of segmentation, where there was a strong attachment to previous occupations during the pandemic and those targeting an occupation change found it hard to break into expanding, higher skill and better paying occupations unless they start from one. As this segmentation did not occur across industries, policies that attempted to force reallocation from the declining low skilled jobs to expanding high skilled ones would appear to have little effect in the short run. Instead, medium term re-training policies would be more effective. This is important in light of thelabour market policiesthe UK government enacted at several stages throughout the pandemic to incentivise job seekers to search for employment outside their occupations.6The above evidence shows that workers’ search behaviourreactsto employment changes by industry and occupation. This naturally implies that their behaviour must thencontributeto the evolution of the labour market. The aggregate trends show that the pandemic initially discouraged job search among those who lost employment due to the lockdown measures. There was a sharp rise in the number of individuals out of the labour force flowing from employment and unemployment to inactivity. This resulted in a much larger increase in inactivity than experienced in the Great Recession, and provides another clear indication that the extensive margin of job search was a relevant channel of adjustment during the pandemic. During the second half of 2020, however, more individuals re-engaged with job search as vacancy posting began to recover, resulting in a higher unemployment rate and a slower rise in inactivity. The subsequent drop in unemployment during 2021 then led to the recovery in the employment stock. During the recovery, job-to-job transitions also increased back to and even above their pre-pandemic level. However, the recovery was marked by a divergence in gross reallocation across industries and occupations, with gross mobility across industries recovering more rapidly than in the Great Recession, while gross mobility across occupations stagnated.1.1. Related literatureThis paper contributes to the large literature that developed during the COVID-19 pandemic analysing the impact of lockdowns and other social distancing measures on labour market outcomes. Like our paper,Albanesi and Kim (2021)andJones et al. (2021)investigate aggregate changes in the stocks and flows of inactive, unemployed and employed workers in the US and Canada respectively. A common finding in these studies and ours is that there was an initial increase in outflows from both employment and unemployment to inactivity in the onset of the pandemic, followed by a reversal of these outflows as the economy recovered. This suggests that, in these countries and the UK, the decision to participate in labour market search is indeed sensitive to aggregate labour market conditions.Changes in the extensive margin of job search are important as they inform the degree of tightness in labour markets, a key ingredient in search and matching models (seePissarides, 2001).Faberman et al. (2022)use the Aggregate Hours Gap measure developed byFaberman et al. (2020), which is shown to be highly correlated with the extent of job search, and document that the US labour market was tighter than suggested by more conventional measures based on the unemployment rate.7A key distinction between the US and the UK labour markets during the pandemic was the sharp rise in temporary laid-off workers and how they affected the evolution of the unemployment rate.Hall and Kudlyak, 2022andForsythe et al., 2022document that this rise led the unemployment rate to jump to 14.7% in April 2020. In the UK, the unemployment rate did not exceed 5% at any point during 2020 and 2021. Similar to temporary layoffs, however, the UK furlough scheme prevented the destruction of search capital by preserving a large number of worker-firm matches and hence keeping unemployment from rising to unprecedented heights.8Our results complement the findings of studies that focus on changes in the intensive margin of job search during the pandemic. For example,Balgová et al. (2022)using number of applications as a measure of job search intensity, find that in the Netherlands the unemployed searched less intensively for jobs than was the case in the Great Recession. Their contribution is distinct from our focus on thedirectionof job search, which is crucial for understanding how job search both reacts and contributes to shocks that are heterogeneous by sector and occupation.Adams-Prassl et al., 2022instead investigate perceived returns to job search among employed and unemployed job searchers in the UK and how these perceptions varied during the pandemic. Among their several findings we highlight that job searchers tend to be over-optimistic in their probability of finding a job. This is in line with our finding that workers appear over-optimistic when targeting jobs in different occupations. This is evidenced be the relatively large discrepancy we document between targeted and realisedoccupational mobilityduring the pandemic. In addition, both our Job Search Module and the survey implemented byAdams-Prassl et al., 2022collect information on the desire to change occupations. While they emphasise the role of occupational change due to working from home and otherjob characteristics, we emphasise the determinants of desire reallocation towards expanding and contracting occupations.Closest to our paper isHensvik et al. (2021). These authors investigate how the direction of workers’ job search changed during the pandemic in Sweden using a widely used online job search platform. They find that jobs in high home-working occupations, or in occupations where vacancy creation has been more resilient, see increases in clicks per vacancy. This is broadly consistent with the evidence we uncover: for example, that workers target expanding occupations, which generally had higher home-working ability, and this tendency increases over the pandemic (see alsoAdams-Prassl et al., 2022). Further,Bauer et al. (2020)use LinkedIn data to investigate changing patterns of job applications by industries in Germany. A key point of departure with these papers is that our approach additionally looks at the realised occupations and industry transitions of workers and compares these to targeted transitions.9Finally, our results inform the growing literature of multi-sector business cycle models based onLucas and Prescott (1974)in which worker reallocation takes centre stage (seeCarrillo-Tudela, Visschers,Pilossoph,Wiczer, 2015). The large observed discrepancy between targeted and realised occupation/industry mobility and the large proportion of workers that remain attached to their occupations/industries even though these are performing badly suggest that when modelling occupation/industry reallocation one needs to take into account a degree of occupation/industry attachment and the existence of significant impediments to reallocation.The rest of the paper proceeds as follows.Section 2briefly describes the data we use. In order to understand the context of the UK labour market during the pandemic,Section 3examines changes to aggregate labour market stocks and flows.Section 4presents our main results where investigate the nature of jobs targeted by workers and reallocation of workers by occupation and industry.

"1. IntroductionEconomic recessions often lead to significant “scarring”: long-lasting damage to individual economic situations and to the labor market as a whole (Jacobson et al., 1993;Couch and Placzek, 2010;von Wachter et al., 2009). However, many of the long-term implications of recessions still remain unknown. Although numerous studies have documented the consequences of recessions on labor markets, most of these findings are not generalizable to a setting characterized by a large informal sector and a lack of labor market regulations. In such a setting, the effects of recessions are not necessarily limited to formal employment and wages, and they can affect other aspects of local labor markets—informality,labor force participation, and migration flows. The magnitude and persistence of these effects influence labor market dynamics, worker opportunities, and optimal policy responses.We present comprehensive evidence on the effects of recessions on earnings and employment losses for Mexican workers during theGreat Recession(2008–2009).1Unlike previous studies, we provide a holistic quantitative assessment of various local labor market adjustment mechanisms, including migration and the transition both to informality and out of the labor force. The effects of the Great Recession are particularly interesting for two reasons. First, its depth, longevity, and its heterogeneous effects at the sectoral and regional level allow us to construct a comprehensive picture of its effects on the Mexican labor market combined with granular longitudinal data. Second, notwithstanding its differences, the current recession induced by the COVID-19 pandemic can be compared to the Great Recession in a variety of ways (see Fig. A1 in the Supplementary Material).2A better understanding of the long-term labor market effects of the Great Recession may help us to prepare better for the aftermath of the COVID-19 recession.The objectives of this paper are twofold. First, likeYagan (2019), we estimate the long-term employment and earnings effects of the recession for individual Mexican workers. Second, in a significant departure from previous research, we investigate various mechanisms by which local labor markets adjusted to the Great Recession shock. The first question considers how much employment and earnings fell but does not discuss the different mechanisms of adjustment that operate in the labor market. To understand the timing and magnitude of these mechanisms we analyze variables such as informality, unemployment, and migration. The primary analysis is carried out using longitudinal data from 25% of the universe of formal workers (i.e., those registered with the Mexican social security system) who were observed at least once between 2005 and 2019 and who were born between 1958 and 1977 (i.e., they were 30 to 49 years old in 2007). With this data, we can determine when and where an individual worked prior to the recession and whether they relocated to a different job or region.Mexico is an interesting case in which to study the short- and long-term labor market effects of a large recession, for a variety of reasons. First, the 2008–2009 recession in Mexico was not in any way a crisis prompted by domestic factors: it was a collateral effect of the Great Recession in the United States, the result of a purely external shock that affected the economy through several channels. Second, the magnitude of the shock was significant. Mexico's GDP collapsed by 5.3% in 2009, one of the largest contractions the Mexican economy had experienced in recent decades; it took the economy approximately two years to recover its pre-crisis GDP and economic activity levels. Third, since the economy was affected through several channels (trade, foreign direct investment, tourism, and remittances), the impact of the Great Recession had an important geographic and sectoral dispersion, a source of heterogeneity that requires a detailed analysis of the impact on labor markets during the recession.3Our empirical strategy begins withevent studiesthat estimate the dynamic impact of employment shocks on wages and the employment rate over an extended period (2005–2019). This method allows us to provide estimates of the magnitude, length, and reaction time of key labor market variables, as well as to study potential mechanisms of labor market adjustments by affected workers. We then turn our attention to those workers who enter the labor market during recessions, as these are more vulnerable to long-term damage resulting from their entry into a struggling market. Next, we account for formal-to-informal transitions by exploiting the Mexican National Occupational and Employment Survey (ENOE), conducted by the National Institute of Geography and Statistics (INEGI), the primary source of labor market statistics in Mexico. The survey offers quarterly data on the country's labor force, occupations, labor informality, sub-occupations, and unemployment. We also investigate theinternational migrationchannel by developing a measure of increased migration based on a confidential version of the Mexican government's Matricula Consular (MCAS) database, which provides a detailed measure of migration flows between Mexico and the United States. Finally, we synthesize our findings to offer an accounting of the mechanisms underlying the impact of the recession on Mexican labor markets.We restrict our study to 247 sizable municipalities (roughly equivalent to counties in the U.S.) that account for 93% of all formal workers in 2007. To identify causal effects, we build a shift-share instrument for local demand shocks that varies at the Mexican municipality level. We assign each individual to their January 2007 municipality and follow the empirical strategy ofBartik (1991)to construct aninstrumental variablefor locallabor demandshocks by interacting differences in industrial composition with national changes inindustryemployment shares. The shock is then identified as each municipality's projected change in formal employment from 2007 to 2010, based on leave-one-municipality-out nationwide changes in employment, as tracked by four-digit industry categories.4We find that, conditional on 2006 age-earnings-industryfixed effects, a onestandard deviationincrease in the Great Recession local shock reduces the average working-age formal sector employee's probability of employment by 0.53% in 2010 (the short run), and by 0.12% in 2018 (the long run). These estimates are statistically significant and robust across numerous specifications. The averages also conceal considerable heterogeneity: the most affected municipalities receive a shock that is four standard deviations greater than the average, which implies that residents in these areas are still 0.48% less likely than average to be employed in the long run. We also find that hard-hit local labor markets show less dynamicjob creationduring and after the recession.5The Great Recession's influence on new job creation is far from short-term, as the gap in new job creation between slightly and severely afflicted towns lasts close to 10 years. We find similar effects on wage earnings in the formal sector: a one standard deviation increase in the size of the shock causes the average working-age Mexican worker to earn $180 MXN less per quarter by 2011. The long-run projection shows that the same worker still earns $90 MXN less per quarter in 2018 compared to the pre-recession norm.The recession's impacts were highly uneven across local areas. Consistent with previous literature, we find larger and more persistent negative employment and earnings effects among men than among women (Kalleberg and von Wachter, 2017). Additionally, we find that although initial low-wage earners (those who earned less than the median wage in 2007) bear more of the employment effects of the local recession shocks until 2009, they also recover faster. This could be a sign of an increase in employment and wage disparity acrossskill levels, rather than just within skill levels in different places. The granularity of our data also lets us identify crucial heterogeneity in wages and employment between internal movers and non-movers: a typical worker can absorb the shock by relocating to a less affected municipality. We study movers who work in municipalities 100 or 200 km from their municipality of origin in 2007 and stay for at least one year after moving. The long-run estimate for the movers shows that, while they have fully recovered to their pre-recession employment levels, they still earn 90 Mexican pesos (MXN) less than their pre-recession wage.Faced with job losses, wage cuts, and a less dynamic labor market, affected workers may adjust in many ways, including opting out of the labor force or resorting to an informal job. Workers in highly affected areas may also decide to migrate internationally. A nascent literature studies how shocks in the U.S. labor market affect outcomes in Mexican places of origin (Caballero, 2021;Caballero et al., 2021). Unfortunately, very little is known of the effect of the Great Recession shocks on migration flows, given the simultaneous interaction of push and pull factors. The use of a confidential version of the Mexican government's Matricula Consular database (MCAS) provides us with detailed measures of migration flows between Mexico and the U.S. We estimate that a one standard deviation increase in the mean local shock increases the issuance ofmatriculaIDs to new migrants by 9.2% in the first quarter of 2010. The timing of the first statistically discernible increase in new IDs (second quarter of 2009) suggests that migration to the United States is a potential mechanism of adjustment in the presence of job losses and labor market stress.For those workers remaining in Mexico, adjustment may come in the form of dropping out of the labor force or turning to the informal labor market. The aggregate magnitude of each adjustment mechanism is an empirical question. In the final section, we decompose changes in employment into different margins of adjustment: changes in unemployment, in labor force participation, and in formal and informal employment rates. Using the ENOE survey, we estimate that a one standard deviation increase above the mean in the Great Recession shock reduces aggregate employment by 0.36%, increases unemployment by 7.5%, increases the size of the informal sector by 1.1%, and increases the size of the economically inactive population by 0.44% in the first quarter of 2010, compared to pre-recession levels. The size and timing of this pattern is notably consistent with anecdotal evidence of how Mexican workers have dealt with the economic crisis associated with COVID-19, as well as the role of the informal labor sector in supplementing lost income due to layoffs or wage reductions (Raziel, 2021;Carbonell, 2020).Taken together, our findings provide evidence regarding the long-term employment impact of the Great Recession and contribute to a large literature on the incidence of labor market shocks. Earlier work has found long-term impacts on individual earnings and sometimes on local employment rates (Jacobson et al., 1993;Black et al., 2002;Autor and Duggan, 2003;Davis and von Wachter, 2011;Walker, 2013;Autor et al., 2014;Yagan, 2019). We provide evidence that transitory aggregate shocks can have persistent negative employment impacts even after unemployment recovers (the view ofAutor and Duggan 2003, andYagan 2019). One branch of this literature examines the effect at the time of labor market entry and finds sizable persistent effects on employment, wages, and earnings that fade over the decade followinggraduation(Kahn, 2010;Oreopoulos et al., 2012;Schwandt and von Wachter, 2019;Borgschulte and Martorell, 2018). A few studies have examined migration responses to the Great Recession and how mobility affects the persistence of employment and earnings losses (Cadena and Kovak, 2016). To our knowledge, our paper is the first to provide a holistic understanding of the scarring effects on these different groups of workers in the same accounting framework by providing empirical estimates of the different dimensions and mechanisms of labor market adjustment.The rest of the paper is organized as follows:Section 2describes our data sources and the primary variables analyzed.Section 3discusses the Great Recession‘s heterogeneous effects on local labor markets and how we measure them.Section 4sets up the empirical analysis and details the identifying assumptions and methodological contributions.Section 5presents the main results and details the adjustment mechanisms.Section 6concludes.",Raymundo,Gerardo,Priyasmita
"1. IntroductionAs COVID-19 spread across the world and the United States in 2020, people greatly reduced their mobility, stayed more at home, and spent less time producing and consuming products and services that require face-to-face interactions. These changes, caused by both voluntary behavior and various mitigation policies, have also severely damaged the economy. What are the labor market consequences of lockdowns and mobility restrictions? And can information technology (IT) mitigate these adverse effects? For everyone?This paper analyzes the interplay between the sudden decline in mobility, its effect on the labor market, and firms’ adoption of IT in the US. It relies on several data sources, and in particular on survey data covering software and hardware purchases in 2016 for almost three million establishments in differentindustries.Firm-level IT adoption can strengthen or dampen the effect of mobility on economic outcomes in several ways. On the one hand, IT adoption can cushion the impact of the pandemic by facilitating work-from-home or contact-less interactions (Bloom, 2020,Brynjolfsson, Horton, Ozimek, Rock, Sharma, TuYe, 2020,Papanikolaou, Schmidt, 2020) and by increasing online sales. IT adoption can facilitate online job search, which may be particularly important when physical mobility is reduced. Availability of IT investments and capabilities may also spur the creation of new digital-intensive jobs. On the other hand, the pandemic may reinforce the substitution of labor with technology for ex-ante heavy IT adopters (Chernoff and Warman, 2020). High-technology adopting firms may be more inclined to automate processes when the pandemic spreads as humans would be at risk of contracting the virus.We find that IT adoption significantly shields workers from the economic consequences of the pandemic.Fig. 1illustrates the increase in the unemployment rate between February and April 2020 for each US state and the decline in mobility during the same period. In low-IT adoption states, there is a strong correlation between the drop in mobility and the rise in the unemployment rate. Conversely, mobility is not associated with rising unemployment rates in states with higher IT adoption. Anevent studyempirical design confirms this finding and illustrate that states hit more harshly by the pandemic and states with more IT adoption werenotexperience different pre-pandemic trend in unemployment.Download :Download high-res image (243KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. Unemployment and Mobility in the US. This figure plots the change in the unemployment rate between February and April by state on the average change in mobility in retail, recreation and transit station in April. The red diamonds represent states where IT adoption is above the median and the blue triangles represent states where IT adoption is below the median. The red line shows the linear fit for high-IT state and the blue line shows the linear fit for low IT states. SeeSection 3andSection 4for more details. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)We present further evidence relying on individual-level data from the CPS (Current Population Survey) respondents and using within-state (MSA-level) variation in IT adoption while controlling for a rich set of various other potential confounding factors, such as the pre-pandemic industry and occupation of the respondent. We find that respondents living in MSAs with a larger drop in mobility are more likely to be unemployed during Spring 2020 (controlling for pre-pandemic unemployment), but the impact of mobility is less pronounced among MSAs where IT was adopted more intensely.Importantly, we provide causal estimates on the mitigating role of firms’ IT adoption on local labor markets thanks to aninstrumental variableapproach. IT adoption can be correlated (and caused by) several local characteristics, such as availability of human capital. While we control for various potential confounding factors, such as the level of education, we cannot rule out that unobservable characteristics are driving the mitigating impact of IT. We thus followAutor et al. (2003)by instrumenting regional-level IT adoption by its historical routine employment share. In regions where historically more routine workers were employed, IT adoption has been faster and stronger when the price of IT equipment fell and routine workers could be replaced by technology. Because of path-dependency, even today IT adoption is higher in areas where historically the routine employment share was higher than in other regions. Instrumental variable regressions confirm our OLS estimates: the impact of the mobility drop on unemployment probability is lower in areas where IT is adopted more intensely by firms. This points toward IT playing a causal role in mitigating adverse employment outcomes during a pandemic.We quantify the effect of IT adoption relative to a counterfactual scenario in which the pandemic had hit the world five years earlier. The digital economy as a share of employment grew by around 10% relative to five years before (seeSection 5.2for details). Combining this number with our regression results, we find that the unemployment rate would have been around 2 percentage points higher during April and May 2020 if IT adoption would have been at the level of 2015. Instead of an unemployment rate of 14% the unemployment rate would have reached 16%.1The recent literature (seeSection 2for a brief review) has argued that the economic consequences of COVID-19–especially at its onset–were significantly more severe for more economically vulnerable individuals, such as women, racial minorities, immigrants, and individuals with lower educational attainment. IT adoption may also have a heterogeneous impact along those dimensions. For instance, information technology can be a complement for skilled labor, while it may substitute unskilled labor. If the COVID-19 shock promotes further automation of production processes, and more so for more IT intensive companies, then it may differentially impact women or men according to which industry is subject to the greatest changes (e.g.manufacturing sectorpredominantly employs male workers). Minorities have been experiencing COVID deaths and infections at higher rates (Kirby, 2020); an occupational distribution skewed towards occupations requiring in-person contacts is a main potential culprit. Therefore, IT adoption, by facilitating the delivery of contactless services and goods, may help individuals employed in these risky occupations.The effect of IT adoption in shielding workers is consistent across most groups. We show that both males and females as well as individuals of different races benefit from IT adoption. However, we find a striking difference in the way IT adoption shields individuals with heterogeneous levels of educational attainment. Individuals with high-and medium levels of education significantly benefit from IT adoption, while individuals with low educational attainment (those who did not complete high school) are not shielded by IT. These findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic increasesinequalityacross educational groups through skill-biased technical change. This is consistent with evidence from past recessions when low-skilled individuals were disproportionately affected, which further reduced complementary IT skills and persistently widened inequality (Heathcote et al., 2020).Finally, we investigate the role of different channels in explaining the shielding effect of IT. We find that local IT adoption is strongly correlated with measures of the feasibility of working from home (Dingel and Neiman, 2020). We find that local IT adoption and the ability to work from home are both independently shielding the economy from a local mobility shock, but the role of local IT is significantly reduced when local working-from-home ability is controlled for. This suggests that part of the shielding impact of IT is due to high IT firms having facing lower disruption in the shift to work from home, but other forces are also at play. Conversely, we find no significant role for local firms’ access to e-commerce technologies.Local unemployment can be impacted by both job destruction andjob creation. The pandemic depressed job creation both because of lowerlabor demandand because mobility restrictions limited firms and workers ability to meet in person, potentially worsening labor market search frictions. To shed more light on the importance of IT adoption for the job creation margin, we study how online job postings respond to the pandemic and to local IT adoption. We find that during Spring 2020, job postings declined more in MSAs that suffered a larger drop in mobility, but this decline was less pronounced in high-IT MSAs. This shielding impact of IT is present only for job postings that relate to digital-intensive occupations and not for other jobs. Thus, a further reason why IT shielded local labor markets from the impact of the pandemic was that it protected firms’ ability to create vacancies for digital jobs. These results suggest that IT adoption improved firms’ ability to adjust job creation in a flexible and dynamic manner and highlight the role that local IT played in facilitating the transition to a more digital economy during the early stages of the pandemic.We finally test for the importance of local demand spillover–which can be a source of general equilibrium effects at the local level–by testing whether IT shields local-level employment in tradable or non-tradable industries (Mian and Sufi, 2014). We find no mitigating role of local IT for non-tradable industries, suggesting a minor role for such spillovers.The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. InSection 2we present a brief literature review. InSection 3we describe the data. InSection 4we illustrate state-level patterns. InSection 5we present evidence (including IV estimates) on the mitigating role of IT using individual-level data. InSection 6we investigate the potential channels through which IT shields and inSection 7we conclude.",Myrto,Nicola,Yannick
"1. IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic and the containment measures put in place by governments caused severe disruptions to labor markets all around the world during 2020 and 2021. In the US and the UK, two years after the beginning of the pandemic,labor demandhas recovered and is exceptionally high, with vacancies well above early-2020 levels. However, employment has not yet fully recouped the losses from the first months of the pandemic. One possible explanation for this unusual coexistence of sluggish employment and tight labor markets is the heterogeneous impact of the COVID-19 shock, which may have generated significant misalignment between the sectors in which the jobless search for work–such as the hard-hit retail andhospitalityindustries–and those where most vacancies are–such as the ICT sector and thoseindustriesthat have benefited from increased digitalization and shifting consumption patterns. This paper assesses the extent to which such mismatch has indeed played a significant role for US and UK labor market dynamics from the onset of COVID-19 until the fourth quarter of 2021.The unprecedented impact of COVID-19 on labor markets has been the subject of research since very early on in the pandemic (Petrosky-Nadeau and Valletta, 2020). Since past recessions have been aligned with waves of structural transformation and reallocation of employment across sectors (Cortes, Jaimovich, Nekarda, Siu, 2020,Jaimovich, Siu, 2020), some studies have suggested that a similar process could take place in the aftermath of COVID-19 (Barrero, Bloom, Davis, 2020,Basso, Boeri, Caiumi, Paccagnella, 2020). Lending support to this hypothesis, in both the US and the UK, several studies highlight the large disparities in the vulnerability of different sectors anddemographicgroups to the pandemic and containment measures (Adams-Prassl, Boneva, Golin, Rauh, 2020,Albanesi, Kim, 2021,Cortes, Forsythe, 2020,Cribb, Waters, Wernham, Xu, 2021,Powell, Francis-Devine,Shibata, 2021). Salient dimensions of heterogeneity across sectors during the pandemic, which may portend longer-term shifts, have been the ability to work remotely (Dingel and Neiman, 2020), and the need for in-person interaction (Famiglietti, Leibovici, Santacreu, 2020,Kaplan, Moll, Violante, 2020). However, two years after the pandemic began, it remains unclear how persistent heterogeneity along these characteristics is, whether such shifts have in fact taken place on a large scale, and whether the labor force was able to adjust smoothly to them.Structural reallocation often entails a period of misalignment between labor supply and labor demand across sectors, which would in turn increase frictions in the process of matching workers with firms. In this paper, we thus examine: (i) whether COVID-19 has generated labor market mismatch, in particular in comparison to the 2008–2009 Global Financial Crisis (GFC), and (ii) to what extent mismatch can explain the coexistence of tight labor markets and sluggish employment recoveries as of 2021Q4 in the US and the UK.To this end, we apply and extend the approach proposed byŞahin et al. (2014)to measure labor market mismatch and its contribution to employment dynamics in the two countries since the beginning of COVID-19. The framework is intuitive and lends itself well to inspecting labor market developments in the aftermath of the pandemic. The resulting mismatch index reports the fraction of hires that are foregone due to misalignment in the distribution of searchers and vacancies.Job creationwould be impaired if the unemployed mostly searched for work in shrinking industries while vacancies in growing sectors remained unfilled. For COVID-19, this could be the case if, for instance, the majority of workers are laid off from contact-intensive jobs while jobs with greater ability to work remotely expand, but workers fail to transition smoothly from the former to the latter.We extend the framework ofŞahin et al. (2014)in several directions that are salient for the COVID-19 recession. First, we compute the baseline measure of mismatch until late 2021, which allows us to compare the developments ensuing the COVID-19 pandemic to the aftermath of the GFC. Second, we consider COVID-specific aspects of heterogeneity by computing mismatch when grouping sectors according to their ability to work remotely and their contact intensity. Third, given the large outflows from the labor force witnessed in the first months of the pandemic, we quantify the implication of mismatch for the employment rate rather than just the unemployment rate. Fourth, for the US we exclude the temporary-layoff unemployed from our baseline measure of job seekers, as their search behavior differs markedly from that of the permanent-layoff unemployed. Finally, motivated by the peculiarities of the COVID-19 recession, such as the unprecedented rise in temporary layoffs in the US and the millions of workers covered by the government’s job protection scheme in the UK, we compute mismatch considering a broad set of alternative pools of job seekers.Our main result is that, while mismatch grew sharply at the onset of COVID-19 in both the US and the UK, this rise was shorter-lived and, in the case of the US, smaller than during the GFC. Consequently, the employment loss due to the rise in mismatch was smaller during the COVID-19 crisis than during the GFC in both countries. Moreover, we find that mismatch across a broad aggregation of sectors grouped by teleworkability and contact intensity does not overturn this result and, somewhat surprisingly, we find that under this alternative grouping mismatch did not rise in the UK. These results are robust to considering alternative pools of job seekers, such as adding marginally attached or furloughed workers or including temporarily laid-off workers, and also to computing “effective searchers” to account for the possibility that the unemployed may search beyond their original industries. With regards to the second question, on the extent to which labor market mismatch can explain the coexistence of tight labor markets and sluggish employment recoveries as of 2021Q4, we find that sectoral mismatch accounts for about 10 percent of the existing employment gap as of late 2021 in both countries.1This finding suggests that, at least over 2020–2021, COVID-19 did not set in motion a large wave of structural reallocation involving significant frictions in the matching process between workers and firms. Therefore, the strong heterogeneity in the initial exposure of different sectors to the pandemic likely resulted primarily from the short-run impact of the lockdown measures and contagion risks. As restrictions to economic activity and health concerns receded, labor demand recovered, including in hard-hit industries, and its sectoral composition broadly returned to that of the pre-pandemic period. Reflecting this, those sectors with relatively high vacancy postings by the second half of 2021 turned out to be also those with relatively high numbers of job seekers. This stands in contrast with the GFC, where the downturn was followed by a progressive but eventually persistent contraction of the most affected sectors (manufacturing and construction) and a rise in long-term unemployment for displaced workers.Absent a persistent rise in mismatch, other forces must be slowing the employment recovery, most likely by dampening labor supply. As discussed by recent studies, candidate explanations with empirical support include a persistent rise in inactivity for older workers (Faria e Castro, 2021,Coibion, Gorodnichenko, Weber, 2020), the increased childcare duties falling on mothers of young children (Albanesi, Kim, 2021,Bluedorn, Caselli, Hansen, Shibata, Tavares, 2021,Fabrizio, Gomes, Tavares, 2021,Furman, Kearney, Powell, 2021), and demands for higher pay and better working conditions particularly for workers in low-wage occupations.2Our paper contributes to this debate by finding that about 10 percent of the sluggish labor market recovery is attributed to the mismatch as of late 2021.The rationale for focusing on the US and the UK is two-fold. First, worker-level microdata and series on vacancies by sector are available for both countries with only a short lag, allowing for granular and timely analysis of labor market developments. Second, despite having broadly comparable economic and demographic characteristics, these countries differed substantially in the magnitude of the employment contraction during the first quarters of COVID-19, as shown inFig. 1. In the US (left panel), the employment-to-working age population ratio fell by ten percentage points (p.p.) between January and April 2020. In the UK (right panel), the employment fall was more gradual, reaching a maximum of 2 p.p. in 2021Q1 relative to 2019Q4. At least in part, the widely differentlabor market policiesimplemented during the pandemic, particularly the greater reliance on job retention schemes in the UK, underpin this difference in employment dynamics. With regard to labor market tightness, however, by the second half of 2021, the US and the UK found themselves in very similar situations: In both countries, after a sharp fall early in the pandemic, the vacancies-to-unemployment ratio, also known as labor market tightness, rose above its pre-COVID level. For the US, this pattern holds true regardless of whetherunemployed personson temporary layoff are excluded or included in the measure of the pool of unemployed. Although labor market tightness has declined more sharply once we include temporary layoffs in our measure of the unemployment pool, both measures visibly rose above their pre-COVID levels by mid-2021. Meanwhile, despite this strong recovery in labor demand, employment growth slowed substantially by the beginning of 2021, leaving an employment rate gap vis-à-vis pre-COVID levels.Download :Download high-res image (312KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1.

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)Through this country comparison, our analysis also sheds some light on the appropriateness of policies enacted by governments both to contain the initial employment contraction and to support the ensuing recovery. For instance, in the UK the furlough scheme muted the rise in job destruction and thus diminished the number of job seekers. In the US, while the initial spike in unemployment was predominantly due to temporary layoffs (Hall and Kudlyak, 2022), permanent layoffs also grew and remained high throughout 2020. As the number of temporary-layoffs sharply declined starting in May 2020, the share of unemployment consisting of permanent job losers steadily rose over time, presaging long-lasting scars along the lines of previous “jobless recoveries” caused by waves of structural reallocation.3Despite the different policy approaches, the short-lived nature of the rise in mismatch may have been a contributing factor to the initially quick employment rebound. Moreover, the slowing down of the employment recovery throughout 2021 and the emergence of acute worker shortages in some occupations –like truck drivers– spurred a debate over the need for policies to encourage jobless workers to broaden the set of sectors in which to seek employment.4However, the concurrently low levels of mismatch partly call into question the need for policies focused on labor reallocation relative to more neutral policies supporting higher labor supply.Our paper directly contributes to the study of sectoral reallocation in the aftermath of downturns in advanced economies, with a focus on the COVID-19 recession.Cortes et al. (2020)andJaimovich and Siu (2020)show that the GFC accelerated the decline in manufacturing and clerical jobs in the US, which in turn created a “jobless recovery” as displaced workers were either substituted by labor-saving capital or could not smoothly transition into other sectors. Proposing a new methodology to measure labor market mismatch, the seminal study ofŞahin et al. (2014)found that higher mismatch due to sectoral and occupational reallocation accounted for up to one-third of the rise in the unemployment rate after the GFC. Their framework was also applied to the UK byPatterson et al. (2016), focusing on industries, andTurrell et al. (2021), focusing on occupations. Studying the COVID-19 pandemic through the same approach provides a useful point of comparison with the GFC. We thus contribute to this strand of research by showing that, at least by late 2021, COVID-19 had not triggered as dramatic a structural transformation of the labor market as the GFC did. Although labor demand in certain teleworkable industries rose, this increase did not appear to be large enough to cause major frictions in aggregate job creation.Finally, our work adds to the large number of studies on labor market developments during the pandemic. A non-exhaustive list of those focusing closely on the issue of heterogeneity across demographic groups, sectors, and occupations in the US includesAdams-Prassl et al. (2020);Albanesi and Kim (2021);Coibion et al. (2020a);Cortes and Forsythe (2020);Shibata (2021). Prominent works on the UK includeAdams-Prassl et al. (2020);Carrillo-Tudela et al. (2022);Cribb et al. (2021);Görtz et al. (2021);Powell and Francis-Devine (2021). Our paper is closest toCarrillo-Tudela et al. (2022), who inspect job search patterns across industries and occupations using the UK HouseholdLongitudinal Study. They find that job search during COVID-19 broadly shifted towards less-affected occupations and, to a lesser extent, industries. However, workers from contracting sectors were less likely to target and transition to growing ones, thus suggesting that structural reallocation on the back of the pandemic ultimately remained limited.The rest of this paper is structured as follows.Section 2describes the data sources we use for the analysis.Section 3motivates the work through descriptive evidence on the presence of mismatch after the start of COVID-19.Section 4briefly describes the mismatch framework.Sections 5and6present the main results and the extensions.Section 7concludes.",Carlo,Ippei,None
"1. IntroductionResearchers have documented a rise in earningsinequalityover the past several decades, and a large literature exists that attempts to explain this growth. Potential explanations for higher inequality include immigration, skilled biased technological change, reductions in unionbargaining power, lower purchasing power of the minimum wage, andinternational trade.1Gottschalk and Moffitt (1994)andMoffitt and Gottschalk (1995)were the first to note that one contributing factor to the increase in inequality is a rise in earnings instability. One factor that should affect earnings volatility is the onset of an unforeseen health condition that hinders the effected person's ability to work in the same capacity as before the shock. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how the onset of a work-limiting health condition (i.e. disability) affects male earnings instability.Research shows that male earnings instability/volatility, as measured by the variance of transitory earnings, increased over time, and this increase came in three distinct phases (Moffitt and Zhang, 2018).2Instability first increased from the 1970s to the 1980s. In fact, the rise in the variance of transitory earnings accounts for approximately half of the increase in measured cross-sectional inequality during that period. Instability was then stable from the 1980s until around the beginning of theGreat Recession, after which volatility again rose. Changes in the incidence and costs of involuntary job loss contributed to this overall rise in volatility by approximately 12 to 14% (Stevens, 2001). Earnings instability tends to be higher for African Americans and those with less education (Gittleman and Joyce, 1996), andDelaney and Devereux (2019)provide evidence that increased education causes a decline in volatility.While many studies examine the transitory variance of earnings, how it has changed over time, and how it differs by variousdemographicand labor market characteristics, to our knowledge, no study exists that investigates how the onset of a work-limiting disability influences earnings volatility. Understanding the experiences of disabled individuals is important. Many view the disabled as adisadvantaged group, and understanding their experiences helps in learning of the changing nature of inequality (Haveman and Wolfe, 1990).DeLeire (2000)notes how the disabled may be less productive and/or face substantial barriers in the labor market. Some evidence suggests that the disabled suffer from wage discrimination (Johnson and Lambrinos, 1985;Baldwin and Johnson, 1994;DeLeire, 2001). In fact, theAmericans with Disabilities Actof 1990 may have increased the cost of hiring the working-aged disabled, thereby lowering employment rates for this group (DeLeire, 2000).Current research on work-limiting disabilities suggests that the onset of this type of health limitation should alter earnings instability. Work-limiting disabilities are associated with permanent losses to labor earnings and large reductions in hours worked (Stephens, 2001;Charles, 2003;Mok et al., 2008;Meyer and Mok, 2019). Evidence suggests that even 10 years after onset, the level of earnings remains 15 to 24% below what would have been earned in the absence of the disability. These financial losses translate into large downward movements in the earnings and income distributions (Nagi and Hadley, 1972;Jolly, 2013). Furthermore, disability is a fluid concept, particularly with regards to the degree to which it can limit the amount and type of work that the effected individual can perform. For example,Meyer and Mok (2019)provide evidence showing that only 65% of those reporting a non-severe disability during the previous two years will report being non-severely disabled in the current year, and 25% will report not being disabled. Therefore, as individuals transition across disability statuses or through varying degrees of work-limitation, they may alter the types of jobs held and/or the amount of work done within the same job. This would lead to changes in earnings instability over time around the date of initial disability onset.In this paper, we use data on male household heads from the 1970 to 2013 survey waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). We separate men into two samples based upon their disability status and decompose each sample's labor earnings into its permanent and transitory components. To do so, we use a semi-parametric error components model developed byMoffitt and Zhang (2018). Results show that the variance of transitory earnings for the non-disabled is similar to that of the disabled before the onset of the health condition. Upon onset, volatility increases substantially and does not return to pre-onset levels until five years after the last reported disability. When examining the calendar-year trend in instability between the two groups, we find that volatility is nearly always higher for the disabled and has a steeper slope. In other words, earnings instability has increased faster for the disabled relative to their non-disabled counterparts. This finding is more pronounced among those who are younger at onset.Only investigating individual labor earnings ignores three important factors: severe disabilities that require full withdrawal from the labor market; spousal labor supply responses; and governmenttransfer paymentsdesigned to assist the disabled. To account for these three factors, the entire analysis is replicated using total family income. Results from this replication also show a steeper trend in income instability for the disabled relative to the non-disabled. Therefore, the main results persist. Additional findings from this replication suggest that other sources of income help to mitigate the negative effect disability has on income instability. However, this is only true for those who are older at onset.The paper proceeds by discussing the data and empirical methodology inSection 2.Section 3presents the results, andSection 4offers concluding remarks.",Nicholas,Kathryn,None
"2. DataThis paper uses employer–employee panel data from the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS), that covers all formal private-sector workers.8Employers must legally report wages, separations, and new hires to the IMSS. This reporting process is remote and, accordingly, this dataset's methodology and coverage were not affected by the pandemic. Thus, these records became a key source of information during the pandemic.9The administrative records I used in this paper start in 2005. For each worker, it is possible to know the age, sex, wage, municipality,industry, as well as a unique employer and employee ID.10Several features of this dataset make it especially suitable for a cohort-based analysis: first, this dataset is an employer and employee panel. This allows me to know each worker's complete formal employment history; second, this is a census-type dataset, which allows me to compare groups that differ by a few years of work experience or age; third, I can estimate total and firm-specific experience (commonly called “tenure”).2.1. Data limitationsConcerning the IMSS records, it is important to bear in mind some potentially important caveats: I cannot estimate the entry date for anyone before 2006, nor the time spent in the informal labor market. I also cannot see a worker's educational attainment, time ofgraduation, or occupation. In the following paragraphs, I discuss the actions I took to minimize any bias arising from these limitations.IMSS administrative data starts in January 2005, and it is possible to follow workers after that date. I follow the literature that uses panel data to study entrants (seeGertler et al., 2022andAlbagli et al., 2022) and define entrants as those workers who first appear in the IMSS dataset one year after the first observation in my dataset (January 2006).A significant limitation of the IMSS data is the lack of information regarding the informal market: after all, informal work can provide meaningful human capital accumulation. To reduce any potential bias caused by this unobservable variable, I restrict my sample to individuals who began their first formal employment very young (I vary the definition of “young” as a robustness check). By doing so, I minimize the likelihood that workers in my sample may have a significant employment history in the informal market.A second concern regarding informal employment is that I have no information regarding what happens to a worker once they lose their formal job. Therefore, I simply state that the individuals are not formally employed when they are not in the dataset. Having a formal job is an outcome of interest in itself because it is associated with increased productivity, tax revenues, and wages (Ohnsorge and Yu, 2022).Regarding the lack of information regarding workers’ education, college-educated workers are less likely to experience skill obsolescence and are less vulnerable to technological changes (Rothstein, 2021). Therefore, this group would be ideal to study. Nonetheless, as I cannot observe education, I study the worker more likely to have just finished college: those who get their first formal full-time job at 22 years of age. This is the most common age of completing college coursework in Mexico, and graduation before age of 22 is extremely rare (Mexican College Census, ANUIES).11Accordingly, the unit of study in this paper is the cohort which is defined as those workers who entered the formal labor market for the first time in a given year while being 22 years old. I recognize that I could have used a different and equally reasonable cohort definition (for example, 19 years old, which is the typical high school graduation age), but the conclusions of this paper are not particularly sensitive to changing this definition as long as the treatment group entered the labor market after the control group.A related issue is the possibility of endogenous labor market entry. That is, some workers might choose when to join the labor market depending on the state of the labor market, creating large group differences. I test for endogenous graduation timing following the tests proposed bySchwandt and von Wachter (2019;Appendix A3) and find no large effects.Finally, although there is no information on occupation, I attempt to make indirect approximations (for example, industry-by-firms’ wage quintile fixed effects) to control for such differences. This result is in the Appendix (Table A2.4).",Daniel,None,None
"1. IntroductionSocial mobility addresses the link between family origins and later social and economic life outcomes (Chetty et al., 2014). The common normative interpretation is that higher levels of social mobility reflect a fairer society with more equality of opportunity, while the opposite is the case when life chances are strongly determined by circumstances of birth (Erikson and Goldthorpe, 1992). In political and public discourse, it is generally taken as self-evident that education promotes social mobility, because more educated individuals are more likely to attain better paid and higher status jobs (Heckman et al., 2018;Wolf, 2002). Thus, education is frequently presented as ‘the great leveller’, enabling children from all backgrounds to fulfil their potential, regardless of the constraints imposed by the material conditions of their economic origins. Academically selective schooling is often proposed as an effective system of education for achieving meritocratic advancement (Department for Education, 2016). This is because, in theory at least, able children from disadvantaged backgrounds can access the higher quality teaching, facilities, and positive peer influences that have historically been found in academically selective schools (Betts, 2011;Boliver and Swift, 2011). Conversely, proponents of comprehensive schools contend that academically selective systems will hinder social mobility due toinequalityof access and resources across school types (Benn and Simon, 1971).In this paper, we provide new evidence on the link between schooling systems and social mobility. We analyse the link between the extent of selective schooling in an area and the level of intergenerationalsocial classmobility, for children born in England between 1956 and 1972. England provides an ideal case study for this purpose because it transitioned from fully selective secondary schooling to a predominantly mixed ability system over a short time frame (Bolton, 2020). Additionally, the timing of the transition from a selective to a mixed ability system occurred differentially by area. Under the selective system, pupils were allocated to an academically-focussed ‘grammar’ school, if they passed an ability test taken at 10 or 11 years, or to a ‘secondary modern’ school or technical college if they did not pass. This‘selective schooling system’ was gradually replaced by a mixed ability, or‘comprehensive schooling system’, in which selection on ability for school admissions is prohibited. This shift from academic selection to a mixed ability system remains politically controversial, with proponents of selective schools contending that their decline resulted in social mobility, particularly of the ‘long range’ variety, grinding to a halt (Mansfield, 2019). Proponents of comprehensive schools, on the other hand, have made the opposite claim, if not quite as loudly; that comprehensivisation should increase upward mobility by providing a better quality education for less advantaged pupils (Benn and Simon, 1971;Gamoran, 2009;Gamoran and Berends, 1987;Oakes, 1985). As recently as 2017, the Conservative government was elected on a manifesto that pledged to overturn the legal ban on new grammar schools with the explicitly stated objective of increasing social mobility (“Britain the great meritocracy” Prime Minister's speech, 2016). And, although that pledge was not implemented, the policy remains popular amongst many MPs and commentators.We identify the effects of the schooling system on social mobility by exploiting the differential decline in selective system schools across English local areas, using data from the Office for National StatisticsLongitudinal Study(LS). The LS is a 1% sample drawn from five decennial censuses in England and Wales spanning the period 1971 to 2011, which is also linked to administrative data on births, deaths and cancer registrations. These data allow us to construct measures of occupational social class mobility for a representative sample of over 90,000 people in England tracked over five decades. We link social mobility outcomes in the LS to an administrative dataset containing information on the proportion of pupils attending selective system schools in each of 145 Local Education Authorities (LEA) for the years 1967 to 1983. This enables us to relate the extent of selective system schooling to rates of intergenerational social mobility within these areas. To identify selective schooling effects, we use a two-wayfixed effectsspecification with social mobility as the outcome; controls for area- and time-specific effects; and treatment variables which are a function of the share of pupils in selective system schooling in an area at a given time. A causal interpretation of the link between the share of pupils in selective system schooling and social mobility relies on the assumption that the variation in selective system schooling across LEAs is as good as random after accounting for LEA characteristics and time trends.Our results show that individuals living in areas with a higher concentration of selective system schools had lower rates of absolute and relative social mobility over the period of observation, although these effects are small and become statistically indistinguishable from zero after adjusting for area and cohort fixed effects. We consider the plausibility of both the identification strategy and estimation assumptions, and show that our findings are robust to a range of sensitivity checks. Overall, our results indicate that, once local characteristics and secular changes to themacroeconomicenvironment are taken into account, there is little evidence that selective or comprehensive schooling systems shape aggregate social mobility outcomes. While unadjusted correlations do show small positive effects on social mobility from the shift to a comprehensive system, these effects are not statistically distinguishable from zero after adjustment for cohort trends. Although our central estimate of the effect of school system on social mobility is zero, we cannot rule out small effects due to limitations of sample size. However, even a change from 100% to 0% selectivity would be expected to have, at most, modest effects on social mobility based on our estimates.Our analysis provides important advances in our understanding of how school selectivity is related to social mobility. Much of the current evidence on the effects of selective schooling uses discontinuity-basedstudy designsto compare social and educational outcomes of pupils ‘just passing’ the test to enter an academically selective school with those who ‘just miss out’ (Abdulkadiroglu et al., 2014;Beuermann and Jackson, 2020). Evidence in the UK has found, at most, small positive effects on later test scores of attending a grammar school, and larger positive effects on years of completed education (Clark, 2010;Clark and Del Bono, 2016). These types of study design yield a causal effect of attending an academically selective school for themarginal applicant. However, selecting a subset of students for entry into academically selective schools modifies peer groups and school environments for all pupils, not only those attending academic schools. Hence, for policy purposes, the key question is how to design the broader assignment mechanism which matches pupils to schools, whether that be by ability, geography, ability-to-pay, and the consequences of that system for the full population of pupils (Dickson and Macmillan, 2020). Our study addresses this by estimating the net effects of the schooling system as a whole, rather than for those attending grammar school only. Most studies also consider the effect of school system on proximal outcomes such as test scores (Atkinson et al., 2004;Gorard and Siddiqui, 2018;Sullivan et al., 2014), university admission (Mansfield, 2019) andincome inequality(Burgess et al., 2020), rather than social mobility itself. We directly estimate the association between the extent of school selectivity in an area and the degree of intergenerational social mobility of its residents.Disentangling the effects of schooling systems from other factors which influence social mobility is challenging because of non-random selection of pupils into school types (Manning and Pischke, 2006). Existing studies of schooling in England have relied on cross-sectional variation to study the consequences of selective schooling (Atkinson et al., 2004;Boliver and Swift, 2011;Burgess et al., 2020;Galindo-Rueda and Vignoles, 2007). However, caution is warranted in interpreting such research designs which rely on between-pupil variation in the treatment only, as it is difficult to rule out bias from unobserved confounding. Our study builds on these existing studies by exploiting both cross-sectional and over-time variation in the extent of selective schooling, requiring less strong assumptions for a causal interpretation.

InSection 3, the institutional setting is described.Section 4presents the data and summary statistics of our key variables.Section 5sets out the empirical strategy.

"1. IntroductionThe changing demand for labor in different segments of the labor market is a key topic in social science and in the public debate. SinceAutor et al. (2003), much of the research in this field has analyzed the process through the lens of a task-based framework which emphasizes task- and occupation-specific possibilities of automation. A salient pattern documented across countries and settings is that employment has grown in the highest-paid and the lowest-paid occupations whereas employment has declined in occupations in the middle of the wage distribution (Acemoglu, Autor, 2011,Autor, Levy, Murnane, 2003,Goos, Manning, 2007,Goos, Manning, Salomons, 2009,Goos, Manning, Salomons, 2014,Spitz-Oener, 2006andAdermon and Gustavsson, 2015). The finding of suchpolarizationis important for understanding the relationship between the changing occupational employment structure and wageinequalitybut it is less informative about the changing demand for different types of skills. In this paper, we generate new evidence on the relationship between changing occupational structure and the demand for skills covering both the cognitive and non-cognitive domains.The favored explanation in the literature for the polarization patterns of the recent past is that technological change has induced a sharp decline in the demand for routine-intensive tasks traditionally performed by occupations in the middle of the wage distribution (Acemoglu, Autor, 2011,Autor, Levy, Murnane, 2003,Böhm, 2020,Cortes, 2016,Goos, Manning, Salomons, 2009,Goos, Manning, Salomons, 2014,Michaels, Natraj, Van Reenen, 2014). In this article, we do not challenge this view, instead we complement it by characterizing occupations by theskill-setof the employees (instead of the tasks they perform) in affected occupations. We present what we believe to be the most detailed description yet of how structural change in the form of occupational decline has altered the demand for different types of skills. The aim is to provide input to the vivid policy debate regarding which skills will be demanded on the labor markets of the future.To this end, we use very detailed Swedish skills data for nearly all male Swedish workers. The data capture pre-market endowments of eight different intellectual skill components, where four capture non-cognitive productive traits and four capture cognitive abilities. Each of these specific skills are valued across the market and could be considered as “general-purpose” skills that can be transferred across tasks. But as workers with different skills are sorted into different occupations (seeFredriksson et al. (2018)), the skills map well into the “skill-weights” approach ofLazear (2009)where skills are general, but used in different intensities in different parts of the labor market.Throughout our paper, we relate theinitial(2001) worker endowments of traits and abilities within each occupation to the employment growth across time (2001−2013). As an important prelude, we first show that the skill-use within occupations has remained stable across time, despite the changing task content documented by, e.g.,Spitz-Oener (2006)andAtalay et al. (2020). Furthermore, we show that occupations with high-skilled employees pay higher wages, but, at the same time, there is substantial wage variation across occupations with similarskill levels. The wedge between skills and wages may arise because our skill measures are broad in the intellectual dimension but leave out all other wage-related attributes, e.g., manual strength, the ability to cope with hazardouswork environments, rent sharing practices and/or other types of specific knowledge that may be acquired through on-the-job learning.Our main analysis conveys three main insights: First, employment growth in the recent past has had amonotonic positive relationshipto occupation-specific endowments of the intellectual skills we measure, despite the polarizing relationship to occupation-specific wages. We show that this result is robust to using other direct skill measures (grades from school for men and women) and to many variations in measurement and definitions - including an analysis of how skills and wages relate to the growth oflabor demandat the establishment times occupation level.1Our analysis unravels the previously undocumented fact that the low-wage occupations that have grown are those that employ comparatively skilled workers. Conversely, the (routine intensive) occupations in the middle of the wage distribution that have declined are those that employ comparatively low-skilled workers. In other words, labor demand has moved away from average-paying occupations with relatively low-skilled employees to lower-paying jobs with relatively high skilled (within the wage-segment) employees. The fact that workers in mid-wage routine occupations appear to have comparatively low skills in our measured dimensions may help explain why these workers tend to struggle to find new employment after displacement as shown by e.g.Bliena et al. (2021).The second insight is that occupational decline is systematically related to workers’ specificcomparativeadvantages. We find important differences across different types of cognitive and non-cognitive skills. There has been a particularly strong growth in occupations employing workers with higher-than-average levels of the non-cognitive skillsocial maturity(i.e. extroversion, responsibility and independence) - andtwoof the four cognitive skills -verbalcomprehension andtechnicalability. These results suggest that the labor demand increased in occupations that rely on social communication and technical abilities. We also show that these skills tend to be used less in routine-task intensive occupations. At the other end of the scale, occupations where workers primarily rely onpsychological energy(a non-cognitive trait capturing perseverance and the ability to focus) andinductivereasoning (a cognitive ability related to pattern recognition) have declined. These results complementEdin et al. (2022)who document a secular increase in the wage returns to non-cognitive skills relative to cognitive skills. Our results suggest that the key empirical difference in terms of occupational decline is not between occupations that rely on cognitive vs. non-cognitive skills, but between occupations that rely on differenttypesof cognitive and non-cognitive skills. Our results are thus more aligned withDeming (2017)who found that labor demand is shifting towards a combination of communication-related skills (in our case social and verbal ability) and math-skills (in our case, more specifically, technical abilities.)The third insight is more tentative. We cautiously interpret our results as suggesting that the evolution in the recent past may be informative about the skill-specific demand for labor also in the not-so-distant future. As in most of the literature, our main analysis focuses on the recent past. But since it has been argued that future technological advances will affect a much broader set of tasks, and hence different types of workers (see e.g.Mitchell and Brynjolfsson (2017)), we end the paper by providing results on the relationship between observed occupational skills andprojected futureoccupational employment growth from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. We show that the overall skill levelandthe same specific skills that were positively related to past employment growth are positively related to future employment growth according to the BLS projections. Thus, the BLS projections do not indicate that empirical lessons from the recent past should be invalid when discussing the skill-specific impact of future changes in labor demand as has been argued byMitchell and Brynjolfsson (2017)and others. On the contrary, the current trends are likely to continue if (and we acknowledge that this is a big “if”) the BLS projections are reasonably accurate, as they have been in the past; seeEdin et al. (2018).We complement this analysis with an even more tentative analysis where we use assessments of how difficult tasks in different occupations are to automate based on “engineering bottlenecks” as computed byFrey and Osborne (2017)and three measures of task-replacingpatentswithin each occupation taken fromWebb (2019). The results suggest that skilled occupations are more likely to be insulated from automation by more “engineering bottlenecks” and covered by fewer task-replacing patents related to Robots and Software. For AI-patents the picture is somewhat different as these tend to be related to high-wage tasks as noted byWebb (2019)and these tasks are also more skill intensive on average. But we show that skilled occupations are less exposed to AI-patentsconditional on the wage. Thus, although high-wage jobs are in general more exposed to AI-patents, our results imply that tasks-replacing AI-patents are more likely to negatively affect jobs that pay high wages for other reasons than those related to our vector of cognitive and non-cognitive skills.2The paper is structured as follows:Section 2reviews the literature.Section 3presents the data and the methods.Section 4presents the results.Section 5concludes the paper.

"1. IntroductionHow labor market concentration affects wages has been the subject of a burgeoning literature in recent years. Many papers have shown that a substantial proportion of individuals are employed in labor markets that are at least moderately concentrated according to the thresholds defined by the US Horizontal Merger Guidelines and that this has a depressing effect on wages, consistent with amonopsonymodel - see e.g.Azar et al. (2020);OECD (2022).However, the channels through which labor market concentration affects wages are still poorly understood. In particular, is the effect concentrated on new hires or does it also affect incumbents, i.e. individuals who were already employed in one of the establishments of their current firm the year before? If the elasticity of new hires’ wages with respect to labor market concentration is large enough, it could in principle account for the entire effect estimated in the literature, all the more that new hires represent a substantial part of the workforce in manyOECDcountries - on average 20% in the OECD and as much as 27% in the USA.1If this were the case though, it would imply that labor market concentration affects wages only at the margin, i.e. for individuals who change job. For a given individual, the downward pressure on wages experienced when concentration is high would then only be transitory, since most new hires eventually become incumbents. If, in contrast, incumbents’ wages are also negatively impacted by labor market concentration, this entails that the core of the labor force is affected and that individuals may suffer the negative effects of concentration in the labor market all along their career.In this paper, we use French data to estimate the effect of labor market concentration on total wages2and decompose it into its effects on new hires and incumbents separately. Our contribution is twofold.First, we provide estimates of wage elasticities with respect to labor market concentration that are not confounded by the effect of establishment-level productivity or product market competition. While these two factors likely correlate both with labor market concentration and wages, most papers in the literature do not control for them. Two noticeable exceptions areBenmelech et al. (2022)andMarinescu et al. (2021). The former control for establishment-level productivity but restrict their analysis to themanufacturing sector. To the extent that they focus on tradable goods whose market is not mainly local, they validly control for product market competition by including firm-by-timefixed effects.Marinescu et al. (2021)consider all sectors of the economy and control for productivity using covariates at the firm level. As a result, they do not take into account differences in productivity that may correlate with labor market concentration and wages at the more disaggregate (establishment) level where wages are observed. In this paper, we control for establishment-level productivity and product market competition in the strictest possible way, by including establishment-by-time fixed effects. Thus doing, we provide estimates of the elasticities of total, incumbents’ and new hires’ wages that are not affected by changes in plant efficiency and competitive pressure in downstream markets over time.Our second contribution is to decompose the overall impact of labor market concentration on total wages. To do so, we estimate the elasticities of new hires’ and incumbents’ wages separately. If concentration in the labor market reduces workers’ outside options, we expect the former to be negative. For the same reason, we also expect the latter to be negative, to the extent that incumbents’bargaining powerwill be weaker.3We show, however, that the overall effect of labor market concentration on total wages is not the weighted sum of these two elasticities. By making outside options scarcer, labor market concentration indeed affects worker flows. This should mechanically reduce the probability that a worker be a new hire rather than an incumbent. How this affects total wages ultimately depends on the relative level of wages of new hires as compared to incumbents: if new hires are better paid than incumbents, this third component will negatively affect total wages; if, in contrast, incumbents’ wages are higher than those of new hires, it will dampen the negative effect of labor market concentration on total wages. To our knowledge, we are the first to provide such a decomposition, thereby enhancing our understanding of the different channels through which labor market concentration affects worker flows and wages.4We find that the point estimate of the effect of labor marker concentration on total wages ranges from -0.0244 to -0.0267 depending on the instrument we use. The elasticity of incumbents’ wages ranges from -0.0185 to -0.0230, i.e. between about two thirds and three quarters of the elasticity we estimate for new hires. We show that the effect of labor market concentration on incumbents is not due to the persistence of the effect that concentration had at the time they were hired since our results are robust to the inclusion of a match-specific fixed effect. Our estimates suggest that the effect of labor market concentration on new hires’ wages accounts for 30% to 34% of the overall effect on total wages, according to the instrument we use. The effect on incumbents’ wages accounts for 74% to 70% and is therefore far from negligible. The sum of both effects is slightly larger than 100% since labor market concentration reduces the probability that workers’ be new hires. Since we find that incumbents’ wages are higher than new hires’ wages, this dampens the negative effect of labor market concentration on total wages by a small 4%.Our paper belongs to the growing literature estimating the effect of labor market concentration on wages - see e.g.Arnold (2021);Azar et al. (2019b);Benmelech et al. (2022);Dodini et al. (2020);Hafner (2021);Martins (2018);Qiu and Sojourner (2022);Rinz (2022);Schubert et al. (2021). We provide a new estimate of the wage elasticity that is not confounded by the effect of product market competition nor by establishment productivity. Our findings point to a significant degree of employers’ monopsony power in France.We also contribute to the literature investigating the effects of labor market concentration on specific groups of workers and, in particular, new hires and incumbents. For the USA, using vacancy data,Azar et al. (2022)estimate an elasticity of posted wages with respect to labor market concentration of -0.12, without controlling for either productivity or product market competition. Focusing on new hires in France,Marinescu et al. (2021)find a wage elasticity as large as -0.05 in their preferred specification where they control for productivity and product market competition through firm-level observables. We improve on these estimates by controlling in a stricter way for these two potential confounders. Beyond looking at the effect on average market wages,Arnold (2021)also focuses on incumbents and shows that mergers and acquisitions that lead to higher concentration have a negative effect on the wages of employees who stay in the firms that have merged. We estimate the effect of labor market concentration on the wages of incumbents employed in all types of companies, not only those that have merged. The paper closest to ours isThoresson (2021). She considers the impact of a reform of the Statemonopolyover pharmacies in Sweden on the wages of new hires and incumbents. In 2009, entry barriers were removed and a majority of state-owned pharmacies were privatized, thereby increasing the number of employers on the market for the corresponding industry-specific skills.Thoresson (2021)finds no effect of this reform on the wages of new hires in the pharmacy sector. In contrast, incumbents’ wages increased with elasticities to concentration ranging between -0.02 and -0.05. Our paper enlarges the scope of the analysis by considering the impact of labor market concentration on both new hires’ and incumbents’ wages in all sectors of the economy. Moreover, we determine how much of the overall effect of labor market concentration on total wages is due to the impact on the wages of each category of workers, and how much is due to the effect on worker flows, which has never been investigated so far.The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.Section 2lays out our empirical strategy and derives the decomposition of the effect of labor market concentration on total wages.Section 3describes the data we use and presents summary statistics.Section 4presents the results andSection 5concludes.",Andrea,Cyprien,Eve
"1. IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in early 2020 has led to a global health emergency and the imposition of restrictive measures (e.g. strict lockdowns, domestic and international travel restrictions and bans, social distancing, isolation, contact-tracing) for the containment of the rapid spread of the virus. The upheaval in the labour markets around the globe was imminent and at massive scale, and has persisted to a large extent since then. The nascent literature examining the labour market implications of the COVID-19 shock has provided some first robust evidence on its unequal effects on the employment, earnings and hiring rates of workers with differentdemographicor other characteristics (e.g.Adams-Prassl, Boneva, Golin, Rauh, 2020,Baylis, Beauregard, Connolly, Fortin, Green, Gutiérrez-Cubillos, Gyetvay, Haeck, Molnár, Simard-Duplain, Siu, teNyenhuis, Warman, 2021,Mongey, Pilossoph, Weinberg, 2021,Forsythe, Kahn, Lange, Wiczer, 2020) and on shifts of job seekers across growing and shrinking occupations andindustries(Hensvik, Le Barbanchon, Rathelot, 2021,Marinescu, Skandalis, Zhao, 2021,Carrillo-Tudela, Clymo, Comunello, Jäckle, Visschers, Zentler-Munro, 2022).Our goal in this paper is to advance further this literature by conducting the first comprehensive analysis on the effects of the COVID-19 shock on the relative demand for occupations, considering a broad set of occupational characteristics such as routine intensity, service-orientedness, physical contact intensity, and essentiality.1To this end, we exploit monthly data from Burning Glass Technologies (BGT) on online job postings of two-digit (SOC) occupations in all fifty US states and the District of Columbia over January 2020 – December 2020 and data on occupational characteristics from various sources. Importantly, the COVID-induced shifts in occupational composition of USlabour demandthat we identify allow us to derive useful insights in relation to labour market trends that were persistent in the US and other advanced economies in recent decades and until before the pandemic outbreak –most notably, job polarisation.2We begin the analysis by documenting the evolution of the country-wide number of online job postings to the total US population over the period examined. This ratio declined sharply over the first wave of the pandemic and lockdown (March–April), which accords with evidence provided by pertinent studies for the US and other countries (e.g.Forsythe, Kahn, Lange, Wiczer, 2020,Hensvik, Le Barbanchon, Rathelot, 2021). It recovered only partially when the lockdown was lifted (May–October), and plummeted again during the second pandemic wave and ensuing lockdown (November–December). The per-capita numbers of online job postings of different occupations also declined during the first wave of the pandemic, but the magnitudes of these declines were different, and so were the trends in the following months. As a consequence, the shares of online job postings of some occupations in the total number of online job postings (e.g.communityand social service, healthcare practice, healthcare support, protective service) increased, while those of other occupations (e.g. arts and entertainment, sales, food preparation and service, personal care and service) decreased over the period examined.Motivated by these trends, we identify the heterogeneous effects of the COVID-19 shock on the relative demand for different occupations by regressing the monthly share of online job postings by occupation-state pair on the interaction between a measure of occupation-state-level economic uncertainty and a measure of occupational task content. We focus on economic uncertainty as it is a key driving force of firms’ hiring decisions. To capture it empirically in the baseline specification, we rely on the monthly index of US news-basedEconomic Policy Uncertainty(EPU) ofBaker et al. (2016). We also consider using alternative measures of economic uncertainty such as the monthly composite index of US EPU (of the same study) or the monthly indices of sales revenue or employment growth uncertainty in the US, as constructed based on micro-level data of the Survey of Business Uncertainty (SBU). As the original measures are country-specific, we apportion these to occupation-state pairs according to their pre-COVID (2019) shares in country-wide employment of the respective occupations. Exploiting, further, variation in occupational task content is key in order to make sense of the documented differences in the relative demand for occupations during the months of 2020. Hence, the interaction term that we create is a shift-share variable, whose estimated coefficient captures the differential effects of economic uncertainty on the relative demand for occupation-state pairs, according to pre-COVID differences in their occupational country-wide employment shares and occupations’ composition of tasks.3We estimate the specification by OLS with standard errors clustered by occupation-state pair. We also control for unobserved differences across occupation-state pairs (e.g. demographic composition, levels of income and human capital) by including the relevant dummies, and for time-varying shocks to occupation-state pairs (e.g. country-wide responses of the federal government and the Federal Reserve to the COVID-19 shock) by including month dummies. As the shift-share and outcome variables are unlikely to be simultaneously determined, we interpret the OLS estimates as causal effects.4The first set of results that we obtain reveals that economic uncertainty due to the COVID-19 shock exerted positive differential effects on the relative demand for occupations with relatively high non-routine cognitive interactive or manual task content –especially, when these occupations are also non-essential (e.g. community and social service, life, physical and social science, transportation and material moving), as well as occupations that have both relatively high non-routine cognitive analytical and interactive task content (e.g. architecture and engineering, management). By contrast, economic uncertainty exerted negative differential effects on the relative demand for occupations with relatively high routine cognitive or manual task content (e.g. administrative, production). Importantly, most of these effects persisted over time, as they were observed during the two pandemic waves (February–May and October–December) and the months in-between, and increased in magnitude from the one period to the next.These findings are in accord with existing evidence showing that the secular phenomenon of routine-biased technological change (henceforth, RBTC) led to job polarisation in the pre-COVID era (e.g.Autor, Levy, Murnane, 2003,Spitz-Oener, 2006,Acemoglu, Autor, 2011,Autor, Dorn, 2013,Goos, Manning, Salomons, 2014). They are also consistent with the episodic aspect of RBTC, implying the acceleration of the adoption of new technologies undertaking routine tasks during economic downturns and their aftermath (Hershbein and Kahn (2018);Jaimovich and Siu, 2020). The differential effect on the relative demand for occupations with both relatively high non-routine cognitive analytical and interactive task content is also consistent with existing evidence showing that RBTC has contributed to the growing complementarity between analytical and interactive tasks (Borghans et al. (2014);Weinberger (2014);Deming, 2017).Interestingly, however, we derive an additional set of results that is seemingly at odds with RBTC-induced job polarisation and rather explained by key features of the new setting that has emerged since the onset of the COVID-19 shock. That is, a major health crisis and the imposition of restrictive measures (e.g. social distancing, lockdown) aiming at restraining the rapid spread of the virus (Ferguson, Laydon, Nedjati-Gilani, Imai, Ainslie, Baguelin, Bhatia, Boonyasiri, Cucunubá, Cuomo-Dannenburg, Dighe, Dorigatti, Fu, Gaythorpe, Green, Hamlet, Hinsley, Okell, van Elsland, Thompson, Verity, Volz, Wang, Wang, Walker, Walters, Winskill, Whittaker, Donnelly, Riley, Ghani, 2020,Gupta, Simon, Wing, 2020). According to our findings, COVID-induced economic uncertainty exerted positive differential effects on the relative demand for essential occupations –especially, those that also have relatively high routine cognitive, routine manual, service-oriented, or contact-intensive task content. Similarly, positive differential effects were exerted on the relative demand for contact-intensive occupations that also have relatively high routine cognitive, routine manual, or service-oriented task content. All these effects point to increases in the demand for healthcare practice and support and protective service occupations. Indeed, individuals in these occupations have been all along on the front line in the fight against COVID-19.Also, the negative differential effects on the relative demand for non-essential occupations with relatively high routine cognitive or manual task content point to some occupational demand trends that are consistent with the job polarisation witnessed in the pre-COVID era, but also to other occupational demand trends that are rationalised by idiosyncratic features of the COVID-19 shock. In particular, these effects point to declines in the relative demand for administrative and some production (e.g. assembly-line) occupations, which experienced employment share losses also in the pre-COVID period –predominantly due to RBTC and offshoring– and contributed to job polarisation. However, the same effects also point to declines in the relative demand for arts and entertainment, personal care and service, and building cleaning and maintenance occupations, among others, which experienced relative employment gains in the pre-COVID period due their being largely shielded from automation and offshoring and the high demand for their services –especially, in densely-populated urban areas. Equally importantly, most of these effects were highly persistent and increasing in size from the first through the second pandemic wave.Related literatureThe novel empirical evidence of this paper contributes to four streams of literature. Our focus on identifying the differential effects of the COVID-19 shock on the demand for occupations according to their non-routine, routine, customer-oriented, and service-oriented task content emulates the influential literature making the task-based approach in order to study job polarisation and its determinants. In turn, a set of findings that we derive is consistent with key evidence of two streams of this literature. The first shows that RBTC and offshoring have been major drivers of job polarisation (Autor, Levy, Murnane, 2003,Spitz-Oener, 2006,Acemoglu, Autor, 2011,Autor, Dorn, 2013,Goos, Manning, Salomons, 2014). RBTC also partly explains why cognitive analytical and interactive tasks have become increasingly complementary since the 1980s (Borghans, Weel, Weinberg, 2014,Weinberger, 2014,Deming, 2017). In fact, machines have started outcompeting human in the execution of some cognitive analytical tasks, while social interaction is, at least up to now, a prerogative of humans (Autor, 2015). The second stream establishes a link between RBTC and job polarisation during recessions.Hershbein and Kahn (2018)show that skill requirements in online job postings increased in US Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) that were disproportionately hit by theGreat Recession(2007–2009), that this effect persisted through 2015, and that it was correlated with a surge in capital investments, both at the MSA and firm levels. Relatedly,Jaimovich and Siu (2020)show that employment losses in routine occupations in the US since the early 1980s have been primarily observed during recessions, and that the lack of employment recovery in these occupations accounts almost entirely for the jobless recoveries in the aggregate.Moreover, our approach to consider in the analysis additional occupational characteristics, namely, physical contact intensity, tele-work potential, and essentiality, is influenced by the burgeoning stream of literature studying the labour market implications of the COVID-19 shock. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to consider a wide range of occupational characteristics allowing for a comprehensive analysis of the heterogeneous effects of the COVID-19 shock on the demand for different occupations. In doing so, it enriches this stream of literature by deriving a set of findings that, as mentioned earlier, is consistent with evidence on job polarisation, but also another set of findings that is at odds with this phenomenon, and can rather be rationalised by features of the pandemic shock (e.g. major health crisis) and individual and collective responses to it (e.g. social distancing, lockdown).Using data from real-time surveys conducted in the US, UK, and Germany in March and April 2020,Adams-Prassl et al. (2020)document smaller job losses in the latter country, which are attributed to its firmer pre-COVID labour market institutions (e.g. short-time work schemes). They also show that job and earnings losses in the three countries were higher for workers with temporary work arrangements and those with relatively limited tele-work potential. In a similar vein,Baylis et al. (2021)find larger employment losses for women in Canada during the first part of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak due to their larger concentration in high-viral-risk occupations, and for the less educated workers due to their lower tele-work potential. Using data from the US Current Population Survey,Cortes and Forsythe (2020)find that the COVID-19 shock has exacerbatedinequalities, with the low-educated, younger, and female workers, and those of Hispanic origin experiencing larger increases in job losses and larger decreases in hiring rates. Similar evidence is also provided byMontenovo et al. (2020). Further,Mongey et al. (2021)find that while jobs in the US with low tele-work potential and those with high physical proximity requirements were hit disproportionately, those that are also essential did not.5Using data on online job postings from Burning Glass Technologies,Forsythe et al. (2020)report a collapse of over 40% in the number of job vacancies in the US by late April 2020. A collapse of similar magnitude is also reported for Sweden byHensvik et al. (2021), who exploit data from the country’s largest online job board. However, the first study also finds that essential retail and nursing maintained or decreased slightly their job posting levels. The simultaneous rise in unemployment insurance claims made by workers in such occupations points to a great deal of churn in the US labour market. The latter is consistent with evidence provided byBarrero et al. (2020)on realised and predicted job reallocation in the US since the onset of the crisis. Exploiting rich online job postings data from LinkUp,Campello et al. (2020)show that new-hiring cuts during the COVID-19 shock were more pronounced for high-skill jobs, smaller or credit-constrained firms, highly-unionised industries, and low-income areas. Also,Althoff et al. (2022)use data from the US Current Population Survey and provide evidence on disproportionate declines during the COVID-19 shock relative to January 2020 in hours worked by individuals in low-paying service occupations in big cities due to the rising tendency of individuals in high-skill, high-paying occupations –which, by and large, also have high tele-work potential– to move away from these.A smaller group of studies of this stream of literature look into thelabour supply effectsof the COVID-19 shock.Hensvik et al. (2021)provide evidence on labour market searches shifting towards occupations that have been hit less severely by the pandemic. Similar shifts have been identified byMarinescu et al. (2021), with the use of data for the US from Glassdoor, and byBernstein et al. (2020), with the use of data from a job board focused on tech companies (Angel-List Talent). In addition,Carrillo-Tudela et al. (2022)exploit novel and rich information from the job-search module of the UK HouseholdLongitudinal Study(UKHLS) on targeted and realised switches of job seekers across occupations and industries. They find that although job seekers, by and large, increasingly targeted growing occupations and industries, certain groups of job seekers (i.e., non-employed, low-educated, formerly employed in declining occupations and/or industries), targeted mostly declining occupations and industries. Equally importantly, the authors find that the mismatch between targeted and realised switches of job seekers across occupations is substantial, pointing to a high likelihood of an unemployment mismatch in the UK.The final stream of literature to which our paper relates studies non-labour-market outcomes of economic uncertainty induced by the COVID-19 shock.Baker et al., 2020bestimate that half of the predicted US output contraction during the months of 2020 was accounted for by COVID-induced economic uncertainty, as measured by the stock market volatility (VIX), the news-based Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU), and the Survey of Business Uncertainty (SBU) indices. In addition,Baker et al. (2020b)show that investments in tangible andintangible capitalare extremely responsive to EPU, most likely due to their irreversible nature and the relatively high associated sunk costs. There is also evidence on the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 shock on the stock market (Baker, Bloom, Davis, Kost, Sammon, Viratyosin, 2020,Leduc, Liu, 2020). Our paper emulates this group of studies in using the EPU and SBU measures in order to capture COVID-induced economic uncertainty. Unlike these studies, however, it is the first paper that does so with the aim to identify its labour market implications and, in particular, its implications for occupational demand.Layout of the paperInSection 2, we describe the different datasets that we rely on and the construction of variables. We also present the main trends of online job postings and measures of economic uncertainty in the US during the COVID-19 shock, as well as the patterns of occupations by occupational characteristic. InSection 3, we give a detailed account of theeconometricmodel and the identification strategy, while inSection 4, we present and rationalise the main results and test their robustness. InSection 5, we highlight the key conclusions drawn from the main results and indicate some promising avenues for future research.",Sotiris,Rigas,None
"1. IntroductionOver 46 million adults suffer from some form of mental illness in the U.S. (Ponte, 2019). Furthermore, 5.2 percent of all adults in the U.S. suffer from Serious Mental Illness (SMI)—mental, behavioral, or emotional disorders resulting in serious functional impairments that substantially interfere with or limit one or more major life activities (Ponte, 2019). The burdens of mental illness are particularly concentrated among those who experience disability due to SMI, where many suffering SMI rely upon government disability benefits to survive. In this paper, we ask how additional access to mental health treatment services affects participation in federal disability programs.Mental health has far-reaching labor market implications.Kessler et al. (2008)use 2002 data and estimate that those with SMI had annual earnings roughly $16,000 less than other respondents with the same values, resulting in a societal-level total of $193 billion.1While mental illness is one of the leading causes ofsickness absencesin most high-income countries (Harvey et al., 2009), fewer than half of American adults suffering from mental illness receivedmental health servicesin 2019 (National Alliance on Mental Health, 2019). A common barrier to low treatment rates is the inability to locate a provider (CBHSQ, 2015). Even after one has identified a provider, wait times atoutpatient clinicsoften span weeks or months (Blech, West, Yang, Barber, Wang, Coyle, 2017,Steinman, Shoben, Dembe, Kelleher, 2015). At the same time, research suggests that longer wait times lead to less favorable outcomes (Steinert et al., 2017). One possible way to increase labor market participation for those suffering from mental illness could be to provide additional resources that allow individuals to identify and receive treatment for their diagnosed illness.In this paper, we examine how expansions in office-based mental health establishments affect participation in the Social Security Administration (SSA) programs that support people with disabilities: SSI and SSDI. Using within county variation in the number of establishments from 2010 to 2016, we are able to document the extent to which additional mental health resources can affect SS(D)I participation among counties in micropolitan or larger areas.2To speak to the concern that counties experience expansions in establishments at the same time as there is an uptick in SS(D)I participation, we create an event sample of treatment counties—that have only one expansion over the period of study—and comparison counties—that experienced no change over the same period. This allows us to estimate anevent studyspecification and determine the validity of the empirical design.We posit two potential ways that additional mental health establishments may impact program participation. Since bottlenecks, such as long wait times, reduce access to mental health resources, additional availability of appointments may foster mental health. This treatment could allow individuals to obtain and maintain employment, reducing participation in SS(D)I. Alternatively, additional access may increase the likelihood of proper diagnoses of SMI, which would likely increase the take-up of disability programs.Our work contributes to two main literatures. First, we add to the literature that examines the link between mental health and labor market participation. Previous work shows that mental illness has far-reaching labor market implications on outcomes including employment, earnings, labor market entry, work hours, and absences.3These negative consequences arise through a variety of channels, such as education (Kessler et al., 1995), discrimination (Currie and Madrian, 1999), and job performance (Chatterji et al., 2007). Our work considers the degree to which mental health treatment affects disability program participation which has direct ties to labor market participation.Second, we contribute to the literature studying the effects of government policies and resources that affect participation in SSI. Broadly, a large literature has shown that economic factors, more aggressive welfare reform (Schmidt and Sevak, 2004), and other policies—like SNAP—affect SSI participation.Deshpande and Li (2019a)show that increasing the cost of applying for SSI—through office closures—reduced awards. Similarly, our results examine a policy lever that could reduce the costs of applying by expanding access to resources that could help with diagnoses and completing the SSI application process. While others have explored the effects ofhealth insuranceon SS(D)I participation, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore the effects of local availability of mental health treatment on SS(D)I. For example,Burns and Dague (2017)show that expanding Medicaid to childless adults reduced reliance on SSI. However, additional work shows that blanket Medicaid expansions do not affect SSI participation (Schmidt, Shore-Sheppard, Watson, 2020,Soni, Burns, Dague, Simon, 2017).Our findings indicate that an increase in the availability of mental health facilitiesincreasesparticipation in disability programs. Overall, a 10 percent increase in the number of office-based mental health establishments in the county increases the SSI application rate by 1.2 percent and increases the SSDI application rate by 0.7 percent. In the aggregate, this does not translate to an increase in SSI awards that is statistically different from zero. In counties with populations that have a higher proportion of residents below thepovertyline, we see that the effects on SSI and SSDI applications are larger in magnitude. Further, we find evidence in all of these subsamples that the higher application rate translates to higher proportions of SSI awards. Since these less affluent counties tend to have more people with SMI and who have earnings consistent with SSI eligibility, these findings suggest that mental health resources are an important link to benefits that may greatly assist with individuals’ necessary expenses.Deshpande (2016)found that failing age 18 disability medical review resulted in a sizable reduction in lifetime earnings, andGelber et al. (2018)show that additional SSDI earnings reduce mortality. Providing additional access to mental health resources can potentially allow individuals suffering from SMI to access SS(D)I income that is likely necessary to meet basic needs. Further,Moore (2015)find that after individuals lost SSDI eligibility in 1996 when drug and alcohol addictions were no longer listed as qualified conditions, those with two to three year SSDI spells were able to later work at much higher rates. Together with our results, these findings suggest that for individuals with mental illness may have higher likelihoods of working after a few years of SS(D)I and continuous treatment.We find additional evidence that greater access to office-based mental health establishments that have physicians translates to higher fractions of SSI applications, SSDI applications, and SSI awards. This finding suggests that the presence of a physician may be important for diagnoses and successfully progressing through the SSI screening process. While SSI office closures reduced SSI awards through increased application costs (Deshpande and Li, 2019a), our work suggests that the converse is also true: reducing costs—by having additional physicians in office-based mental health establishments locally—increases SSI awards. Further, our results show that both applications and awards for SSI are concentrated among mental health diagnoses, as opposed to physical health diagnoses.",Matt,Isaac,Carly
"1. IntroductionNearly37%of recent college graduates in the U.S. are underemployed, i.e. have a college degree and work in occupations that do not require a college degree. Moreover,60%of underemployment durations last at least 1 year (Barnichon and Zylberberg, 2019). Meanwhile, as seen inFig. 1, attainment of college degrees continues to expand and there has been an enduring priority to increase the supply of college graduates via policy levers such as subsidizing tuition.Download :Download high-res image (291KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. Underemployment and college degree attainment.Notes:Panel (a) shows the fraction of recent graduates employed in occupations which require less than a college degree. Panel (b) represents the distribution of highest degree completed among 25–30 year olds. SeeAppendix A.1for details on data sources and construction of these figures.In this paper, I develop a model of underemployment andhuman capital investmentto characterize underemployment as an equilibrium phenomena, identify the channels through which fundamentals and policy affect the underemployment rate, and study the efficiency of equilibrium allocations. I then apply the model to quantify the effect of subsidizing education on underemployment, human capital investment, and welfare.The economy has a frictional labor market with two types of jobs (simple and complex) and workers who differ in their initialwealth. Workers self-select into education groups (less- and highly-educated), which determines their capacity to be productive at complex jobs as inAlbrecht and Vroman (2002), while firms choose their job’s type based on the relative productivity of jobs and how quickly they expect to find a match. This results in a tractable framework where some workers invest in human capital and eventually meet simple jobs in the labor market.1If such a meeting turns into a match, the worker becomes underemployed and searches on the job to eventually meet a complex job as inDolado et al. (2009).The decision to become underemployed is determined by comparing the endogenous relative productivity of simple to complex jobs with the worker’s opportunity cost of giving up their job search. In contrast to unemployment, underemployment does not always exist in equilibrium. If, for example, the flow utility of unemployment is large, highly-educated workers are better off unemployed than underemployed. Also in contrast to the unique equilibrium unemployment rate of theMortensen and Pissarides (1994)model, there can be multiplicity of steady-state equilibria that is driven by two coordination problems. First, firms create more complex jobs if more workers invest in human capital, whereas more workers invest in human capital if firms create more complex jobs. Second, if firms coordinate to create more simple jobs, workers are more likely to become underemployed and hence invest less in education, which in turn causes more simple jobs to be created.2There are two channels through which fundamentals affect the underemployment rate. First, arelative price channel, follows from a demand for diversity in consuming goods produced in simple and complex jobs and operates as follows.3If the supply of highly-educated workers increases, the relative price of complex to simple jobs decreases, making workers more likely to become underemployed due to the smaller gap in earnings between simple and complex jobs. The second channel emphasized byShephard and Sidibé (2019), thejob supply channel, focuses on how the supply of highly-educated workers can affect the composition of jobs between simple and complex jobs. A shift in the composition towards complex jobs decreases the rate at which highly-educated workers meet simple jobs and increases the opportunity cost of underemployment, as underemployed workers forgo more opportunities to meet a complex job.With the relative price channel shut down, a decline in the price of human capital investment causes more workers to invest in human capital, the vacancy filling rate of complex jobs to increase, and more complex jobs to be created. Through the job supply channel, the underemployment rate decreases. With the relative price channel active, however, the relative price of simple to complex jobs increases as the supply of highly-educated workers increases. I show examples where, due to the change in relative prices, highly-educated workers are more likely to become underemployed and the underemployment rate increases.The decentralized equilibrium is never constrained-efficient due to externalities in human capital investment and the formation of cross-skill matches (matches between highly-educated workers and simple jobs).4There is a hold-up problem in human capital investment (Acemoglu, 1996,Moen, 1998) in addition to workers not internalizing differences in the magnitude of thick market and congestion externalities across education groups. As for cross-skill matches, the planner considers the total expected forgone surplus of a cross-skill match, whereas workers only consider their private share of the forgone surplus. This can make the planner choosier in forming cross-skill matches. On the other hand, the planner internalizes that forming a cross-skill match reduces congestion for other job seekers, a social benefit that can make the planner more keen on forming them.A calibrated version of the model implies that workers under-invest in human capital, too many jobs are created, the underemployment rate is inefficiently low, and welfare (net output) is4.53%lower in the decentralized allocation relative to the constrained-efficient allocation. Given the inefficiencies, there is a role for policy to both increase the supply of highly-educated workers and reduce the amount of jobs created to implement the constrained-efficient supply of highly-educated workers and underemployment rate. I find that the constrained-efficient allocation can be implemented by subsidizing30.8%of the pecuniary cost of human capital, increasing unemployment benefits by18.3%, and subsidizing60.0%of the costs to create a complex vacancy.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The remaining parts of the introduction review the related literature and present a few motivating facts on underemployment.Section 2introduces the environment.Section 3derives and defines the set of equilibria.Section 4characterizes the constrained-efficient allocation.Section 5presents the quantitative analysis. Finally,Section 6concludes. Details on data are inAppendix Awhile proofs and derivations are delegated toAppendix B.1.1. Related literatureThis paper is most closely related toShephard and Sidibé (2019). The two papers, developed independently, have in common a frictional labor market in which workers invest in human capital and firms choose their job’s skill requirements. Both models generate a job supply channel where an increase to the supply of highly-educated workers causes more high-skill jobs to be created and decreases the underemployment rate. This paper’s contribution is to consider an environment that also produces a demand for diversity in consuming goods produced in low- and high-skill occupations by assuming imperfect substitutability between jobs. This adds a relative price channel in addition to the job supply channel. I show that the relative price channel can outweigh the job supply channel and lead to opposite comparative statics on the underemployment rate. Additionally, this paper characterizes the solution to the social planner’s problem, computes the constrained-efficient allocation, and studies the role of education subsidies in restoring efficiency.Furthermore, this paper contributes to the literature on labor search models with two-sided heterogeneity.5Albrecht and Vroman (2002)developed a model where highly-educated workers can end up working in low-skill jobs and characterize two equilibrium regimes: cross-skill matching and ex-post segmentation.6Dolado et al. (2009)extendAlbrecht and Vroman (2002)’s framework by allowing underemployed workers to search on the job.Barnichon and Zylberberg (2019)generate underemployment through high-skill workers escaping competition from their highly-skilled peers and more easily finding jobs for which they are over-qualified.7This paper builds on these studies by endogenizing the supply of highly-educated workers. This allows for a characterization of when workers both invest in human capital and become underemployed in equilibrium. This paper also contributes to the literature by endogenizing the relative productivity of jobs through a final goods technology as inAcemoglu (2001), which activates a key channel, the relative price channel, that has been studied in many models of human capital investment with competitive labor markets.8This paper is also related to models of human capital investment in frictional labor markets.Acemoglu (1996)andMoen (1998)study the hold-up problem that arises in these environments.Moen (1999)studied an environment where investing in human capital increased worker’s job-finding rates. The models ofFlinn and Mullins (2015)andMacera and Tsujiyama (2017)have workers who are heterogenous in ability and invest in human capital before entering the labor market. Additionally,Charlot and Decreuse (2005)study an environment with segmented labor markets and show that when workers are heterogenous in their innate ability, low-ability workers do not internalize that they reduce the average innate ability within the pool of highly-educated workers by investing in human capital. This inefficiency can lead to over-investment in human capital. Relative to these studies, this paper is the first to characterize the constrained-efficient allocation in an unsegmented labor market with two-sided heterogeneity where human capital investment, the productivity of jobs, and underemployment are endogenous.The normative analysis in this paper is related to the literature which studies efficiency in frictional labor markets. The most related paper isBlázquez and Jansen (2008)who show that the decentralized equilibrium inAlbrecht and Vroman (2002)can never be constrained-efficient.9Acemoglu (2001)shows that in a model with heterogenous jobs and homogenous workers there can be a bias in the composition of jobs towards low-wage jobs. As mentioned above,Charlot and Decreuse (2005)show that composition effects associated with low-ability workers investing in human capital can lead to over-education. This paper advances this literature by emphasizing how inefficiencies associated with human capital investment create distortions in the number of jobs, composition of jobs, and underemployment rate that motivate a role for policies such as education subsidies in order to restore efficiency in the labor market.Finally, this paper contributes to the literature which studies the effects ofeducation policyin the context of a frictional labor market.Ji (2020)shows that risk averse workers who are credit constrained use the labor market for insurance purposes and that switching from standard to income basedstudent loanrepayment plans afford workers the opportunity to be choosier in their job search. While this paper studies an environment with risk neutral workers, risk aversion would have a similar effect as inJi (2020). Investing in human capital may be more appealing to workers as it expands the set of jobs they can work at, thereby reducing their unemployment risk. Once in the labor market, risk aversion could make workers more keen on forming cross-skill matches if they credit-constrained.10Finally, as mentioned above,Shephard and Sidibé (2019)study the effect of education subsidies and compulsory schooling on wageinequalityand mismatch. This paper advances this literature by developing a framework that emphasizes both the job supply channel studied byShephard and Sidibé (2019)and a relative price channel. Additionally, this paper motivates the role for education subsidies by characterizing inefficiencies which lead to discrepancies between the decentralized and constrained-efficient allocations. Moreover, this paper computes the amount of education subsidies required to restore efficiency.111.2. Underemployment in the dataThis section introduces the empirical definition of the aggregate underemployment rate and a few motivating facts. In particular, this section illustrates that (i) the underemployment rate has been stable dating back to 1980, (ii) underemployment is primarily driven by college graduates with only a bachelors degree, (iii) underemployment is prevalent across many undergraduate majors, and (iv) underemployment is not just a temporary phase experienced by recent graduates, as many are underemployed five and ten years into their career.I followAbel et al. (2014)in defining a recent graduate (ages 22–27) with at least a bachelors degree to be underemployed if they work in an occupation that requires less than a college degree. An occupation, at the disaggregated Census code level, is defined to require a college degree if at least50%of respondents in the O*NET survey say that a college degree or above is required to perform that occupation.Appendix A.1provides further details on calculating the underemployment rate.As seen inFig. 1, nearly37%of recent graduates were underemployed between 1980–2017. It is also clear that underemployment is not a recent phenomena, as the underemployment rate has been relatively stable dating back to 1980. Further, panel (a) ofFig. 2illustrates that the aggregate underemployment rate is primarily driven by those with only a bachelors degree as the underemployment rate among those whose highest degree is a bachelors is41.6%while the underemployment rate among those with advanced degrees is14.5%. Panel (b) ofFig. 2shows that there is variation in underemployment rates across undergraduate majors as the underemployment rate varies from17.3%(Engineering) to51.3%(Communications). Despite this variation, underemployment is prevalent among a variety of majors, including STEM fields.Download :Download high-res image (300KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 2. Underemployment by highest degree obtained and undergraduate major.Notes:Panel (a) shows underemployment rate by highest degree obtained. Panel (b) shows the underemployment rate by undergraduate major. Data on undergraduate major come from the AmericanCommunitySurvey between 2009–2016.The degree to which underemployment is viewed as an inefficient outcome can rest on how transitory underemployment is as many graduates may take a temporary job as they transition into their field. A report by Burning Glass Technologies and the Strada Institute,BGT and SI (2018), sheds light on this. They find that (i) nearly43%of college graduates begin their career underemployed, (ii) out of those initially underemployed,67%are underemployed five years later, and (iii)48%of those initially underemployed are underemployed ten years after entering the labor market.Finally, it is worth noting potential issues with this empirical definition of underemployment. Some occupations are slightly below the50%cutoff, and are therefore labelled the same as occupations where nearly zero respondents in the O*NET survey believe a college degree is required. While the50%cutoff is stark, it produces an aggregate underemployment rate that is very similar to alternative approaches to measure educational requirements. For example,BGT and SI (2018)use educational requirements included in online job ads whileBarnichon and Zylberberg (2019)use the BLS 2012 Occupational Outlook Handbook. All three approaches find an underemployment rate among recent graduates of approximately40%.",Paul,None,None
"1. IntroductionWhen job displacement occurs, the distress levels of displaced workers and their partners elevate as a result.2Considerable research has linked job displacement—that is, workers being fired or made redundant unexpectedly, despite their willingness to work at the prevailing wage (e.g.,Shapiro and Stiglitz, 1984)—to the psychological well-being of the displaced (e.g.,Kuhn, Lalive, Zweimüller, 2009,McInerney, Mellor, Nicholas, 2013,Schaller, Stevens, 2015,Schiele, Schmitz, 2016). Recent studies also reveal that the well-being of the partner is similarly affected by unemployment or job stress (Bubonya, Cobb-Clark, Wooden, 2017,Clark, 2003,Everding, Marcus, 2020,Fletcher, 2009,Marcus, 2013,Mendolia, 2014,Nikolova, Ayhan, 2019,Siegel, Bradley, Gallo, Kasl, 2003). Hence, in a 2-adult household (that is, a household with two adult partners), workers are subject to a potential mental healthspillover, because their partners may encounter job displacement, and displacement blues are contagious.At the same time, having a partner also confers mental health benefits when workers lose their jobs involuntarily. From a burden-sharing perspective, displaced workers can seekemotional supportfrom their partners.3From a risk- and income-sharing perspective, pooling wages with partners ensure household income will not plunge to zero when workers encounter unemployment shocks (Mazzocco, 2004). Working partners can increase work hours to maintain household financial security (Kohara, 2010); non-working partners may choose to (or be compelled to) find employment to compensate for the income loss (e.g.,Lundberg, 1985). In a 1-adult household (that is, a household with one adult member), whilst a worker lacks the means of sharing the mental health burden or insuring against an income shock within the household, the worker is spared the additional risk of a partner’s displacement.The phenomenon begs the first research question: Is there a mental health difference in having a partner when job displacement takes place? To motivate the question, consider a hypothetical individual who can either form a 1-adult household or be part of a 2-adult household. In a 1-adult household, the individual loses their job involuntarily and incurs a mental health cost MH1. In a 2-adult household, when job displacement unfolds, the mental health repercussions are likely less severe because of the tangible (e.g., financial) and intangible (e.g., psychological) support from partners. Meanwhile, the individual’s partner may experience involuntary job loss, which is shown to be detrimental to the individual’s mental health. The expected mental health effect for the individual in this 2-adult household, is MH2. The research question asks, given the tradeoff between own mental health gain and the partner’s mental health spillover, whether MH2is different from MH1.The second research question concerns gender: Do males and females undergo similar mental health challenges when displaced? The question is fueled by a few observations. Regardless of household type, the gender pay gap (e.g.,Blau, Kahn, 1996,Watson, 2010) predicts a greater loss of income for males than for females. Under this view, male workers may confront higher financial strains and more mental health issues. In terms of genderdivision of labor(Baker and Jacobsen, 2007), men have long been viewed and treated as the breadwinners of the family. The provider stress and gender perception of job loss are therefore different for men and women in 2-adult households. In 1-adult households, women are more likely than men to be single parents supporting dependent children.4As such, women may face greater provider stress and find the unemployment experience more overwhelming.5Following from the above, potentialgender differencescan become less clear-cut when examined in different types of households.To seek answers to these two questions—how the mental health toll of job displacement differs by household composition and gender—I make use of the Health, Income and Labor Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey from 2007 to 2019. I estimate the impact of job displacement separately for 1-adult and 2-adult households, men and women, and workers and partners. To facilitate the comparison with displaced workers, I reweigh non-displaced workers based on their observable characteristics. For each individual, I construct the difference in mental health across survey waves; the resulting measure tracks the changes in the individual’s well-being during the treatment period. In short, the empirical approach addresses selection issues through reweighting, and it accounts for time-invariant unobservable characteristics through differencing. It does not, however, deal with selection on unobservable time-varying traits, nor does it address similarities across types of households and gender. These remain the limitations of the current empirical strategy.The results reveal that job displacement influences the mental health of 1-adult and 2-adult households alike (p-value = 0.27 for males and 0.28 for females), notwithstanding the statistically significant spillover effects. This emerges from the fact that by having partners, displaced workers enjoy a discount on the emotional burden, and the discount is of similar size to any mental health spillover from the partners’ potential unemployment. In fact, if one factors in the differences in the prevalence of job loss, a worker likely benefits from being in a 2-adult household. Furthermore, being unemployed (becoming reemployed) after job displacement gives rise to significant gender differences in 2-adult (1-adult) households (p-values = 0.03). I conjecture that the interplay of (relative) financial contribution to the household and gendered perception of job loss is accountable for such heterogeneity. For men, job displacement appears to be linked to high distress independent of earnings or their relative contributions to household income.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.Section 2surveys related literature.Section 3introduces the data and variables and describes the methodology.Section 4presents the summary statistics and conveys the key results.Section 5discusses further results.Section 6concludes the paper.",Yuejun,None,None

"1. IntroductionIn labour-market models with On-the-Job Search (OJS) as developed byBurdett and Mortensen (1998), the ordeal of a job seeker resembles that of the mythological character Sisyphus, who is tasked with rolling a boulder up a hill. Each time he nears the top, the boulder slips from his hands and rolls back down the slope. Sisyphus has no alternative but to start his laborious task all over again. For their part, job seekers climb the hill of rents by selecting into ever better paying jobs drawn from an offer distribution. When their current job is destroyed, they tumble back to the trough of unemployment at the bottom of the hill. As with Sisyphus, all gains from prior selection are lost. They have to restart their task, climbing the same hill from which they have just fallen. This process yields simple predictions regarding the evolution of wages over the course of a worker’s career which can be used to identify the shape of the wage-offer distribution, estimate the contribution of OJS to wage dispersion and the overall increase in expected wages over the lifecycle.The key concept in our approach is theemployment cycle(seeWolpin (1992)): the interval between two consecutive job-destruction shocks (i.e. two consecutive attempts to roll the boulder up the hill of rents). The selection of ever better offers means that wages increase in the course of each cycle. But when the boulder tumbles back to the bottom of the hill—i.e. when the destruction of a job ends the employment cycle—average wages return to the level at the beginning of the employment cycle and the process starts again.Moreover, the speed at which Sisyphus is able to roll the boulder up the hill depends on weather conditions. Job offers arrive more frequently during booms than busts. The higher their arrival rate, the more quickly the job seeker is able to climb the hill of rents. This type of search models yield detailed predictions as to how these differences in job-offer arrival rates affect the profile of wage growth during the employment cycle. Extrapolating from this parable, we can identify two independent sources of variation for the position of Sisyphus on the hill or the position of a worker in the job ladder:1.the timing with which the boulder slips from the worker’s hands: the random arrival of job-destruction shocks, which end the employment cycle at different points in time for each job seekers. We use the distinction between quits and layoffs to identify employment cycles;2.differences in weather conditions: the variation in aggregate labour-market conditions. We distinguish between two concepts of time:calendar timeandlabour-market time; the clock of the former runs at a constant pace, that of the latter runs proportional to the job-offer arrival rate (i.e. faster during a boom than a bust). Where the regular return to experience is a function of calendar time, the return to search is a function of labour-market time. The difference between these concepts of time enables us to disentangle the two returns.We show that we can exploit these sources of exogenous variation to create a theoretically consistent measure of match quality. We measure the sum of the job offer arrival rates from the start of the employment cycle until the end of the current job capturing the expected number of job offers paying alower wagethen the current job. We further show how this measure can be used to quantify the contribution of OJS to wage dispersion by means of simple OLS regressions. The specification of these regressions is based on a detailed analysis of the characteristics of the selection process of ever better draws from the offer distribution. We also show that this type of job ladder model yields strong predictions regarding both wages and the distribution of job tenure. The starting date of all jobs (barring the first job) during an employment cycle is predicted to be uniformly distributed over the length of that cycle until the job ends. The intuition for this result is that the current job is the best offer received since the start of the employment cycle. As all draws have equal probability of being the max, its moment of arrival is uniformly distributed over the length of the employment cycle. Furthermore, jobs ending in a quit, rather than a layoff, are expected to have a lower match quality. This implies that the wage is also expected to be lower. The empirical analysis confirms both predictions.We apply our method to the 1979 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY). We find that thestandard deviationof the distribution of log wage offers is about13%and that frictions explain around8%of the total variation in log wages for male workers. This standard deviation is 1.5 times larger for workers with higher than lowereducation levels. Our estimates imply an average wage loss after layoff of about13%, consistent with large earnings losses following displacement documented empirically (e.g.,Jacobson et al. (1993),Davis and Wachter (2011)andBertheau et al. (2022)). Our method allows for a decomposition of the overall increase in expected wages over the lifecycle into three components: OJS, experience and tenure. OJS explains about 30% of the overall return, experience about 60%, leaving 10% for the return to tenure.Our methodology builds on the work ofBarlevy (2008)andHagedorn and Manovskii (2013).Barlevy (2008)shows how record theory can be used to identify the wage offer distribution from a sequence of expected wages in an employment cycle. We show how to use the information on job duration to obtain stronger prediction.Hagedorn and Manovskii (2013)create two measures of match quality from the histories of labour market tightness during the time-interval before the start of the current job and during the current job. We extend this analysis by constructing one unified and theoretically consistent measure of match quality and show how it relates to the wage offer distribution.Several authors have to attempted to estimate the return to OJS using a variety of methods. Whereas we directly estimate the return to OJS,Hagedorn, Manovskii and Wang (2017)measure frictional wage dispersion as the residual item andBagger et al. (2014),Tjaden and Wellschmied (2014)andBurdett et al. (2016)use structural approaches.Gautier and Teulings (2015)andGuvenen, Kuruscu, Tanaka and Wiczer (2020)compute a measure of match quality directly from data on worker andjob characteristics.Fredriksson, Hensvik and Skans (2018)measure match quality as the similarity of the worker’s skills compared to those of co-workers.Vejlin and Veramendi (2020)use wages associated with displacement to provide an upper bound for the contribution of job search for total wage dispersion which is about twice as large as our estimate.Guo (2021)proves that one can identify the offer distribution using the wages of workers with multiple offers and empirically finds very similar results to us in terms of the dispersion of wages.The next section develops the theoretical concepts employed in this paper, whileSection 3presents our empirical results.Section 4briefly discusses the implications of our findings.",Axel,Coen,None
"1. IntroductionIn 2002, the Peruvian Supreme Court ruled for the right to the reinstatement of workers who were dismissed unfairly. We exploit this ruling as a quasi-experiment to test how employment protectionlegislationaffects labor market outcomes; namely, permanent and temporary hiring, and wages. Our empirical strategy identifies a treatment group of workers who were affected by the ruling, and a control group of workers who were not affected. More specifically, we estimate a difference-in-difference model taking private sector workers as the treatment group and workers outside of the private sector as the control group. We find that the ruling is associated with an increase in permanent hiring of 2.5 percentage points. Furthermore, it is also associated with a relative decrease of temporary hiring in the private sector of 6.8 percentage points. We also find that reinstatement is associated with drops in wages of 1.4 percentage points in the private sector. Nonetheless, except for the increase in permanent private hiring, none of these variations is found to becausedby reinstatement rights. We verified these lack of causal effects by a battery of robustness checks, placebo test,event studies, and estimations with synthetic controls.These findings cast serious doubts on the alleged perverse effects of employment protection legislation and, consequently, on removing reinstatement laws as an effective policy tool to improving labor market conditions, as it is proposed in many countries in the world. This is, of course, a very controversial matter. Top firm executives surveyed by the Global Competitive Index (Vera and Rendon, 2021) express their generalized concern about reinstatement laws and employment protection legislation overall. In addition, more comprehensive and representative surveys, like the 2015 National Enterprise Survey (Encuesta Nacional de Empresas),1suggest that reinstatement laws influence permanent hiring patterns for 31% of Peruvian firms.The economic literature is not consensual regarding the unemployment effects of employment protection legislation. A series of studies finds that employment protection reduces firings at the expense of the perverse effect of lowering employment creation or increasing unemployment (Botero, Djankov, LaPorta, de Silanes, Shleifer, 2004,Heckman, Pagés-Serra, 2000,Lazear, 1990). However,Addison and Grosso (1996)andKanbur and Ronconi (2018)find that the methods applied in those studies are not sufficiently robust. Moreover,Autor et al. (2006)suggest that the real employment effect of employment protection is lower than it was previously attributed. In the same line,Kugler and Pica (2008)find that a comprehensive labor reform in Italy reduces the probability of becoming employed of between 1 and 2.6 percentage points.Cahuc et al. (2016)also find small employment effects of employment protection for the French labor market, and, instead, a significant substitution of permanent for temporary contracts, who are not entitled toseverance payments, are less productive, enjoy less job satisfaction, wages, and human capital accumulation.2Similarly,Schivardi and Torrini (2008)andHijzen et al. (2017)find a positive relationship between employment protection and temporary hiring in the Italian labor market. The literature so far seems to conclude that employment protection has small effects on employment,3but it has substantial effects on increasing temporary hiring at the expense of permanent hiring.For Peru,Jaramillo (2019)finds large, significant, and persistent drops in formal permanent hiring,real wagesand unionization rates after the reestablishment of reinstatement laws. This author gives a causal interpretation to those findings based on comparing formal and informal workers before and after the ruling. In Appendix C, we elaborate on some important threats to the validity of his identification strategy. While attempting to reproduce his results, we do we find a similar decline in formal permanent hiring. Nonetheless, we have to reject interpreting those effects as causal, because formal and informal permanent hiring were already diverging prior to the ruling on reinstatement rights. That is, there is no evidence of common pre-treatment trends between his proposed treatment and control groups. We also show that relaxing this assumption fully erodes the association or changes its sign, under some specifications.We contribute to the literature as follows. First, we add to previous work related tolabor market policyevaluation. This task has proven to be challenging in regions where labor market policy is set at a nationwide level. In particular, because there is no sub-national geographical heterogeneity to exploit à laCard and Krueger (1994). We add to the recent literature in Latin America that resorts to workers outside of the private sector (e.g., public sector workers) as a control group for the private sector (Aguila, 2011,Fernández, Villar, 2017). Moreover, we dedicate Appendix C to discuss the potential pitfalls of recurring to another popular alternative used in the literature. Namely, using informal workers as a control groups for formal workers (Jaramillo, 2019,Kugler, 2004). Our methodological discussion is of general interest as it can be extrapolated to any instance where there is no sub-national treatment intensity heterogeneity within the private sector. We carefully evaluate the likelihood of the identification assumptions, and provide a set of results that relax them. These can be applied in cases when there are valid reasons to doubt their fulfillment.Second, sinceHeckman and Pagés-Serra (2000), policy makers and some academics in developing nations have argued that all forms of labor market regulations, such as employment protection legislation, necessarily harm the labor market. Nonetheless, more than 20 years after that book was published, this paper contributes to a more recent literature showing that this is not a straightforward conclusion. For instance,Bergolo and Cruces (2014)show that, in Uruguay, a hike in workers’ payroll contributions enacted tofinancean expansion in healthcare coverage, increased labor formality by reshaping individual’s incentives to take up registered employment. Similarly,Magruder (2013)shows that minimum wages can cause a “big push” that increases formal employment and decreases informal employment. Our results are in the same vein. We show that an increase in employment protection increased covered workers’ welfare by augmenting their likelihood of being hired under a permanent contract. We show suggestive evidence that this might have been the result of an increase in workers’bargaining power.We submit these results to an extensive battery of robustness checks. First, we perform a series of placebo experiments where we falsify the timing of the treatment. Next, we modify our benchmark specification and estimate an event study design to verify if the timing of the differences between the treatment and control groups coincides with the ruling. Moreover, we relax the parallel trends assumption by modeling flexible group-specific time trends, we select our preferred estimates based on the statistical properties of the observed employment patterns before the treatment. Finally, we provide a data-driven justification for our selection of treatment and control groups via a synthetic control approach. Additionally, in Appendix B we show that our results hold under alternative, but related, definitions for these groups. All of these empirical exercises reinforce our main conclusion: reinstatements seem to have caused an increase in permanent hiring while they had no credible effect on permanent hiring nor wages.We organize the rest of this document as follows. The next section describes the institutional framework and the legal changes introduced by the Supreme Court’s 2002 ruling regarding job reinstatements.Section 3describes the data;Section 4details our identification strategy andSection 5presents the quasi-experimental design: private vs. other sectors.Section 6discusses the results and presents several robustness checks. InSection 7, we estimate the wage effects of the ruling. Finally,Section 8summarizes our main conclusions.",Bruno,Silvio,None
"1. IntroductionAggregate pay gaps (also known as unconditional or raw pay gaps) can serve as holistic measures of gender disparities in pay, and are often quoted in the press.1Assuming innate differences in productivity and preferences are small across genders, large aggregate pay gaps must reflect discrimination and inefficiency in compensation, in job assignment (hires,promotions, retention) or, upstream, in the production of human capital.2In contrast, legal recourse againstsexual discriminationin compensation historically relies on the narrower concept of “Equal Pay for Equal Work” (EPEW), which is concerned with pay gaps between equally productive workers in identical occupations but silent on occupational segregation orinequalityin promotions.3Consequently, new transparency regulations are expanding firms’ responsibility beyond EPEW. In the United Kingdom, the “Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017” now requires all firms with 250-plus employees to report the difference between the mean hourly rate of pay of all male employees and that of all female employees.4To understand how firms will (or should) respond to these new transparency requirements, we must first understand how aggregate pay gaps arise within a firm. This paper addresses three key considerations that have received little attention in the literature. First, historical patterns in hiring can generate lasting pay gaps long after the original imbalances have disappeared. Consider a firm that satisfies EPEW and applies identical promotion rates to both genders, but hired fewer women than men in the past. Because of “pipeline” effects, it will exhibit an aggregate gender pay gap and an apparent glass ceiling.5If the role of pipeline effects is mistakenly assigned to other factors, firm policy responses aimed at fixing the pay gap could create further imbalances. Second, existing gender pay gap decompositions assume a constant environment, in the sense that the returns to endowments (aka. the “wage structure”) are time-invariant.6In fact, we show in our appplication that firm processes, and the gender pay gap itself, can exhibit large fluctuations over time. Third, existing studies tend to examine each firm process separately, even though gender disparities in hires,salarygrowth and exits interact dynamically.7As an example, high turnover tends to decrease the quantitative importance of salary growth differences relative to initial salaries differences.This paper proposes a new dynamic decomposition method that can be applied to aggregate pay gaps to quantify the relative contributions of the gender composition of hires, entry salaries, salary growth, and retention, while accounting for pipeline effects and a changing firm environment.8The method estimates auxiliary, reduced-form models for each of the decomposition factors in each year, before aggregating them through microsimulations. We then obtain the decomposition through counterfactual simulations of male and female salaries in which each source of pay differences is shut down at a time. The simulations can also be extended forward to quantify pipeline effects. Rather than assume that data are drawn from a steady state, as in traditional wage decomposition methods, our approach accounts for the constant changes in hiring, firing, growth, and shrinkage that are typical in most firms.To apply our methodology, we assemble a new panel containing 27 years of all personnel records from the World Bank Group (WBG), a multilateralfinanceorganization with more than 16,000 employees in 2015. The panel length, data size, recency, and measurement precision afforded by these personnel records offer the perfect setting for the specific purpose of this paper, which is to analyze the within-firm dynamics of gender pay gaps. The firm is a policy-relevant unit of analysis because firms increasingly bear the legal responsibility of eliminating gender pay gaps. In addition, we show that the size and trends exhibited by gender pay gaps and employment differences in our sample are similar to those found among U.S. employees as a whole.Our application of the decomposition method to the WBG offers a striking example of how past hiring stocks can affect pay gaps today. Our data show a decline in the aggregate gender gap from 50 cents on the dollar in 1987 to 23 cents on the dollar in 2015. For the mean salaries in our data, this amounts to an annual difference of US$27,400. However, we find that three-quarters of the 2015 gap was due to historical differences in the types of jobs at which women and men were hired. By contrast, less than 10% of the pay gap is due to differences in entry salaries; 5% is due to differences in salary growth (including promotions and raises) and less than 1% is due to differences in retention.9We are also able to quantify how much of the gap will tend to dissipate over time in the absence of any policy or environmental change. When we simulate what would happen to the pay gap if 2015 hiring patterns were kept in place and no changes were made to compensation, we find that over the next 10 years, the aggregate pay gap continues to decline by one fifth (or five percentage points) but then stabilizes. The reason why we see these patterns is that, historically, most hires in technical positions were men; because these hires formed the pipeline for management jobs today, they continue to exert a negative influence on the gender pay gap. By 2015, the bias in hiring among the technical staff had virtually disappeared, which explains our simulated reduction in the pay gap. The persistent residual gap reflects the continued over-representation of women in support staff positions; reducing the gap further requires that men are hired into supporting staff positions as well.Lastly, we show that the patterns we uncover are not specific to the gender pay gap but also apply to pay gaps associated with employee nationality (broadly categorized in developed versus developing countries). Our methodology could similarly be applied to pay gaps between employees of different races, or disability status, among other examples.Our main contribution is therefore to propose a simulations-based dynamic decomposition method to understand how gender pay gaps are produced within firms. Studies performing dynamic decompositions based on a fully specified economic model can be found in the literature, applied to different contexts (e.g.Joubert, 2015,Keane, Wolpin, 2010). In contrast to that approach –but in line with classic decomposition methodologies– we do not account for behavioral responses or permanent unobserved heterogeneity. Therefore, our counterfactual simulations should not be interpreted as policy experiments but rather as accounting exercises.10Two non-structural studies share similarities with our approach.Bourguignon et al. (2008)decompose country-level income distribution differences. Although their exercise is static, they also use simulations to aggregate semi-parametric models of each determinant of income dispersion, and generate counterfactual distributions in which the differences in the parameters governing each individual factor are shut down one at a time.Gayle et al. (2012)implement a decomposition that explicitly captures individual career dynamics but the object of their decomposition is the gap in the cumulative earnings of U.S. male and female executives, rather than a cross-sectional firm-level pay gap and hiring pipelines. Also, their approach relies on stationary analytical formulae rather than micro-simulations.A second contribution of the study is to produce new evidence on the career stages at which pay gaps arise in organizations. The evidence comes from an original panel data set of uncommon length and width, extracted from recent personnel records of the World Bank Group. We show this organization exhibits the classicinternal labor marketfeatures identified in other large US companies and discussed inBaker and Holmstrom (1995). Existing gender pay gap studies using single-firm data separately document the gender differences in job assignment (Malkiel, Malkiel, 1973,Ransom, Oaxaca, 2005), entry salaries (Gerhart, 1990), salary growth and promotion (Barnet-Verzat, Wolff, 2008,Hersch, Viscusi, 1996,Jones, Makepeace, 1996) and/or retention (Giuliano, Levine, Leonard,Gobillon, Leturcq, Meurs, Roux, 2014,Petersen, Saporta, 2004), but they do not provide, as we do, a quantitative comparison of these gender pay gap sources.The originality of our approach is to quantify the career stages at which pay gaps arise, rather than to disentangle the contribution of observable worker endowments (such as experience or education) from that of prices as classic regression-based decompositions do. It allows follow-up investigations and remedial efforts to be focused on those organizational processes where the gaps are largest. If, for instance, most of the gender gap arose in entry salaries, a classic Oaxaca–Blinder decomposition could then be applied to entry salaries.11If instead, salary growth was the main pay gap source, follow-up efforts could investigate gender differences in performance rating, promotions, project allocations, or the impact of career interruptions due to children.",Jishnu,Clément,None
"1. IntroductionMany women will work part-time at some stage of their working career.1Although both men and women mostly start out in full-time positions, women, more frequently than men, make adjustments to their labor supply choices (Apps and Rees, 2005;Kleven et al., 2019). One common pattern is that women sharply reduce working hours after giving birth to their first child, subsequently increasing hours as children enter day care or school, then reduce hours again when elderly relatives are in need of care.2Despite this mobility, women remain overrepresented in part-time jobs well beyond the child-rearing years, generating substantial and persistent gender segregation in employment contracts (Petrongolo, 2004), which in turn has significant implications for gender wage gaps (Cortés, Pan, 2019,Goldin, 2014).One key factor that may influence a woman’s decision to work part-time or to resume a full-time position after spending years in part-time employment is whether she expects wage gains or losses when moving between full-time and part-time work. In standard labor supply models, the number of hours chosen to work directly depends on expected wage offers, which may differ between part-time and full-time employment (Blundell, Costa Dias, Meghir, Shaw, 2016,Francesconi, 2002).Previous studies analyze if women experience changes inhourly wage rateswhen they transition between full-time and part-time work, but unless one is willing to impose rational expectations, worker beliefs about the part-time wage penalty remain unidentified. If women fail to factor in wage losses where they exist or anticipate wage gains where there are none, they may misjudge the true costs or benefits of changing working hours, which can lead to suboptimal decision making. Moreover, even in the absence of beliefs-biases, measuring the perceived returns to full- and part-time work would release us from making unverified assumptions about rationality. Yet, whether women expect different wage rates in part-time and in full-time employment remains largely unanswered.Stevens et al. (2004), in a survey of British women about various aspects of work-life balance, report that 74% of surveyed women believe their employer pays part-time and full-time working women the same hourly wage.Boneva et al. (2021), using vignettes to depict a hypothetical family in which the mother works full-time, part-time, or stays at home, document that survey respondents predict lower life-time earnings for part-time working mothers. However, none of these existing studies measure women’s self-beliefs about theirownperceived wage loss or gain when switching between full- and part-time work, which is arguably the more relevant criterion in labor supply decisions. For example, individuals may predict negative part-time penalties for other (hypothetical) persons but not for themselves if they are informed but overconfident. Moreover, existing work on the perceived returns to hours worked mostly focus on future returns, hence documenting the perceived long-run effects of part-time work on wage growth (Blesch, Eisenhauer, Haan, Ilieva, Schrenker, Weizsäcker,Boneva, Kaufmann, Rauh).3Although beliefs about the long-run effects are important when agents are forward-looking, expectations about the direct or short-run impact of part-time work on current wages are of particular interest if agents are either myopic, that is, not forward-looking, or if they are present-biased, thereby prioritizing immediate over future pay-offs. To the best of my knowledge, no existing study analyzes women’s expectations about the effect of working different hours on current wages. Hence, whether women expect wage cuts for part-time work is not fully understood.In this paper, I quantify the perceived hourly wage losses and gains from working different hours on the same job among a representative sample of working women. I utilize a within-subject design with hypothetical scenarios implemented in a survey experiment, hence comparing the part-time and the full-time scenarios at the individual respondent level. The within-subject design allows me to evaluate the perceived wage changes associated with working different hours while holding constant individual andjob characteristics. Specifically, I ask full-time working respondents to consider a hypothetical transition to working part-time at 20 hours per week, ceteris paribus, and report the anticipated wage offer associated with this transition. Conversely, part-time working respondents are asked to report their expected wage offer for a hypothetical transition to working full-time at 40 hours per week. Utilizing information on current earnings and working hours, I measure the perceived hourly part-time wage penalty among full-time working respondents, and the perceived full-time wage premium among part-time working respondents. I integrate the survey experiment into the Innovation Sample of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP-IS) between 2016–2019. The SOEP-IS is a moderately sized survey of German households that is representative of the German population, thus allowing me to study the expectations of employed women across various backgrounds and occupations.I find that full-time working women, on average, expect no hourly wage cuts for switching to part-time (0.21 percent, p>0.1). However, part-time working women expect notable full-time wage premiums (6.70 percent, p<0.01). The asymmetry between full-time and part-time working women is amplified further when estimates of the wage penalties and premiums account for current overtime. Thus, women’s beliefs do not appear to be affected bycognitive dissonance, the inclination to report beliefs that justify past choices, which is a commonly voiced concern with subjective data (Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2001), but seems to be less relevant here.In studying the disagreement between workers about the part-time penalty, I document that motherhood is a significant correlate of belief heterogeneity among full-time workers. Full-time working women with children expect 6.74 percentage points stronger wage losses from part-time work compared to non-mothers (p<0.1), suggesting that these women may have self-selected into full-time employment precisely because they would face a wage penalty if they chose to work part-time on that job. However, the majority of mothers work part-time. Among part-time workers, both mothers and non-mothers expect similarly high returns to full-time employment of about 7 percent. Adding to previous findings byBoneva et al. (2021)who show that individuals predict pecuniary losses for part-time working mothers, I document that mothers themselves perceive the relationship between hours and their own earnings as convex.Besides analyzing the point forecasts of counterfactual wage offers, I quantify respondents’ uncertainty about the perceived wage penalties and premiums. Using the methods proposed byEngelberg et al. (2009)andBellemare et al. (2012), I construct density forecasts from subjective bin probabilities to measure belief uncertainty and to evaluate the robustness of the point forecasts as measures of subjective central tendency. I find that full-time workers tend to report point estimates that correspond to the lower percentiles of their subjective distribution, in line with point-prediction optimism (Engelberg et al., 2009). The extent to which point estimates deviate from subjective means further correlates with belief uncertainty. I also show that workers who are more uncertain expect more extreme wage penalties and premiums. Overall, belief uncertainty is substantial, with respondents assigning large probabilities to penalties above 20 percent and below -20 percent. Observable characteristics can to some extent predict uncertainty among full-time workers, but barely among part-time workers. Regional variation in uncertainty indicates that there might be learning effects, given that full-time workers in Eastern Germany - where part-time employment is less common - reveal higher uncertainty about the part-time penalty.To further interpret and evaluate workers’ beliefs, I estimate the returns to full- and part-time work from observed data, using these estimates as proxies of the objective pay penalty and the premium of working different hours, controlling for job and worker characteristics. Estimates of the observed returns are then compared to the perceived returns. To compute the observed returns, I build a static structural discrete choice model of female labor supply and estimate the model on a sample of German women that is comparable to the SOEP-IS sample, exploiting the longitudinal dimension of the larger German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) to model selection into part-time, full-time, and non-employment. To account for the endogeneity of wages and working hours, I estimate counterfactual full-time and part-time wage offers jointly with a multinomial logit hours equation, building onVan Soest (1995)andFrancesconi (2002).In comparing estimates of the observed returns with women’s expectations, I provide suggestive evidence of a mismatch between women’s beliefs and objective data. Adding to previous work byHirsch (2005)who documents stronger effects on hourly wages for full-time workers moving to part-time than for part-time workers moving to full-time, I find that part-time workers appear to overestimate full-time wage gains, whereas full-time workers seem to underestimate part-time wage losses. The apparent mismatch is consistent with worker overconfidence, possibly driven by misperceptions about the returns to work experience accumulated in full- and part-time employment. Although suggestive, these findings have some interesting implications for women’s labor supply decisions, as discussed below.In a set of robustness checks, I use alternative measures of working hours and part-time status to ensure that results do not depend on a specific hours threshold or on the exclusion of overtime. I further provide non-structural estimates of the observed part-time wage penalty based on OLS andfixed effectsregressions of Mincerian log-wage equations. Moreover, I extensively discuss the role of nonwage benefits for workers’ perceptions of the relative returns to full- and part-time work.The results from this paper contribute to our understanding of observed choice patterns in many OECD labor markets, where female part-time shares reach levels up to 60 percent.4The beliefs documented in this paper can rationalize why few women hesitate to reduce hours, for instance to engage in care work. Full-time working women who expect no changes in the hourly wage rate when switching to a part-time position have lower incentives to prefer full- over part-time contracts in a given period, thereby explaining the mobility from full- to part-time employment observed in many female labor markets (Apps, Rees, 2005,Kleven, Landais, Søgaard, 2019). One other interesting insight from this paper is that women’s wage expectations cannot explain why so many women remain in part-time positions over prolonged periods of time. Part-time working women expect wage gains from full-time work - in fact, they even seem to overestimate these gains. Possibly, expected short-run wage gains are too small to alter labor supply choices in comparison to other pecuniary and non-pecuniary benefits of part-time employment. In Germany, joint taxation schemes continue to reward, thereby incentivizing, the part-time employment of the secondary earner (Bick, Fuchs-Schündeln, 2017,Steiner, Wrohlich, 2004). Another explanation is that women’s labor supply choices largely reflect (perceived) social norms and constraints related to child care (Boneva, Kaufmann, Rauh,Müller, Wrohlich, 2020). By uncovering women’s beliefs about the relative costs of part-time employment, the results from this paper narrow down the set of potential determinants of women’s labor supply decisions.This paper also contributes to a large theoretical and empirical literature studying the wage penalty of working part-time (Aaronson, French, 2004,Booth, Wood, 2008,Connolly, Gregory, 2008,Ermisch, Wright, 1993,Hirsch, 2005,Manning, Petrongolo, 2008,Paul, 2016, to cite a few). I review this existing literature in more detail in a separate section of this paper. The main novelty of this paper is to quantify women’s self-beliefs about the respective wage losses and gains of switching between full- and part-time employment.Finally, this paper also contributes to the growing literature using stated expectations data to overcome the standard identification problem in revealed preference analysis (Manski, 2004,Wiswall, Zafar, 2021,Zafar, 2011). Specifically, the results presented here provide a behavioral foundation for economists modeling female labor supply. Labor supply models require an assumption about the wage-hours locus and there are competing approaches in the literature. Standard discrete choice models in the tradition ofVan Soest (1995)impose constant wage offers for full-time and part-time work, implicitly assuming that decision-makers expect constant wages. Others estimate counterfactual part-time and full-time wage offers, hence assuming that expectations about the part-time wage penalty matcheconometricpredictions (Francesconi, 2002,Löffler, Peichl, Siegloch, 2014). So far, the choice between competing models is guided by whether researchers believe a rational agentshouldtake into account a part-time wage penalty. However, whether agentsactuallyexpect different wage offers in part-time and in full-time employment is ultimately an empirical question. This paper answers this question for a representative sample of female workers and can serve as a behavioral guideline for researchers striving to capture key features of agents’ decision-processes within economic models of female labor supply.The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows.Section 2discusses the mechanisms that generate part-time wage gaps and reviews previous empirical findings.Section 3outlines the research design.Section 4describes the data.Section 5presents the results andSection 6concludes.",Annekatrin,None,None
"1. IntroductionShort-term flexible labor practices are becoming increasingly popular and, together with the rise of thegigeconomy, have attracted a high level of attention (Krueger, 2018). In recent years, the use of short-term work arrangements, such as temporary contracts, has become widespread in many European countries, where labor markets are relatively more rigid and regulated than those in the United States and the United Kingdom (ter Weel, 2018).Despite allowing employers to easily adapt to fluctuations in demand (Aguirregabiria and Alonso-Borrego, 2014), the impact of temporary arrangements on worker’s labor market careers is still debated. On the one hand, workers might benefit from their availability since they ease job finding (de Graaf-Zijl et al., 2011) and mitigate wage losses associated with skill depreciation during non-employment (Guvenen, Karahan, Ozkan, Song, 2017,Jarosch, 2021). On the other hand, they could be detrimental if they induce an unstable career (Blanchard, Landier, 2002,García-Pérez, Marinescu, Vall Castello, 2019) or lower firm-sponsored on-the-job training (Bratti, Conti, Sulis, 2021,Cabrales, Dolado, Mora, 2017).Temporary contracts might shorten non-employment spells and let workers accumulate experience with fewer interruptions, but the quality of that experience may be worse due to poorer learning opportunities, translating eventually into wage losses. In this paper we shed light on how human capital accumulates under different types of contracts, fixed-term versus open-ended, and how this affects workers’ wage trajectories during their first years in the labor market. We perform our analysis in the context of the Spanish labor market, where the use of fixed-term contracts is the rule rather than the exception: more than 90% of the contracts signed each month are fixed-term and around 25% of the workforce is under some form of temporary employment (Felgueroso et al., 2018).We rely on rich administrative data that allow us to follow individuals since labor market entry and to measure the exact time worked under permanent and temporary contracts separately. We use these precise measures of accumulated experience to estimate reduced-form wage regressions derived from a stylized framework of human capital accumulation in adual labor market. In our empirical analysis, we are able to control for workers’ permanent heterogeneity as well as contemporaneous job-firm characteristics. This allows us to account for sorting of the best workers into the best jobs, andhysteresisof contracts along workers’ careers. The dual nature of the Spanish labor market together with our rich dataset provide a unique setting to investigate how experience accumulated in alternative contracts shapes individual wage profiles.We document lower returns to accumulated experience under fixed-term contracts relative to open-ended contracts. We find that, after accounting for observed match components and unobserved worker heterogeneity, one additional year of accumulated experience in permanent employment is, on average, associated with 18.5% higher returns compared to one extra year of experience in fixed-term contracts. We provide evidence that the estimated gap in returns is neither due to differences in unobserved match quality nor firms’ unobserved heterogeneity: accounting for firm-specific unobserved wage differences explains up to 15% of the gap, while removing match-specific components results in a larger gap.Our analysis suggests that the observed difference in returns is, instead, related to worse human capital accumulation under fixed-term contracts. First, we show that the gap in returns prevails among workers who switch jobs, suggesting a human capital channel since for these workers there is a clear dissociation between the job where experience is acquired and the job where it is valued. Second, we find that the gap in returns persists when workers move to jobs with similar skill requirements, while it vanishes when they move to jobs where prior accumulated skills are less portable.Differences in returns to contract-specific experience are positively correlated with observed and unobserved individual ability, suggesting complementarity between workers’ skills and learning opportunities. These results have important implications for life-cycle wage profiles: low-ability individuals do not suffer significant wage losses whereas high-ability workers are the most penalized. Comparing counterfactual wage trajectories in fixed-term and open-ended contracts reveals that workers at top of the ability distribution (90th percentile) may face up to 16 percentage pointslower wagegrowth 15 years after entering the labor market, a loss that corresponds to a shift from the 67th to the 77th percentile of the wage growth distribution.This paper contributes to different strands of the literature. A large literature has focused on the consequences of flexibility at the margin (coexistence of fixed-term contracts with low firing costs along with highly protected open-ended contracts) for labor market performance (Bentolila, Dolado, Jimeno, 2020,Boeri, 2011). One of the dimensions analyzed is the existence of contemporaneous wage differentials between temporary and permanent workers. Most of the results point to a wage penalty for workers on fixed-term contracts (e.g.,Booth, Francesconi, Frank, 2002,Kahn, 2016,Laß, Wooden, 2019,Mertens, Gash, McGinnity, 2007) though some recent evidence highlight potential wage premiums (Albanese and Gallo, 2020). We add to this literature by focusing on how past experience accrued in temporary versus permanent jobs affects current wages. Our results suggest that the costs of being employed on temporary contracts build up over the course of workers’ careers, leading to a lower wage return on experience accumulated with fixed-term contracts.A parallel literature has investigated the impact of temporary employment on workers’ careers. Although empirical evidence on whether temporary employment is a stepping stone or a dead end to stable employment is mixed (Filomena, Picchio, 2021,Ichino, Mealli, Nannicini, 2008), what is less controversial is that fixed-term contracts penalize workers in the long run, due to a less continuous employment path and lower wage growth (e.g.,Amuedo-Dorantes, Serrano-Padial, 2007,Autor, Houseman, 2010,Booth, Francesconi, Frank, 2002,García-Pérez, Marinescu, Vall Castello, 2019). We contribute to this literature by showing that even when workers are able to continuously work during their career, they are penalized from acquiring experience in fixed-term contracts.Our analysis also contributes to the growing literature that links heterogeneous returns to experience to differences in learning opportunities based on firm type (Arellano-Bover, Saltiel, 2021,Gregory, 2020,Pesola, 2011), coworkers quality (Jarosch et al., 2021), or city size (de la Roca and Puga, 2017). We show that one-the-job learning under alternative contractual arrangements also leads to heterogeneous wage-experience profiles.We also complement the existing literature on human capital accumulation and skill transferability. Existing studies have looked at the portability of skills acrossindustries(Neal, 1995,Sullivan, 2010), occupations (Kambourov, Manovskii, 2009,Robinson, 2018), locations (Jara-Figueroa et al., 2018), firms (Lazear, 2009), tasks (Gibbons and Waldman, 2004), or more generally across jobs (Gathmann and Schönberg, 2010). We contribute to this line of work by linking the acquisition of skills in fixed-term and open-ended contracts to their portability. We show that differences in learning opportunities between contracts generate wage penalties when workers move to jobs where their skills are transferable and could be compensated.Finally, our paper relates to the literature that studies the consequences of flexible labor practices, such as zero-hours contracts (Dolado et al., 2021), informal contracts (Ponczek and Ulyssea, 2021), or dependent self-employment contracts (Roman et al., 2011). Our results points to lower human capital accumulation in fixed-term contracts, a channel for negative labor market performance that potentially extends to other short-term flexible work arrangements.The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows.Section 2characterizes the Spanish labor market, whereasSection 3presents the conceptual framework behind our reduced-form analysis.Section 4describes the data.Section 5introduces oureconometricapproach and discusses the results on contract-specific returns to experience.Section 6explores the human capital channel behind our results, andSection 7documents the implications for wage trajectories.Section 8concludes.",Jose,Laura,Alessandro
"1. IntroductionNow, many firms give their employees the option to work from home (WFH). Although a WFH arrangement has become a reality for some, many employers were hesitant to provide this option until recently, citing suspicions about employees’ misuse of freedom over assigned work and the resulting increased risk of “shirking from home.” The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, however, dramatically changed this pattern. In response to increasing infections and deaths, in mid-March 2020, many European governments called for social distance measures to slow the virus’ spread, including restrictions on going to work. By the end of the spring of 2020, about half of the employed population in many Western countries worked exclusively from home (Bonacini, Gallo, Scicchitano, 2021,Brynjolfsson, Horton, Ozimek, Rock, Sharma, TuYe, 2020,Dingel, Neiman, 2020,Felstead, Reuschke, 2020,Kunze, Hampel, Zimmermann, 2020,Schröder, Entringer, Goebel, Grabka, Graeber, Kroh, Kröger, Kühne, Liebig, Schupp, Seebauer, Zinn, 2020). This ‘forced’ innovation of WFH, though not a perfect “natural experiment” as not all employees could feasibly take up WFH, allowed social scientists to analyze the relationship between WFH and employee performance. With WFH expected to remain in practice even after the pandemic ends (Barrero et al., 2021), a comprehensive assessment of employees’ WFH performance is relevant to establishing future policies.In theory, WFH should increase employees’ authority over working time, pace, and workplace. Following this line of argument, some existing research suggests that increasing workers’ authority over delegated tasks can positively influence their performance (Eaton, 2003,Kelliher, Anderson, 2010,Lyness, Gornick, Stone, Grotto, 2012) and that there is a positive link between WFH and employee performance, e.g., hourly productivity (Bloom et al., 2015) and work effort (Beckmann, Cornelissen, Kräkel, 2017,Bloom, Liang, Roberts, Ying, 2015,Rupietta, Beckmann, 2018). Furthermore, an individual’s job-related and household characteristics play an important role in the productivity association, which we consider in our attempt to understand the relationship between WFH and employee performance. For instance, the use of technology at work can determine the nature of the expected relationship. The employers’ ability to monitor worker efforts can vary between high-tech and low-tech sectors. Also, the degree of oversight may differ by the nature of the occupation and job function. For example, in the case of customer service call centers, employers can monitor operators’ work efforts in real time (e.g., the number of calls taken, length of calls, and ratings from end of call surveys), while such oversight is not readily available in sectors that do not use similar monitoring tools. Similarly, individuals’ household characteristics (e.g., number of children, household size, availability of a separate working room, stable internet) can determine how effectively they can work from home. For instance, parents of school-age children may find it more challenging to concentrate on their work than their childless counterparts, especially during pandemic-led school closures.Using the novelUnderstanding Society COVID-19 survey datafrom the UK, this paper investigates whether employees’ WFH frequency is associated with their work performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dependent on the availability of outcome variables, the baseline estimation sample consists of employed respondents interviewed in the following three COVID-19 survey waves: 5 (September 2020), 7 (January 2021), and 9 (September 2021). Using the information on their WFH behavior, we construct our primary explanatory variable of interest, a dummy variable indicating the increase in the respondents’ WFH frequency during the pandemic compared to the baseline period in January/February 2020. The primary outcome variable reflects the change in work performance in the same period, measured by the change in their self-reported hourly productivity. Other outcomes include employees’ weekly hours worked and weekly wages (net payments).The baseline estimation model investigates whether increases in WFH frequency are associated with changes in the respondents’ work performance. The results show that increases in WFH frequency during the pandemic are positively related to hourly productivity. In contrast, we find that increases in WFH are unrelated to changes in weekly hours worked and wages. Further subsample analyses suggest that the positive WFH-productivity association primarily applies to employees surveyed in months when strict lockdown measures were not imposed. Furthermore, the positive association with productivity becomes weaker for parents with homeschooling needs during school closures. We then investigate the effect of heterogeneity in the baseline relationship. Concerninggender differences, we find that females show a stronger WFH-productivity association if they work in more WFH-feasible jobs or have higherautonomyover their work pace and hours. Meanwhile, male employees who previously had a longer commute to their jobs exhibit increased productivity when beginning to WFH during the lockdown.Although COVID-19-related increases in WFH offer an appropriate setting for studying the association between WFH and hourly productivity, selection into WFH may distort our findings. In particular, not all employees were forced to WFH, and those who were asked to do it were not necessarily working from home during the entire pandemic period, i.e., more employees were asked to WFH during lockdown months than in months when strict lockdowns were not imposed. Moreover, as performance measures and WFH behavior are only available for the employed during the pandemic, our results may be representative of a selective group. We exploit the richness of the data to visit the extent of selection in this context. Based on the available data and our analysis, we suggest that the estimates presented in this paper should not be interpreted as causal estimates of WFH’s impact on employee performance but simply as correlations.Our paper makes the following contributions to existing literature. First, we contribute to the emerging literature investigating the connection between WFH and employee performance. To this end, in addition to the pre-pandemic research demonstrating the link between voluntarily-taken WFH and employee performance (Beckmann, Cornelissen, Kräkel, 2017,Bloom, Liang, Roberts, Ying, 2015,Rupietta, Beckmann, 2018), we contribute to the small yet growing body of literature on the topic that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic (Adrjan, Ciminelli, Judes, Koelle, Schwellnus, Sinclair, 2021,Baert, Lippens, Moens, Sterkens, Weytjens, 2020,Bonacini, Gallo, Scicchitano, 2021,Etheridge, Tang, Wang, 2020,Felstead, Reuschke, 2020,Feng, Savani, 2020,Kunze, Hampel, Zimmermann, 2020,Lee, Tipoe). Our results indicate the existence of a modest positive association between WFH and employee productivity even when WFH is introduced by the government. Second, WFH and employee performance during the pandemic in the UK is still rarely studied. For instance, using data similar to the data analyzed in this paper,Etheridge et al. (2020)report mean hourly productivity changes for individuals working from home and find that they reported higher WFH productivity in June 2020.1Different from their approach, our analysis considers all employees, including those who never worked from home during the pandemic. In this regard, our use of a dedicated and large reference group of employees in the empirical analysis — those who observe no change in their WFH behavior or have never participated in WFH before and during the pandemic — helps us capture the general effects of the pandemic on labor market outcomes and sets the paper apart from emerging literature on the topic (Feng, Savani, 2020,Kunze, Hampel, Zimmermann, 2020,Lee, Tipoe). Third, we use three measures for performance and mainly focus on hourly productivity. Our analysis spans a relatively large time horizon, approximately one and a half years after the outbreak of the pandemic, which sheds some light on the persistence of a higher performance induced by increased WFH frequency. We also describe how the links between WFH and hourly productivity differ across observation periods (lockdown and non-lockdown),demographicgroups (gender and parenthood) and job-related characteristics (WFH feasibility, work autonomy, and commutes).As the pandemic continues to rage worldwide and is likely to result in structural changes in the labor market permanently affectingwork environments(Baert, Lippens, Moens, Sterkens, Weytjens, 2020,Kunze, Hampel, Zimmermann, 2020), we further investigate whether employees’ recent WFH experiences relate to their desires to WFH in the future. We find that increases in WFH frequency and subsequent WFH productivity are intimately associated with the respondents’ willingness to perform more WFH in the future, a finding particularly relevant for policymakers and employers aiming to expand flexible WFH arrangements. Our findings also call attention to mitigating policies aimed at curing the adverse differential experiences of WFH arrangements. The results suggest that necessary support for those who WFH, especially always-open childcare facilities for working parents, should be considered.The remainder of the paper is set up as follows. The next section elaborates on the UK’s COVID-19 pandemic situation, reviews related literature, and discusses the theoretical foundations of our expected results.Section 3describes the data sources we employ, defines variables used in the empirical analysis, and outlines our estimation strategy.

"1. IntroductionWhy does the unemployment rate rise during recessions? A large body of literature has decomposed unemployment variations into components attributed to the inflows into and outflows from unemployment. The main conclusions being that the ins and outs of unemployment are both important to varying degrees.1Understanding which of these forces drives unemployment variation is thought to be fundamental to our understanding of how recessions impact labour markets, in particular whether there is predominantly either a spike in separations or a decline in hiring.The rise in employment to unemployment transitions during recessions does, however, not have to be due to an increase in separations. Instead, the rise could be due to a decline in job finding conditional on separation.2Attributing changes in employment to unemployment transitions as due to changes in separations may be inaccurate. In this paper I quantify the importance of the separation and job finding channels, where I importantly allow for the large heterogeneity in the reason workers separate from jobs. My results outline the role of changes in overall layoffs and quits, and illustrate how ignoring heterogeneity in the reason for separation can create considerable bias in the importance of the job separation and job finding channels.This is not the first paper to acknowledge that employment to unemployment transitions can be split into job separation and job finding components.Bachmann (2005)andNagypal (2008)both show that the proportion of workers who move to new employment following a separation drops in recessions, and that separations remain stable. This observation may lead one to conclude that separations are unimportant. As I discuss inSection 2, and is acknowledged byBachmann (2005)andNagypal (2008), this conclusion may be premature. The reason being because all separations are not identical. Some separations occur when a worker enjoys their job but has received a superior offer and almost certainly will transition to the new job; others occur because a worker has begun to find their job unsatisfactory and may quit to unemployment if a job offer does not arise; and some separations are employer initiated and are plausibly likely to result in unemployment. These differences in the reason for separation not only likely result in different outcomes, but also change in different directions during recessions.3Ignoring these compositional changes may result in inaccurate conclusions.This paper offers three main contributions in relation to previous work. First, inSection 3, I document large variation in outcomes by reason for separation in the US and UK, both between layoffs and quits, but also by heterogeneity in the reason for quitting. Some reasons for separation almost never result in unemployment, whilst others very often do. I show that this heterogeneity in the reason for separation varies differently over the business cycle. As is well known, layoffs rise and quits decline during recessions. The decline in quits is, however, driven by the subset of quits that almost never result in a transition to unemployment.Second, inSection 4, I incorporate a decomposition of the ins of unemployment followingNagypal (2008)into a non-steady state decomposition of unemployment dynamics as inElsby et al. (2015). The decomposition fromNagypal (2008)splits the employment to unemployment rate into three components: (i) separating, (ii) remaining in the labour force following the separation, and (iii) subsequently not finding a job. I allow these individual components to depend on the underlying reason for separation, and detail analytically how this can impact the results.Third, I estimate the contribution of fluctuations of overall separations, layoffs, quits and job finding to the dynamics of the unemployment rate over a period of two decades which includes theGreat Recession. If separations are treated as uniform, changes in the separation rate drive close to none of unemployment variation. Allowing for heterogeneity in the reason for separation increases the contribution to a quarter in the US. Despite this, I find that job finding conditional on separation is also an important driver of the dynamics of the ins of unemployment in both countries. I show that these results are not driven by fluctuations in observable characteristics such as changes in on-the-job search; robust to adjustments for time aggregation and classification error; and discuss other caveats with worker flow analyses.The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows.Section 2discusses the decomposition of the ins of unemployment and outlines two conceptual issues with this decomposition.Section 3discusses the data, presents cross sectional heterogeneity in outcomes by reason for separation, and documents how these reasons for separation change over the business cycle.Section 4shows how it is possible to assess the fluctuations of the decomposed ins of unemployment in a three-state system, presents the results, studies the Great Recession, and presents further results and robustness.Section 5provides further discussion relating this paper to existing empirical and theoretical work, andSection 6concludes.",Michael,None,None
"1. IntroductionPaid parental leave as it is common in many industrialized countries has been shown to be associated with higher women’s employment rates on the one hand, but lower relative wages at extended durations of paid leave on the other hand (e.g.Ruhm, 1998). A synthesis of many empirical studies from various countries and institutional settings shows that there seems to be a non-monotonic relationship between the length of the leave and mothers’ labor market outcomes (e.g.Olivetti and Petrongolo, 2017). Besides promoting work-family life balance, family policy often defines additional goals such as child well-being and financial security for families that might conflict with the goal of strengthening the labor market attachment and, thereby, the economic independence of mothers. Against the background of various potential trade-offs, many countries are currently discussing the optimal design of parental leave policies. Germany implemented a parental leave reform in 2007 that changed the old parental leave benefit scheme in three important ways. First, it replaced a means-tested benefit targeted at lower-income families by an earnings related transfer that is paid to all families. Second, while the duration of job-protection (36 months) has not been changed, the maximum duration of paid leave was cut from 24 to 12 months. Depending on household income and individual pre-birth earnings, this changed work incentives for mothers in the first and second year after giving birth. Incentives to take a leave for one year have strongly increased for mothers with high pre-birth earnings. For mothers with low pre-birth earnings andlow household income, incentives to take up employment in the second year after giving birth have increased. Third, the new parental leave scheme introduced a ”daddy quota” of two months. This means that two out of 14 months are earmarked individually to each parent. If one (non-single) parent does not take parental leave, the maximum duration of paid parental leave for the family is twelve months.Several empirical evaluation studies have shown that this reform had the expected short-runlabor supply effectsfor mothers: Labor supply of mothers with high pre-birth earnings decreased in the first year after giving birth, whereas labor supply of mothers with low pre-birth earnings increased in the second year after giving birth (see, e.g.Bergemann, Riphahn, 2011,Bergemann, Riphahn, 2015,Geyer, Haan, Wrohlich, 2015,Kluve, Schmitz, 2018,Kluve, Tamm, 2013,Welteke, Wrohlich, 2019). Much less, however, is known about the medium- and long-run effects of this parental leave reform. One study byKluve and Schmitz (2018)has shown that the parental leave reform positively affectedjob characteristicssuch as duration of contract in the medium run, in particular for high-income mothers, in the medium-run. Evaluation studies that analyzed previous reforms of maternity leave in (West) Germany from the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s have shown that extensions of paid leave and the job-protected leave have increased the employment interruptions of mothers (Schönberg and Ludsteck, 2014). These longer employment interruptions had – with one exception – no negative effects on mothers’ earnings in the medium term (i.e. up to six years after giving birth).1Our paper contributes to the literature in two ways. First, we broaden the focus from the short and medium-term perspective to long-term outcomes, i.e. up to nine years after giving birth. Second, we investigate the effects of the 2007 parental leave reform on mothers’ earnings - an outcome that has not been analyzed in this context so far. To this end, we use administrative data from the Integrated Employment Biographies (IEB) of the Institute of Employment Research (IAB) that contain information on the total population of individuals in Germany who have an employment contract subject tosocial security contributions. For the identification of the causal effect of the parental leave reform of 2007 on mothers’ earnings we follow previous literature on short-term effects of parental leave in Germany and exploit the quasi-experiment that was provided by the unanticipated introduction of the parental leave benefit in January 2007. In particular, we compare mothers whose first child was born in the last quarter of 2006 (control group) to mothers whose first child was born in the first quarter of 2007 (treatment group). In order to take seasonal differences into account, we add first-time mothers who gave birth to a child in the last quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006 and employ a difference-in-differences approach.Our results confirm previous findings and show that the parental leave reform has increased employment interruptions for mothers with high pre-birth earnings by almost three months on average. However, these longer employment interruptions did not lead to lower earnings in the long run. On the contrary, we find that two to nine years after giving birth, these mothers have higher earnings. This result is obtained both, in a sample of all mothers who have been employed prior to giving birth as well as in a sample of mothers returning to work after giving birth. For mothers with low pre-birth earnings, on the other hand, the results are different: we do not find positive effects on earnings in the medium and longer run (i.e. 5 to 9 years after giving birth).Based on further empirical analyses, we are able to rule out that the positive earnings effects of mothers with high pre-birth earnings are caused by a change in working hours, socio-demographic characteristics of working mothers, changes in fertility patterns or changes in employer stability.One potential mechanism causing the increase in mothers’ earnings in the first couple of years after giving birth could be the increased share of fathers getting involved in childcare due to the reform. Descriptive evidence shows that fathers whose partner has high earnings had the strongest reaction to the introduction of the “daddy quota” and started taking parental leave at much higher rates than the average. Previous studies have shown that paternity leave can increase fathers’ involvement in childcare and has the potential to reduce gender specialization in market work and unpaid care work. Thus, we hypothesize that the increased involvement of fathers in parental leave could have facilitated mothers’ re-entry into the labor market, increased their productivity and thereby also increased their earnings.From a policy perspective, our results show that granting a more generous benefit in the first year in order to provide a financial safeguard for families with young children together with introducing a ‘daddy quota’ within the parental leave scheme has increased the duration of employment interruptions for certain groups of mothers without harming their long-term career perspectives. In contrast, mothers with high pre-birth earnings even experience positive effects on their earnings. Thus, the suspected trade-off between providing a safeguard for families with a new-born child and strengthening mothers’ labor market attachment and their long-term economic independence does not seem to be empirically relevant in the context of the German parental leave reform of 2007. In fact, there is suggestive evidence that this trade-off could have been mitigated by simultaneously incentivizing the use of parental leave by fathers, thereby facilitating the re-entry into the labor market for mothers after their family-related employment interruptions.However, our results also reveal that only mothers with medium or high incomes benefited from this parental leave reform in terms of higher long-term earnings. Low-income mothers potentially lost income due to the cut of the maximum duration period, and they did not gain higher earnings in the medium or long run.The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we describe the institutional setting and summarize the related literature.Section 3presents the empirical approach, whilesection 4provides information on the data.

"1. IntroductionIn January 2019, the Mexicanauthorities increased the minimum wage at the country’s northernborderby 100% and decreased the value-added tax (VAT) rate from 16% to 8%. The policy combination aimed at boosting investment at the border while reducing incentives to migrate to the US (Conasami,Diario Oficial de la Federación). In the rest of the country, the minimum wage was raised by 16.21%, and there was no change in the VAT rate. We study the effects of such sizable policy changes on prices at the northern border, as understanding the price impact is essential to evaluate the effects on workers’ purchasing power (ILO, 2016).The Mexican context is relevant, first, because the changes are substantial compared to other policy shifts analyzed in the minimum wage and VAT literature. Their magnitude helps identify their effects, as they may induce considerable price adjustments.1,2Second, it is also relevant because of the simultaneous implementation of both policies. Their effect on prices may be countervailing, reducing the risk of a price increase that the minimum wage hike could bring about. More generally, these policies can impact employment, earnings, andliving standardsand may reinforce or counteract each other.The combination of a higher minimum wage and a lower VAT tax rate may be specific to the Mexican context. However, it is not uncommon for governments to implement policy combinations when trying to achieve particular goals. Therefore, it is usually a challenge for policy evaluation to rigorously identify the specific effects of each policy on the economy and the behavior of economic agents. We are able to disentangle the effects of the two simultaneously implemented policies by exploiting a combination of industrial and geographical differences that translate into exogenous variation in the incidence of each reform.Our identification strategy can be summarized as follows. First, to estimate the effect of the minimum wage increase on goods subject to VAT, we exploit the variation in the incidence of the minimum wage acrossindustrieson the northern border. Second, we identify the effect of the minimum wage increase on Non-VAT goods using the differential increases in the minimum wage along the country’s Northern Region (northern border vs. rest of the Northern Region). Third, to estimate the effect of the VAT rate reduction, we first compare the prices of VAT goods between the northern border and the rest of the Northern Region (which yields a combined effect of VAT and minimum wage changes). Then, we subtract the estimated effect of the minimum wage on VAT goods.We find that the lower VAT rate counteracted the price increase caused by a higher minimum wage. We estimate that the minimum wage led to a 1.2% increase in the Mexican northern border’sconsumer price index. In contrast, the VAT rate reduction resulted in a 2.57% decrease, for an overall combined effect of a 1.37% price reduction. The increase in the minimum wage by itself would have, on the net, increased the purchasing power of low-wage workers at the expense of reducingreal wagesfor high-wage and informal workers. However, the VAT rate decrease implied that the overall policy’s effect was an increase in the purchasing power of all workers.The degree of informal labor in the production of different goods seems to be playing a role in the impact of the minimum wage on prices. In particular, the effect on Non-VAT goods, produced with a higher share of informal labor, is small and imprecisely estimated. At the same time, it is economically and statistically significant for VAT goods, which tend to have a lower degree of informality. Moreover, among VAT goods, those with lower levels of labor informality show a higher pass-through. Our analysis suggests that it is essential to consider this heterogeneity while evaluating the effects of the minimum wage on prices in countries where labor informality is a critical element in the labor market’s structure.Many studies have found evidence of the pass-through of higher minimum wages onto prices in the US, with varying degrees of transmission (Aaronson, French, MacDonald, 2008,Leung, 2021,MacDonald, Aaronson, 2006,MaCurdy, 2015,Renkin, Montialoux, Siegenthaler, 2020). For developing countries, a survey byLemos (2008)suggests that the evidence is mixed, although more recent studies find significant positive impacts.3We contribute to the literature by providing estimates of the effect of a large and sudden minimum wage increase in a middle-income country. We also suggest that it is relevant to look at informal labor shares in the production of goods to understand the magnitude of the pass-through. The context also allows us to show how the effects can be counteracted by simultaneously implemented policies, like the VAT rate decrease in this case. Separating the effects is relevant for proper identification and because of the policy implications. In this regard,Campos-Vazquez and Esquivel (2020)analyze the same episode as the one analyzed in this paper but do not provide separate estimates for the impact of each policy.On the VAT side, several papers estimate different pass-through rates of VAT changes onto prices, and some of them document important asymmetries in the effects of VAT rate increases and reductions (Benedek, De Mooij, Wingender, 2015,Kosonen, 2015,Politi, Mattos, 2011).4Our estimates for Mexico show a partial pass-through of the VAT reduction onto prices that materializes quickly, occurring over the lapse of one month. For the Mexican context,Aportela and Werner (2002)andMariscal and Werner (2018)study the effect of a VAT rate increase in 1995 and 2014. Our VAT elasticity estimates for the 2019 reform are higher than those found in the referred studies. Also, for Mexico,Racimo (2018)looks at elasticities to the VAT rate separating goods that are sold in formal and informal establishments, finding that they are not statistically significant in the latter case.The rest of the paper proceeds as follows.Section 2gives some context about the minimum wage and VAT reforms we study.Section 3describes the data we use and provides somedescriptive statistics.

"1. IntroductionUnemployment remains an important economic and social concern in Europe, even though in the European Union (EU) the (overall) unemployment rate has steadily decreased from 10.9% in 2013 to 6.8% in 2018 (Eurostat). This is particularly true for somevulnerable groups, such as youth, older workers, and migrants. Policymakers, therefore, have continued interest in getting a better understanding of whichlabour market policieswork for whom. Such understanding helps to improve the counselling process, the design, and the allocation of active labour market policies.Getting a better understanding of which programme works for whom, and subsequently determining a rule that can improve the allocation of individuals to programmes is challenging. First, estimators of programme effects are typically not designed to flexibly estimatetreatment effectsat the fine-grained individual level.1If they do, they are likely to use some parametric model for the necessary smoothing to avoid the curse of dimensionality (e.g., as inLechner and Smith, 2007), but this then risks biasing the estimator. Second, it is difficult to derive a general analytical rule that determines which individuals should be assigned (or not) to which programme to maximize a criterion, such as the overall time that these individuals are employed. Recent developments in causal machine learning (CML) propose methods that facilitate the quest for such heterogeneity analysis and assignment rules. In this paper, we use such a CML approach to estimate, at various levels of aggregation, the heterogeneity in the effectiveness of training programmes in Flanders, a region in the north of Belgium. We then use our estimates to simulate the extent to which the public employment service (PES) can enhance the effectiveness of these programmes by changing the assignment of unemployed job seekers to these programmes. We show that such reassignment can substantially improve allocations, demonstrating the value of using such CML methods for the evaluation of active labour market programmes.Machine learning methods are traditionally used for prediction (e.g.,Hastie et al., 2009). More recently, these methods have been modified such that they are useful for causal inference as well (seeAthey, 2019, andAthey and Imbens, 2019, for overviews). This literature shows how the counterfactual causal problem (e.g.,Imbens and Wooldridge, 2009) can be transformed into a combination of specific prediction problems. For this paper, these methods are of interest because they provide a way to uncover the underlying heterogeneity of the causal effects, a goal for which traditionaleconometricmethods fail to provide a systematic solution. At the same time, we will show that the causal machine learning methods will provide very similar and, hence, reliable estimates of theaveragetreatment effects as the traditional methods based onpropensity score matching.In this paper identification of the causal effect relies on the assumption of unconfoundedness. Estimation is based on the Modified Causal Forest (MCF) estimator proposed byLechner and Mareckova (2022). This builds on the Causal Forest estimators proposed byWager and Athey (2018). The main innovation is thatLechner and Mareckova (2022)improve on the objective function used to build the trees of the Causal Forest leading to improve performance. In addition, by using weight-based inference methods to estimate the approximate precision of the estimated treatment effects at the various aggregation levels of interest, from the individualized to the (grouped) average treatment effects, estimation and computation are simplified. Nevertheless, these methods are still vulnerable to biases induced by multiple testing. Readers must be aware that there exists currently no satisfactory solution to this problem (seeSection 4.4.2).To the best of our knowledge, this paper is one of the first papers that applies CML methods to analyse treatment effect heterogeneity in the evaluation of active labour market policies. It appears also to be the first paper to perform such analysis in a multiple treatment context.Knaus et al. (2020)use LASSO-based methods to evaluate the effect heterogeneity of a (single) job search programme in Switzerland using administrative data from 2003. They find substantial effect heterogeneity, but only during the first 6 months after the start of programme participation.Bertrand et al. (2017)apply the Causal Forest method ofWager and Athey (2018)within a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effect heterogeneity of a temporarypublic works programmein a less developed country. Their analysis reveals important heterogeneities, but again mostly during programme participation.Unlike the aforementioned papers, this paper considers multiple programmes and explicitly exploits the estimated effect heterogeneity to propose reallocation rules that could increase the programme performance. Two approaches are considered. A first approach aims at finding a rule that reassigns the unemployed to programmes based on the estimated individual programme effects such that it maximizes a chosen objective – here, with equal weight, respectively maximizing and minimizing the time spent in employment and unemployment over a 30-month horizon. One practical disadvantage of this “black-box” approach is that it is not transparent, making caseworkers reluctant to implement such rules (e.g.,Lechner and Smith, 2007). In addition, it may conceal that the rule implicitly raises ethical or societal concerns (e.g.,Pope and Sydnor, 2011;Whittlestone et al., 2019;Rambachan et al., 2021). We therefore also consider an approach recently proposed byZhou et al. (2022)in which optimal policy rules are derived using shallow decision trees with a small number of nodes, resulting in simple rules that are easy to comprehend.The empirical analysis uses administrative data of theFlemishPES and is based on the population of about 60,000 individuals aged between 21 and 55 who started claiming unemployment insurance benefits after an involuntary lay-off between December 2014 and June 2016. To consider labour market outcomes during at least 2.5 years (until September 2019), we evaluate the impact of participating in a subset of training programmes that were entered within the first 9 months of the unemployment spell. We focus the analysis on three training programmes: short-term vocational training (less than 6 months, SVT), longer-term vocational training (between 6 and 10 months, LVT), and orientation training (OT) that aims at helping to determine a clear occupational goal. We could only analyse a subset of the offered training programmes, for various reasons.2Consequently, by restricting the set of programmes that the reallocation rules consider, we provide a lower bound to the gains that a reassignment of unemployed to programmes can establish.The interest in using data from the Flemish PES is threefold. First, the types of training offered to the unemployed are like those offered in most other EU countries, so that findings for Flanders are of general interest. Second, the administrative data is very informative. In addition to rich socio-demographic information, the data contains extensive information on labour market histories (including sickness and past programme participation) of individuals since 1991. This makes the assumption of unconfoundedness, which is used for identification, arguably plausible (see, e.g.,Lechner et al. 2011, andBiewen et al., 2014). In fact, in a placebo exercise unconfoundedness could not be rejected (seeSection 7.1). Third, the Flemish PES displayed a high willingness to employ CML methods in future programme evaluations and assignments.The main findings of this paper can be summarized as follows. There is a cleardominanceordering in terms of the average effectiveness of the three programmes considered, both in the short-run (lock-in effects) as well as in the medium run (post-programme effects): SVT performs best, followed by LVT. Although OT also shows positive post-programme effects, the lock-in effects are so large and enduring, that the overall effect in our observation period is negative. After 2.5 years, participation in SVT increases on average the time spent in employment by 2.5 months relative to no participation. For LVT this gain is close to zero, while participation in OT decreases the number of months in employment by 1.4. There is considerable heterogeneity in the aforementioned effects. The effects are especially higher for recent migrants with low proficiency in Dutch, which is the official language in Flanders.Finally, we study to which extent the Flemish PES could improve the effectiveness of the training component of their ALMP by simulations that change the allocation of programme participants according to the individualized effectiveness of these programmes, following the two aforementioned approaches. Based on the black-box approach, we find that a reallocation that keeps programme capacity fixed could for the group affected by this reassignment on average increase, respectively decrease, the time spent in employment, respectively unemployment, by about one month and one week within 30 months. Shallow policy trees of depths 2 to 4 define policy rules that can achieve about 85% of this gain. These rules reveal that most gains are achieved by reallocating workers born abroad and with little employment experience in Belgium (i.e., typical profiles of recent immigrants) to short vocational training programmes. By contrast, it assigns older workers displaced from specific sectors and with little recent employment experience to long vocational programmes, consistent with the idea that such workers need intensive retraining for their professional reorientation. Finally, nobody would be reassigned to orientation training, because this programme is for most unemployed less effective than remaining unenrolled.The rest of the paper is structured as follows. InSections 2and3we describe the institutional setting and the data that are used in the analysis.Section 4discusses the econometric methods.Section 5presents the results with a focus on the analysis of effect heterogeneity.Section 6simulates several alternative assignment rules.

"1. IntroductionAn increasing number of studies have focused on interactions between students with different achievement in class, especially the impact of low- and high-achieving students onstudent performance(Lavy et al., 2012b;Bietenbeck, 2020;Mouganie and Wang, 2020;Huang and Zhu, 2020;Xu et al., 2022).2These studies have generally suggested that middle-achieving students do not havespillover effectsand that they can be regarded as the control group for low- and high-achieving students. Importantly, these findings imply that middle-achieving students do not havepeer effectson other students’ performance. However, if students in a class interact effectively, middle-achieving students may also have an impact on other students instead of being passively affected by their peers. Surprisingly, there is virtually no direct empirical evidence to examine the existence of middle-achieving peer effects or their impact on student performance.The identification of middle-achieving peer effects may be contaminated by selection and reflection problems (Manski, 1993).3Most studies have addressed these problems through the exogeneity and randomization of group composition (Abdulkadiroğlu et al., 2014;Gong et al., 2018;Golsteyn et al., 2021).4Similar to these studies, our study uses randomized classroom assignments in middle schools in China to evaluate the evidence for middle-achieving peer effects. On the one hand, we use a randomized sample, which can avoid the endogeneity problem caused by students selecting classes based on classmates or classroom characteristics. On the other hand, after graduating from the 6th grade, students in China are forced to change schools and enroll in a different middle school. We use the students’ academic performance in middle school as the dependent variable and the students’ effort in the 6th grade as the independent variable. This procedure aims to avoid the endogeneity problem caused by the connection between academic performance and student effort.We find a positive and significant impact of hardworking middle-achieving peers on student's test scores. Specifically, a one-percentage point increase in the share of the hardworking middle-achieving students can increase Math and English test scores by approximately 0.0041 and 0.0049standard deviations, respectively. The effect is relatively smaller on Chinese scores (0.0033 standard deviations). The results indicate that middle-achieving students are as critical with regard to influence as low- and high-achieving students, which should not be overlooked in the previous literature.In terms of the mechanisms, the middle-achieving peer effort might affect student performance through the classroom environment, student attitude, and teacher attitude. Specifically, when there are more hardworking middle-achieving peers, the classroom atmosphere improves and students tend to have more friendly classmates. In addition, students are more inclined to spend more time doing homework, have higher educational expectation, and have much pressure. Moreover, teachers tend to adopt a more interactive teaching style (question and praise students) and are more patient with and responsible for students.Further analysis suggests that the performance disparity decreases when the classroom has more hardworking middle-scoring peers. The middle-ability peers’ positive spillovers on academic performance seems to be stronger among the low-achieving students. Moreover, exposure to higher proportions of repeat middle-ability peers is associated with a significant decrease in the students’ academic performance, consistent with the positive middle-ability peer effects. We also find statistically significant spillover effects between Chinese and English, while Chinese and Math and Math and English exhibit no significant interactions. In addition to cognitive performance, the middle-ability students also affect student mental health outcomes.Our contribution is related to the following three strands of literature. First, this paper contributes to the literature by providing the first direct evidence on the impact of middle-achieving peers on students’ academic attainments. The most commonly used measure of peer effects is the leave-one-out mean, which assumes that all students are equally affected by others (Golsteyn et al., 2021). However, the average value may conceal the impact of structural changes within the group, and the gains of one group may be offset by the losses of another group. Some recent studies have found nonlinear effects between students with different achievement, thereby increasing the attention being paid to the peer effect structure (Hoxby and Weingarth, 2005;Lavy et al., 2012a;Mouganie and Wang, 2020) .5However, the recent literature on ability peer effects focuses only on the effects of low- and high-achieving students while ignoring the middle-achieving peer effect. Therefore, we include low-, middle-, and high-achieving students, as well as the leave-one-out mean, in the research framework and focus on the middle-achieving peer effect. The results suggest that after controlling for a set of conventional peer effects, the hardworking middle-achieving peers have a positive effect on student performance. This finding means that there is a middle-achieving peer effect in the context of Chinese middle schools.Second, our work uncovers the mechanisms by which middle-aptitude students affect student performance. Understanding the formation mechanism of the peer effect is crucial for the design of relevant policies (Lazear, 2001). However, the literature neglects the question of how groups who perform differently interact with each other and the further influence of this interaction on student performance (Imberman et al., 2012;Golsteyn et al., 2021) .6Our results show that the peer effect of the different student groups affects student performance through channels such as a better classroom environment, motivated learning attitudes, and responsible teachers. Meanwhile, the middle-ability peers’ positive spillovers on academic performance seems to be stronger among the low-achieving students. This finding explains the internal mechanism of the peer effect of the middle-aptitude students in reducing the classGini coefficient.Third, our conclusions are helpful for understanding the causes of performance disparity from the perspective of ability peer effects. Since classmates can learn from each other, peer effects have received intense attention from researchers and policymakers in recent years. Several studies have presented convincing evidence about gender, race, personality, and family background peer effects on student performance (Angrist and Lang 2004;Hoxby and Weingarth 2005;Schøne et al., 2019;Golsteyn et al., 2021). In terms of ability peer effects, recent studies have found that high-achieving students have a role model effect, while low-achieving students have a bad apple effect, which affects student achievement. However, these studies have ignored the influence of middle-scoring students. Meanwhile, most studies have regarded test scores as an outcome while ignoring the problem of performance disparity within the class. Therefore, our study explains how the peer effect of groups with different performance affects academic performance from the perspective of the ability peer effect. The empirical results show that the middle-achieving peer effect helps to decrease English performance disparity. This finding indicates that middle-achieving students are a neglected but important group. Therefore, we suggest that schools and teachers should pay more attention to middle-achieving students.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II describes our dataset and variables. Section III discusses the empirical strategy and randomization check. Section IV reports our main estimates and robustness checks. Section V presents the mechanism. Section VI reports the effect heterogeneity. Section VII reports some further analysis of our findings. Finally, Section VIII provides some concluding remarks.",Xiaoqi,Yinhe,Shuang
"1. IntroductionIn order to find a new job, one typically has to search for a job. This takes time and effort. In most search-and-matching models, job seekers determine their search intensity to balance the expected benefits and costs of search (Mortensen, 1986,Nekoei, Weber, 2017,Marinescu, Skandalis, 2021). There are many dimensions to job search beyond simply the number of job applications sent. Which occupations to target, at which wage rate, and whether to invest effort now or later, are all relevant dimensions to determine the speed of labor reallocation and new patterns of labor market sorting. Understanding workers’ perceived returns to job search is thus crucial in general, but also specifically relevant for understanding the labor supply response to sectoral reallocation and economic recovery in the post-Covid economy (Carrillo-Tudela, Comunello, Clymo, Jäckle, Visschers, Zentler-Munro, 2021,Hensvik, Le Barbanchon, Rathelot, 2021).In this paper, we document workers’ search behavior and their perceptions of the returns to search. To do so, we collect a two-wave panel dataset of real-time survey evidence on search behavior for workers searching on the job and for unemployed workers in the UK. At the time of data collection, the UK had emerged from formal stay-at-home orders and non-essential retail, restaurants and pubs had reopened. At the time of our first survey, 12% of employees were on furlough compared to a high of 32% in June 2020. The Government was running active advertising campaigns encouraging workers to switch into expanding areas of the economy.1The Covid-19 pandemic has caused a significant change to the level and pattern oflabor demand(Costa Dias et al. 2020). Many advanced economies have simultaneously experienced a rise in unemployment alongside labor shortages in key sectors of the economy. As public health experts increasingly predict that the virus will become endemic (Murray 2022),labor market policyhas shifted from preserving pre-pandemic employer-employee matches to encouraging displaced workers, and workers whose jobs have become durably unproductive, to find new jobs in resilient sectors of the economy.The pandemic has also significantly affected labor supply. Social distancing restrictions have seen more workers work more from home. Early polling suggests that many want to continue working from home, at least part time (Barrero, Bloom, Davis, 2021a,Barrero, Bloom, Davis, 2021b). Covid has also made new dimensions of healthinequalitysalient, potentially with consequences for the preferences of workers over the characteristics of jobs they value (Adams-Prassl et al. 2021). Frictions in adjusting working patterns within a job may thus have created new incentives for workers to switch into new jobs that better align with their preferences.Our goals are twofold. First, we provide evidence on workers’ perceptions of the returns to search. To elicit perceived returns to job search, we use hypothetical scenarios that allow us to estimate individual perceived job-search functions, i.e. how likely individuals are to receive a job offer depending on the time searched and reservation wage. This allows us to overcome limitations with survey data on realised behaviour in which search effort and reservation wages may be endogenous to perceived job finding rates (Mueller and Spinnewijn 2022). More specifically, we can approximate (i) the perceived level by asking how likely they will receive a job offer depending on a given number of hours searched, (ii) the shape of the function by varying the number of hypothetical hours searched within respondents, (iii) how the level and shape depend on the wage by varying target wages in the scenarios, and (iv) the interaction with the state of the economy by asking about search now versus later and the expected state of the economy in the future. As our survey design includes a longitudinal dimension, we can assess whether a worker’s search was successful and the degree to which this correlates with prior perceptions. Second, we analyze the degree to which the novel aspects of the pandemic recession and health shock have altered workers’ search behavior and their preferences over jobs.Concerning individual perceived returns to search, we find that respondents believe they have a 32% chance of finding a job in one month if they search for 5 hours per week. The perceived job finding probability is nearly linear in hours searched and only slightly concave for most respondents. However, the marginal return to additional hours searched is comparably low: on average, there is only a 14 percentage points (p.p.) increase in job finding probabilities for increasing search effort from 5 to 15 hours per week, i.e. for each of the additional 10 hours spent searching, the perceived probability of finding a job only increases by 1.4 p.p. This is consistent withMueller and Spinnewijn (2022)who document that only 13% of job seekers perceive a positive marginal return to search. The fact that the perceived returns to the extensive margin of searching are high but the marginal return to additional hours is comparably low might explain why time-use surveys tend to reveal low search intensities amongst job seekers. On the one hand, our findings show that, absent more detailed information, it is defensible to engage in the common practice in structural search-and-matching models of using information of job seekers’ perceived probability of receiving an offer without conditioning on search effort (Krueger, Mueller, 2016,Mueller, Spinnewijn, Topa, 2021), which is also used to motivate the functional form in theoretical search-and-matching models (Marinescu and Skandalis 2021). On the other hand, the rich heterogeneities and systematic patterns uncovered in our data suggest that more attention to behavioral responses amongst job seekers is warranted if these are key to any model’s mechanism.While respondents are over-optimistic about their job finding rate on average, we find that perceived returns to search satisfy several attractive properties. These beliefs correlate well with whether a worker received a job offer in the months following the first-wave survey: a 1 p.p. higher perceived job finding probability translates into a 0.2 p.p. higher probability of actually receiving an offer (R2=0.093). Higher target wages are associated with lower perceived job finding rates and receiving a job offer boosts the average expectation by around 8 p.p. in the second survey wave. Furthermore, we find that job finding probabilities are stationary despite the turbulences of the pandemic: workers perceive similar job finding rates when searching now compared to if they were instead searching in 6 months.We also document systematic heterogeneities in perceived job finding probabilities and marginal returns to search. Respondents who are optimistic about the future state of the economy perceive the probability of being offered a job as significantly higher than those who think the economy will not be doing better going forward. However, optimistic respondents do not perceive the returns to delayed job search as significantly higher than returns to searching immediately. This suggests that the expectations about the state of the economy that we measure are capturing a broader optimism that influences workers’ beliefs about their job finding rate. Moreover, women report higher returns to job search on average, and also perceive the marginal return to each extra hour spent searching for a job as higher. Lastly, we find evidence of significant associations between severalpersonality traitsand perceived job finding probabilities: individuals who are more willing to take risks, have higher confidence in their ability and feel that they are in control of their own life report significantly higher returns to search.We find that the novel aspects introduced by the pandemic have had a relatively limited impact on workers’ motives for search. The vast majority of on-the-job search is motivated by a desire to move into a more stable position or to increase wages, with 77% and 48% of workers, respectively, citing these two reasons as main determinants of their job search. A desire to work more from home was cited as a primary reason for searching by 14% of workers and only 5% cited that risk of Covid infection was a key motivation. Moreover, search behavior amongst employed and furloughed workers is uncorrelated with their ability to work from home. Thus, we find little evidence that pandemic-specific motivations are particularly salient in driving job search decisions.This paper contributes to three main strands of the literature. First, we provide new evidence on job search behavior during the pandemic (Carrillo-Tudela, Comunello, Clymo, Jäckle, Visschers, Zentler-Munro, 2021,Hensvik, Le Barbanchon, Rathelot, 2020,Marinescu, Skandalis, Zhao, 2020,Pan, 2020). This literature has shown that job search has responded to changes in the sectoral and occupation prevalence of job vacancies that has occurred since the start of the pandemic. Our results suggest that job search has not, however, been significantly altered by the new salience of working from home nor Covid-19 infection risk. More broadly, we contribute to the literature that has examined differences in job search strategies and behavior acrossdemographicgroups and personality traits.2Second, we provide new evidence on beliefs about the returns to search and the shape of the job-finding function using hypothetical vignettes. The use of hypothetical vignettes allows us to address the challenges that arise when using realized search behaviour and perceived returns given the endogeneity of behaviour and reservation wages to beliefs (Mueller, Spinnewijn, 2022,Spinnewijn, 2015). Closest to our paper isMueller and Spinnewijn (2022)who analyze data from the Krueger-Mueller survey (Krueger and Mueller 2016) to infer the perceived return to searching an additional hour beyond a job-seeker’s chosen search intensity. While asking for the perceived return to an additional hour of search allows to study marginal returns to search, cross-subject comparisons need to consider that most respondents will be operating at different margins. We complement this work by eliciting job-finding probabilities at a set of multiple search hours, and analyzing whether perceptions between current and future returns differ and how perceived returns vary with target wages. Moreover, our survey allows us to study richer dimensions of heterogeneity in perceived returns including personality traits, which have been documented as important factors in relation to job search.We elicit the elasticity of job finding rates with respect to effort, and find that workers perceive a comparably low return to additional hours searched. This finding lends support to the common practice of assuming constant job finding rates. Furthermore, in most cases, it has been found that job seekers are overoptimistic about their job finding rates, especially the long-term unemployed (Mueller, Spinnewijn, Topa, 2021,Spinnewijn, 2015,Arni, 2015,Potter, 2021). Our detailed and interpersonally comparable measures of perceived job finding rates also confirm that individuals tend to perceive the average probability of being offered a new job as excessively high, and that out-of-work respondents are significantly more optimistic than those who are in paid work. These beliefs contrast with the “negative duration dependence”, i.e. the adverse effect of increasing unemployment spells documented byKroft et al. (2013)using fake CV’s in a field experiment, which is also a typical feature of search models (e.g.Jung and Kuhn 2019).Finally, our work contributes to the literature that directly measures beliefs and examines their role in explaining actual behaviors. Existing work has, for example, made use of hypothetical scenarios to measure beliefs about the returns to different types of parental or educational investments (Attanasio, Kaufmann, 2017,Boneva, Rauh, 2018,Adams, Andrew, 2019) and maternal labor supply intentions (Boneva et al. 2022). To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first paper to collect interpersonally comparable measures of the perceived job finding function.3Our findings are consistent with previous work showing that subjective probabilities vary meaningfully with observable characteristics and that individuals are typically aware of differential risks, even if the level of the probabilities they state is biased (Delavande and Kohler 2009).The rest of this paper is organized as follows.Section 2describes our data collection, analysis sample, and survey modules in detail.Section 3characterizes search behavior, search effort, and the motivations for job search.Section 4provides a detailed exploration of individual perceived returns to search effort including the extent to which these correlate with realized search behavior and job offers.Section 5concludes with a discussion of the wider significance of our results.",Abi,Teodora,Marta
"1. IntroductionWhat makes a good teacher? This question has been at the center of a large literature spanning several decades. Although a definitive answer remains elusive, a consensus has seemingly emerged on some facts. Many studies have shown that generic teacher qualifications, such as teacher degree level, advanced degrees, or certification status are not good predictors of teacher quality (Hanushek, 1986;Rivkin et al., 2005;Clotfelter et al., 2007;Buddin and Zamarro, 2009;Staiger and Rockoff, 2010;Ladd and Sorensen, 2015). Conversely, subject-specific teacher qualifications tend to better predict teacher quality (Monk and King, 1994;Goldhaber and Brewer, 1997,2000;Croninger et al., 2007;Clotfelter et al., 2010), although findings in this field are more mixed and less abundant. Yet, a striking feature of this literature calls for caution when interpreting results: the vast majority of studies uses US data. A recent survey of high-quality studies from 2003 to 2018 investigating the effect of any teacher characteristics on student scores features no studies investigating teacher subject-specific qualifications outside the US (Coenen et al., 2018).1A concurrent survey of the literature onteacher effectivenessand student outcomes highlights the same issue, thus questioning the extent to which existing evidence applies to other contexts (Burroughs et al., 2019). As teachereducation programsvary greatly from country to country (Blomeke et al., 2008;Tatto et al., 2012), policymakers worldwide should be wary of existing evidence when devising policies concerning teachers. This deficit of evidence is even more critical for developing countries, which likely benefit the most from improving student achievement (Hanushek and Woessmann, 2015).In this paper, I investigate the impact of subject-specific teacher qualifications—as captured by teachers holding a major in science subjects—on student science test scores in an international setting. In most contexts, estimating the impact of teacher characteristics on student outcomes is challenging. Non-random assignment of teachers to students as well as unobservable student and teacher characteristics are the most obvious concerns from aneconometricstandpoint. I tackle these issues in a novel way by using within-student within-teacher across-subjects variation. I exploit the availability of test scores and teacher qualifications in four science subjects—biology, chemistry, physics, and earth science—available for each 8th-grade student participating in theTrends in Mathematics and Science Study 2015(TIMSS, 2015). I focus on 30 countries where science is taught as an integrated subject, namely where all science subjects are taught by the same teacher, which constitute most of the countries in TIMSS 2015. Estimates obtained using the within-student within-teacher variation are not biased by unobserved student or teacher characteristics that do not vary across subjects, thus mitigating the most serious sources of bias.I find that teacher subject-specific qualifications have a positive and statistically significant impact on student test scores. The magnitude of the impact is equivalent to 3.5% of astandard deviation(SD). Putting this figure into perspective, evidence from the US links an increase in teacher effectiveness by one SD to an increase in student math achievement by 20% SD (Jackson et al., 2014). If the variation in teacher effectiveness in the international sample that I use is similar to that in the US, teacher subject-specific qualifications would explain approximately 17.5% of the variation in teacher effectiveness. Similarly, a student would gain approximately $6825 on average in cumulative lifetime income from being taught by a teacher with subject-specific qualifications in a single grade.2Compared to other educational inputs, the effect of teacher subject-specific qualifications is equivalent to an increase of 2 h and 10 minutes of weekly classroom instruction.3Heterogeneity analyses reveal that the impact is stronger for female students, especially when they are taught by female teachers, and for students with a lower socio-economic status (SES). Concerning teacher characteristics, the impact of teacher subject-specific qualifications is stronger for teachers who also hold a major in education and follows a concave path with respect to years of teacher experience. The analysis of cross-country heterogeneities suggests that students in lower-achieving countries benefit more from being taught by teachers with subject-specific qualifications. These findings, together with the previously described larger impact of teacher with subject-specific qualifications for students with lower SES, suggest that students in more disadvantaged contexts might benefit the most from having such teachers. To shed light on the possible mechanisms through which teachers with subject-specific qualifications affect student achievement, I conduct amediation analysis. I find that up to 20% of the impact of subject-specific qualifications is explained by teachers being more confident to teach subjects in which they hold a major.This paper contributes to the literature of the impact of teacher characteristics on student test scores in three ways. First, it contributes to the existing evidence on subject-specific teacher qualifications as a determinant of student achievement in an international setting. Previous studies have generally found positive effects of subject-specific teacher qualifications on student test scores, especially for math (Monk and King, 1994;Goldhaber and Brewer, 1997,2000;Clotfelter et al., 2010), although other studies have not found any effect (Aaronson et al., 2007;Harris and Sass 2011).4However, all the evidence in this field comes from studies conducted in the US. I enrich this literature by providing first evidence that teacher subject-specific qualifications positively affect student test scores in an international setting. Further, I find a stronger effect in developing and low-performing countries. This result suggests that the current consensus of the literature on teacher qualifications may underestimate the benefits that teacher qualifications bring to students around the world. Nudging teachers to acquire subject-specific qualifications is therefore likely to be beneficial for countries worldwide, especially in developing countries.Second, I analyze the impact of subject-specific teacher qualifications in a novel way by using a within-student within-teacher across-subjects approach, with subjects belonging to the same field. Much like the more commonly used within-student across-subjects approach5, it accounts for subject-invariant student characteristics that are known to affect student achievement, such as student ability or socioeconomic background. However, it has the additional advantage of holding constant any teacher characteristics that do not differ across subjects.6Further, to the best of my knowledge, this is the first study that applies this approach in a context where the subjects belong to the same field, i.e., science, as opposed to different fields, such as math and reading. A key assumption of all the approaches that exploit within-student across-subjects variation is that unobserved sources of subject-specific student or teacher heterogeneity do not bias the estimates. Given the relatedness of the subjects, this assumption is more likely to hold in this case.The third contribution of this paper is that I focus exclusively on an important yet understudied subject: science. In the recent survey of the effect of teacher characteristics on student test scores byCoenen et al. (2018), science was among the subjects analyzed in only 11 of the 58 reviewed studies, while the majority of studies focused on math and/or reading. The lack of interest in science is at odds with the current educational and political debate. Calls to nurture science skills in school to address the need for employees with a STEM background and for a scientifically literate public have been pervasive in the last decade (Carnevale et al., 2011;President's Council of the Advisors on Science and Technology, 2012;OECD, 2016;European Commission, 2020). The literature has also shown that the impact of teacher qualifications on student test scores varies across subjects. For example, the US study byClotfelter et al. (2010)finds that the effects of teacher subject-specific certifications are, on average, positive, but very heterogeneous. Test scores of students taught by teachers with math or English certification are 11% SD and 10% SD higher, respectively, while it finds no effect for biology. Similarly,Monk and King (1994)andGoldhaber and Brewer (2000)find that teacher subject-specific qualifications have a positive impact on student math test scores, but little or no effect in science.7Harris and Sass (2011)does not find evidence of the impact of teacher subject knowledge in math and reading acquired through undergraduate coursework on students’ math or reading test scores, but it speculates that in other areas, such as science in secondary school, teacher subject knowledge may be a determinant of student test scores. I provide evidence in favor of this hypothesis.The remainder of the paper is structured as follows:Section 2describes the data and provides somedescriptive statistics.Section 3presents the estimation strategy. The main results, heterogeneities, international evidence, and robustness checks are discussed inSection 4. The mediation analysis is discussed inSection 5.Section 6concludes.",Pietro,None,None

"1. IntroductionHow do labor market institutions impact the labour market outcomes ofmigrant workers? We consider three major labor market institutions, namely occupational licensing, certification, and unionization. Occupational licensing entails that only those who meet certain prescribed standards of competence (usually in the form of educational credentials, work experience and examinations) can legally practice an occupation. Licensing affects a sizeable proportion of the workforce; about 22 percent of workers in the EU are required to hold a license to do their job (Koumenta and Pagliero, 2019), while estimates for the US range between 20% (Gittleman et al., 2018) and 29% (Kleiner and Krueger, 2013). In the case of certification, practitioners may voluntarily apply to have their skills certified by a state-appointed regulatory body or a professional association. Certification may provide access to a protected title, but it is not a legal requirement to practice the occupation. Currently about 22% of workers in the EU hold a professional certification related to their main job.1Finally, unionization is the most well-known labor market institution and it has been the subject of a vast literature. Membership is about 23% in the EU (Fulton, 2015) and 11% in the US according to the 2020 union membership rate reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.We provide a theoretical framework for comparing migrants and natives in terms of wages and representation among licensed, certified, and unionized workers. Our approach is based on two characteristics of institutions: whether they confer wage setting power to their members and whether they screen their members based on their individual characteristics (seeTable 1). The systematic comparison of migrants and natives across institutions sheds light on two mechanisms by which institutions may affect the labor market outcomes of natives and migrants. The first is wage setting power. Occupational licensing confers legal monopoly power to an organized profession, which has exclusive rights over specific activities. Through their ability to control entry into the occupation, insiders can affect labor supply and thus wages. Similarly, by organising incollective bargaining, unionization also confers wage setting power to its members. However, certification does not provide exclusive rights to specific activities, nor does it engage in collective bargaining, so it does not give any wage setting power to its members.Table 1. Labor market institutions.Empty CellNo Screening of membersScreening of membersNo wage setting powerUnregulated marketCertificationWage setting powerUnionizationLicensingNotes:The table compares labor market institutions according to the presence of screening mechanisms and wage setting power.The second and less studied mechanism is screening. Occupational licensing regulates entry into a profession by selecting its members based on individual characteristics, often through professional exams, educational and experience requirements. In the absence of licensing, these individual characteristics are typically unobservable (or very costly to verify) to employers and consumers. They are also typically unobservable to researchers. For example, workers are heterogeneous in quality, or productivity, which can be assessed by specific professional exams, but is otherwise not observable. Moreover, migrants differ from natives in terms of cultural characteristics, educational credentials, local knowledge, and language proficiency. All these variables are relevant—to some extent—for admission into licensed professions. Obtaining a license thus implies having passed a screening process and provides a signal of individual characteristics. Certification also screens workers according to their individual characteristics, although the entry standards may be different. Becoming a union member on the other hand does not involve any screening based on individual characteristics.2We propose an additive decomposition of the effects of wage setting power and screening. We exploit the fact that benefits from wage setting power are shared by all licensed and unionized workers. However, the benefits from screening are enjoyed only by workers who meet the standards for obtaining a license or certification. Overall, our results provide evidence of a dual role of institutions, which screen workers according to unobservable characteristics and provide them with wage setting power. We show that both mechanisms are important in explaining the labor market outcomes of migrants. To our knowledge, this is the first paper that decomposes the effects of institutions into these two channels. Since the academic and policy debate on occupational regulation has mainly focused on the wage setting power of institutions, this paper contributes by highlighting the role of screening, which has not received much attention in the literature.3We use data from the European Union Survey of Occupational Regulation (EU-SOR), which is a representative sample of the labor force within the EU-28 member states providing detailed information on occupational regulation and migration. The survey was carried out by a market research company in 2015 by means of telephone interviews (about 26,000 individuals were interviewed). The data discern, in a way comparable across all EU states, whether an individual holds a license to legally practice an occupation, or a certification—which is not legally required—or union membership. The data further include a rich set of individual characteristics such as age, gender, education, and wage. In the EU, workers with the same individual characteristics, in the sameindustryand type of occupation face different types of regulations across countries (and sometimes regions). This generates significant variability in regulation that can be used in the empirical analysis.Using OLS fixed-effects wage regressions, we find that labor market institutions confer significant wage premia to affiliated native workers. After accounting for observable characteristics, the average licensing wage premium is 4.0 log points, the certification premium 1.6, and the union wage premium 2.7. The first is explained by the screening effect and wage setting power of licensing institutions, the second by the screening effect of certification institutions, and the third by the wage setting power of unions. The difference between the licensing and the certification wage premium for natives (2.4 log points or 60% of the licensing wage premium) can be attributed to the legal requirement of holding a license, which is the defining characteristic of licensing.The licensing and certification wage premia for migrants are much higher, 10.3 and 6.6 log points, respectively. This is because they incorporate a large screening effect (61% and 75% of the two wage premia, respectively) that is specific to migrant workers. The union wage premium is not higher for migrants, reflecting the absence of screening into union membership. Migrant wage gaps (i.e. wage differences between natives and migrants) reflect differences in wage premia between natives and migrants. The migrant wage gap for workers with no institutionalaffiliationis 8.3 log points, and for unionized workers is about the same (8.7 log points). However, the gap is significantly lower for certified (3.3 log points) and licensed (2.0 log points) workers. This progressive drop in the migrant wage gap can be attributed to the increasing intensity of screening of migrant workers.We also estimate the difference between natives and migrants in the probability to be licensed, certified, and unionized (the migrant representation gap). This is substantial for licensed workers (3.2 percentage points or 15%), which implies that there is a large difference in screening for natives and migrants. We find no significant representation gap among certified workers, which implies the absence of large differences in screening for natives and migrants in certified markets. We find no significant representation gap for unionization, which is consistent with no screening by unions.To provide additional evidence on screening by institutions, we compare the labor market outcomes of migrants from different countries. If migrants from countries that are culturally distant from the host country are worse in terms of unobservable variables, then the migrant wage gap for unregulated and unionized workers is expected to be larger for these workers. In contrast, since licensed and certified migrants are subject to the same screening process, independently of the country of origin, the migrant wage gap is expected to be the same for these workers. To test this hypothesis, we measure cultural distance across countries based on language differences and differences in legal origin. Our results on wage and representation gaps support the notion that certification and licensing, but not unionization, screen migrants based on unobservable characteristics that are correlated with cultural differences.",Maria,Mario,Davud
"1. IntroductionOccupations, defined by what people do at work and the knowledge required to do those work tasks, are a fundamental unit inlabor market analysis. They are a major determinant of wages, accounting for a greater share of the variance of log wages or earnings than education, arguably because occupations better signal what workers do at a job than does education.1Analytic attention to occupations has, however, varied over time. Human capital analysis directed attention at education and rates of return to years of schooling, superseding an earlier literature on occupational wages and employment (Perlman, 1958,Reder, 1955). Beginning in the 2000s, there has been renewed investigation of occupations as units of analysis. One reason is concern for how technological change affects the demand for specific tasks, which are occupation associated (Autor et al., 2003). Another is that the explanatory power of occupations for wages relative to that of education also appears to have been rising in recent decades.2In developing countries, where formal educational attainments are relatively low and on-the-job learning is critical inskill formation, education has never sufficed as an indicator of labor skills.Nevertheless, analyses of occupational wage differentials worldwide are rare – a gap thatAshenfelter (2012)attributes to the paucity of internationally comparable data on occupational pay. This paper fills this gap by introducing and analyzing an extended version of the “Occupational Wages around the World” (OWW) database (Freeman and Oostendorp, 2000) that reports wages in many detailed occupations in 192 countries based on the International Labor Organization’s “October Inquiry” of pay. From 1953 to 2008, the October Inquiry gathered wages from national statistical offices in more countries and on a greater number of identically defined detailed occupations than any other data source, and then was abandoned.3We study the determinants of occupational pay differentials in the OWW, considering changes in supply, demand, and labor market institutions. Since World War II, the supply of educated persons has increased greatly due to the phenomenal global increase in formal education, with average years of schooling across countries increasing from about 3 years in 1950 to more than 8 years in 2010 (Barro and Lee, 2013).4Supply is therefore a key variable for the study of skill premia. We identify occupationallabor supply effectsby combining country level data on the distribution of workers by education across occupations from the World Bank I2D2 database byMontenegro and Hirn (2009)with country-level data on educational attainments from the Barro-Lee database. Keeping the occupational distributions by education fixed over the study period but allowing the educational distribution to change over time gives us an estimate of the effect of the expansion of education on the supply of workers by occupation in a country. To the extent that aggregate changes in educational attainments are exogenous with respect to occupational wages, we can use these estimated education supply shifts to identify the effect of changes in occupational labor supply on occupational wages.5In contrast, our measures of demand and institutions are based oncountry leveldata. For demand, we use GDP per worker and merchandise exports plus imports over GDP as measures of the level and trade orientation of aggregate demand. To reflect the effect of institutions on wages, we use country level union density. Since we lack measures of demand and unionization at thecountry-occupationlevel, we employ a different strategy to assess the impact of these country level variables on skill premia. Our strategy is to estimate separate equations for occupations with differingskill levelsthat allows for those country level variables to affect occupations differently. All of ourregression analysesinclude country-occupation and period dummy variables so that estimates rely on within country-occupation changes over time.Section 2introduces the updated 2020 OWW database together with evidence on the importance of occupations for wages, especially relative to formal education, in a broad sample of countries drawn from theLuxembourg Income Study Database. The Section documents similar patterns of change in occupational differentials among countries at different levelsof economic developmentin the OWW data. Differentials narrowed substantially in most countries from the 1950s to 1980s and then widened through the mid 2000s.Section 3uses country data on the distribution of workers by educational attainment among occupations to estimate how increased levels of education altered the supply of workers to occupations. Our results show that in countries where educational attainments are low, a non-negligible proportion of persons in a skilled occupations has a low level of formal education. This points to the importance of informal learning on the job, which will be reflected in their pay: low education persons get higher pay in more skilled occupations, which is taken into account by occupational skill premia.Section 4presents our regressions of log wages by country-occupation on supply, demand and union drivers of wages. The estimates indicate that shifts in labor supply narrowed wage differentials between high and low skilled occupations. By contrast, increases in trade orientation were associated with increasing wage differentials, driven in particular by developing countries. The fall in union density in most countries from the 1980s through the 2000s also contributed to the increase of wage differentials by lowering pay primarily for less skilled workers.Section 5shows that our estimates of the effect of demand, supply, and unionism on occupational pay explain part but not all of the pattern of skill differentials.Section 6reviews wage data on occupational differentials from the period after the OWW terminated in 2008 and makes a case for new detailed occupational wage data to aid analysis of the impact of new technologies onlabor demand. The Appendices detail the sources of the data and probe the robustness of results.",David,Richard,Remco
"1. IntroductionIn the years since the publication ofImbens and Angrist (1994), applied researchers have embraced the interpretation ofInstrumental Variables(IV) estimators as measuring the impact of treatment on the subset of respondents who comply with the instrument. For binary instruments, Imbens and Angrist call this the Local AverageTreatment Effect, or LATE. The LATE framework allows researchers to consistently estimate interpretable causal parameters in the presence of treatment effect heterogeneity.The LATE framework, however, comes with some costs. First, the LATE approach requires the assumption that instruments have a “monotonic” impact on behavior. Put differently, the instruments must induce all agents to behave in a weakly uniform manner when subjected to a change in the value of the instrument. Informally, if the instrument induces some agents to enter the treatment, then the instrument must not induce any agent to leave the treatment. Second, relative to approaches based on conditional independence, LATE identifies a treatment effect only for a very specific sub-population of the treated. Third, treatment effect heterogeneity invalidates the traditional Durbin-Wu-Hausman test for selection: The relationship between the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and IV estimands becomes completely uninformative about the existence of selection within the LATE framework.1Thus, researchers face the paradox of using IV to address potential selection on unobserved variables, but with no clear evidence that such selection exists.Consider the binary treatment framework ofAngrist et al. (1996), with a binary instrumentZi∈{0,1}. Without loss of generality, letZi=1increase the likelihood of treatment. They show that we may divide agents into three mutually exclusive sets: the “always-takers (A),” defined as the sub-population withDi(1)=Di(0)=1, the “never-takers (N),” defined as the sub-population withDi(1)=Di(0)=0, and the “compliers (C),” defined as the sub-population withDi(1)=1andDi(0)=0, whereDi=Di(Zi)denotes the treatment choice of agent “i” as a function of the binary instrumentZi, withDi=1for treatment andDi=0for no treatment. In this framework, the Wald estimand corresponds to a LATE or(1)ΔW=E(Yi|Zi=1)−E(Yi|Zi=0)E(Di|Zi=1)−E(Di|Zi=0)=E(Y1i−Y0i|C)whereY1iandY0idenote the treated and untreated potential outcomes of agenti, respectively, andYi=DiY1i−(1−Di)Y0idenotes the observed outcome.Selection on unobserved variables in AIR’s (1996) binary instrument and binary treatment framework means that at least one of the following four conditions fails:(2)E(Y0i|N,Xi)=E(Y0i|C,Xi)andE(Y0i|C,Xi)=E(Y0i|A,Xi)(3)E(Y1i|N,Xi)=E(Y1i|C,Xi)andE(Y1i|C,Xi)=E(Y1i|A,Xi)whereXidenotes a vector of conditioning variables not affected by the treatment. These conditions do not imply the equivalence of the OLS and IV estimands: By construction, the set of compliers differs from the set of people receiving treatment.2Nor does equivalence of the estimands imply the conditions.3How then do we test for such selection?In this paper, we provide a set of simple tests for the presence of selection on the treated and untreated outcomes and derive measures of the magnitude of the selection in each case. We care about the incidence and magnitude of selection because (i) they inform our understanding of the underlying behavior, (ii) they affect thereasonablenessof generalizing impact estimates obtained via instrumental variables beyond the compliers, and (iii) they affect the relative attractiveness of estimates based on IV and on conditional independence in particular substantive contexts. We illustrate (i) in our empirical applications and expand on (ii) and (iii) in the penultimate section of the paper.Our tests consider two of the four conditions inEqs. (2)and(3)(or their distributional analogues) as the data do not provide information aboutE(Y0i|A,Xi)andE(Y1i|N,Xi). We provide a quick and simple diagnostic that would indicate the presence of selection on unobservables affecting the outcome; but failure to detect the presence of selection effects from our test does not prevent the existence of selection on unobservables per se. Put differently, we test necessary (but not sufficient) conditions for the absence of selection. We develop and apply tests of both conditional mean independence and conditional independence of distributions. Relative to the traditional Durbin-Wu-Hausman test that compares the IV and OLS estimates, our tests reveal substantively relevant information regarding whether selection occurs on the treated outcome, the untreated outcome, or both.Drawing on the work ofBlack et al. (2015), our tests of conditional mean independence come in two forms. First, we compare the conditional mean outcomes of agents who comply with the instrument when not treated to those of agents who never take treatment. Second, we compare the conditional mean outcomes of agents who comply with the instrument when treated to those of agents who always take treatment. Mechanically, we implement these tests by estimating outcome equations for those who are untreated, or treated, as a function of the covariates and the instruments (or the probability of selection). With a simple adjustment, our tests allow researchers to assess the economic magnitude of any selection effects as well. Our distributional tests proceed along similar lines, but replace the dependent variable with other features of the outcome distribution.Our tests resemble those inHeckman's (1979)seminal paper on the bivariate normal selection model. In the two-step estimator for the normal selection model with a common treatment effect, the inverse Mills’ ratio represents the control function, and the coefficient on the inverse Mills’ ratio identifies the correlation between the errors of the outcome equation and the selection equation. Under the null hypothesis of no selection on unobserved variables, a simple test for selection asks if the coefficient on the inverse Mills’ ratio equals zero. Allowing selection on both the treated and untreated outcomes in a trivariate normal framework, as inBjörklund and Moffitt (1987), makes the parallel to our tests an exact one.4Our paper is closely related toHeckman et al. (2010), hereinafter HSU, who derive both parametric and non-parametric tests for the correlated random coefficient model. Formally, HSU develop a test for the independence of treatment status and the idiosyncratic effect of treatment conditional on covariates. Note that selection on the idiosyncratic component of the treatment effect implies selection on one or both ofY1iandY0i, while selection on outcomes need not imply selection on the idiosyncratic component of the treatment effect.Building on the work ofHeckman, Vytlacil, 2005,Heckman, Vytlacil, 2007a,Heckman, Vytlacil, 2007b, who show that conditional independence ofY0iandY1iimplies constant marginal treatment effects, HSU (2010) propose parametric andnonparametric teststhat regress the realizations of the dependent variable against the estimated propensity score (which includes the instruments) to see if the realizations of the outcome variables are linear functions of the propensity score. But as HSU note, their non-parametric tests suffer from low power in sample sizes common in empirical studies.5Our tests also provide more insight into the precise nature of the selection problem because we allow for selection on one or both ofY1iandY0i.Similarly, in the context of a Marginal Treatment Effects (MTE) model,Brinch et al. (2017)propose testing for a constant MTE by regressingYi=Y0i+Di(Y1i−Y0i)againstDi,Ziand their interactions. As they note, the extension of their test to a model with covariates is straightforward, but for a linear parametric model the test could involve the estimation of a large number of interaction terms.Kowalski (2018a)describes alternative tests that relax the linearity assumptions inBrinch et al. (2017)and provides links to the literature in health economics that seeks to empirically distinguish moral hazard and adverse selection;Kowalski (2018b)applies her tests in the context of the OregonHealth Insuranceexperiment.Three other papers build tests on the same basic intuition as our own:Bertanha and Imbens (2020)in the context of fuzzyregression discontinuity designs,de Luna and Johansson (2014)in the context of conventional instrumental variables analysis, andHuber (2013)in the context of experiments with imperfect compliance. Casting a broader net,Angrist (2004)proposes a test that compares the estimated treatment effect for compliers to an estimate obtained using the always-takers and the never-takers. His test does not distinguish among selection on one or both ofY1iandY0iand assumes the magnitude of the treatment effect does not vary with covariates.Guo et al. (2014)provide a substantially more complex test than ours in the IV context.Battistin and Rettore (2008)andCosta Dias et al. (2013)consider related tests that exploit particular empirical contexts.Donald et al. (2014)derive a test that uses differences between estimates of the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATET) and LATE parameters in the context of one-sided non-compliance.6We add to this literature in seven ways. First, we place the tests inHuber et al. (2013),de Luna and Johansson (2014),Black et al. (2015), andBertanha and Imbens (2020)within a common framework that encompasses standard binary instruments, experiments with imperfect compliance, and fuzzy regression discontinuity designs. Second, we emphasize separate consideration of selection onY1iandY0i, which illuminates the underlying economics. Third, we develop and apply tests of conditional independence of distributions as well as tests of conditional mean independence. Fourth, we provide quantitative measures of selection that complement the qualitative inferences provided by our tests. Fifth, we link our tests to the classical literature on selection models. Sixth, we relate our tests to ongoing discussions about instrumental variables methods and the trade-offs involved between approaches that build on instruments and those that build on conditional independence. Seventh, we undertake three meaningful empirical applications, one each for standard instrumental variables, fuzzy regression discontinuity, and experiments with imperfect compliance.We find it peculiar that while the LATE revolution has led to a more sophisticated interpretation of IV estimates, researchers rarely make an empirical case via testing for the use of instrumental variables methods.Heckman et al. (1998)find that most of the difference between non-experimental and experimental estimates of the treatment effect in the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) data results from lack of common support and from differences in the distributions of covariates, leaving selection on unobserved variables to account foronly about seven percentof the difference.Blundell et al. (2005)find little evidence that their matching estimates suffer from selection bias when estimating their “single treatment” model using the very rich National Child Development Survey data. Similarly, when using comparable outcome measures for the treated and untreated units,Diaz and Handa (2006)’spropensity score matchingestimates are quite similar to the experimental evidence from the famous PROGRESA experiment with their set of conditioning variables.While by no means conclusive, matching on a rich set of covariates motivated by theory and the institutional context and limiting the analysis to the region of common support between treated and untreated units substantially reduces bias in many empirical contexts. Indeed, given the necessary, and often empirically quite large, increase in the variance of estimates when using instrumental variables methods, a researcher might well prefer a precise but modestly biased OLS estimate to a consistent but imprecise IV estimate. We see a parallel to non-parametric estimation, where researchers trade off bias and variance via the choice of a bandwidth. We develop a simple estimator of the magnitude of the bias implicit in the OLS estimate which allows a quantitative comparison of the costs and benefits of IV relative to OLS.In the next section, we outline the restrictions necessary for matching and OLS. Insection 3, we outline the necessary assumptions forImbens and Angrist’s (1994)IV estimation and the latent index approach ofVytlacil (2002). Insection 4, we outline our simple tests of conditional independence and provide formulae for the magnitude of the selection.Section 5reports on our empirical applications. Insection 6we relate our tests to the broader literatures on instrumental variables and on the choice between IV and OLS estimation of the linear model.

"1. IntroductionSince the 1970s, the increase in femalelabor force participationhas changed the demography of the workplace. In the working context, the chances of having teams diversified by gender have increased. In several countries, the introduction of gender quotas has fostered the integration of women in specific segments of the labor market: this is the case, for example, in professions such as politics and in the corporate sector. Greater female representation on political committees, company boards, and other group settings makes it important for academics and policymakers to understand theeffects of gendercomposition on team dynamics and performance. The gender composition of teams has significant consequences for corporate performance andcollective decision making(Bagues, Esteve-Volart, 2010,Born, Ranehill, Sandberg, 2020,Carter, Simkins, Simpson, 2003,Coffman, Flikkema, Shurchkov, 2021,Farrell, Hersch, 2005). Indeed, males and females show differences in attitude to risk (Borghans, Heckman, Golsteyn, Meijers, 2009,Iriberri, Rey-Biel, 2021),social preferences(Croson and Gneezy, 2009), social confidence (Alan et al., 2020), willingness to make decisions on behalf of others (Ertac, Gurdal, 2012,Ertac, Gurdal, 2019), and preferences over competitive environments (Balafoutas, Fornwagner, Sutter, 2018,Flory, Leibbrandt, List, 2015,Gneezy, Niederle, Rustichini, 2003,Gneezy, Rustichini, 2004,Niederle, Vesterlund, 2007,Saccardo, Pietrasz, Gneezy, 2018,Sutter, Glätzle-Rützler, 2015, andDatta Gupta et al., 2013). These differences may lead to different working dynamics within a team, thus affecting performance.In the work or academic context, groups are usually endogenously formed. In the presence of taste-based discrimination, individuals’ capacity to choose their teams may crucially influence teams’ gender composition and the working dynamics of male versus female-predominant teams. If individuals with specific characteristics self-select into gender-biased teams, endogeneity of group formation makes it difficult to estimate the effect of gender composition on team performance for the entire population.Azmat and Petrongolo (2014)state that, with the experimental approach, we can solve this problem through random assignment to groups. However, they also acknowledge that experiments create an artificial environment that may not mirror many real contexts. Indeed, existing experimental research that studies the impact of the gender ratio on team performance using endogenously and exogenously formed teams find differing results (Apesteguia, Azmat, Iriberri, 2012,Hoogendoorn, Oosterbeek, Van Praag, 2013). Managers and educators considering whether to form working teams themselves or to allow individuals to form them can benefit from information regarding which team formation rule maximizes performance or reduces heterogeneity across groups. In this paper, we first estimate the impact of the gender mix on team performance. We then analyze the influence of the team formation rule (exogenous versus endogenous) on team performance. Finally, we study how the possibility to self-select into teams transforms the relationship between the gender mix and team performance.We use a three-day-long mathematics camp for high-performing students to design an experiment in which we randomly divide students into two groups. In the first group, we randomly assign students to teams with different gender compositions. We call this the group of exogenously formed teams. We let the second group form their teams endogenously. Each team has six members, allowing for seven possible gender compositions. We define male-predominant teams as those with four or more males, female-predominant teams as those with four or more females, and gender-balanced teams as those with three males and three females. Using exogenously formed teams, we first study the effect of belonging to teams with various gender mixes. The outcomes we look at are tastes for gender mix in the team, team performance, individual performance, and potential mechanisms. We then investigate the effect of the team formation rule (exogenous vs. endogenous) on the outcomes using the whole sample. Third, we compare the differences between male-predominant, female-predominant, and gender-balanced teams reported for exogenously formed teams (which we can interpret as causal effects) with those reported for endogenously formed teams (which are affected by self-selection). We are particularly interested in exploring whether and how the possibility to self-select into teams reshapes the relationship between gender mix and team performance. Lastly, we investigate the mechanisms behind the relationships between the team formation rule, gender composition, and team performance, focusing on the role of ability-based sorting versus team dynamics.We find that when subjects are free to choose whom to work with, individuals display a preference for male-predominant teams and that individuals choosing gender-biased teams declare that they prefer even more gender-biased teams after the camp. Our results also show that female-predominant teams underperform other types of teams when we form teams exogenously, but these differences disappear when students form teams. We also find that endogenous male-predominant teams perform worse than exogenous male-predominant teams. Differences in performance are in line with differences in teams’ working styles, students’ self-perception, and within-team heterogeneity. Exogenous male-predominant and gender-balanced teams are more likely to specialize than exogenous female-predominant teams. Females who self-selected into male-predominant teams feel less talented than those who self-selected into other types of teams. Males who self-selected into male-predominant teams think they contributed less to the team than those who chose other types of teams. Finally, endogenous male-predominant teams show significantly higher within-team heterogeneity compared to exogenous male-predominant teams. These results contribute to explain the high performance of exogenous male-predominant teams.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We present an overview of the literature on this topic inSection 2. InSection 3, we describe the mathematics camp. We provide details on the design of the field experiment inSection 4. We describe our data inSection 5. InSection 6, we present the results of the randomization and describe the empirical strategy.

"1. IntroductionThe global pandemic led to unemployment of catastrophic proportions in the United States. From February to April of 2020, the unemployment rate spiked from 3.5 percent to 14.7 percent. In May 2020, unemployment began to recover, and by November the unemployment rate had declined by 8 percentage points. For comparison, during the recovery from the 2007-09 recession, it took ten years for total unemployment to decline by 6.5 percentage points. In December 2021, unemployment was only 0.4 percentage points above its pre-pandemic level. The recovery of the US unemployment rate has been vastly speedier than its historical pace.We propose that a key to understanding unemployment in the pandemic is to distinguish between the unemployed who do not have jobs—the jobless unemployed—and the unemployed who retain their jobs but are on layoff and, thus, not working. Our main findings are•The pandemic shock caused an outburst of unemployment of a different kind from past recessionary shocks.•This kind of unemployment—temporary-layoff unemployment—recovers at a much faster pace than typical jobless unemployment. Most people on layoff are recalled, so the time-consuming search and matching process that normally impedes a quick recovery is avoided.•Despite the huge increase in temporary-layoff unemployment, the labor market during the pandemic remained relatively tight. Job-seekers found new jobs at rates similar to those in normal labor-market conditions.•Despite the higher recovery rates from unemployment during the pandemic, its social cost was high because people on layoff were not working and, therefore, not producing goods or services.In the labor-force statistics of the United States, an individual is unemployed if not working, but available for work, and either actively looking for work or on temporary layoff, waiting to return to an existing job. We refer to the latter category of unemployment astemporary-layoff unemploymentand to the rest of unemployment—asjobless unemployment.A major difference between temporary-layoff and jobless unemployment is that temporary-layoff unemployment returns to normal much faster than does jobless unemployment. A decline in temporary-layoff unemployment takes place aseconomic conditionsimprove and firms recall workers. No search or matching is involved; firm-worker match capital is preserved. In contrast, a decline in jobless unemployment takes time. Creation of new, stable, firm-worker relationships is a long and costly process. Terminated workers often circle through a number of short-term jobs before finding a stable job (Hall and Kudlyak (2019)).Until the pandemic hit the labor market in March 2020, the great majority of the unemployed fell into the jobless category and were actively looking for work because they had low likelihoods of recall to a previous job. Only a fraction of one percent of the labor force was on temporary layoff. Unemployment was effectively synonymous with joblessness. In view of this fact, most of the search and matching models of labor market dynamics have been designed to model jobless unemployment.In contrast to previous recessions, which destroyed jobs, the pandemic prevented many millions of individuals from working, but they retained their jobs. We find that during the pandemic recession, the entire increase in the total unemployment rate from February to April came from temporary-layoff unemployment. The huge cohort of layoffs into temporary-layoff unemployment in April 2020 also accounted for most of the incidence of temporary-layoff unemployment afterwards.Temporary-layoff unemployment also accounted for the entire rapid decline in total unemployment from its peak in April through November 2020. Jobless unemployment increased during this period, reaching its peak in November 2020 at 4.9 percent—slightly less than the average historical rate. Jobless unemployment started its recovery thereafter. In previous recoveries, both total unemployment and jobless unemployment glided downward at a constant proportional rate of approximately 10 log points per year (Hall and Kudlyak (2020)). We find that the decline of jobless unemployment from its pandemic peak in November 2020 was three times faster than its historical pace, until it leveled out at 3.6 percent, its currant value as we write.Tightness is a key concept in modern thinking about labor-market conditions. In a tight market, typical job-seekers find jobs fairly rapidly. In a recession and its immediate aftermath, tightness is low and the typical job-seeker takes around twice as long to find a new job. During the pandemic, tightness governed job-finding rates for the jobless unemployed.In the pandemic, the explosion of temporary-layoff unemployment dramatically altered the relation between overall unemployment and tightness. Despite high overall unemployment rates early in the pandemic, the labor market remained reasonably tight during the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, the overall unemployment rate was a reasonable guide to job-finding rates throughout the labor market. By that standard, the labor market in November 2020, with overall unemployment at 6.7 percent, was slack. In historical times when unemployment was that high, jobs were hard to find. We show that the job-finding rate for the jobless unemployed fell in April 2020 but bounced back later. In November 2020, the job-finding rate among the jobless unemployed was at the level similar to the average rates in 2015 and 2016, when total unemployment was 5.3% and 4.9%, respectively. We note that when using unemployment to measure labor-market tightness in times of unusual volumes of temporary-layoff unemployment, it is appropriate to use the unemployment rate for jobless unemployed in place of the overall unemployment rate.The standard measure of tightness is the ratio of the number of job vacancies to the number of job-seekers. Available vacancy measures do not include the retained jobs of the temporarily laid-off workers. We note that total unemployment is not an appropriate denominator in the vacancy/unemployment measure of labor market tightness, the numerator is limited to the part of the labor market that matches active job-seekers to posted vacancies. A good deal of confusion has occurred because some commentators use total unemployment in the denominator rather than jobless unemployment.Because a substantial fraction of workers on temporary layoff do not search, but rather return to their existing jobs, we generalize the concept of job-finding to encompass recall. We call the general processwork-finding. For the jobless unemployed, the work-finding rate is synonymous with the job-finding rate, but for the unemployed on temporary layoff, the work-finding rate is considerably higher than the job-finding rate because it includes recalls. As in the pre-pandemic period, during the pandemic, the work-finding rate among the temporary-layoff unemployed was twice as high as the rate among the jobless unemployed. This also held true for the unemployed at durations of six months or longer.Our distinction between temporary-layoff and jobless unemployment is based on the expectation of recall while unemployed rather than on the outcome of recall after the fact. Recall expectations evolve over an individual’s unemployment spell, and the self-reported reason for unemployment may change. Not all individuals on temporary layoff return to their previous jobs. Some may become jobless unemployed, find new jobs, or leave the labor force. Conversely, as time passes, individuals not classified earlier under temporary-layoff unemployment may learn that they do have a possibility of recall and thus be reclassified as in temporary-layoff unemployment. The classification based on contemporaneous self-reported reason for unemployment captures expectation of recall, which in turn influences action such as search and saving behaviour.At the onset of the pandemic shock, firms found it necessary to lay off a large number of workers abruptly. They anticipated recalling them on an equally large scale, contrary to the economic circumstances surrounding previous recessions. This is evident from the abrupt explosion of mass temporary layoffs (Kudlyak and Wolcott (2020)). While we do not provide direct measures of recalls, we cite evidence from other studies that confirm that recalls indeed happened on a large scale.We note that, in the regime created by a pandemic, total unemployment retains its social significance even though a high fraction of the unemployed have retained their jobs. The overall unemployment rate remains an appropriate measure of idled labor input and lost employment income. Higher temporary-layoff unemployment implies a burden on the economy from the decline in the utilization of available labor and a corresponding decline in the earnings of the labor force. However, there is a partially offsetting social benefit from the increased time available for household activities and the preservation of job-specific human capital among workers who do return to their previous jobs.This paper is about unemployment, but we should note that the pandemic resulted in a substantial decline in the labor force as well. Expansion of unemployment and of the population outside the labor market was accompanied by contraction in employment. In February of 2020, 36.6 percent of the working-age population was out of the labor force, neither working nor unemployed. The fraction out of the labor force rose by 1.9 percentage points to 38.5 percent in November 2020 and remained high. The rise in the population out of the labor force in recessions is rarely this big. For example, in the recession that began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009, the fraction out of the labor force rate only rose by 0.3 percentage points. Analysis of the social consequences of the rise in the fraction of the population not in the labor force arising from the pandemic would proceed in parallel to the analysis of the rise in the unemployment rate.The findings in this paper show that it is vital to distinguish between temporary-layoff and jobless unemployment in modeling the pandemic labor market and the effects of the policies to ameliorate the impact of the pandemic.Lee et al. (2021)use our classification into jobless and temporary-layoff unemployment to study an unequal employment effects of the pandemic.Gertler et al. (2021)adopt our terminology of jobless and temporary-layoff unemployment in their quantitative model of unemployment dynamics and use the model to study the effect of the pandemic and evaluate the Paycheck Protection Program.Giupponi et al. (2022)use the distinction between jobless and temporary-layoff unemployment in their analysis of social insurance policies in the pandemic.The rest of the paper is organized as follows.Section 2describes related literature.Section 3describes how we measure temporary-layoff and jobless unemployment in the Current Population Survey.Section 4describes temporary-layoff and jobless unemployment before and during the pandemic.Section 5examines work-finding rates and labor-market tightness.Section 6discusses the distinction between temporary-layoff unemployment and jobless unemployment based on expectation ex ante of recall.Section 7discusses social costs of temporary-layoff and jobless unemployment.",Robert,Marianna,None
"1. IntroductionTraumatic life events can have a non-negligible impact on individuals’ mental health and well-being (Dustmann, Fasani, 2016,Kristiansen, 2021,Mahuteau, Zhu, 2016,Mervin, Frijters, 2014). Nevertheless, the ways people react to traumatic life events can differ, depending on whether their situational factors act as moderators or amplifiers. Indeed, psychological theory is clear about the importance of situational factors and their interaction with life events in determining a person’s mental health disorders (VandenBos, 2007).This paper focuses on workplace-related situational factors, namely job insecurity and job stress, and assesses the modifying role of these adverse job conditions when traumatic events occur. The focus on these job conditions is well justified in an attempt to understand the mental health effects of traumatic events for two main reasons. First, employment per se is vital to mental health (Cottini, Lucifora, 2013,Cygan-Rehm, Kuehnle, Oberfichtner, 2017,Farré, Fasani, Mueller, 2018). Second, the workplace is one of the most important venues for social interactions. Typically, for full-time employees, working accounts for most of their activities outside their homes. Therefore, job conditions could be important for workers’ mental health and, thus, theirresilienceto mental health shocks.Historically, most working conditions–related health concerns were associated with workers’ physical safety and thus their physical health. However, given the decline of themanufacturing sector, the expansion of theservice sectorand the use of digital technology, these concerns shifted gradually towards concerns regarding workers’ mental health (Cappelli, 1997,Johnson, Dey, Nguyen, Groth, Joyce, Tan, Glozier, Harvey, 2020), especially in developed countries. As a result, there is a growing body of literature on the impact of job insecurity and job stress on mental health and well-being (Belloni, Meschi, Pasini, 2016,Bünnings, Kleibrink, Weßling, 2017,Caroli, Godard, 2016,Cottini, Ghinetti, 2018,Cottini, Lucifora, 2013,Dickerson, Green, 2012,Eibich, 2015,Green, 2011,Johnston, Shields, Suziedelyte, 2020,Van Aerden, Puig-Barrachina, Bosmans, Vanroelen, 2016). Nevertheless, there is scarce literature on the labor market–related factors’ modifying effects on workers’ mental health and well-being. Notably,Green (2011)suggests that a person’semployabilityhas a protective effect on the mental health of those who experience unemployment or job insecurity. In the same spirit, the work byChoi et al. (2020)shows that financial well-being mitigates the impact of job insecurity on financial stress.1Thus, the current empirical evidence focuses mainly on how positive personal attributes could counterbalance negative situational factors but does not consider adverse job conditions’ role when a negative shock occurs.To fill this gap in the literature, we estimate the modifying effect of adverse job conditions on the mental health of individuals exposed to significant adverse life events. To do so, we use data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey, Waves 2 to 19, focusing on life events that are not directly related to job market participation. Using a difference-in-differences (DiD) approach, where our primary treatment variable indicates whether an individual was exposed to traumatic life events, we first estimate the mental health impacts of negative life events.2To ensure that both the level and the trend of the control group’s pre-treatment outcomes and individual’s characteristics are as close as possible to the treatment group’s and, thus, to mitigate potential selection based on the observables, we combine the DiD approach with apropensity score matching(PSM) approach. The PSM approach eliminates outliers with no close matches in terms of observed individual characteristics or past outcome values. Discarding outliers allows us to associate the outcome differences between the two groups with the occurrence of the events. We then use a triple difference (DDD) approach to determine whether the events’ negative mental health impact increases with the levels of job insecurity and job stress experienced by individuals before the events.Our results suggest that job insecurity and job stress amplify a trauma’s negative mental health impacts. More specifically, the adverse life events’ effect on the mental health score is 0.22standard deviationshigher for workers with high job insecurity than for those with low job insecurity.3Likewise, comparing the effects on workers with high and low job stress levels, the mental health score decline for the former is about 0.19 standard deviations higher than the latter. Furthermore, the results suggest agender differencein the amplifying roles of job insecurity and job stress. Specifically, we find that job insecurity affects females only, and that while job stress affects both females and males, the effect on females is much stronger.This paper contributes to our understanding of the epidemiology of poor mental health. According to the diathesis-stress model, stressful conditions can hasten the development of mental disorders among people with a genetic or biological predisposition to certain disorders (VandenBos, 2007). Similarly, the stress-vulnerability model suggests that social factors can play a role in precipitating the onset of mental disorders (ibid). To the extent that poor job conditions serve as a proxy for some chronic stressors, our findings can be interpreted as quantitative evidence of these models. This paper also contributes to the literature on job conditions by highlighting a potential pathway through which mental health deterioration arising from significant life events can be prevented or attenuated.Our findings have important implications for the recent development of remote work and the gig economy. Specifically, the gig economy has been blooming, but its flexible job arrangement has led to minimal job stability and protection and, hence, higher job insecurity. Likewise, while competition in the labour market may drive up productivity, it comes with the cost of heightening stress among workers (Peck and Theodore, 2000). Against this background, our findings add weight to the argument about the importance of having a sustainable workplacecultureand work–life balance.The rest of the paper is organized as follows.Section 2describes the dataset and thesample selectionprocess.Section 3explains the methodology of the study.Section 4presents the main results, andSection 5presents the robustness checks results.

"1. IntroductionIt is well-documented that poor mental health is correlated with worse labor market outcomes. A review of early studies byMarcotte and Wilcox-Gök (2001)concluded that 5–6 million workers in the US between the ages of 16 and 54 lose, fail to seek, or cannot find employment due to mental illnesses, and that mental illness decreases annual income by $3500-$6000, conditional on working. There are several channels through which poor mental health can lead to worse labor market outcomes. Mental health might affect employment through beliefs and preferences. Depression is associated with negative beliefs about oneself and pessimistic expectations about the future, which may lead to reduced motivation and effort in job searches, as well as easily becoming discouraged with setbacks. Some studies have found that anxiety is associated with lower risk-taking (Giorgeta et al., 2012;Maner et al., 2007), which may affect individuals’ decisions to apply for jobs. Employment could also be affected through mental health stigma and discrimination. Depressed individuals may want to avoid situations that hold a high risk of stigmatization and simply may not apply for jobs. Stigma may exclude depressed individuals fromsocial networksthat provide economic opportunities. Employers may discriminate and not hire depressed individuals due to stereotypes such as being incompetent and unreliable. Depression can affect labor market earnings through labor supply and productivity. Depression typically involves disrupted sleep, fatigue and concentration problems which might lead to higher rates ofabsenteeism, lower labor supply, lower productivity, and thus lower earnings. At the same time, depression may decrease the marginal utility of leisure (Nimrod et al., 2012), resulting in depressed individuals potentially working more since they receive less utility from non-work activities.Despite multiple pathways linking poor mental health to labor market outcomes and empirical associations which do the same, establishing causality is complicated because of omitted variable bias and reverse causality that lead to endogeneity of mental health. Omitted variable bias arises due to “third” factors (e.g., genetic endowments, cognitive ability, childhood circumstances, personality) that are correlated with both mental health and labor market outcomes, while reverse causality occurs when lack of employment or reduced earnings worsen mental health. To identify causal effects, several studies (summarized inSection 2) have usedinstrumental variables(IV) strategies to isolate variation in mental health that is argued to be orthogonal to unobserved factors. Instruments used have pertained to childhood and parental mental health, religiosity, death of a close friend, and availability of social services and social support. Other studies have used panel data and individual fixed-effect regression specifications to control for time-invariant individual characteristics correlated with mental health and labor market outcomes. The consensus from prior studies is that poor mental health reduces employment but effects for earnings are mixed.While IV and panel data approaches are an improvement upon naïve OLS estimates, the assumptions needed for causality may be violated. Valid instruments rely on the exclusion restriction—that the instruments only affect labor market outcomes indirectly through their effect on mental health. One can think of reasons why the exclusion restriction may not be satisfied for each of the instruments used in the literature. Childhood/adolescent mental health may violate the exclusion restriction because poor adolescent mental health is associated with lower educational attainment (Fletcher, 2008) and worse labor market outcomes (Fletcher, 2013a;Lundberg et al., 2014;Mousteri et al., 2019). Parental mental illness has been found to increase the probability of high school dropout of children (Farahati et al., 2003), which could in turn affect labor market outcomes. Religiosity is likely correlated with earnings (Gruber, 2005) and could affect labor market outcomes through other indirect channels (e.g., attending religious services could be helpful for career networking). Furthermore, in the presence of heterogeneous effects, IV identifies a local averagetreatment effect(LATE) for those individuals whose treatment (mental health) is affected by the instrument used.1Individual fixed effects do not control for time-varying factors correlated with mental health and labor market outcomes, such as stress and health shocks. Individual fixed-effect estimates are identified from individuals who experience changes in mental health and labor market outcomes. If within-person variation in mental health and labor market outcomes are randomly distributed across all individuals, then individual fixed-effect estimates will identify the average treatment effect (ATE) on the population, which is arguably a more policy-relevant parameter. Alternatively, the estimates could reflect an effect for a specific subpopulation if the within-person variation is present in certain subgroups of the population. Moreover, if there is insufficient within-person variation in mental health and labor market outcomes, then estimates may lack statistical power to detect effects of mental health.We estimate the effect of mental health (based on a count of depressive symptoms from the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale) in the 1992 round (when individuals are 30 years old) of the NationalLongitudinal Studyof Youth 1979 (NLSY79) on employment and earnings in 1993. Our key contribution is that we provide novel evidence by employing a nonparametric partial identification approach (Manski and Pepper, 2000) to bound the causal effect, which has at least four advantages. First, it accounts for the endogeneity of mental health that may arise from, e.g., omitted variables or reverse causality. Second, it provides bounds on the population ATE as opposed to a subpopulation treatment effect. Third, it relies on relatively weak assumptions, which are, arguably, more credible. These advantages, though, come at a cost of obtaining a range of possible values for the causal population ATE rather than a point estimate of it. The assumptions we use are three: (1) monotone treatment selection (MTS) which posits that, on average, individuals “selected” into worse mental health have lower latent employment probabilities and earnings; (2) monotone treatment response (MTR) which imposes the restriction that worse mental health does not improve labor market outcomes; (3) we employ adolescent test scores as a monotone instrumental variable (MIV)—a variable that is assumed to have a weakly increasing mean relationship with potential outcomes—to help tighten the bounds under the MTS and MTR assumptions. In our context, the MIV assumption states that individuals with higher test scores have no lower average latent employment probabilities and earnings than those with lower test scores. The MIV assumption is weaker than the exclusion restriction in IV models, since the MIV is allowed to have a direct impact on potential outcomes and may be non-random itself. We discuss and assess these assumptions below. Fourth, the bounds allow us to explore the strength of the estimated effects at different levels of depression symptoms experienced (no, little, mild, moderate, and severe). The nonparametric partial identification method that we employ has been used in other contexts but to our knowledge has not been applied to bound effects of mental health on labor market outcomes.2Our estimated bounds indicate that being categorized as depressed decreases employment by 10% and earnings by 27% at most, but we cannot statistically exclude a zero effect at conventional significance levels. Mental health, however, is inherently a continuous condition, but an indicator variable for being depressed or having a psychiatric condition assumes away any heterogeneity in the way the intensity of depressive symptoms affects labor market outcomes. We examine the effects at different levels of depressive symptoms (none, little, mild, moderate, and severe), and find that going from having no (little) to severe depressive symptoms reduces employment by 3–18% (3–16%) and earnings by 11–44% (12–36%). The 95% confidence intervals statistically rule out null effects for earnings but not employment. Therefore, our results provide evidence of a statistically significant average causal effect of worsening mental health from no/little to severe depression symptoms on labor market earnings, while also ruling out relevant magnitudes. The effect for earnings is economically significant, comparable to IV estimates of an additional year of schooling on wages which is between 6 and 15% (Card, 1999).The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.Section 2provides a review of the literature andSection 3gives a description of the data.

"1. Introduction“A necessary, firm integration policy” The alderman, Louise Gade, announcing school closures on November 20, 2007, /ritzau/.Educational attainment isimperativefor integration of ethnic minorities across countries (Algan, Bisin, Manning, Verdier, 2012,Behaghel, Gurgand, Kuzmova, Marshalian, 2018). Education not only builds labour market skills but also has the potential to promote integration and social mobility, making it a vital component of the life course of ethnic minority children. Therefore, schooldesegregationpolicies aimed at promoting educational attainment have been implemented despite potential costs to the affected children in terms of school disruption and social exclusion. Many of these policies have included some kind of school displacement. In this paper, we analyse short- and medium-term effects of school displacement on ethnic minority children arising from school closures, in the context of a wider school desegregation policy.Policy makers across countries try to manipulate school choice to reach political goals in terms of school diversity and/or school quality, overall or for specific segments of pupils such as ethnic minority pupils. Common ways to manipulate school choice are consolidating, merging, or redrawing school districts or reconfiguring grades.1Our paper takes no stand on the ideal organization of school choice. Instead, we quantify the effects of school displacement induced by school closures motivated by integration of ethnic minorities, i.e., school closures decided by political actors that caused pupils to transfer from their default school district to a politically determined alternative school district. In principle, effects on displaced pupils may be negative or positive. First, displacement disrupts peer and teacher networks, which could negatively affect school outcomes (disruption costs). Second, displacement to new schools exposes students to different peer groups and teachers, which could affect their school outcomes (exposure effects). These effects may be transitory or permanent, and negative or positive depending on the differences between the closing school and the new school. We find negative and persistent effects of displacement, which are consistent with disruption costs perhaps combined with negative exposure effects.In 2008, the municipality of Aarhus, Denmark, closed two schools with high shares of dual language learners but kept open other schools with high shares of dual language learners.2Because families sort into school districts in terms of both income and taste (Tiebout, 1956), pupils exposed to school displacement after the closure differ from pupils not exposed to school displacement in terms of both observed and unobserved characteristics. Due to this potential confoundedness, a strategy which compares outcomes of exposed and unexposed pupils is likely to give biased estimates of the effects of school displacement. To account for this potential confoundedness, we implement a difference-in-differences strategy exploiting variation from another policy affecting dual language learners: Since 2006, all dual language learners Danish is tested before school start and, if they show limitedDanish languageproficiency, they lose free school choice. If dual language learners with limited Danish language proficiency exceed 20% of the incoming grade zero cohort in the local school, the surplus is assigned to be bused to schools outside the district, according to defined priority criteria. The subgroup of dual language learners with limited Danish proficiency who attended the closing schools was distributed across schools in adjacent school districts with lower than 20% share of dual language learners with limited Danish proficiency, whereas the subgroup who was assigned to busing was unexposed to the school closures. At the same time, the subgroup of dual language learners with limited Danish proficiency who attended the surviving schools experienced no school displacement, while the subgroup who was assigned to busing was exposed to the same type of schools as pupils assigned to busing from the subsequently closed school districts. Therefore, we compare displaced pupils in closed districts to pupils in similar districts that were not closed and control for potential confounders using the pupils assigned to busing from both types of districts. Our sample consists of pupils starting school in 2006-2009 who are exposed to the school integration policy. The first two cohorts are also exposed to the school closures before grade 2, which allows us to study effects of closures on displaced students. This effect includes the effect of having spent one year in an environment made worse by the upcoming closure.Our difference-in-differences strategy estimates the effect of school displacement as the difference in outcomes between pupils assigned to the local school and pupils assigned to busing in closing districts net of the difference between pupils assigned to the local school and pupils assigned to busing in surviving districts. Our identifying assumption is that the difference between pupils assigned to the local school and pupils assigned to busing in surviving school districts is equal to the difference between pupils assigned to the local school and pupils assigned to busing in closed school districtshad these schools not been closed. Our identification thus relies on the assumption that there is no differential selection into busing across school districts. Whether this is a valid assumption is an empirical question that we test in the paper. Traditionally, studies of school closures rely on comparing pupils in the school district before and after school closure (Brummet, 2014,Engberg, Gill, Zamarro, Zimmer, 2012,Steinberg, MacDonald, 2019,Taghizadeh, 2020). This approach often implies that the effect of school closure is estimated relative to attending a possibly declining school, or a school in which there has been no investment in terms of resources and other interventions. In our setting, comparing pupils in closed schools to their counterparts before closure would not work. It would be misleading because all schools with high shares of dual language learners were exposed from 2006 to a school desegregation policy that allocated more resources to them. Moreover, it would be impossible due to data limitations. An advantage of our approach, though, is that we compare closed schools to similar schools that have been exposed to the school desegregation policy but have not been closed. Another advantage of our approach is that, by studying dual language learners who lost their free school choice, we mostly avoid non-random sorting of displaced pupils into new schools. Furthermore, the schools in our set of surviving schools do not receive the displaced pupils, as they already have a high number of dual language learners and are not allowed to add more, due to the ongoing school desegregation policy. This reduces potentialspillover effectsof the displaced pupils onto non-displaced pupils.We find strong detrimental effects of school displacement on academic achievement that persist throughout lower-secondary school and beyond. In fact, school displacement leads to lower take-up rates of grade 9 tests necessary to enrol in high school and higher rates of high school postponement. Furthermore, school displacement leads to higherabsenteeismand lowerwellbeingtowards the end of lower-secondary school.There is an extant literature addressing school mobility and displacement by exploiting policy-induced variation such as Moving to Opportunity (MTO) (Chetty, Hendren, 2018,Chetty, Hendren, Katz, 2016), school assignment policies (Bergman, 2019,Billings, Deming, Rockoff, 2014,Damm, Mattana, Nielsen, Rouland, 2021) or school closures (Beuchert, Humlum, Nielsen, Smith, 2018,Brummet, 2014,Engberg, Gill, Zamarro, Zimmer, 2012,Steinberg, MacDonald, 2019).3For MTO,Chetty et al. (2016)finds negative effects of school mobility for children moving after age 13 and argue this is because the disruption effects of moving dominate positive exposure effects in adolescence. In this paper, we find that disruption effects dominate any positive exposure effects (and that exposure effects may even be negative) also for younger ethnic minority children, who do not move to a new neighbourhood but attend a school distant both in terms of peer characteristics and geographic distance from their neighbourhood of residence, as well as with lower resources.For school assignment policies, previous studies argue that effects are not driven by school transitions as such but rather by the composition of the pupil body and resource allocation (Billings, Deming, Rockoff, 2014,Damm, Mattana, Nielsen, Rouland, 2021). Similarly, for school closures, effects vary across studies and depend on the difference in quality between the closed schools and the receiving schools.Beuchert et al. (2018)finds negative short-term effects for pupils whose schools are closed, which suggests they are caused by temporary disruption rather than systematic changes in school quality, transportation, or social inclusion.Taghizadeh (2020b)finds no effects of school closures on displaced students in Sweden.Brummet (2014)finds immediate disruption costs that are gradually counteracted by benefits of higher school quality.Engberg et al. (2012)andSteinberg and MacDonald (2019)both find that school closures have positive effects on the achievement of pupils displaced to higher-quality schools, but not otherwise. In our setting, high-minority schools have more resources than the schools where displaced pupils are assigned. For dual language learners, we find evidence of persistent costs generated by school closures, which can suggest negative exposure effects.Closing schools with a high share of ethnic minority pupils is an alternative desegregation policy compared to forced busing, studied in detail byDamm et al. (2021a). We compare the effects of school closure on displaced pupils to the effects of assignment to busing. Our results confirm the detrimental effects reported byDamm et al. (2021a)and indicate that the effects on academic achievement of being displaced due to a school closure areeven largerthan those of assignment to busing and extend to the social-emotional domains in the medium term. In our setting, the closed schools were part of a program aimed at improving school quality for dual language learners through busing and compensatory resources. Therefore, on top of being displaced after they started school, displaced pupils attended schools with fewer resources targeted at theirdemographicgroup. One additional advantage of our approach is, therefore, that we observe and can compare school closure to alternative approaches to improve a struggling school such as transforming the school to a magnet school. This is particularly relevant in light of the fact that school closures are often very unpopular, and that existing evidence points to school closures only being beneficial when displaced pupils are sent to new schools that are not just better than the closed schools, but disproportionately so, in order to compensate for the negative disruption effect (Engberg, Gill, Zamarro, Zimmer, 2012,Steinberg, MacDonald, 2019).Our persistent negative effects may occur because school displacement in the first two years after school start arguably generates disruption of pre-existing social ties. This is consistent with previous literature. For example,Lavy and Sand (2019)exploits information on the disruption tosocial relationshipsamongst Israeli pupils during the transition from primary to secondary school and find that the number of friends in class may have positive or negative effects depending on the types of friends and their socio-economic background.Kirshner et al. (2010)supports this picture based on a case study of a closed high school, which predominantly affected African American and Latino pupils. They find that roughly 40% of pupils report a sense of loss or a disruption of their friendships because of the closure; similarly, roughly 40% reported weaker relations with adults at the new school. Social disruption may be particularly pertinent for ethnic minority pupils because common language skills, common knowledge, and common everyday lives of children matter significantly when they choose friends (Gulløv, 2010,Jensen, 2020).Finally, while we document a long-lasting negative effect of school displacement for pupils whose schooling careers were affected directly by the closures, we cannot infer the net effect of school closures. To answer this, we would also need to evaluate the potential benefits of school closures on academic achievement and well-being in school for future generations of pupils who would have attended the closed school had they not been closed. Then, we could compare them with the costs of school displacement for the current pupil body. Only in rare cases such analysis is possible (Bifulco, Schwegman, 2020,Taghizadeh, 2020).The rest of the paper is organized as follows.Section 2describes the institutional setting and the school assignment policy in Aarhus Municipality.Section 3explains our empirical strategy, whileSection 4.1presents our data. We present our results and discuss possible mechanisms inSection 5, andSection 6concludes, suggests avenues for future research and draws policy implications.",Anna,Elena,Helena
"1. IntroductionA well-documented finding in the entrepreneurship literature is that a significant fraction of entrepreneurs conceives ideas that are translated into new ventures during their previous employment. For example,Bhide (1994)finds that 71% of new startups commercialize an idea that their founders obtained or developed when they were employed by an established firm. Similarly,Agarwal and Shah (2014)report that the fraction of startups formed by former employees of established firms ranges from 24% (e.g., the automobile and legal services industries) to over 80% (e.g., the information technology and communications and the high-tech manufacturing industries).1As translating a business idea into a successful venture provides the entrepreneur with significant financial and non-pecuniary benefits, it raises an important concern for firms. First, the departure of an employee who has talent, skills or information critical to the firm has detrimental effects on its profits (Campbell et al., 2012). Second, the attractiveness of entrepreneurship creates a conflict of interest between firms and their employees to the extent that employees allocate scarce resources (e.g., their effort or time) between exploring new ideas and performing the tasks assigned by the firm (Hellmann, 2007b). As a reaction to employee departures, either to join a rival firm or to start a new venture, firms can take some measures that potentially hinder mobility. For example, they can make use of contracting to induce the worker to focus on the assigned tasks rather than on exploring new ideas (Hellmann and Thiele, 2011), and to impose restrictions on mobility through non-compete clauses or break-up fees (e.g.,Franco, Mitchell, 2008,Mukherjee, Vasconcelos, 2018).2Further, firms can adjust their patenting and litigation strategies (Agarwal, Ganco, Ziedonis, 2009,Kim, Marschke, 2005) or invest in complementary assets (Hvide and Kristiansen, 2012) to reduce the value of the employee’s options outside the firm.This paper considers an alternative strategy that can reduce the mobility of important employees. Specifically, I focus on the firm’s decision to implement new projects conceived by its employees when the firm has better information about their entrepreneurial ability than does the market. Such an informational asymmetry provides the firm with an incentive to distort the implementation decision in order to conceal information from the market. I examine the implications of this mechanism on corporate venturing.In this setting, the worker who conceives a project is indispensable for the implementation of the project, yet she is also important for the firm’s ongoing businesses. The two key pieces of information that determine the expected value of a project concern the project’s content and the worker’s entrepreneurial ability. To seek financing, the worker reveals the content of her project to potential financiers—the firm and venture capitalists—which then use their expertise to assess the value of the project.3Thus, all potential financiers have the same information about the return the project would yield if it is implemented successfully. By contrast, there is an informational asymmetry regarding the worker’s entrepreneurial ability, which is critical to successful implementation. As in the literature on asymmetric employer learning (e.g.,Greenwald, 1986,Waldman, 1984), the firm has better information, vis-à-vis the market, about the worker characteristics that can only be revealed over time in an employment relationship. Such characteristics, which are also relevant to entrepreneurial ability, include having diverse managerial skills (Lazear, 2005), the amount and complexity of the knowledge set acquired at the incumbent firm (Chatterji, 2009,Ganco, 2013), ongoing relationships with potential suppliers and clients (Byun et al., 2019). Observing these characteristics, the firm is therefore better-equipped to determine the success potential of the proposed project.4I consider a two-period model with three types of risk-neutral players: firms, venture capitalists and a worker. Both firms and venture capitalists operate in competitive markets. At the beginning of the first period, the worker is hired by a firm and then assigned to the firm’s core business. Apart from performing the assigned tasks at the core business, the worker engages in anentrepreneurial activity(employee entrepreneurship) by exerting effort to conceive a project. The potential return from the project is increasing in effort, and undertaking the project generates a positive return, which equals the project’s potential return, if and only if the worker has high entrepreneurial ability. At the beginning of the second period, the worker approaches the firm and the venture capitalist to seek financing for her project.5The key aspect of the information structure is that while the worker’s productivity at the firm’s core business is public information, the players learn about her entrepreneurial ability in an asymmetric manner. Accordingly, the firm observes a private signal about the worker’s entrepreneurial ability after one period of employment. Upon observing the signal, the firm decides betweencorporate venturing(i.e., implementing the worker’s project in a new venture to which the worker is assigned as a manager) and assigning the worker to the core business. The venture capitalist uses the firm’s decision to update its beliefs concerning the worker’s entrepreneurial ability and then bids for her. Observing the venture capitalist’s offer, the firm makes a counteroffer, and then the worker chooses one of these offers.I begin my analysis with a benchmark case in which all players have the same information about the worker. Because there is no informational asymmetry, the firm’s corporate venturing decision does not convey any information about the worker’s entrepreneurial ability. In equilibrium the firm matches the venture capitalist’s offer and retains the worker either in the core business or at a new venture where her project is implemented. More specifically, if the worker’s expected entrepreneurial ability exceeds a cutoff, the firm finds it too expensive to convince the worker to give up her project and it thus implements the project through corporate venturing. Otherwise, it shelves the project and retains the worker in the core business. Notably, although her project may not be implemented at all, the worker’s effort choice is not distorted because her earnings in the second period equal the expected surplus generated by the project. The benchmark analysis yields several predictions concerning corporate venturing decisions. First, higher degrees of competition in the firm’s main line of business lead to more corporate venturing. Second, stronger complementarity between the proposed project and the firm’s core business increases the likelihood of corporate venturing. Finally, the firm becomes less likely to implement the project as the worker gets more important for its core business. As will be discussed, these predictions are consistent with the empirical findings in the literature.Next, I introduce asymmetric learning by allowing the firm to observe a private signal about the worker’s entrepreneurial ability. In contrast to the benchmark case, the firm’s decision to implement the worker’s project serves as a signal of high ability. As inMilgrom and Oster (1987)andGhosh and Waldman (2010), the equilibrium is characterized by a winner’s curse in which venture capitalists avoid overvaluing the worker. That is, their offers are consistent with the belief that the worker’s entrepreneurial ability is the lowest among workers with the same public signals (i.e., the same prior and job assignment). Observing the corporate venturing decision, the venture capitalist increases its bid, and therefore, the firm must offer a higher wage to retain the worker. Hence, the informational asymmetry results in an additional tradeoff between implementing lucrative projects and raising the retention cost, and this tradeoff may lead to a distortion in corporate venturing decisions. The analysis reveals that if the firm’s private signal is sufficiently precise, the worker is assigned to the core business even when it is not efficient to do so. In other words, to conceal favorable information about the worker, the firm skips lucrative projects, which would have been implemented in the symmetric-information case. By contrast, the firm does not distort project implementation if the signal is not sufficiently precise. That is, the firm uses the signal to update its belief concerning the worker’s entrepreneurial ability and then implements her project if it is efficient to do so. The distortion, if there is any, is exacerbated by the worker’s weakened effort incentives. That is, anticipating that she would not be able to reap the full benefits from her effort, the worker exerts lower effort and consequently conceives a project with a lower potential return. Because the firm’s opportunity cost of retaining the worker at the core business is positively related to the project’s value, lower effort provision strengthens the firm’s incentive to skip lucrative projects and therefore generates an additional channel that contributes to the inefficiency in corporate venturing.The model’s implications that result from the informational asymmetry are consistent with the existing empirical findings. The analysis reveals that the incidence of corporate venturing decreases as the firm’sprivate informationabout the worker gets more precise. To consider the extent to which this prediction is consistent with the empirical findings of the related papers, I follow the literature on asymmetric employer learning in which the worker’s tenure at the current firm is used to proxy the firm’s informational advantage vis-à-vis the market (e.g.,Ekinci, Kauhanen, Waldman, 2019,Kahn, 2013). Consistent with the model, some studies find that the probability of entrepreneurship is negatively related to the worker’s tenure at the firm (e.g.,Andersson, Baltzopoulos, Lööf, 2012,Braguinsky, Klepper, Ohyama, 2012,Gambardella, Ganco, Honoré, 2015). Further, the model provides an alternative explanation to the positive relationship between competition and innovation.6Accordingly, as the firm faces more intense competition in the core business, its incentive to conceal information about the worker’s entrepreneurial ability is curtailed. Hence, increased competition mitigates the distortion in project implementation, thereby raising the corporate venturing activity.To complete the analysis, I consider two extensions of the model. First, to capture the fact that firms launch corporate venturing programs to identify promising employee projects, I allow the firm to conduct a costly evaluation to increase the precision of its signal. In this case, the firm’s equilibrium choice of signal precision is mainly determined by the project’s potential return.7When the potential return is sufficiently high, the firm dedicates a low amount of resources to the evaluation process, meaning that the precision of its private signal is also low. In this case, there is no distortion in the corporate venturing decision. By contrast, when the potential return from the project is sufficiently low, the firm invests for high precision and assigns the worker to the core business even if it observes favorable information about the worker’s entrepreneurial ability. Second, I introduce turnover into the model.8As in the main analysis, the worker’s job assignment is determined by an ability cutoff above which the firm opts for corporate venturing. Two additional results from this analysis are worth noting. First, because the worker leaves the firm with positive probability regardless of her job assignment, the firm offers a higher wage to mitigate the risk of losing the worker. Second, the worker’s effort choice is distorted if she anticipates that her project will not be implemented by the firm.

Finding the right redistributive policy to counteract this is challenging. Governments largely focus on individuals—not families—attempting to bring about social change by taxing one group (the advantaged) and transferring to another (the disadvantaged). However, “there is little support for the claim that untargeted income transfer policies to poor families significantly boost child outcomes” (Heckman and Mosso, 2014, p. 2). Moving beyond standard tax-and-transfer programs to find new approaches to supporting disadvantaged families requires that we better understand the mechanisms underpinning intergenerational persistence in social andeconomic welfare(seeCorak, 2006;Black and Devereux, 2011).We examine the degree of intergenerational persistence across different social assistance benefits in an effort to understand the forces behind intergenerational disadvantage. Our focus is on the Australian social safety net because it provides a particularly valuable case for studying the issues at hand. Australian social policy is determined at the national level and administered by the Department of Human Services (DHS) through a single central agency known as Centrelink. This results in DHS maintaining an administrative database that includes payment records of all Australians receiving any form ofsocial security benefit. Some benefits can be characterized as social assistance (welfare), while others have either weak or no income test, making them nearly universal for families with children. We use administrative social security (Centrelink) records linked over time and within families, giving us detailed social assistance trajectories—across the entire social safety net—for a birth cohort of young adults and their families over an 18-year period. Our strategy is to exploit variation in the degree of intergenerational persistence across social programs—each differing in their target populations—to draw conclusions about how disadvantage is transmitted from parents to children.We first document that young people are 1.8 times more likely to need social assistance as adults if their parents have a history of receiving social assistance. They also need more intensive support, receiving an additional $12,000 of social assistance over an 8-year period. Intergenerational persistence is particularly strong for benefits targeting disability, caring responsibilities, and single parenting.We then conduct three ancillary analyses that highlight the potential mechanisms underpinning intergenerational disadvantage. First, we estimate intergenerational persistence acrosssocial programs, allowing us to identify those forms of parental disadvantage with the most extensive consequences. We find that those with disabled parents not only receive more disability support themselves, they also receive more in unemployment and parenting benefits. Parental unemployment, in contrast, is only weakly associated with young people's need for disability support, while parents’ receipt of parenting benefits is mainly associated with an increased chance that young people will also require parenting benefits. Parental disability is a clear pathway through which disadvantage is being passed from Australian parents to their children. Second, we develop a simple conceptual framework to highlight the way that the transmission of personal choice and luck may shape intergenerational welfare dependence. Our empirical analysis indicates that, on balance, parents’ bad luck appears to have a broader impact on youth disadvantage than do their personal choices. Finally, we separately analyze the extensive and intensive margins of the intergenerational persistence in social assistance and investigate whether there is any potential for a causal effect of parental welfare on youths’ social assistance receipt once unobserved heterogeneity is controlled for (seeGottschalk, 1996). Our results from these analyses indicate that in Australia intergenerational disadvantage is more likely to stem from the existence of apovertytrap than from acultureof welfare.Our work extends the literature that seeks to isolate the mechanisms behind social and economic mobility. Correlational analyses of intergenerational mobility do not identify the causal mechanisms that drive mobility. Researchers, however, have effectively used heterogeneity in the degree of intergenerational mobility across time (e.g.,Gottschalk, 1996;Beaulieu et al., 2005;Ekhaugen, 2009); geographic areas (e.g.,Corak, 2006,Corak, 2013;Chetty et al., 2014); or family structure (e.g.,Björklund et al., 2006,2007) to rule some mechanisms into the possibility set and others out. We are the first to address this issue by exploiting disparity in intergenerational mobility both within—and across—the various programs that together constitute the social safety net. Each program is designed to address a different form of disadvantage, allowing us to draw inferences about the mechanisms that transmit disadvantage from parents to children. Moreover, our data offer a broad perspective on the entire social assistance system in Australia, capturing people who, due to eligibility conditions or changing circumstances, transition from one program to another while still being broadly reliant on social assistance. These people are missed by analyses that focus on a single program (e.g., unemployment insurance). Our single-country analysis accounts for the broader institutional context (e.g., labor markets, health and educational systems, social norms) which is an advance over cross-country comparisons which have been the focus of prior comparative work (seeChetty et al., 2014).Crucially, our estimates constitute average, not marginal, population parameters. Previous studies of intergenerational welfare receipt often rely on the quasi-experimental variation generated by eligibility rules to estimate the effects of parents’ welfare receipt (e.g.,Dahl et al., 2014; Dahl and Gielen, 2020). This empirical strategy generally results in causal estimates. Inevitably, however, what is being estimated are local averagetreatment effects, i.e., the effect of welfare receipt only for those on the margin of welfare eligibility (e.g., people who receive welfare after a legal appeal or due to small changes in welfare guidelines). If treatment effects are heterogenous, these local average treatment effect estimates are informative about the transmission of disadvantage from marginal welfare recipients to their children; but they leave us ignorant about the intergenerationalspilloverin benefit receipt to the children of average welfare participants (see De Hann and Schreiner 2018). Our estimates, on the other hand, identify population average effects ensuring that comparisons across different welfare payments highlight the overall degree of intergenerational persistence in disadvantage within the population more generally. While not causal, they help us understand the nature of welfare dependence and “use that knowledge to prioritize possible causal mechanisms, generate hypotheses and intervention strategies, interpret the findings of causal research, diagnose problems for practitioners and policymakers to address, and identify new issues to study” (Loeb et al., 2017, p.1).Importantly, we circumvent many of the data limitations that have plagued researchers in the past. Estimates of intergenerational mobility are sensitive to the way that they are constructed. Short observation windows (Page, 2004;Mazumder, 2005); attenuation bias due to measurement error (Solon, 1992;Zimmerman, 1992;Bowles and Gintis, 2002); and noisy proxies (e.g., income, occupation, education) of social and economic status (Clark and Cummins, 2015) can lead to smaller estimates of intergenerational persistence. Recall bias may occur if people find it difficult to accurately report the nature of the benefits that they have received (Pepper, 2000). Our data capture an entire cohort of Australians and their families receiving social assistance. They are drawn from the Australian government's administrative system and span an 18-year period allowing us to minimize any biases associated with measurement error, recall issues, sample attrition, or short study periods. Our large sample sizes make it possible to precisely estimate differences in economic mobility across narrowly defined benefit types. Administrative data linking the receipt of social assistance across generations—such as we analyze here—are rare (Corak, 2006;Dahl et al., 2014;Mitnik et al., 2015), yet they are proving to be very powerful.1Our research contributes to the broader debate on whether theplaying fieldis uneven; that is, whether equality of opportunity is simply becoming an elusive goal.2Equality of opportunity is often described as offsetting “differences in outcomes attributable to luck, but not those differences in outcomes for which individuals are responsible” (Roemer and Trannoy, 2016, p. 1289). Measures of intergenerational correlations are in and of themselves not very helpful in forming judgements about the extent to which children face equal opportunities. Sorting this out requires that we distinguish the influence of differential circumstances (luck)—for which people should be compensated—from the influence of differences in personal choices—for which they should not (seeCorak, 2013;Jusot et al., 2013). Disparity in intergenerational persistence across social programs is informative because, while some programs are primarily designed to insure people from bad luck (e.g., disability benefits), others (e.g., unemployment benefits) also reflect important choices that people have made. By identifying which types of parental disadvantage are most likely to be transmitted to children, we learn more about why the playing field is uneven.",Deborah,Sarah,Nicolás
"1. IntroductionThe Covid pandemic has had a devastating effect on labor markets in the U.S. and throughout the world. Payroll employment in the U.S. fell by as much as 16 percent and remained over 2 percent below its February 2020 level at the end of 2021. The unemployment rate more than quadrupled, rising from 3.5 percent in February 2020 to a peak of 14.7 percent, and was at 3.9 percent at the end of 2021. Several studies, as well as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS, who publish the unemployment rate), have pointed out that even this large spike in the unemployment rate likely understates the degree of labor market slack present during this period.4Moreover, despite a rapid decline in the unemployment rate and relatively strong employment growth since the initial aggregate shock, thelabor force participationrate remains persistently low. Economists and the popular press have suggested a broad range of potential causes. These include lagging cyclical adjustment of labor force participation, added child care burdens among women, generous unemployment benefits and otherfiscal stimulusprograms, fear of returning to work while the virus persists, and structural changes in how individuals view work.The key to our analysis is the Job Search Supplement of the Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE). We designed this survey in 2013 and have administered it through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York annually each October since then (seeFaberman et al. (2022), for details). The supplement asks a wide range of questions on an individual’s employment situation, work preferences, and job search behavior. We focus on questions in the supplement that ask respondents about the number of hours they desire to work and their reservation wage. These measures allow us to identify changes in willingness to work over time. Furthermore, the 2020 and 2021 SCE Job Search Supplements include new questions on how the pandemic has affected individual job search and labor market participation decisions. Thus, using the SCE for our analysis provides two major advantages. First, unlike traditional surveys, it explicitly asks respondents about their potential labor supply and reservation wages; and second, unlike newer surveys developed during the pandemic, it provides a benchmark period that allows a comparison with the pre-pandemic labor market.Desired labor supply combined with actual hours worked also provides an intuitive measure of labor market underutilization. We refer to this broader underutilization measure as theAggregate Hours Gap(AHG) followingFaberman et al.(2020, henceforth FMST). The AHG measures underutilization through the difference between individuals’desired work hoursandactual hours worked, regardless of labor force status. FMST (2020) show that the SCE measure of desired hours is strongly related to job search effort and is a good indicator ofpotential labor supply. They also show that the AHG captures aspects of labor market slack missed by traditional measures, like the unemployment rate, and generally has a stronger relationship with nominal wage growth. Given that it encapsulates a broad concept of labor market underutilization, the AHG is well-suited to deal with the unique labor market circumstances of the Covid pandemic. This includes the misclassification of those on furlough or temporary layoff and any reduction in labor supply and work hours for reasons specific to the Covid pandemic and its related lockdown orders.In this paper, we use the SCE data along with the AHG measure to evaluate and corroborate the impact of the pandemic on labor market underutilization and aggregate labor supply. We find a diverging pattern between the AHG and the unemployment rate. The AHG suggests that the labor market istighterthan what the unemployment rate suggests during the Covid pandemic, with the AHG already below its February 2020 level by the end of 2021. We find that this is driven primarily by individuals out of the labor force (and partly by part-time workers). During the pandemic, these individuals report lower desired work hours, and consequently a lower willingness to participate in the labor market even marginally. Quantitatively, we find that the decline in desired work hours across all individuals is 4.6 percent, compared to a decline in the labor force participation rate of 2.3 percent, over this period. The decline occurs with a sharp drop at the onset of the pandemic that remains persistently low thereafter. Further analysis of the decline in the AHG and desired hours shows that a higher share of the employed are essentially on their labor supply curve (in the sense that their actual hours equal their desired hours) and a higher share of those out of the labor force that are unwilling to work at all drive the observed aggregate patterns. Following theGreat Recession, the pattern was different. The AHG showed a more sluggish labor market recovery, and therefore a higher degree of labor market underutilization, driven primarily by individuals out of the labor force who were willing to work a small amount of hours but were slow to find work. We refer to these driving force as theintensive margin of labor force participation.To quantify the role of the reduction in labor supply on labor market underutilization, we perform a counterfactual exercise that holds desired work hours constant at their pre-pandemic average within detailed labor force anddemographicgroups and recalculates the AHG and associated potential work hours from March 2020 forward. The exercise suggests that the decline in desired work hours reduced the AHG by 2.5 percentage points (12.5 percent) relative to its estimated value at the end of 2021. It also suggests that essentially all of the discrepancy between the fall in potential work hours and the labor force participation rate is accounted for by the decline in desired hours during the pandemic (as opposed to changes in composition). Again, changes in the desired hours of those out of the labor force and part-time workers account for most of the differences identified in the counterfactual exercise. Notably, we find only mild differences by gender in their declines in desired hours—i.e., the result is not driven by a contraction in labor supply among women, which resonates with the findings ofHobijn and Şahin (2021). Instead, we find the drop in desired hours is pervasive across most demographic groups, with those with less than a college degree having a notably larger contribution.Finally, we examine a range of suggestive evidence on the extent that the Covid pandemic had a direct role on the observed reduction on labor supply. First, we group individuals based on the degree ofsocial contactrequired of their current or most recent job, with a higher degree of social contact implying a higher potential exposure to Covid. We find that individuals in jobs with at least a moderate degree of social contact had sizable reductions in their desired work hours during the pandemic, while those in jobs with a low degree of social contact actually increased their desired work hours. Second, we find that real reservation wages increased during the pandemic for nearly all labor force and demographic groups, consistent with a decline in willingness to work. Real reservation wages increased 6 log points (6.2 percent), on average, across all individuals. The increase is robust to controls for observable characteristics. Third, using the responses to special Covid-specific questions in the CPS and SCE, we find that the pandemic caused a sizeable reduction in job search behavior for most of 2020, but that its effect on job search had mostly subsided by the end of 2021. In fact, we find that job search effort (in terms of job applications sent and the incidence of on-the-job search) rebounded strongly in 2021.Our study follows an expansive set of empirical studies on the effects of the Covid pandemic on the labor market. Many of these studies focus on the initial shock to the labor market at the onset of the pandemic, while others evaluate the effects of government policies, such as the expansion of unemployment insurance, on labor supply and employment.5Most relevant to our research are several studies that find labor market tightness was greater than what standard measures implied because of a reduction in job search effort in the early portion of the pandemic. These include studies byForsythe et al. (2020), Marinescu, Skandalis, and Zhao (2020), Brinca, Duarte, and Faria-e-Castro (2021), and Hensvik, Le Barbanchon, and Rathelot (2021). These studies identify a reduction in job search effort, either directly or indirectly, as a contributor to labor market tightness across multiple countries. Our findings are consistent with recent work, such asDomash and Summers (2022)andCrump et al. (2022), that argue that the U.S. labor market at the end of 2021 is tighter than in 2019 using alternative measures of labor market tightness. Our study is also related to research on a declining trend in the willingness to work that predates the pandemic (Barnichon and Figura, 2016). Finally, our study dovetails with academic research (e.g., Bick and Blandin, 2020) and government initiatives, such as the U.S. Household Pulse Survey, that developed special surveys and survey instruments to study the Covid pandemic.The next section describes the conceptual underpinnings of the AHG. Section 3 describes our data and methodology for estimating the AHG and its components. Section 4 presents the aggregate time-series behavior of the AHG and its components. Section 5 quantifies the role of labor supply for the reduction in the AHG and provides supporting evidence on the role of the Covid pandemic for labor supply and job search. Section 6 concludes.",R.,Andreas,Ayşegül
"1. IntroductionFostering older and unhealthy workers’ inclusion in the labour market is a daunting task that requires complex choices, trading-off the provision of incentives to remain active and the protection that motivates social insurance. Knowledge of how labour market institutions shape behavioural responses to health deteriorations over time is central to shaping the policy agenda wisely. Indeed, empirical evidence has so far contributed to a relative consensus on the detrimental effect of health shocks on labour outcomes in terms of employment, income from labour and evenwealthbecause of increased health expenditure (Dobkin et al., 2018).1However, much less is known about the role of institutional factors in mediating these effects.To our knowledge, only two works exist (García-Gómez, 2011;Trevisan and Zantomio, 2016) that discuss the topic in the light of cross-country institutional variation.2Both document differences in employment effect magnitude across European countries and somehow place Northern countries (i.e. Denmark, Netherlands) and Southern (i.e. Italy) at opposite sides of the effect magnitude spectrum: highest in Northern, negligible in Southern countries. Furthermore, both relate – although at a rather descriptive level – effect magnitude to dimensions such as higher hiring rates, generosity of disability compensation, provision for disability integration policies, and (lack of) mandatory quotas for disabled workers.Still, many questions remain unanswered. For example, to what extent do institutional dimensions such as employment protection, working hours’ flexibility and compensation structure rigidities activate different margins of adjustment over time? Are existing social insurance provisions covering against the financial consequences of health deterioration? Does employment protectionlegislation(EPL) actually play a role in fostering employment for workers seeking to maintain employment after a health shock, or do firms findde-factoroutes to dismiss them? What is the interplay between EPL and income protection granted through publicly funded DI programmes?The present work aims at contributing toward answering similar questions, offering evidence on employees’ long-run adjustments to health deteriorations in Italy, a country featuring a highly regulated labour market with limited scope for hours or wage adjustments, generally strong employment-protection policies and comparatively low labour flow indicators. Thanks to an institutional discontinuity, the Italian context offers the possibility of measuring the causal effect of EPL – even if not specifically targeted to workers experiencing health deteriorations – on their labour market inclusion and DI participation.Most of the exiting empirical studies on the labour consequences of health shocks focus on the US, Anglo-Saxon, Nordic countries and the Netherlands, a pattern that reflects the availability of appropriate data sources in these countries (e.g.,Dobkin et al 2018,Au et al. 2005,Zucchelli et al. 2010,Heinesen and Kolodziejczyk 2013,Maczulskij and Böckerman 2019,García-Gómez et al. 2013). However, compared to others, these countries feature higher levels of job mobility,3more limited job protections and, in the case of the Netherlands and Nordic countries, more generous disability policies in terms of coverage and integration (seeEuropean Commission, 2009;OECD, 2016).4Along these dimensions, they differ remarkably from Southern European5countries like Italy.Studying the Italian institutional context is possible thanks to the availability of a new administrative dataset, WHIP&Health, which covers the work and social security histories (1990–2012) of a random sample drawn from the Italian Social Security (INPS,Istituto Nazionale della Previdenza Sociale) archives, linked to individuals’ hospital discharge records from all private and public hospitals. We study workers aged 18–64 and their response to acute forms of cardiovascular disease (CVD) experienced between 2003 and 2011. We measure the behavioural response in terms of employment, annual income from labour and receipt of disability insurance, for up to 9 years later, and extend previous evidence by also covering the channels of adjustment for those who maintain employment, i.e. the effect on hourly wage and working times.Administrative data on hospitalisations overcome several measurement error challenges typically encountered with survey data and self-reported measures, spanning from recall to justification biases (Baker et al., 2004;Benitez-Silva et al., 2004;Jäckle and Himmler, 2010;d'Uva et al., 2008). Multiple reasons underpin the choice of focusing on acute CVD shocks. They are highly prevalent6and often lead to physical and mental impairments, limiting daily activities and the ability to work. In addition, the focus on acute CVD relates to the issue of health endogeneity. We consider unplanned hospitalisations for myocardial infarction (ischaemic heart disease) or stroke (cerebrovascular disease), the onset of which is clearly attributable to a specific, yet unpredictable, point in time. They offer a source of unexpected variation7in health because, although people may anticipate their risk of illness, they cannot anticipate the timing of actual shock occurrence. At the same time, the risk is well known to depend on established factors (Braunwald et al., 2015), which aids in selecting an appropriate comparison group. To this end, a wide observational time window allows a long history record, up to twenty years before the health shock occurrence, to be exploited.Identification follows two approaches: the main one, used to study long-term responses in terms of AverageTreatment Effecton the Treated (ATT), combines coarsened exact matching and entropy balancing procedures on individuals who are affected or not affected by a CVD shock at a particular point in time. The second approach, which can be applied only to short- to medium-run dynamics, exploits individuals who experience the same CVD shocks five years later as a control group that is plausibly less exposed to any unobserved heterogeneity remaining under the first approach. The two identification approaches deliver similar short- to medium-run adjustments to health shocks, which are robust to the inclusion of weights accounting for selective mortality. We then exploit a firm-size-related discontinuity in EPL under a RDD framework to measure their effect on workers’ labour market inclusion and DI participation after the onset of a major health event.Our work's first contribution is offering – through our results - a picture of permanent employment effects of health shocks experienced when working in a rigid labour market. In the context we study, the bulk of adjustments happen along the extensive margin, and become permanent, with no evident employment recovery mechanism. For workers who maintain employment, there appears to be very limited scope to adjust working times flexibly, or wages to lower productivity, two routes that, if viable, might cushion against the alternative of losing or leaving employment. Instead, previous studies in the US8(e.g.Charles 2003,Dobkin et al. 2018) found hours worked to be an important channel of adjustment to health shocks. In Italy, existing rigidities may force workers to withdraw from the labour force and enter the DI system as the only viable option to replace labour income. This condition becomes an absorbing state, especially in a sticky labour market featuring low hiring rates.The second contribution of this work is the provision of new evidence on the value of EPL in raising the chances that a worker experiencing a health deterioration does not leave employment. Such evidence feeds into a well-developed literature on the causal effects of ELP on firms’ and workers’ outcomes, such as employment, wages, inflow and outflow from (un)employment (e.g.Miles, 2000;Autor et al., 2006;Hijzen et al., 2017;Boeri and van Ours, 2008,Boeri and van Ours, 2021) mentalwellbeingand health (e.g.,Caroli and Godard, 2016). However, to the best of our knowledge, the causal literature has so far overlooked the value of EPL for unhealthy workers, which bears important implications in terms of (saved) social expenditure and (reduced) health andincome inequalitiestransmission (as discussed inReeves et al. 2014). This is important in light of theoretical and empirical works highlighting how the employment protective legislation specifically targeted to the disabled might bear adverse effects of reduced employment for the intendedly protected group (seeAcemoglu and Angrist, 2001and literature cited therein).9These results are also relevant to the stream of literature which studies how different forms of public protection mightde factoact as substitutes. So far, evidence has documented the use of DI as an insurance against non-health-related permanent shocks, as revealed by the increased DI applications/receipts visible under worsenedeconomic conditions(seeBlack, Daniel and Sanders (2002)and more recently,Pasini and Zantomio (2013)andMaestas, Mullen and Strand (2015)on theGreat recessionin Europe and the US respectively). Here, we discuss how EPL might instead lower DI applications through an increase in the employment security of unhealthy workers.The rest of the paper is organised as follows.Section 2discusses the theoretical underpinnings setting the scene for the following empirical analysis.Section 3describes the Italian labour market rigidities and the available DI insurance programmes.Section 4illustrates data,sample selectionand the identification approaches.Section 5presents our findings, and finally,Section 6discusses the results and concludes.",Irene,Michele,Elena
"1. IntroductionSalaries for workers with in-demand technology skills are high.1Increasing the pool of workers who have these skills and apply for tech jobs would increase economic productivity in the US and throughout the world. Policy discussions about science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) or computer skill training emphasize the social benefit of a high-skill work force. Often an assumption is made that, if more people had access to training, more people would go into tech careers, especially since wages are high. However, self-selection into tech jobs is not well understood. The number of American college students who choose to major in computer science is increasing, but it remains a small fraction.2The majority of American college students are not pursuing tech careers but rather favor traditional tracks such as business and nursing. It is important to determine the reasons why most students and job seekers do not consider tech jobs nor pursue opportunities in the dynamic technology sector. One possible factor is the perception of the specific work tasks. Do people dislike computer programming, or do they lack confidence in their own ability to do technical tasks? This paper describes the first controlled study of what factors affect the decision to do computer programming jobs. The majority of the participants are college students who are considering their future career.The experiment is designed to isolate willingness to do the technical tasks involved in high-skill computer work.3Specifically, we ask subjects if they will spend time learning and doing paid computer programming. They must pass a quiz on the function of basic commands in order to qualify for most of the payment. A control for the opportunity cost of time focuses the results on whether participants want to program or not. We abstract away from other concerns that a prospective tech worker has, such as whether they will be able to obtain a job offer, to isolate the perception of the technical tasks. Every participant is offered the tech “job” and they perform the task by themselves, so we have a unique opportunity to study the labor supply for technical work removed from concerns about competition or harassment in a team. By asking a narrow question, we hope to gain insights into job selection. However, we acknowledge that some aspects of actual tech employment are not captured in our experiment. Female subjects behave in the same way as males for incentivized portions of the experiment. However, their self-reported survey answers indicate that the gender gap in tech may be due to more than just a preference for the tasks involved. For example, female subjects are more likely to state that they expect to experience harassment if they pursue tech jobs outside of the experiment.4This experimental design can be extended in the future to explore the causes of the gender gap in tech companies.Most participants want to do the training and short job. However, some require a high wage and several refuse entirely. The variation in willingness to accept this job and the implied reservation wages in this experiment can help explain trends in tech employment.5The most important factor in their decision is whether they report that they enjoy programming or not. People who do not enjoy programming require more money to do it. We can show that this is not simply due to having a higher opportunity cost of time, since the experiment also measures the reservation wage for participants to do a simple task that takes the same amount of time as the programming task. Having previous training in programming has very little effect on willingness to train and take the job.Several treatment interventions were implemented with the goal of increasing confidence. Subjects do not appear more confident if they get to preview a programming code challenge. An encouraging message stating the fact that other students with no experience had been able to succeed in the training caused subjects to raise their reservation wage to program, which is the opposite of the intended effect. Although there is some evidence in the literature that the right kind of encouragement increases the tech labor supply, this experiment serves as a warning about one-size-fits-all messages to students.The paper is structured as follows.Section 2discusses the literature on selection into tech work andgender differences.Section 3describes the design of the experiment used to capture willingness to program in a controlled environment. We present hypotheses inSection 4and results inSection 5. We discuss implications of these findings inSection 6and conclude inSection 7.",J.,None,None
"1. IntroductionTo counteract the spread of COVID-19, governments have introduced a wide range of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), such as distancing rules or work-from-home directives. Though indispensable from an epidemiologist’s perspective, measures such as the closing of schools and universities and the general reduction in economic activity has come with high direct and indirect costs for society as early economic evaluations emphasize (see, for example, the review articles byBrodeur, Gray, Islam, Bhuiyan, 2021,Padhan, Prabheesh, 2021) To date, most of this research has primarily considered the costs of NPIs. Besides the obvious effect of fewer infections and deaths in total, research quantifying the individual and economic benefits of infection prevention is hitherto missing. This paper addresses this gap in the literature by documenting the significant and persistent effect of a COVID-19 infection on individual labor productivity.We contribute these novel findings by studying the performance of professional soccer players after a COVID-19 infection – a setting unrivaled in data quality: We use a highly granular nested panel data set that encompasses a sub-panel for every single match for nearly two years in the top-tier male soccer leagues of Germany and Italy. Thereby we take advantage of an institutional setting that is unique across occupations not only in terms of data availability. First, professional soccer is anindustrythat quickly resumed business, mostly unaffected by NPIs, after only a short interruption in spring 2020 – differently from many other industries. Second, the top European leagues implemented a uniquely rigorous testing procedure: Every player was PCR-tested at least once per week and often several times.Our findings hardly suffer from measurement errors caused by unknown positives. Thus, we circumvent the issue of true case numbers being much higher than reported ones – a problem most occupations face (Hortaçsu, Liu, Schwieg, 2021,Manski, Molinari, 2021). Hence, we are actually able to estimate a population effect and not only the impact of COVID-19 of those showing up in a hospital. Given the popularity of the sport, we can exploit extremely detailed records of all players in every match. This allows us to disentangle individual and team productivity and to detect short- and long-run effects which would remain unobserved outside this industry. Eventually, medical studies on ‘long COVID’ are subject to methodological problems due to a reliance on patients’ self-reported health or subsamples with strong symptoms (Maxwell, 2021,Yelin, Wirtheim, Vetter, Kalil, Bruchfeld, Runold, Guaraldi, Mussini, Gudiol, Pujol, Bandera, Scudeller, Paul, Kaiser, Leibovici, 2020). By solely considering observational data, we avoid this issue.To estimate the effects of a COVID-19 infection, we apply a staggered difference-in-differences framework. We compare infected with non-infected players before and after the infection and exploit the arguably idiosyncratic timing of infections with the virus for identification. In the context of our analysis, we consider productivity as a function of various individual health aspects, such as acceleration, condition, and endurance, but also cognitive capability. Our empirical analysis addresses two questions: Does a COVID-19 infection affect the probability of a player participating in a match and the length of time he stays on the pitch? This extensive margin captures general absence effects related to the infection but also takes up the non-consideration of post-infected players by the team managers. Second, is the performance of previously infected players lower once they play again? Here, our interest lies in productivity across matches as well as within a match – the intensive margin effects.At the extensive margin, we find that once players are cleared to play by a team’s medical staff, their time on the pitch decreases by more than 5%. At the intensive margin, we are able to identify a significant deterioration in infected players’ productivity of 5–7% after an infection. This effect becomes visible right after a player’s return to the pitch but remains persistent for more than eight months – a notable difference from what we find for common respiratory infections.Exploiting the very rich nature of our data, we further assess players’ performance throughout every single match. We identify a disproportional decrease in productivity toward the end of a game. This pattern might even be underestimated as the weakest players are likely to be substituted off. Our analysis reveals notable heterogeneity across age groups. Players above the age of 30 are twice as severely hit as players aged 26 to 30. For younger players up to 25 years of age there exists no significant effect at all.Our paper also contributes to the strand of research which addresses differences between COVID-19 infections and other respiratory infections. For example,Briggs and Vassall (2021)approximate the costs of continuing health deterioration to amount up to 30% of the overall costs caused by the disease including fatalities. In our setting, we highlight that an infection with COVID-19 is indeed different from other respiratory infections, because a productivity deterioration of around 5.1% persists over the course of more than eight months. In contrast, we do not find productivity effects originating from colds and similar illnesses.As in many industries, soccer is a team production. Therefore, we investigate how the individual performance deterioration affects the overall group outcome. A priori, it is unclear whether non-infected players might overcompensate the weakness of their colleagues or suffer from lower performance as well. Our findings support the latter. Players’ joint performance tends to be even lower than the accumulated individual deterioration of infected team members.Of particular interest for this paper is research on productivity effects during the pandemic. For example,Bloom et al. (2020)investigate firm-level productivity using a large panel from the UK and identify a decline intotal factor productivityof 3–5%.Morikawa (2021)has shown that low-productivity firms in particular have drawn from public subsidy schemes. Regarding working from home, the findings for productivity are mixed. WhileBarrero et al. (2021)find an overall positive effect on worker productivity in the UK,Etheridge et al. (2020)do not find significant differences for the UK,Morikawa (2022)identifies a decline for the Japanese economy. Using chess tournaments,Künn et al. (2022)identify a deterioration for cognitively demanding tasks.Altindag et al. (2021)find that online learners during COVID-19 shutdowns have significantly worse outcomes compared to fellow students in classrooms. Particularly among academics,Deryugina et al. (2021)find that womens’ productivity was much more affected through the channel of lockdowns and the related burdens of childcare. In a broader sense,Adams-Prassl, Boneva, Golin, Rauh, 2020,Adams-Prassl, Boneva, Golin, Rauh, 2022show that workers have been unequally affected by the COVID-19 pandemic due to different possibilities to move their work to their homes. In contrast to those and many other economic papers, our primary focus lies on thedirecteffect of an infection itself on individual productivity and not indirect channels such as NPIs, which are exploited above.By analyzing soccer players, we also contribute to a large bodyof economic research, which has frequently applied sports data to uncover otherwise hidden economic mechanisms (Bar-Eli et al., 2020). Among others, this concerns the testing of theoretical hypotheses fromgame theory(e.g.,Bhaskar, 2008,Chiappori, Levitt, Groseclose, 2002,Kassis, Schmidt, Schreyer, Sutter, 2021), identifying psychological drivers of cognitive performance (e.g.,Apesteguia, Palacios-Huerta, 2010,González-Díaz, Palacios-Huerta, 2016), or deriving conclusions for public and labor economics (e.g.,Caselli, Grigoli, Sandri, 2022,Kahn, Sherer, 1988,Kleven, Landais, Saez, 2013,Lichter, Pestel, Sommer, 2017,Parsons, Sulaeman, Yates, Hamermesh, 2011,Principe, van Ours, 2022).The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. InSection 2, we provide background information on the setting of this natural experiment and explain the data used. InSection 3, we outline our empirical analysis.Section 4presents and discusses our results at the individual and the team level.Section 5concludes with a summary, discusses limitations, and provides an outlook for future research.",Kai,J.,W.
"1. IntroductionGender gaps are a persisting problem in today’s labor markets. Despite anti-discrimination laws and gender quotas, men still hold the majority of leadership positions, even in professions where gender ratios among graduates are balanced (see e.g.Chamberlain, Jayaraman, 2017,Monroe, Chiu, 2010). It is unclear to what extent social and biological factors can explain these differences (Browne, 2006). The crude gender wage gap in the EU of 16.6% reduces considerably when accounting for relevant explanatory factors such as qualification, tasks, and working biography; 11.5% still remain unexplained (Eurostat, 2018). Even consideringoccupational choicesand career paths expectations cannot fully explain the gap (Chevalier, 2007). Evolutionary differences in intergroup rivalries could lead to gender-specific competitive behavior (Vugt et al., 2007).Personality and competitive behavior determine how people negotiate. Due to differences in social roles and role congruity, men perform slightly better in negotiations (Stuhlmacher, Linnabery, 2013,Stuhlmacher, Walters, 1999). Recent studies document lower female willingness to enter bargaining and worse outcomes. Women accept lower initial wages due to reduced self-perception (Dittrich et al., 2014) and lack of social information (Rigdon, 2012). They are less likely to sort into companies paying higher premiums and only receive 90% of their male colleagues’ premium (Card et al., 2016). Men prefer negotiable wages (Leibbrandt and List, 2015). Environment and framing are relevant for competitive behavior, e.g. for women, the gender of the counterpart significantly affects the willingness to initiate negotiations (Eriksson and Sandberg, 2012). When framed as an opportunity to ask rather than to negotiate,gender differencesdisappear (Small et al., 2007).To better understand where these differences in negotiations come from, the literature analyzes gender-specific competitiveness in experiments. Three potential explanations for the persisting gender gaps exist. First, men are more prone to select into competitive environments (Dohmen, Falk, 2011,Niederle, Vesterlund, 2007). Second, men are less risk-averse (Croson and Gneezy, 2009) and rather overconfident (Niederle and Vesterlund, 2007). Third, women perform worse when competing against men (Gneezy et al., 2003) although this seems to depend on stakes and age (Antonovics et al., 2009).Evidence from sports complements the experimental insights. Three factors seem to be important for high performers: risk behavior, environment, and stakes. First, men take more risks both when risky behavior might pay off (Böheim et al., 2016) and when it does not (Gerdes and Gränsmark, 2010). Second, women perform better in a female environment (Booth and Yamamura, 2018). Third, men choke under pressure (Cohen-Zada et al., 2017).While the literature building on data from professional sports provides substantial insights, there are three drawbacks. First, male and female competitive behavior are rarely directly comparable. Nearly all professional sports are gender-separated. Hence, men and women face different environments and incentives (with some exceptions, e.g. Japanese speedboat racing in Booth and Yamamura, 2018, and chess in Gerdes and Gränsmark, 2010). To analyze whether there are systematic differences in competitive behavior between men and women, it is crucial to observe both genders in exactly the same environment competing against each other.Second, professional sports are extremely selective and representative only for top performers who sacrifice years of training before gaining ground in tournaments with high monetary rewards. This selection is especially important when analyzing gender differences because the distributions of “taste for competition” for men and women might be different (e.g. in terms of standard deviations). Self-selection into professional sports limits the extrapolation of results to the whole working population. To circumvent this problem, one would need to look at an environment which is representative for a larger share of the population in terms of ability and taste for competition, for example at non-professional sports without monetary rewards. Non-professional sports draw from a larger distribution both in terms of athletic potential and taste for competition because the barriers to enter the sport are low. While there is certainly some selection bias, it should be much lower than in professional sports.Third, winning in professional sports is tied to high monetary rewards which incentivize men and women differently. Several studies document that gender differences in competitiveness vary across stakes (Antonovics, Arcidiacono, Walsh, 2009,Ors, Palomino, Peyrache, 2013). High stake situations are rare events, e.g.promotionsand wage negotiations. Low stake situations occur frequently, e.g. whenever employees decide how much effort to put into a task. A single task alone is not relevant for promotion or wage decisions but the sum of those tasks shapes the supervisor’s perception of the employee. Additionally, looking at a low stake environment comes closer to the “intrinsic” motivation to win a competition, which is still not entirely understood.In a previous paper, we analyzed gender differences in competitive behavior in a non-professional sport with direct gender competition: ninepin bowling (Pikos and Straub, 2020). Using data from around 11,000 games from the German region Württemberg, we found that while men perform better against women on average, this is fully explained by differences in ability. Instrumenting for opposite gender using the sex composition of the opponent team, we did not find any evidence for a significant causal effect of competing against the opposite gender on performance. There were also no significant gender differences in tight situations where the pressure to perform is higher.In the present paper, we analyze the rolecultureand age play for gender-specific performance in competing against the opposite sex. Previous studies find that boys and girls differ in their competitive behavior in Israel but not in Sweden (Dreber, von Essen, Ranehill, 2011,Gneezy, Rustichini, 2004). Differences in competing against the opposite sex could be country specific. Our German data does not contain information on age but the sport is played by young and old, while studies using data from professional sports are often restricted to very homogeneous groups (professional athletes). This is problematic considering that some aspects of personality develop during adolescence (e.g.Fehr et al., 2013, for distributional preferences) and are stable over the working life (e.g.Cobb-Clark and Schurer, 2012, for BIG-5 personality traits). So far, we have only limited knowledge about the heterogeneity of gender-specific competitive behavior. Although previous studies suggest that it varies over age, evidence for whether the gender gap in competition is stable across the life cycle is mixed.Flory et al. (2015)conduct a field experiment with 18- to 68-year-olds and find a smaller gender gap in competitiveness for older age cohorts (Flory et al., 2018confirm this with experiments in Malawi and the U.S. showing that elderly women have the same taste for competition as men). In contrast to that,Mayr et al. (2012)document that the gender gap does not vary over age in their laboratory experiment with 25- to 75-year-olds.Czibor et al. (2019)show that women are more risk averse in a traditionally male environment of online card players and do not find significantage effectsin a subsample analysis.To contribute to this literature, we use around 585,000 observations from twelve seasons of ninepin bowling. Our data comes from the Czech Republic and Austria and contains information on 8,700 players’ gender and age and their performance in nearly 23,000 games. Controlling for ability, we find that men perform better against women and women worse against men in the Czech Republic but not in Austria. This is stable across age.

"1. IntroductionAs in many countries around the world, prospective higher education students in the United Kingdom (UK) choose between a vast number of different degree options when entering university. This paper is the first to exploit an innovative new administrative dataset to look at labour market outcomes at the degree level - that is, the combination of subject field and institution. We explore the variation in earnings returns and investigate the predictability of those returns based on other observable characteristics of the degree. To our knowledge, our paper is the first to estimate returns for individual degrees across an entire higher education market.We find substantial variation in returns, even for degrees that are similarly selective. This implies degree choice matters much more than some of the previous evidence has suggested. Slightly more than half of the variation in returns is within subject, across institutions. We find only a weak relationship between selectivity and returns through much of the selectivity distribution, but a strong positive relationship at the top end. This suggests that there is a large payoff to high ability students attending elite universities. However, this is not true for all subject areas - for some, such as creative arts, there is only a very weak relationship between selectivity and returns throughout the distribution. Finally, aside from selectivity, we find that commonly available measures of degree quality, such as student satisfaction ratings and early career earnings, are not well related to returns. Such measures might therefore mislead student choice and distort university incentives.We use a new administrative data linkage that was developed in partnership with the UK Department for Education. The dataset links together administrative school, university andtaxrecords for the more than three million individuals who completed secondary school in England between 2002 and 2007. The tax records include annual earnings from 2005/06 to 2016/17, meaning we observe the oldest cohort in the data up until roughly age 30. The school records allow us to condition on an extremely detailed set of prior attainment controls that include exam grades in specific subjects at ages 11, 16 and 18, as well as rich information on student background and secondary (high) schoolfixed effects. Unlike some of the recent papers in this literature, the dataset tracks all students through all of the available higher education institutions in the country, and captures anyone who is filing for taxes anywhere in the country.Our data contains more detailed background information on students than many previous studies have been able to use. We exploit this to test the likely role of unobservable factors, such as preferences for factors other than the monetary returns to degrees (whichWiswall and Zafar, 2014, have shown to be important drivers of choices, and may also be correlated with subsequent earnings outcomes), in driving our results. We show that our headline findings are robust to a bounding exercise, followingOster (2019), suggesting that unobservable factors are not likely to affect our main conclusions. We also show that the main findings are robust to the exclusion of subsets of our control variables and are also insensitive to reasonable changes in the sample selected or the regression specification that we use. We also show that we would get different conclusions if we were to estimate degree effects as being equal to the sum of subject and institution effects. This highlights the value of our data, as while the additive approach could be estimated using smaller datasets, it is only possible to obtain reliable degree-level estimates using large scale dataset such as ours.We start by estimating the earnings returns to different subjects and universities. We estimate returns relative to a base case (history for subjects and Sheffield Hallam for universities), within the set of people who attend. We find that medicine, economics and law are amongst the subjects with the highest earnings returns, while social care and creative arts are the subjects with the lowest returns. We find a weak association between university selectivity (as measured by the average prior attainment of people at the university) and returns amongst the bottom half of the selectivity distribution, but a much stronger relationship amongst the top half, suggesting there are large payoffs to attending the most elite universities in the UK, in particular the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, the London School of Economics, and Imperial College London.We then turn to the most novel contribution of the paper and estimate returns at the ‘degree’ level, which is the interaction of institution and subject. We can estimate returns for almost 2000 subject-university combinations (for example, mathematics at the University of Warwick). This is a natural level of granularity to focus on for the UK, where people choose specific subject-university combinations for their degrees prior to starting, and is only viable because of the unique dataset at our disposal. There is dramatic variation in raw earnings outcomes across different degrees: thestandard deviationof the degree-level fixed effects, without any controls, is 32 percentage points and the 90:10 range is 75 percentage points. These figures drop to 22 and 52 percentage points respectively once we estimate degree-level fixed effects controlling for prior attainment, student characteristics, and secondary school fixed effects.There is still substantial variation in returns, even when looking within relatively tight selectivity bands. Amongst the least selective degrees (as measured by the average prior attainment of students at the degree level), the standard deviation in returns is still more than 16 percentage points, increasing to 27 percentage points amongst the most selective set of degrees. It is also the case that a large share of the variation in returns iswithinsubject, even within our selectivity bands. Roughly 50% of the variation in degree returns for the least selective band of degrees is within subject, rising to 65% of the variation for the most selective degrees. Combined, these results suggest that degree choice is crucial for subsequent earnings outcomes, right across the selectivity distribution. This holds even holding subject choice fixed - it is not at all uncommon to see differences in returns of 30 percentage points between degrees in the same subject at similarly selective universities. We highlight the value of our dataset by showing that the variation in estimated returns and the returns to selectivity would be understated (and the share of variation that is within-subject overstated) if we were to simply estimate degree returns as the sum of institution and course returns.Given the importance of degree choice in determining earnings outcomes, in the final part of the paper we consider the predictability of returns across different institutions, within subject. We find that, other than selectivity, existing measures of degree quality are not well correlated with returns once we control for selectivity. As with the institution estimates, on average there is only a weak relationship between degree selectivity and returns through much of the distribution but a much stronger relationship at the top end. However, this varies a lot by subject area: for economics, law and business, returns increase rapidly with university selectivity, while for others, such associologyand the creative arts, they do not.1We then show that other measures of degree quality including publicly available subject-specific university rankings, completion rates and degree performance are all correlated with returns, but this correlation almost completely disappears once we control for selectivity.This suggests that observable measures of degree performance contain little information over and above a simple measure of selectivity. Student satisfaction ratings, early career earnings and wages in the surrounding area are also not well correlated with returns, even unconditionally. These observable degree characteristics matter. For example,Gibbons et al. (2015)shows that public league table rankings are a key driver of student choices, while many of the other measures we look at (such as very early career earnings and student survey scores) are used as inputs for centralised evaluation of teaching quality in the UK, through the ‘Teaching Excellence Framework’. The result that public information on degrees is not well correlated with the earnings outcomes of students has several important implications. First, it will matter for productivity if students select degrees that are not highly valued in the labour market. Second, it will affectinequality, as students from more disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to have to rely on public information when making their higher education choices. Indeed,Campbell et al. (2021)highlight that poorer students are more likely to choose degrees associated with lower earnings outcomes, conditional on prior attainment. Third, it is likely to incentivize universities to focus on metrics that may not be beneficial to the long-term outcomes of students, as doing well on those metrics helps them to achieve good scores in teaching evaluations and to attract students.This rest of this paper is set out as follows.Section 2reviews the related literature and discusses how our paper fits into it.Section 3then describes the dataset we use and gives more detail on the institutional background in the UK andSection 4outlines our methodology. Our results are then presented inSection 5. We start by showing heterogeneity in returns across institutions and subjects before turning to our estimates of degree level returns. In the final part of the results section we look at the relationship between degree level returns and selectivity, as well as with other observable characteristics of the degree.Section 6concludes.",Jack,Laura,Chris
"1. IntroductionImproving gender equality in the labor market remains a challenge in all countries. Currently no country has achieved gender equality according to the UN's GenderInequalityIndex (United Nations, 2021). There are well established gender gaps in key labor market outcomes including labor supply, wages, and representation in certain occupations, especially in “top jobs”. As we will discuss in more detail, “top jobs” refers to high-status occupations that tend to have higher earnings, more job security, and better career trajectories than most other jobs (Goldthorpe and McKnight, 2006). For example, women are less likely to make partner at law firms (Azmat et al., 2020) and reach corporate leadership positions (Bertrand and Hallock 2001;Bertrand et al., 2010). The overrepresentation of men in top jobs may be an important driver of the gender pay gap and other gender inequalities in the labor market. It is therefore important to understand why men have a higher probability of being in a top job.The debate around the gender gap at the top of the career ladder has centered on institutional (e.g. lack of childcare, poor parental leave policies, lack of flexible working arrangements, etc.) vs. individual factors (e.g.gender differencesin non-cognitive skills, preferences for certain types of jobs orindustries, etc.). The popularity of the bookLean Inby Sheryl Sandberg has put a focus on the role of women's underconfidence as a barrier to climbing the career ladder. In addition to highlighting institutional barriers holding women back, Sandberg focused on the ways in which women “hold themselves back” (Sandberg, 2013). This is related to academic literature, which has found that women are more likely to shy away from competition and underestimate their abilities (Azmat and Petrongolo, 2014;Niederle and Vesterlund, 2007;Reuben et al., 2015;Sarsons and Xu, 2021), but are also less likely to overclaim knowledge (Jerrim et al., 2019) than men. These findings show that not only are women more likely to be underconfident, but men are more likely to be overconfident in their abilities, which may exacerbate gender inequality in who climbs the career ladder.In this paper we explore how much of the gender gap in top jobs can be explained by overconfidence. Despite the acknowledgement in the psychological literature that “the significance of overconfidence to the conduct of human affairs can hardly be overstated” (Griffin and Tversky, 1992: 432) and an “individual's choice, persistence, and performance can be explained by their beliefs about how well they will do on the activity and the extent to which they value the activity” (Eccles et al., 1983: 68), no previous studies on gender gaps in access to top jobs have explored the role of overconfidence.Psychologists typically differentiate between three types of overconfidence: overplacement of one's skills compared to others, overestimation of own abilities compared to objective measures, and overestimation of the precision of certain beliefs (overprecision) (Moore and Healy, 2008). We use the second definition and measure overconfidence by looking at whether one's self-assessed cognitive skills (how well individuals think they do in mathematics and how clever they are) are higher than their performance on a series of tests. Overconfidence is thus different from confidence since overconfidence implies individuals have an inflated sense of self relative to their actual ability. There is much discussion in the literature as to the existence and magnitude of gender differences in overconfidence. While some papers find everyone to be overconfident and no difference between men and women (Bandiera et al., 2022), others emphasize the existence of stronger male overconfidence, especially in domains traditionally regarded as “male” (Bertrand, 2011;Sarsons and Xu, 2021;Exley and Kessler, 2022).While there is no evidence on the contribution of overconfidence to the gender gap in top jobs, men being more overconfident than women contributes to the gender gap in expected wages.1Briel et al. (2021)look at the role of overplacement in the gender gap in future wage expectations of prospective university students in Germany whileReuben et al. (2017)examine this among undergraduate students at New York University. They both find that men are more likely to have upward-biased beliefs about their abilities and overplacement plays a major role in explaining the gender gap in wage expectations.Briel et al. (2021)find that 7.7% of the gender gap in wage expectations is attributable to a higher overconfidence of males, whileReuben et al. (2017)find that 18% of the gap is due to men being more overconfident and competitive.We investigate the role of overconfidence in the gender gap in top jobs using representative data from a British birth cohort study to follow men and women from childhood into the labor market in mid-career. We define top jobs following the literature as occupations in the top National Statistics socioeconomic classification (NS-SEC) categories. We use linear probability models and decomposition techniques to show that overconfidence is a significant explanatory factor in the gender gap in top jobs, especially for top jobs in Law, Economics, and Management (LEM). It also appears as though some of the overconfidence effect works through previous educational channels, highlighting the importance of overconfidence in shaping educational pathways into the labor market.We make four contributions to the literature. First, we use representative data to quantify the impact of overconfidence on labor market outcomes. This is unlike previous studies looking at the role of overconfidence in expected wages, which have used samples of university students. Second, as opposed to a one-time measure of overconfidence, we exploit objective measures of cognitive abilities measured at ages 5, 10 and 16, and subjective estimation of abilities from ages 5 and 10 to construct a measure of overestimation. Using data from multiple points in time reduces measurement errors and provides a long-run estimate of overconfidence that is robust to potential individual changes (Golsteyn and Schildberg-Hörisch, 2017). Thus, our measure of overconfidence is more likely to capture a meaningful latent construct than one-time measures captured in a university course or laboratory setting. It is also captured before labor market entry, eliminating concerns around reverse causality. Third, our outcomes are real labor market outcomes, not expected wages.Lastly, while a growing literature aims to explain who ends up in top jobs focusing on social mobility (Laurison and Friedman, 2016;Macmillan et al., 2015;Sullivan et al., 2018), we are the first to explicitly investigate the gender gap in top jobs. We look at those in full time employment and document that the gender gap in top jobs emerges in the late 20s and grows into mid-career. By age 42, full time employed women are six percentage points (or 25 percent) less likely to be in a top job than men, conditional on family background, early educational attainment, university course, partnership status and children. Interestingly, the conditional gap is large amongst full time employed university graduates as well, at 9.5 percentage points (or 20 percent). We also confirm that men are significantly more overconfident than women. When we decompose the gender gap in top jobs, accounting for education, partnership, children, and a range of other factors, we find that overconfidence accounts for a statistically significant portion (5–11 percent) among those in full time employment. Given that overconfidence is measured in adolescence and that it still explains labor market outcomes at age 42, over 25 years later, we argue that its contribution is meaningful, but of course not the entire picture.We go one step further and descriptively look at the gender gap in terms of the costs and benefits of working in a top job. Practically, we compare hours worked, hourly earnings, having a cohabiting partner, and having children among women and men working in top jobs vs. regular jobs. We find that while the gender wage gap is not smaller among those in top jobs than in regular jobs, women work on average more hours in top jobs than in regular jobs. Among men, we do not find such difference: full time employed men work about the same weekly hours in both top and regular jobs. Overall, women in top jobs still work somewhat fewer hours than men. Furthermore, we find that full time employed women who work in top jobs are less likely to have children (even conditional on having a cohabiting partner) than women working in regular jobs. Thus, we find a substitution effect for women between working in top jobs vs. having children, and we find no such effect for men.We conclude that many of the barriers to women ending up in top jobs are not the result of them “holding themselves back”, but rather societal or workplace based. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that the gender gap in top jobs becomes small and statistically insignificant once we restrict the sample to those who do not have partners (or children). Overconfidence still predicts the probability of being in a top job for those women without partners or children, but not for the subsamples with partners and children. Thus, once the decision to start a family is made, overconfidence seems to lose its importance.The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In section 2 we discuss the data used and present keydescriptive statistics. In section 3 we present the methods used to conduct our decomposition. Section 4 contains our results. In section 5, we look at the costs and benefits of working in a top job while we conclude in section 6.",Anna,Nikki,None
"1. IntroductionHigh levels of wageinequalitycontinue to persist and, in some countries, they have been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic (e.g.Palomino, Rodríguez, Sebastian, 2020,Bonacini, Gallo, Scicchitano, 2021). High levels of inequality are not only incompatible with widely held norms of social justice, they can also fuel social tensions and might pose a threat to economic growth. Not surprisingly, the drivers of wage inequality and possible remedies have become some of the most hotly debated issues by policymakers and researchers alike.In this paper, we investigate the role of occupational tasks in driving male wage inequality in West Germany.1A distinctive feature of our paper is the use of administrative wage data matched with task data fromemployee surveyswhich capture changes in task content within occupations. Economists have long recognised the importance of human capital in explaining workers’ wage differentials (Becker, 1962,Mincer, 1974). In the early 2000s, researchers proposed a new approach to measuring human capital using data on tasks performed on the job (Autor et al., 2003). This task-based approach defines occupations as bundles of tasks and links workers’ wages to occupational tasks. The main hypothesis is that recent technological change is biased toward replacing labour in routine tasks, leading to a decrease in wages and employment shares in routine-task intensive occupations.Several studies have drawn on this hypothesis to explain the polarisation of the US labour market since the late 1990s (e.g.Autor, Dorn, 2013,Autor, Katz, Kearney, 2006,Autor, Katz, Kearney, 2008). Some researchers argue that the routinisation hypothesis also (partly) explains polarisation tendencies in Western European countries, most notably in Germany and in the UK (e.g.Dustmann, Ludsteck, Schönberg, 2009,Goos, Manning, 2007,Goos, Manning, Salomons, 2009,Goos, Manning, Salomons, 2014). Contributions in this field focus on employment or wage polarisation, or both. The term employment polarisation describes the phenomenon that the employment shares of high- and low-skill occupations have been increasing at the expense of employment shares in middle-skill occupations. In the same vein, wage polarisation means that wages at the top and the bottom have been increasing faster than those in the middle of the distribution. In other words, the pay difference between high-wage and middle-wage jobs has increased, while the difference between middle- and lower-wages has been shrinking. In this paper, we focus on wage polarisation.The majority of studies investigating the routinisation hypothesis suffer from several shortcomings. First, most are of a descriptive nature: They simply document changes in wage and employment patterns of occupations and juxtapose them to the routine-task intensity of those occupations. Second, most are silent on whether taskswithinoccupations have changed.2Third, most studies lack a discussion on how to measure routine tasks. However, such a discussion is nontrivial and wrong classifications may lead to wrong conclusions (Autor, 2013).In this paper, we try to overcome these shortcomings. First, we apply a rigorouseconometricframework and move beyond merely comparing patterns. Specifically, we use a two-stage decomposition procedure introduced byFirpo et al. (2009), which allows for (i) accounting of multiple explanatory factors in a regression framework, and (ii) investigating changes along the entire wage distribution. The approach is similar to the Oaxaca-Blinder (OB) decomposition (Blinder, 1973,Oaxaca, 1973) in that it decomposes wage differentials in a counterfactual manner. However, it is more flexible, allowing for the decomposition of any distributional statistic. We may thus uncover important differences at different parts of the distribution, which the mean analysis of the OB decomposition would overlook. Second, we account explicitly for changes in task content within occupations. Third, we introduce a new classification of tasks, focusing the discussion on how to identify routine tasks.Our task data are the BIBB/IAB and BIBB/BAuA Employment Surveys, representative cross-section surveys conducted roughly every seven years since 1979. For each survey wave, we can directly measure the task content of occupations; that is, survey participants indicate the activities they perform on the job. We characterise occupational tasks by four categories: abstract (such as researching), interactive (such as negotiating), manual (such as repairing) and routine (such as operating machinery). We aggregate this worker-level data into occupational cells and use the occupational code to match our task data to our wage data, which is the Sample of Integrated Labour Market Biographies (SIAB). The SIAB is a 2% random sample of all social security records in Germany, covering the employment histories of about 1.5 million individuals from 1975 through 2008.We provide descriptive evidence that the task content within occupations varies over time. This evidence provides support forAutor's (2013)assessment that new technologies have not simply wiped out certain occupations, but fundamentally changed the tasks performed in these occupations. Generally, we find that the shares of routine and manual tasks decrease over time, while the shares of abstract and interactive tasks increase. This trend holds across wage deciles, while its magnitude differs at different parts of the distribution. We thus speak to the recent literature investigatingwithin-occupation task changes in the US labour market (Atalay, Phongthiengtham, Sotelo, Tannenbaum, 2018,Atalay et al., 2019,Atalay, Phongthiengtham, Sotelo, Tannenbaum, 2020,Deming, Kahn, 2018,Hershbein, Kahn, 2018,Michaels, Rauch, Redding, 2019). In a departure from prior research, we find that the share of routine tasks is largest in occupations at the lowest tail of the wage distribution and that this share slowly declines with increasing wage. We can thus not confirm that occupations in the middle of the wage distribution have the largest routine-task intensity.Related to this point, we show descriptively that changes in the West German wage structure are different to those observed in Anglo-Saxon countries. Instead of a U-shaped polarisation of wages since the early 1980s (Autor, Katz, Kearney, 2008,Goos, Manning, 2007), we find a uniform increase in wage inequality with widening wage gaps at the top starting in the early 1980s, and at the bottom starting only in the 1990s. Our findings are in line with studies for West Germany that use register data (Antonczyk, DeLeire, Fitzenberger, 2018,Baumgarten, Felbermayr, Lehwald, 2020,Biewen, Fitzenberger, De Lazzer, 2017,Dustmann, Ludsteck, Schönberg, 2009,Dustmann, Fitzenberger, Schönberg, Spitz-Oener, 2014,Fitzenberger, 1999,Kohn, 2006,Riphahn, Schnitzlein, 2016). Changes in the wage structure are thus concentrated both at the top and the bottom, while the middle remains relatively stable.Our decomposition analyses reveal several additional findings. First, we find composition effects, i.e. changes due to varying worker characteristics, not to matter much. This result somewhat contradicts previous studies (Antonczyk, Fitzenberger, Leuschner, 2009,Biewen, Fitzenberger, De Lazzer, 2017,Dustmann, Ludsteck, Schönberg, 2009), which point toward composition effects explaining some of the inequality increase. However, those studies use either different data or look at different time horizons compared to us, which may explain the differing findings. Contrarily, using the Integrated Employment Biographies, which contains nearly all private sector employees in Germany,Card et al. (2013)also find that compositional effects do not matter greatly.Second, we find wage structure effects, i.e. changes in the returns to those characteristics, to be important drivers of wage inequality. Specifically, from the late 1970s until the early 1990s, we identify changes in the returns to education and experience as major drivers of wage inequality. Occupational tasks start to matter in the 1990s only. For that period, we find changing returns to abstract tasks to drive upper-tail inequality. Technological change may have increased the demand for and thus the returns to abstract tasks. An example could be advancements in communication technology that benefit workers in occupations with large shares of abstract tasks. This assessment is in line withDustmann et al. (2009), who argue that technological change is an important driver for upper-tail wage inequality.For lower-tail inequality, we find changing returns to routine tasks as a major driver. The intuition here is that workers at the bottom of the wage distribution have a comparative advantage in occupations that are intensive in routine tasks, while the demand for these tasks has declined. This result differs from earlier work focusing on labour markets where occupations in the middle of the distribution are characterised by high routine intensity. This difference may be the result of our more rigorous definition of routine tasks. For example,Katz (2014)highlights for the US that many crafts occupations that are commonly classified as routine manual have been faring well in terms of labour market performance. This could point to an inappropriate classification of routine manual tasks.In the 2000s, we find abstract and routine tasks not to matter greatly anymore, while changing returns to interactive tasks are now driving lower-tail inequality. This finding could be related to previous empirical findings that some tasks are not easily offshored and thus less affected by decreasing wages (Autor, Dorn, 2013,Firpo, Fortin, Lemieux, 2011). Occupations with large shares of ‘non-offshorable’ tasks may thus have experienced an increasing demand and thus increasing returns during the 2000s. Our results also speak to the relatively few studies that focus on the rising complementarity between cognitive andsocial skills(Borghans, Ter Weel, Weinberg, 2014,Deming, 2017,Weinberger, 2014).Furthermore, in the 2000s, we find a role for firm characteristics to explain increases in lower-tail wage inequality. We thus confirm previous findings, which point to the importance of firm heterogeneity in explaining increases in inequality (Antonczyk, Fitzenberger, Sommerfeld, 2010,Card, Heining, Kline, 2013,Dustmann, Ludsteck, Schönberg, 2009).Our study is closest toAntonczyk et al. (2009), who also run adecomposition analysisfor Germany. However, our study differs in several important aspects. First, they use the classification of tasks introduced bySpitz-Oener (2006), while we develop a new task categorisation. Second, they investigate the years 1999 to 2006, while our time horizon spans from 1978 to 2006. This longer horizon provides the opportunity for a detailed analysis of task changes within occupations. Third, they solely rely on survey data, while we use wage register data.Our study adds several new insights to the discussion on the drivers of wage inequality. First, we show how the time-varying characteristics of occupations matter. Any discussion on how technological change affects the nature of work should thus explicitly account for changing task requirements within occupations. Second, we show that a simple comparison of wage and task patterns may lead to wrong conclusions. For example, in the early 2000s increases in upper-tail wage inequality coincide with increases in the share of abstract tasks. However, our RIF regression-based decompositions reveal that these patterns are largely unrelated. Only a regression framework allows controlling for confounding factors and uncovering the contribution of changes in occupational tasks to changes in the wage distribution.Our study thus allows for a better understanding of why some occupations have incurred sharp wage losses, while others have experienced strong gains. Such an understanding is also important for the policy debate on whether workers today are well equipped to face the challenges arising from technological change and on whether education curricula may need to be revised.",Miriam,Uschi,None
"1. Section I: IntroductionCompliance is a crucial and understudied dimension of the minimum wage's labor market effects.1In this paper, we investigate a set of key issues regarding the pervasiveness and determinants of subminimum wage payment (sometimes termed “wage theft” in the U.S. context). First, we estimate the extent of “subminimum wage payment on the margin.” That is, we quantify the change in subminimum wage payment following recent minimum wage increases. Second, we investigate whether a minimum wage increase's magnitude and forecastability shape the extent of subsequent subminimum wage payment. Third, we investigate the relationship between subminimum wage payment and enforcement regimes.Our empirical analysis focuses on recent minimum wage changes, enacted from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2019. This decade offers an attractive empirical environment for two reasons. First, the 2008 financial crisis was followed by a period of stability in both state and federal minimum wage policy. Second, subsequent changes in states’ minimum rates exhibited historically dramatic variations. Thispolicy environment— a “pre period” prior to policy changes across states, followed by substantial state-level policy changes of varying magnitudes — offers an opportunity to conduct transparent analyses using both traditional and recently developed empirical methods.We begin by investigating whether subminimum wage payment becomes more common when the minimum wage rises. We find strong evidence that it does. In our baseline analysis of young workers ages 16 to 25, we find that a one-dollar increase in the minimum wage predicts, on average, a wage gain of 29 cents and a 3.6 cent increase in underpayment. A consistent finding across our analysis samples is that increases in measured underpayment average in the neighborhood of 10 to 20 percent of realized wage gains. On average across the country, we estimate that each dollar of minimum wage increase would, if applied nationally, have generated an increase in subminimum wage payment of roughly $1.16 billion and an increase in realized wage gains, among the employed, of roughly $6.86 billion. Our results thus suggest that compliance with the minimum wage is the norm, but that avoidance and evasion are nontrivial.Next, we find far larger increases in subminimum payment following increases that were enacted through newlegislationthan following increases that came about due to pre-existing laws that call for annual, inflation-indexed updates to states’ minimum wages. Relatedly, we find that observed wage rates regularly move in lockstep with the minimum wage itself under the inflation-indexing regimes. The regularity and forecastability of inflation-indexed minimum wage increases thus appear to have a substantial impact on compliance.2Finally, we find that enforcement regimes mediated the extent to which minimum wage increases led to increases in subminimum wage payment. Below, we elaborate on how these findings relate to the literature's understanding of the causes and consequences of compliance with minimum wages.Because self-reported wage data may be reported with error, it is challenging to analyze subminimum wage payment in the U.S. labor market. Our analysis thus considers and accounts for issues including exemptions for tipped workers, occupational exemptions, substate minimum wage rates, and survey item non-response. We assess measurement error's potential role in explaining both our overall estimates and key findings from our heterogeneity analyses.We emphasize that we are investigating compliance with minimum wageson the margin. That is, we estimate the increase in subminimum wage payment that occurs following changes in the minimum wage. We are not attempting to estimate the total amount of noncompliance at any given point in time, which would require making much stronger assumptions. For the task at hand, the key assumption we must make is that changes in the role of measurement error in self-reported subminimum wage payment are not correlated with minimum wage changes. While nontrivial, this assumption is weaker than the assumptions required to estimate the overall prevalence of subminimum wage payment, perhaps using a structural model that attempts to account and correct for measurement error. Of course, a structural approach can only correct for measurement error subject to strong assumptions about the properties of the error. We thus prefer to take the more modest approach of acknowledging measurement error's potential relevance and investigating its plausibility as an explanation for our findings along several dimensions.Our analysis requires assuming that measurement error has not generated a spurious, systematic correlation betweenchangesin the minimum wage andchangesin the amount of subminimum wage payment we observe. We conduct several lines of analysis to investigate the plausibility of this assumption. First, we show that minimum wage increases do not predict changes in the relevance of selection margins linked to imputation and measurement error. We then discuss evidence that a canonical measurement error model is unable to match key patterns we observe in the prevalence of subminimum wage payment. Finally, we find that economic features of states’ labor market institutions predict substantial variations in the prevalence of subminimum wage payment. Measurement error does not predict systematic variations of this sort. Our evidence on the role of enforcement and wage-setting institutions thus pushes against the hypothesis that the variations in subminimum wage payment we observe are driven, either entirely or even to a substantial degree, by measurement error.Our analysis contributes to an existing set of studies on the empirical predictors of noncompliance with minimum wages. In the U.S. context, analyses have found that violation rates are correlated with several of the factors that arise in classic models.3BothWeil (2005)andBernhardt, Spiller, and Theodore (2013), for example, find high violation rates inindustriesin which firms have a limited ability to passlabor costson to consumers.Bernhardt, Spiller, and Theodore (2013)also find that firms’ management structures shape compliance behavior.Compliance rates vary substantially around the world.Bhoratet al.(2017)find high and highly varying rates of noncompliance across a set of seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Two additional studies, one focused on a set of 10 European countries (Goraus‐Tańska and Lewandowski, 2019) and one focused on a set of 11 developing countries (Raniet al., 2013), find complementary evidence that subminimum wage payment is most prevalent when countries’ minimum wage rates are high relative to average wage rates.Garnero (2018)finds evidence of substantial noncompliance in Italy's labor markets, in particular among small firms and in the wages paid to women and temporary workers.Garnero and Lucifora (forthcoming)find evidence of noncompliance as a margin that can mitigate the extent of employment declines in response to minimum wage increases.Caliendo, Schröder, and Wittbrodt (2019)discuss evidence from several recent papers on compliance in the context of Germany's recent introduction of a statutory minimum wage. The evidence suggests moderately high rates of noncompliance in the short run (Caliendoet al., 2018;Bruttel, Baumann, and Dütsch, 2018).In the United Kingdom, theLow PayCommission has paid significant attention to the issue of noncompliance with minimum wages and has published annual reports on this issue since 2017. Using data from the UKLabour Force Surveyof workers and the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, theLow Pay Commission (2020)reported substantial and relatively consistent rates of subminimum wage payment over time. A key question raised by the report is the extent to which subminimum wage payment reflects regulatory avoidance and evasion, and thus in need of remedy primarily through greater enforcement, versus reflecting deficits in employer and employee regulatory awareness, and thus in need of remedy primarily through additional information provision.A final set of papers has highlighted a conceptually relevant connection between minimum wages and tax compliance. This research emphasizes the fact that the minimum wage imposes a floor on firms’ wage reporting, since earnings that would fall below the minimum wage are suspicious, and can increase firms’ audit probabilities.Gavoille and Zasova (2021), for example, find that likely-tax-evading firms in Latvia are less likely to reduce employment following a minimum wage hike. Such firms are able to “comply” with the minimum wage increase by reporting wages that had previously been paid but not reported to the tax authority. An implication of this finding is that the apparent beneficiaries of a minimum wage increase can, under these circumstances, experience a reduction in their net-of-tax income following the increase in the minimum wage.Tonin's (2011)analysis of the effect of a large 2001 increase in Hungary's minimum wage is consistent with this concern, as he finds evidence that consumption decreases among workers whose reported earnings rose with the increase in the minimum wage.4In a cross-country analysis,Tonin (2013)finds a strong positive correlation between the fraction of a country's workers earning the minimum wage and the degree of underreporting of earnings. Put differently, more workers’ reported wages are bunched at the minimum wage in countries with relatively largeunderground economies.We contribute to this literature in two ways. First, we provide new evidence on the magnitude of noncompliance following minimum wage increases in the recent U.S. context, which is empirically attractive due to substantial variations in states’ minimum wage regimes. Second, we develop two sets of facts, one involving enforcement institutions and one involving wage setting institutions, that shed light on the economics of subminimum wage payment.With respect to enforcement institutions, we find that increases in the prevalence of sub-minimum wage payment were largest in states with relativelystrongenforcement regimes. This finding is consistent with models that incorporate the worker's incentive to report subminimum wage payment, as inYaniv (1994)andBadaoui and Walsh (2022). In such models, strong enforcement regimes encourage reporting and compliance when the minimum wage is low, such that enforcement is in the worker's interest. If the minimum wage rises beyond the level an employer would be willing or able to pay, however, enforcement may cease to be in the worker's interest. As the minimum wage crosses this threshold, reductions in compliance will tend to be larger under strong enforcement regimes because these were precisely the regimes in which workers had an incentive to report noncompliance at baseline.With respect to wage setting institutions, we find that compliance is far stronger when minimum wage increases are regular and forecastable than when they are newly legislated. Noncompliance is one of many margins along which firms might respond to minimum wage increases (Clemens, 2021). As highlighted byBasu, Chau, and Kanbur (2010)as well as byGarnero and Lucifora (forthcoming), this can imply tradeoffs between enforcement and the minimum wage's effects on employment.5Notably, adjustments to personnel, benefits, and the structure of the workplace take time to implement, while noncompliance arises automatically if firms fail to raise wages. Noncompliance may thus be more prevalent as firms respond to newly legislated minimum wage increases than when increases are baked into longstanding legislation. Our additional evidence on dynamics shows that compliance improves by the end of our sample following moderate minimum wage increases, but not following large increases. When it is more costly for firms to comply, the required adjustments take longer to unfold.Our paper proceeds as follows. Section II describes recent changes in states’ minimum wage policy regimes. Section III describes the data we analyze. Section IV presents our empirical methodology. Sections V presents our empirical analysis and Section VI concludes.",Jeffrey,Michael,None
"1. IntroductionA large literature has documented the importance ofpeer effectsin education. These studies have mostly focused on short-run outcomes and how these are affected by various measures ofaveragepeer quality. Our paper contributes to the literature by studying long-run educational outcomes by gender for a US representative sample of high-school students. Our analysis generates an important finding: male “high flyers” (the term we use to denote students who have parents with a post college education) have a significant negative effect on the propensity of their high-school female peers to go on to obtain a college degree. We show that these results stem from male high flyers rather than from exposure to boys who on average might be expected to perform better academically. Furthermore, the gender effect is asymmetric: female high flyers do not affect their male peers.Our investigation focuses on the exposure to high flyers at a particularly impressionable period of life: high school. We use the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) which was designed to be a nationally representative sample of students in grades 7–12 in the US. We make use of a predetermined student characteristic – whether at least one parent has somepost-collegeeducation – to proxy for a bundle of characteristics that predict that a student will do very well in school. Students with a post-college parent can not only be expected to perform very well academically but may have other important correlated characteristics – e.g., be more career-oriented, have greater self-confidence, possess high expectations of going to college, etc. – that matter to their peers.1Aggregating this feature across students at the grade level by gender allows us to exploit plausibly exogenous variation across grades within the same school in the proportions of high flyers of each gender.Our main question of interest is to determine how exposure to high flyers affects long-run human capital. We find a very strong asymmetric gender effect: male high flyers have a statistically and economically significant negative effect on the probability that girls will obtain a bachelor’s degree but do not affect boys. Female high flyers, on the other hand, do not affect college outcomes for either gender. Probing further, we show that the negative effect of male high flyers is concentrated in the lower half of the female ability distribution and among those with more-educated parents. Girls exposed to a higher proportion of male high flyers tend to have lower math and science grades in high school and to substitute away from a four-year college degree into a two-year college degree. Furthermore, they have lowerlabor force participationand higher fertility by the ages of 26–32. Although our data does not allow us to pin down the precise pathway underlying our results, we are able to go beyond most of the literature and show that a higher proportion of male high flyers is associated with lower self-confidence/aspirations in girls, reminiscent of the asymmetric gender effects from competition found byNiederle and Vesterlund (2007)andBordalo et al. (2019), among others.Our paper is related to several strands of a literature that study the interaction of peer effects and gender broadly speaking.2One strand examines how the proportion of own-gender students affects various outcomes (e.g.,Anelli, Peri, 2019,Black, Devereux, Salvanes, 2013,Hoxby, 2000,Lavy, Schlosser, 2011). Another strand studies how ability composition/peer quality affects academic outcomes (e.g.,Carrell, Fullerton, West, 2009,Imberman, Kugler, Sacerdote, 2012). There are only a handful of papers that, like ours, are concerned with the potentially asymmetric gender effects from high-performing peers. We discuss these in greater depth below.Exploiting the shuffling of students between primary and secondary schools in England along with subject-specific differences in peer ability,Lavy et al. (2012)find that high-achieving male peers (those scoring in the top five percent on national standardized tests) have no significant impact on girls’ test scores but negatively impact boys’ scores; high-achieving female peers affect girls’ test scores positively and have no effect on boys’ scores.Mouganie and Wang (2020)study high-school students in China and find that high-performing male peers (as defined by their national exam scores in mathematics) reduce the likelihood of girls choosing a science track (relative to an arts track) for the remainder of high school; high-performing female peers have the opposite effect. This study differ from ours in various respects. First, their primary focus is on how high-performing peers affect girls’ choice of a STEM track in high school. Although the authors also examine 4-year university eligibility, the data does not permit them to know whether the student actually went on to attend, let alone graduate, from university. Second, high-performing peers of genderzin a particular grade are defined as those students of genderzwho scored above the 20th percentile in the national math exam,calculated as a proportion of all students in that grade who also did so. This automatically implies that if the proportion of female high-performing peers in the grade is high, the equivalent proportion for males is low as they must add to 100 percent at the grade level. When the authors calculate the proportion of high achievers relative to others of theirowngender in the grade, as we do, they do not find significant effects for college eligibility.3The negative results for girls choosing STEM in high school from high-achieving males remains as does the positive effect of high-achieving females, however. Lastly, the institutional setting is very different and both are of great interest in their own right.Feld and Zölitz (2022)exploit the random assignment of first-year students within compulsory courses to teaching sections in a Dutch business school. Conducting a careful statistical analysis, they show that belonging to a teaching section in which either female or male peers have a higheraveragepre-assignment GPA (grades obtained in business school prior to joining the teaching section) does not have a significant effect neither for a student’s choice of mathematical elective courses nor for the selection of a mathematical major. The authors also study outcomes five years later and do not find any effects of higher GPA female or male peers on employment or earnings. Relative to this paper, our contribution is to study outcomes in a less specialized environment than a business school and to do so for a representative sample of US high schools.4Our paper, along with the ones cited above, have influenced other recent papers to examine asymmetric gender effects. For example,Busso and Frisancho (2021)study how exposure to high-performing male and female peers in public middle schools in Mexico City affect high-school placement outcomes, disentangling between two factors that affect placement: exam performance and how the student orders school preference. They find that high-achieving boys have strong negative effects on high-performing girls’ admission scores and preferences for selective schools.Balestra et al. (2021)study the causal impact of intellectually gifted students on their non-gifted classmates in grades 7 and 8 in Switzerland. They find that male students benefit from gifted peers, regardless of their gender whereas female students benefit almost exclusively from gifted female students, particularly in math. They also study longer term outcomes, finding that exposure to gifted classmates significantly increases the likelihood of male students entering the academic track instead of the vocational one, increasing the likelihood that these men go on to choose a STEM occupation. Lastly,Modena et al. (2022)study exposure to high-performing peers across cohorts within the same degree and university in Italy. They find that all students, although especially girls, benefit from female high-performing peers. Male high performers have negative effects on female students (and smaller but still negative effects on male students), particularly in STEM degree programs.Our paper is also related to those that study the long-run impacts of peers’ parental education.Bifulco et al. (2011)andBifulco et al. (2014)use Add Health and find that peer socioeconomic status, as measured by percentage of students whose mother completed college, improves high-school completion and college attendance but has no effect on bachelor’s degree attainment. We show that these results stem, however, from not differentiating between male and female peers with college-educated mothers and from not allowing the effect of these peers to differ by the gender of the student (seeTable 10). Furthermore, in a horse race between using college-education (now differentiated by gender) and our high flyer measure, we show that only the latter affects long-run education outcomes.Table 1.

"1. IntroductionThe importance of team-based production increased notably over the last three decades (see e.g.Deming, 2017,Jones, 2009,Wuchty, Jones, Uzzi, 2007). Understanding which factors determine successful collaboration is thus at the very heart of various studies in labor, business, and organizational economics. In particular, a large body of literature studies whether working groups whose members differ in their sociodemographic characteristics are more or less productive than homogeneous working groups.Making a prediction about how diversity in sociodemographic worker characteristics affects the performance of a team is difficult as diversity can have both positive and negative effects (seevan Knippenberg, De Dreu, Homan, 2004,Prat, 2002,Williams, O’Reilly, 1998). For instance, on the one hand, diversity may broaden the range of skills, which in turn may raise team performance (Cox et al., 1991).1However, on the other hand, diversity may lower team performance because of lower group cohesion or higher risk of conflict (O’Reilly et al., 1989). In addition, since various characteristics exist in which members of a team can differ from each other (e.g. gender, tenure, religion), the relevance of the positive and negative aspects of diversity may depend on the characteristic. It is also possible that surrounding factors moderate the effects of diversity (van Knippenberg et al., 2004).This paper complements the existing literature by providing causal evidence on the relationship between birthplace diversity and team performance. We choose this type of diversity for three main reasons. First, the number of multinational working groups increased considerably in the last decades (see e.g.Freeman, Huang, 2015,Kahane, Longley, Simmons, 2013). Second, compared to other sociodemographic worker characteristics, only little research exists on the effects of birthplace diversity on team performance. Finally, managers are interested in this type of diversity and differ in their beliefs regarding its effects (see e.g.Stahl-Rolf et al., 2018).Providing causal evidence on the effect of birthplace diversity on team performance is challenging for a number of reasons. A main challenge is to find an environment where working teams are clearly identifiable and people from different countries collaborate. Another difficulty is to satisfy the data requirements for such an empirical analysis. In particular, we need objective measures of performance and data on workers’ abilities. Finally, we must develop an identification strategy that is appropriate for establishing causality.We exploit hand-collected and web-scraped data from the highest division of men’s football in Germany (1.Bundesliga)2to address the problems that arise when studying the relationship between birthplace diversity and team performance.3TheBundesligais an attractive environment for our purposes since we clearly observe who collaborates with whom and have objective measures of team performance. In addition, freely accessible sources provide detailed information about football players, including their country of birth. Especially remarkable in this regard are time-varying measures of quality that we obtain from the video game seriesFIFAand the web platformTransfermarkt. In total, our dataset consists of 7038Bundesligamatches and 3266 players, coming from almost 100 countries.The most common approach when investigating how diversity affects team (or firm) performance is to estimate two-wayfixed effectregression models. In these models, the measures of diversity are typically based on ex-post observable information about the composition of the team (seeDezsö, Ross, 2012,Haas, Nüesch, 2012,Kahane, Longley, Simmons, 2013,Prinz, Wicker, 2016, among others). An objection against this popular approach is that it neglects compositional changes that happen during the production process. This neglect is problematic since the performance of a team may influence the extent to which the composition of a team changes over time. For instance, imagine a research unit of three junior scientists that has limited time to develop a new software package. Suppose further that these junior researchers realize after three-fourth of the time that they are stuck and thus ask a senior scientist to join the team. The ex-post observable information on the composition of the team therefore provides an inaccurate picture in this example and hides important dynamic adjustments.In our specific case, such adjustments are a severe issue. In particular, we illustrate that the level of birthplace diversity increases throughout a match if a team does not perform well (in the case above, it would be the tenure level of the research group). We explain this pattern with the fact that team managers replace defensive with offensive players if their team is behind. These performance-based substitutions increase the level of birthplace diversity since the share of foreigners inBundesligaclubs is often larger among offensive than among defensive players. Consequently, when applying a two-way fixed effect approach in our setting, we underestimate the optimal level of birthplace diversity.4To address the aforementioned and otherendogeneity problems, we useinstrumental variableapproaches. The first of these approaches exploits predicted starting line-ups published by the leading football magazineKicker. More specifically, we compute how diverse the players in these predicted starting line-ups are and use this measure as an instrument for the diversity of the fielded players. Our second approach resembles the approach byBettinger and Long (2005)who exploit unexpected absences of university lectures to study the importance of role models for study choice. In our case, we use unexpected replacements in the starting line-ups. Conditional on our large set of fixed effects and control variables, we believe that these changes produce plausible exogenous variation in team structures. In a robustness check, we only exploit those unexpected replacements for which we know that they are caused by an injury.Our instrumental variable regressions provide evidence for a non-linear relationship between birthplace diversity and team performance. In particular, we observe that the effect of birthplace diversity on team performance increases up to a certain level and becomes smaller beyond this threshold. Put differently, our estimates imply that an intermediate level of birthplace diversity maximizes team performance. A variety of robustness checks substantiates this view. We also present estimates suggesting that the optimal level of birthplace diversity varies across tasks and depends on the importance of interpersonal communication.This paper contributes to the literature that links birthplace diversity to economic performance. At the macro level, most existing studies have identified positive effects of birthplace diversity (for country-level studies, see e.g.Alesina, Harnoss, Rapoport, 2016,Bove, Elia, 2017; for regional-level studies, see e.g.Ager, Brueckner, 2013,Docquier, Turati, Valette, Vasilakis, 2020,Hornung, 2014,Ottaviano, Peri, 2005,Suedekum, Wolf, Blien, 2014). The common explanations are complementary skills and business specializations. However, the macro studies remain inconclusive about situations in which diverse individuals are forced to directly collaborate. At the micro level, two types of studies exist. The first consists of studies that conduct (field or laboratory) experiments. The results of these experiments are mixed. For instance,Earley and Mosakowski (2000)conclude that the relationship between birthplace diversity and team performance is U-shaped, whereasLyons (2017)finds negative effects. To explain her result,Lyons (2017)provides evidence, suggesting that nationally diverse teams suffer from communication problems. The second type of studies analyzes observable data with fixed effect approaches. In many cases, this data comes from the sports industry. An exception isFreeman and Huang (2015)who study research groups and find that birthplace diversity enhances performance. By contrast, most of the studies that exploit sports data conclude that birthplace diversity reduces team performance (see e.g.Addesa, Pazzona, Rossi, 2022,Haas, Nüesch, 2012,Kahane, Longley, Simmons, 2013,Maderer, Holtbrügge, Schuster, 2014).5We show results from instrumental variable regressions, suggesting that the relationship between birthplace diversity and team performance is hump-shaped. We also illustrate that the classical fixed effect approach produces much lower estimates for the optimal level of birthplace diversity. More specifically, we show that neglecting performance-based substitutions creates results that are consistent with prior studies, considering comparable circumstances. To the best of our knowledge, our instrumental variable procedures have not been used in other studies that examine how birthplace diversity affects team performance.More generally, we contribute to the literature that analyzes how diversity in socio-demographic worker characteristics affects team performance. This literature consists of numerous studies, considering several types of diversity and applying various empirical methods (for detailed reviews, seeGuillaume, Dawson, Otaye-Ebede, Woods, West, 2017,Horwitz, Horwitz, 2007,Joshi, Roh, 2009,van Knippenberg, Mell, 2016,Williams, O’Reilly, 1998).6Apart from providing causal evidence on the role of one specific type of diversity, our paper has three contributions.7First, we illustrate that regression results can be severely biased if an empirical approach neglects that the composition of a team changes during the production process, depending on how it performs. Since such changes can occur in manyindustries, we think that such an illustration is important to further improve the awareness for this endogeneity problem. Second, our paper establishes instrumental variable approaches. Because variants of our methods can be applied to other types of diversity and in other institutional environments, our paper may help other scholars to address their problems. Finally, we support the view that external factors moderate the effect of workplace diversity on team performance by showing that the optimal level of diversity depends on the importance of interpersonal communication. In particular, we exploit the division of tasks on the pitch between forwards and defenders and show that the optimal level of birthplace diversity is higher for offensive players than for defensive players. We consider this difference as notable because offensive players have to solve creative tasks, whereas defensive players need to rely more on communication skills to fulfill their duties.This paper proceeds as follows.Section 2informs about theBundesligaand our data.Section 3describes our empirical approaches.Section 4presents our estimation results.Section 5concludes.",Enzo,Tommy,None

"1. IntroductionTheGreat Recession, and more recently the Covid-19 pandemic, exposed most firms to unprecedented large and persistent product demand shocks. Firms reacted to these shocks using different margins to adjust production costs to changing output. For example, focusing onlabour costs, firms reacted by adjusting wages or working hours. In this respect, short-time work (STW) schemes have been one of the most used policies in manyOECDcountries, especially in Europe, to reduce working hours, subsidize workers' earnings while preserving their jobs. These schemes are defined as public programs that allow firms experiencing economic difficulties to temporarily reduce the hours worked while providing their employees withincome supportfrom the State for the hours not worked (European Commission, 2020). As a matter of fact, STW schemes have been used more extensively in those contexts where the costs to adjust either employment or wages are higher, due to a more rigid institutional setting (such as strict employment protectionlegislationor widespread collective agreements). Limitations to the ability of firms to lay-off workers implemented in some countries during the COVID pandemic further increased the use of STW. Only in 2020, in OECD countries at some point in time, over 50 million jobs were supported by STW schemes. At the peak of the first wave of the pandemic in the second quarter of 2020, more than one third of employees were on such schemes in countries, such as France, Italy, Germany and the UK (these areFurloughscheme in the UK,Kurzabeitin Germany,Activité partiellein France, andCassa Integrazione Guadagniin Italy). While STW schemes are usually appealing for both employers and workers, since they help firms to buffer the shocks by reducing hours of work and preserve worker's job and earnings, their effect on firm's performance is more controversial (Cahuc, 2019). Also, unions play a central role in the actual implementation of these schemes at the firm level, however still little is known about how the presence of unions at the workplace influences short time work adoption and the likely effects on firm performance.In this paper, we study the effects of STW on firm performance using panel data for the metal engineering industry in Italy, from 2009 to 2015. In particular, we focus on the role of firm-level unionization andcollective bargainingin mediating the effect of STW on a number of firms outcomes, such as hours worked, wages, productivity and profitability. The effects of unions on firms' performance has been widely debated in the economic literature (see, among others,Freeman and Medoff, 1984;Booth, 2002;Bennett and Kaufman, 2007. For a recent review on the firm-level effects of codetermination, that is worker representation in firms’governanceand management, seeJäger et al., 2021). Traditional models of trade unions behaviour focus on the objective of maximizing union's member utility, which depends on their employment and wages, thus protecting incumbent workers on permanent contracts (insiders), at the expense of workers on fixed-term contracts and the unemployed (outsiders). In this perspective, to preserve employment levels, unions are likely to resistreal wagecuts and support working hours reduction. This is more likely where STW schemes are generously subsidized by the State. In some countries, local unions also play a crucial role in the actual implementation of STW at the workplace. For example, in France firms that apply to STW schemes (Activité partielle) have to consult the Social Economic Committee (i.e. the employee representation body in firms with more than 10 employees) or, in absence of employee representatives, must inform employees about the activation of an STW procedure. In Germany, firms with a works council, usually negotiate a local agreement for the implementation of STW schemes (Kurzabeit), which should include the details on the duration, location and distribution of the short-time work, including the list of the employees or firm departments involved. Similarly, in Italy, STW schemes (Cassa Integrazione Guadagni) are negotiated between the employer and union representatives in the firm. The negotiations also involve selecting employees who are eligible for STW, using as criteria tenure and family status, with the aim of protecting both the value of the job match (i.e. tenure is likely to be correlated with employees’ productivity) and household well-being.1Finally, unions have other channels to provide employment insurance to their workers beyond the use of STW schemes. For example, strong unions may favour information sharing, improvingwork organizationand internal flexibility, thus reducinglabour turnoverand potentially enhancing productivity (Addison, 2005;Devicienti et al., 2018).In the empirical analysis, we estimate the elasticity of working hours, labour cost, labour productivity and profitability to changes in STW hours, comparing unionized and non-unionized firms, as well as those covered by firm-level collective bargaining. Since the adoption of STW schemes is unlikely to be randomly distributed across firms, to account for the endogeneity driven by firms’ self-selection into STW schemes and other confounding factors that influence both STW hours and firm performance, we rely on anInstrumental VariablesFixed-Effects estimator. We build our instruments leveraging on specific institutional features of STW schemes and Employment Protection Legislation (EPL). We then exploit exogenous changes in firing costs that firms experience around specific size thresholds (defined in terms of number of employees) set by the law, which change the relative cost of employmentversushours adjustment through STW schemes. In particular, since some STW schemes are available only for firms with more than 15 employees (and stricter EPL applies to firms larger than this size threshold), firms crossing the 15-employees threshold experience an exogenous change in the cost of adjusting employment relative to working hours, also changing the incentive to use STW hours. Notice that stricter EPL applies to all plants in multiplant firms with at least 60 employees, independently of whether the size of each plant is below or above the 15-employees threshold. Hence, a multiplant firm with less than 15 employees in each plant is likely to experience an additional exogenous change in the relative cost of adjusting employment compared to working hours when it crosses the overall 60-employees threshold. We exploit these institutional features to construct our instruments: first, a dummy variable equal to 1 if the firm has 15 or more employees, and 0 otherwise; second, a dummy variable equal to 1 for multiplant firms with more than 60 employees, and 0 otherwise. Notice that since we estimate fixed effects models, identification relies on firms crossing either of the two size thresholds over time.Our findings contribute to the existing literature on STW by uncovering the role of unions as a mechanism to explain the heterogeneous effects of STW on firm performance. Furthermore, we provide new evidence on the elasticity of various firm-level outcomes to STW hours.Most of the existing studies which have investigated the effect of STW focus on labour market outcomes, typically exploit cross-country differences before and during the Great Recession and find positive effects of STW on employment (among others,Boeri and Bruecker, 2011;Cahuc and Carcillo, 2011;Hijzen and Venn, 2011;Abraham and Houseman, 2014). In some countries, however, the inefficient design of STW led to a sizable deadweight loss (Boeri and Bruecker, 2011).Hijzen and Venn (2011)suggest that the positive impact of STW is limited to workers with permanent contracts, underlining the risk of increasinglabor market segmentationbetween workers in regular jobs and those on temporary and part-time contracts.A more recent strand of literature based on microdata at the worker or firm-level finds more heterogeneous results, also due to differences in identification strategies and country-specific institutional features. Interestingly, even studies based on the same country, but using different methods or covering different regions, find quite different results. For example, in the case of Germany,Tilly and Niedermayer (2016)merge different data sources on workers in the Nurembergmetropolitan areaand find that STW significantly increases employment, whileKruppe and Scholz (2014)estimate dynamic propensity score models using IAB survey data merged with administrative data on STW and find no statistically significant effects on employment.A few recent papers use high quality administrative data for different European countries and exploit eligibility rules related to STW implementation. Using Difference-in-Differences (Kopp and Siegenthaler, 2021) or IV approaches (Cahuc et al., 2021;Giupponi and Landais, 2022), most of these studies find positive short-run effects of STW on employment but not long-run effects, thus implying that STW may simply delay dismissals. On the whole, these estimates point out that STW is an effective policy to preserve jobs, but the overall effect may be temporary or quite heterogeneous across different types of firms.Very few studies have investigated the effects of STW on firm outcomes beyond employment and hours of work. Among the previous papers,Giupponi and Landais (2022)use social security data covering the universe of employer-employee matches in the private sector in Italy from 1983 to 2015 and show that employment gains are associated to higher probability of firm survival but declining productivity per employee, caused by working hours reduction. They report no statistically significant effect on investments, while the effect on liquidity is positive though imprecisely estimated. STW is found to save more jobs and increase firm's survival particularly in firms with low liquidity facing a temporary shock. Conversely, STW in less productive firms facing a persistent shock is shown to prevent a more efficient reallocation of jobs towards more productive firms.Kato and Kodama (2019)study the effect of STW on firm's profitability estimatingPropensity Score Matchingwith Difference-in-Differences models using panel data for a sample of Japanese firms from 2008 to 2014. They show that STW significantly increases firm's profitability (as measured by ROA), at least a few years after the implementation of STW and due to higher sales growth, without significant effects on labour costs.Our findings show that STW schemes contribute to reduce working hours per employee, with a subsequent negative impact on per-capita labour productivity (measured by added value per employee), with no statistically significant effect on hourly productivity. A higher number of STW hours is found to be associated to lower labour cost per employee, though the overall effects on profitability (proxied by ROA), in the short run, is still negative. All these effects seem temporary and fade away after two years since the adoption of the STW schemes, which corresponds to their maximum legal duration. A statistically significant decline in average labour cost is detected only for firms with low liquidity, which register also a larger decline in per-capita productivity, compared to more liquid firms.When we consider the role of firm-level unions, we find a larger sensitivity of working hours per employee to STW in highly unionized firms compared to low unionized ones. On the contrary, per-capita labour cost significantly reacts to STW hours only in low unionized firms, while they are rather insensitive in more unionized firms. If we interpret local union density as a proxy for unions’ power, these results are coherent with strong unions pushing for the use of STW as a work sharing device to protect both employment and pay of incumbent workers, who are mainly union members (the so-called “insiders effect”;Saint-Paul (1996)). Our estimates are robust to alternative definitions of unions presence and additional indicators ofindustrial relationsat the workplace.The paper proceeds as follows.Section 2describes the institutional context. InSection 3we present our data.Section 4explains the identification strategy, while the main results of the empirical analysis are presented and discussed inSection 5.Section 6summarises the main findings and outlines some policy implications.",Daniele,Claudio,Federica
"1. IntroductionIn virtually every professional setting, from wage negotiations, to taking time off, asking for what you want is an essential component of what you end up getting. There is substantial evidence of men and women on average asking or negotiating differently (for overviews, see e.g.Bertrand, 2011,Mazei, 2015), with women often but not always asking for less than men (see, e.g.,Dittrich, Knabe, Leipold, 2014,Eckel, Grossman, 2008,Säve-Söderbergh, 2019,Hernandez-Arenaz, 2018). As someone asking for less is likely to end up getting less, thisgender differencemay contribute to many of the well documented gender gaps in the labor market.2However, relatively little is known about why women often on average ask for less compared to men in negotiations, and thus what mechanisms drive the gender gap.In this paper, we study why women on average ask for less than men insalarynegotiations. We leverage a survey that goes out to a representative sample of college graduates in the social sciences in Sweden. For the sample of 2015-2016 graduates, we have information about the respondents’ first job and starting salary. Salary negotiation is captured by a question on whether respondents stated an explicit salary request and if yes, the actual amount requested.Mainly based on previous research, we added several questions on attitudes and beliefs towards negotiating to the survey. The goal is to see whether the gender gap in salary requests diminishes when adding potential mediators. We thus ask respondents about their beliefs about the social costs of negotiating, i.e. whether they anticipate a negative treatment from managers or colleagues if they have high salary requests. Social costs have been particularly highlighted in the social psychology literature (Amanatullah, Tinsley, 2013,Bowles, 2013), but also in economics with a link to identity and stereotypes (Akerlof and Kranton, 2000). Women who negotiate or request more may fear being socially punished if the stereotype is that women should be cooperative and not negotiate, potentially making women ask for less. We also explore the role of confidence and risk attitudes. There is evidence suggesting that men and women on average differ in economic preferences linked to risk taking, overconfidence or competitiveness (Croson, Gneezy, 2009,Niederle), and these traits have been linked to different educational or labor market related outcomes (Buser, Niederle, Oosterbeek, 2014,Zhang, 2013) including part of the gender gap in earnings expectations (Reuben et al., 2017). However, the actual gender gap in risk taking tends to be small (Nelson, 2016) and a recent meta-analysis on overconfidence finds no gender gap (Bandiera et al., 2021), thus to what extent these matter for the gender gap in negotiation is unclear. We also ask respondents about their beliefs of how others negotiate. We explore if women may ask for less than men because they believe others are similarly asking for relatively low amounts, or whether beliefs about relative merits matter.We find that women are 30% more likely than men to negotiate (39% of women negotiate compared to 30% of men), but on average ask for 2.5% lower salaries than men. This difference in salary requests accounts for virtually all of the gender difference in actual salaries. We also find that women differ systematically from men on various beliefs and attitudes related to negotiating. However, when it comes to explaining the gender gap in salary requests, the only statistically significant mediator is a variable measuring the belief of what constitutes a reasonable request from the ideal candidate for the same job, where women tend to believe that the ideal candidate would ask for less than men believe. As field data on salary requests is fairly uncommon, we believe that this study contributes with new evidence to explain gender gaps in salary requests. However, our study only provides correlational evidence of mechanisms; future work is needed in order to replicate our results and also study the direct causal mechanisms that can reduce the gender gap in negotiations.There are other related papers based on survey data describing how individuals negotiate their wages in the recruitment process (e.g.Agan, Cowgill, Gee, 2021,Barach, Horton, 2021,Reuben, Wiswall, Zafar, 2017). The most relevant paper to ours isRoussille (2022)who finds that on an online recruitment platform for software engineers in the United States, all of the gender gap in payinequalitycan be accounted for by women asking for less than men. Unlike us,Roussille (2022)can also causally study how the gender gap in salary requests can be closed. Cleverly using an unanticipated design change in the recruitment platform where the median bid salary (offered by the firm) for similar candidates replaced an empty field for some of the job candidates,Roussille (2022)shows the causal effect of the requested salary on job offers and finds that salary information can close the gender gaps in requested and offered amounts. Roussille argues that the most likely explanation to these results is that women have downward biased beliefs about what other candidates with similar resumes ask for - which is consistent with our results. Somewhat related,Baker et al. (2019)find that public sector salary disclosure laws reduce the gender gap in pay for university faculty in Canada, due to women’s wages increasing because of the disclosure laws.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.Section 2describes the data andSection 3outlines the empirical strategy.Section 4reports our results.

"1. IntroductionThe aim of this paper is to better understand why some workers leave unemployment faster than others. We revisit this old question using large administrative social security records for Spain and apply a non-parametric decomposition of the variance of unemployment duration, following the methodology recently developed byAlvarez et al. (2014). This method directly estimates the contributions of the different components of unemployment duration without functional form assumptions. That is, how much the variation of unemployment duration is due to workers’ heterogeneity, duration dependence or labour market frictions. In other words, whether some workers’ characteristics make them leave unemployment faster than others, or the fact that more duration in unemployment reduces the probability of exit, or simply, the stochastic probability of finding a job. This method takes a more aggregate perspective than traditional duration models that focus more at the individual level. Quantifying the importance of the different components is important for theoretical modelling of the labour market as well as for designing unemployment policies.The application of the ABS method to a dysfunctional labour market like the Spanish one, offers some new insights. Firstly, we show the importance of the interpretation of unemployment in social security records. Secondly, thanks to our large dataset and the volatility of the Spanish labour market, we can relax the assumption that the variance decomposition is the same for all worker types at all times. In particular, we let duration dependence differ bydemographicgroups as well as over the business cycle. This allows us to shed light in the mechanisms behind duration dependence.Traditionally, unemployment duration has been studied through the lens of duration models, which generally assume a parametric structure for the hazard function, distinguishing between duration dependence and unobserved heterogeneity parameters.1These methods require long panel data (i.e., larget) as well as some functional form assumptions. The ABS approach requires fewer assumptions and, as long as the data have a large number of observations (i.e., largen), a small number of observations per individual (i.e., smallt) will suffice.2The ABS method directly estimates the relative contribution of the components related to heterogeneity, duration dependence and labour market frictions to the total variance of unemployment duration. In this paper, we use numerical examples to illustrate the method and its capacity to allow the unemployment hazard to depend on duration, as well as to distinguish heterogeneity from duration dependence. InSection 2.1we also discuss the limitations of the method, such as dealing with censored spells, as well as, time-varying heterogeneity.The methodology is naturally suited for social security administrative data, which offer many advantages overLabour Force surveydata: daily frequency of observations, no attrition, no self-reported bias on spell duration, firm identifier and the complete working history of all workers in the sample. However, social security data were not designed to study unemployment and there is no labour supply information. These data provide an account of spells of employed workers (who contribute to social security) and those of unemployed workers who are entitled to unemployment insurance (who are paid by social security). Therefore any other labour market status will appear as a ‘blank’ spell in the data. Crucial to unemployment analysis, unemployment spells without benefit entitlement will appear as blank spells in the data. A challenge when using administrative data is how to interpret job search among blank spells. This is important as any analysis using administrative data will be sensitive to the interpretation of the blank spells.Alvarez et al. (2014)(ABS, hereafter) offer two possible interpretations: on one extreme, ignore such blank spells; on the other extreme, shift the focus to non-employment and consider all blank spells as non-employment. We propose an interpretation of administrative data that expands on the original paper: an intermediate approach which identifies the different types of blank spells, includes only those that can be interpreted as genuine unemployment and excludes those who are clearly not engaged in job search. FollowingLafuente (2020), we identify the different types of unemployment spells using the richness of our administrative data as well as labour market institutions, such as the rules of unemployment insurance and temporary contracts.Our main findings are that, as in the ABS application for Austria, the component related to labour market frictions explains more than half of the total variance in unemployment duration. Moreover, in our comparison over the business cycle in Spain, we find the component that is due to frictions becomes even more prominent in recessions. The components related to duration dependence and heterogeneity follow in terms of importance, in this order. We find that duration dependence varies by demographic groups and is higher for women and college graduates. Perhaps surprisingly, the share of the total variance explained by duration dependence does not vary over the business cycle, particularly for non-college workers. For college graduates, the duration dependence component is higher in expansions. These findings are compatible with a statistical discrimination mechanism due to dynamic selection into long durations for college graduates.The rest of the paper is organized as follows.Section 2explains the ABS method in more detail.Section 3describes the Spanish social security administrative data.Section 4discusses possible interpretations of the blank spells. Having established our preferred interpretation of the blank spells,Section 5describes our results. Finally,Section 6concludes.",Maia,Cristina,None
"1. Institutional backgroundOur study takes place in the context of the Australian active labor policies in a regulated market for employment services – known asjobactive– which is composed of competing employment agencies (also referred to as job service providers) of various size and nature (e.g. NGOs, for-profits, etc.). Job seekers who are claiming unemployment benefits and are deemed capable to work are referred to a set of local providers by the governmental authorities, and need to register with one provider of their choice to actively look for work in order to keep receivingincome support. The agency can’t reject job seekers upfront and is tasked with offering them re-employment services, including placing them into a vacancy they secured and enrolling them in training courses if needed. Employment outcomes of placed job seekers are monitored and used by the Australian Department of Employment to reward agencies based on a set of performance indicators.6Thus, employment agencies have an incentive to have a healthy pipeline of secured vacancies they can fill with job seekers that are referred to them on an ongoing basis. As such, agencies actively compete against each other and engage in business development activities to secure partnerships with employers. Agencies work closely with employers to understand their recruitment needs and are responsible for referring suitable job seekers to an available vacancy. A supply of job seekers that is higher than the supply of vacancies means that securing a vacancy is financially more valuable to agencies as it can lead to repeat business with that employer.While agencies are tasked to assist both job seekers and employers by identifying suitable job matches, there are inherent frictions in the making of this match. For example, an agency may secure a vacancy but may not have a suitable job seeker, and vice versa. In these cases, vacancies may either remain unfilled or filled sub-optimally. An evaluation report by the Australian Government found that, in 2018-19, only around 45 percent of job seekers placed into a vacancy (or training program) were still in that position some months later, and a lower 34.6 percent transitioned off income support.7Job placement duration rates may vary for various reasons, but it is reasonable to expect that a mismatch between the employer’s needs and the job seeker’s skills is a contributing factor. Foreseeing which alternative matches might be feasible, however, is challenging. While providers must register all vacancies in a centralized database overseen by the government, agents can choose to register vacancies just before filling them, making it difficult to analyze correlates of longer vacancy lifespans and matching frictions.8. In this regard, the Australian context is not unique. Many other countries also rely on a centralized system to track the effectiveness of their welfare assistance services (OECD, 2015) and the issue of strategic use of these systems has been documented in the literature (Barros, 2003,Koning, Heinrich, 2013).One solution is for employment agencies to collaborate. Agents can share information on job seekers and vacancies that they are unable to match internally, and such collaborations are encouraged by the government. However, trust issues may prevent agencies from collaborating. The agency that offers to share a vacancy needs to trust that the other agency will refer a suitable job seeker and also refrain from ‘poaching’ the employer to place job seekers from their own caseload in the future. A survey of employment agents commissioned by the Government found that ”providers supported the concept of collaboration in principle but that most were sceptical about how realistic it would be to collaborate in the highly competitive employment services environment. Instead, they indicated a preference for concentrating on placing their own job seekers into vacancies and maintaining their own relationships with employers” (The Australian Department of Education and Employment, 2017). This hesitancy to collaborate is further supported by responses to our end-of-experiment survey, which show that agents perceive others’ willingness to share vacancies and job seekers as very low, and lower than their own willingness to share.9This norm misperception hinders collaboration and hurts all stakeholders in the labor markets. Studying the impact of incentives in a market where prior beliefs might be hard to shift makes our experiment an interesting example on how trust affects market outcomes.",Guglielmo,Andreas,None
"1. IntroductionA recent literature shows that first-time parenthood has substantial and persistent negative effects on women’s labor market outcomes, while it has almost no effects for men (Bütikofer, Jensen, Salvanes, 2018,Chung, Barbara, Sandler, Sienkiewicz, 2017,Kleven, Landais, Posch, Steinhauer, Zweimüller, 2019,Kleven, Landais, Søgaard, 2019,Sieppi, Pehkonen, 2019). Inspired byBecker (1985)it has been hypothesized that household specialization based on comparative advantage is an important channel for this so-called child penalty for women. The evidence regarding this channel is, however, mixed.Angelov et al. (2016);Pora and Wilner (2019)andChung et al. (2017)find support for it, whileAndresen and Nix (2020);Kleven et al. (2021)andRosenbaum (2019)do not. A possible reason for this are differences in relevant institutions regarding for example the possibilities to adjust working hours or to use formal child care for very young children.We contribute to the literature by investigating the importance of household specialization in a setting – the Netherlands – where there are arguably no institutional hurdles to divide household tasks in a gender-neutral way. In the Netherlands, employees are legally entitled to unilaterally change the working hours of their already existing contract. This is one of the reasons why not only the share of part-time working women is very high, but also the fraction of men working less than 30 hours per week is with 19.4% in 2019 by far the highest among allOECDcountries (OECD, 2020). It is therefore easier and presumably more accepted for fathers to trade market work for child care if their partner has better earnings prospects. Furthermore, formal child care is available for children as young as three months so that parents have the option to use it when paid maternity leave ends (Plantenga and Remery, 2009). This is different from the situation in, for example, Denmark, Norway or Sweden where children have to be nine or twelve months old to attend formal child care.Our second contribution to the literature is that we analyze labor market trajectories of both partners in relation to various measures of their relative earnings potential. This is more comprehensive than approaches which restrict attention to the within-couple earnings gap (Angelov, Johansson, Lindahl, 2016,Chung, Barbara, Sandler, Sienkiewicz, 2017) or to women’s pre-childbirth rank in the wage distribution (Pora and Wilner, 2019), and will therefore provide a broader picture of the role of household specialization in explaining the child penalty.Using the event-study approach proposed byKleven et al. (2019b), we first replicate results from other countries; there are large and persistent negative effects of first-time parenthood on women’s earnings, while there is no effect on men’s earnings. The earnings child penalty is about 47% ten years after women have their first child. This is mostly due to a reduction in working hours right after childbirth and to a lesser degree to lower participation and a gradual decrease in wage rates. Conducting the analysis by parents’ level of education, we find a similar earnings child penalty for college and non-college educated women. We also find substantial, but heterogeneous child penalties for all fields of study, whereby the child penalty is lowest in the male-dominated fields of Informatics, and Science and Mathematics.To study whether couples divide household and market work based on comparative advantage andbargaining power, we construct three (main) measures of mothers’ and fathers’ earnings potential. The first measure is based on the levels of education of both parents, the second on their fields of study, and the third on their predicted lifetime earnings. These measures differ in how sophisticated households are assumed to be when forming beliefs about their earnings potential. Using these different measures will give more insights into the factors that couples do or do not take into account when deciding about child care and market work. While our measures for relative earnings potential cover different aspects of earnings capacity, overall we find little evidence of household specialization based on comparative advantage. Women with higher within-household earnings capacity reduce their labor supply less than women with lower relative earnings potential, but men only marginally adjust their labor supply after childbirth irrespective of their relative earnings potential. We therefore conclude that even in a setting that is conducive for young parents to divide household tasks in a gender-neutral way, spouses do not specialize according to their comparative advantage. Descriptive evidence instead suggests that the use of formal child care is more sensitive to women’s earnings potential implying that households with higher-earning/higher-educated women use more child care to reconcile work and family.Apart from the recent literature on the child penalty, our paper relates to the literature on the effects of first-time parenthood on women’s labor supply and earnings more generally (see e.g.Adda, Dustmann, Stevens, 2017,Bertrand, Goldin, Katz, 2010,Hotz, Johansson, Karimi, 2017,Lundberg, Rose, 2000,Lundborg, Plug, Rasmussen, 2017,Paull, 2008,Waldfogel, 1998,Wilde, Batchelder, Ellwood, 2010). Our paper also relates to the vast literature on genderinequalityin the labor market with recent reviews byBlau and Kahn (2017)andOlivetti and Petrongolo (2016). This literature finds that traditional human capital variables contribute little to the gender gap in recent years, but thatgender differencesin occupation andindustry, career interruptions, shorter working hours and the unequal genderdivision of laborcontinue to play important roles.The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.Section 2provides a brief overview of the institutional background in the Netherlands.Section 3describes our data and empirical approach.Section 4discusses our proxies for earnings potential and presents our findings, andSection 5concludes.",Elisabeth,Hessel,Bas
"1. IntroductionOnline delivery of tertiary education has taken center stage. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced virtually all education institutions to switch to online teaching. However, the literature has generally found online teaching to be inferior to classroom-based teaching (e.g.,Bettinger, Fox, Loeb, Taylor, 2017,Figlio, Rush, Yin, 2013). Switching to online teaching may thus aggravate the problem that many students struggle to complete their studies successfully (Weiss et al., 2019). Accordingly, students expect and experience negative consequences of the COVID-19-induced shift to online teaching (Aucejo, French, Araya, Zafar, 2020,Bird, Castleman, Lohner, 2022,Kofoed, Gebhart, Gilmore, Moschitto, 2021). This may be due to problems of disorganization among students in online teaching, as argued formassive open online courses(“MOOCs”; e.g.Banerjee, Duflo, 2014,McPherson, Bacow, 2015,Patterson, 2018). One way to improve outcomes of online education could therefore be to assist students through online peer mentoring. Evidence on the effectiveness of such programs is scarce for online teaching, where they may be particularly helpful.In this paper, we report results of a randomized trial studying the effects of peer mentoring at a German university that, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, switched to online teaching for the spring term 2020. Our sample comprises 691 second term students from the core undergraduate program at the university’sSchool of Business and Economics. To assess the effectiveness of the program, we combine registry data with survey data on study behavior and motivation that we collected before the start of the examination period in the spring term 2020. Our paper presents the first evidence on the role of remote peer mentoring in online higher education.The mentoring program focused on students’ general study skills, such as self-organization and study techniques. Mentors and mentees met one-on-one online. The program consisted of five meetings of around 40 minutes each that took place around every two weeks. In each meeting, mentors would discuss specific topics, such as mentees’ weekly study schedules, using materials provided by us, as well as follow-on discussions on topics from prior meetings. Importantly, we instructed mentors not to discuss any coursework with mentees. As mentors, we hired students from a more advanced term in the same study program. Thus, this kind of mentoring could be scaled up easily and at modest cost. Including one additional mentee into the program for a three-month period would cost about € 60.Our setting is common for public universities across the developed world. Each fall, students enroll in the three-year bachelor’s programEconomics and Business Studies. In each of the first two terms, students are to pass six courses each worth five credits. Since the second term includes more rigorous courses relative to the first term, many students struggle in this term.1A key advantage of our setting is that the spring term 2020 was conductedentirelyonline because the German academic spring term starts and ends later (April to July) than is common internationally. Thus, there are nospilloversfrom in-person to online classes.Our main results are as follows. First, the mentoring program improved students’ motivation and study behavior. Treated students report higher overall motivation, are more likely to report having studied throughout the spring term 2020, and are more likely to state they provided enough effort to reach their goals in this term. In contrast, students’ views on departmental services or on online teaching in the spring term 2020 or in general seem unaffected. Second, while these effects translate into more exam registrations, the average effect on earned credits is small and insignificant. Similarly, the students’ GPA is unaffected. Third, these results mask a heterogeneity that contrasts with common expectations on potential impacts of peer mentoring. For instance, we observe a positive effect on students who previously performed well, with no effects on other students. In addition, male students benefit more from the program, if anything. These results somewhat contrast expectations based on prior research suggesting that weaker students struggle most in online learning (e.g.,Bettinger, Fox, Loeb, Taylor, 2017,Figlio, Rush, Yin, 2013) and that female students tend to benefit more from mentoring (e.g.,Angrist, Lang, Oreopoulos, 2009,Rodriguez-Planas, 2012).We contribute to research on the effectiveness of online education. This literature has found online teaching to be less effective than classroom-based teaching (Bettinger, Fox, Loeb, Taylor, 2017,Figlio, Rush, Yin, 2013), likely due to problems of disorganization among students in online teaching (e.g.Banerjee and Duflo, 2014).2Research on specific aspects of the online education production function is scarce. Closest to our work,Oreopoulos et al. (2022)show that assigning online and regular students to an online planning module to construct weekly study schedules and reminders or loose mentoring via text messages does not affect students’ outcomes. We focus on a more comprehensive and intensive mentoring program with regular contact and guidance, which has been shown to matter (e.g.,Oreopoulos and Petronijevic, 2018). We thus contribute by providing the first evidence on the role of peer mentoring programs for online higher education.We also contribute to the experimental literature on mentoring interventions in higher education.3Closest to our work,Oreopoulos and Petronijevic (2018)experimentally study different coaching methods. They find that close one-on-one peer mentoring programs are effective in raising student outcomes.Oreopoulos and Petronijevic (2019)show evidence from several nudging interventions that did not shift students’ academic outcomes, but improved their motivation.Angrist et al. (2009)test the impact of academic support and financial incentives on students’ GPA, finding performance increases among female students. However, they find no effects for academic support without financial incentives. Our program is targeted more towards individual mentor-mentee interactions, is more structured, and it takes place in an online environment where mentoring may be more important. We thus contribute by providing the first evidence on the effectiveness of close (peer) mentoring in online education and by extending the small experimental literature on mentoring effects in higher education.4Finally, we contribute to research on education responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of which has focused on primary orsecondary education(e.g.,Angrist, Bergman, Matsheng, 2022,Bacher-Hicks, Goodman, Mulhern, 2020,Grewenig, Lergetporer, Werner, Woessmann, Zierow, 2021). The closest paper isCarlana and La Ferrara (2020), who experimentally assigned struggling Italian middle school students an online tutor during the pandemic and report positive effects on performance and well-being. They specifically target students from less affluent backgrounds. Our paper contributes by studying the effectiveness of online mentoring in higher education. Our strongest effects are for already well-performing students, indicating that peer mentoring in online education may increaseinequalityin outcomes. This is very different from tutoring, where we find a reduction in inequality in a follow-on project in a similar setting (Hardt et al., 2022). Despite the nearly universal shift towards online teaching in higher education due to the pandemic, evidence on improving the effectiveness of online teaching in this context remains scarce. This is in spite of emerging evidence showing that the shift led to worse learning outcomes and depressed student expectations and outlooks (Altindag, Filiz, Tekin, 2021,Bird, Castleman, Lohner, 2022,De Paola, Gioia, Scoppa, 2022,Jaeger, Arellano-Bover, Karbownik, Matute, Nunley, Seals Jr., Almunia, Alston, Becker, Beneito, Bheim, Bosc, Brown, Chang, Cobb-Clark, Danagoulian, Donnally, Eckrote-Nordland, Farr, Ferri, Fort, Fruewirth, Gelding, Goodman, Guldi, Hckl, Hankin, Imberman, Lahey, Llull, Mansour, McFarlin, Merilinen, Mortlund, Nybom, O’Connell, Sausgruber, Schwartz, Stuhler, Thiemann, van Veldhuizen, Wanamaker, Zhu, 2021,Kofoed, Gebhart, Gilmore, Moschitto, 2021,Rodriguez-Planas, 2022,Rodriguez-Planas, 2022).We acknowledge that the situation during the pandemic was special relative to regular online education settings. We nevertheless believe that our results carry lessons beyond the pandemic and discuss this in more detail inSection 2.",David,Markus,Johannes
"1. IntroductionTemporary employment is widely used by employers in many countries as it is characterized by a limited duration and lowerseverance paymentthan permanent employment. For workers, however, temporary employment creates more job insecurity and fewer career prospects than permanent employment, which may have important implications on fertility. On the one hand, previous studies have shown that a higher job security raises fertility for women (Prifti and Vuri, 2013) and family size for cohabiting and married individuals (Clark and Lepinteur, 2020). On the other,career advancementincreases the value of working relative to other activities (Becker, 1965), which may lead to reductions in fertility through increases in the opportunity cost of having a child (Autor, Dorn, Hanson, 2019,Hotz, Miller, 1988,Schaller, 2016,Schultz, 1985). The effect of permanent contracts relative to temporary ones on fertility is therefore ambiguous, yet it is crucial for policy-makers to understand whether implementing policies that lead to a higher prevalence of permanent employment may also bring changes in fertility. As most advanced economies have experiencedfertility ratesunder the replacement level of a population and suffered fromageing populationsin the last decades, this type of policies may help increasing future economic growth.1This paper provides causal evidence on whether subsidies that incentivize the use of permanent employment are also effective ways of raising fertility. It does so by exploiting exogenous variation in subsidies to open-ended labour contracts in Spain as a quasi-natural experiment. These subsidies were given by the various regional governments to employers who converted temporary employees into permanent ones. The introduction, size, and eligibility conditions for subsidies were decided by the regional authorities, and frequently changed on a yearly basis. Consequently, the amount of the subsidy varied markedly across regions, in the age and gender of the employees whose contracts were converted, and within these three dimensions over time. The goal of the policy was only to incentivize employers to use permanent employment, thus the variation in subsidy generosity is unlikely to be correlated with unobserved determinants of individuals’ fertility. Previous research has studied the impact of these subsidies on permanent employment transitions (García Pérez and Rebollo Sanz, 2009) or used them to examine the effect of permanent employment onwealthaccumulation and housing choices (Barceló, Villanueva, 2016,Barceló, Villanueva, 2018). Instead, the focus of this paper is to study whether subsidies to permanentemployment changefertility, as well asgender differencesand explanations behind this effect.The analysis uses an individual-level administrative dataset that contains retrospective labour market and sociodemographic information on employees randomly selected from the Spanish Social Security records. Using this information, I construct a large panel dataset of 2.5 million observations that contains yearly information on the labour and fertility history of employees during the period of 1997–2004.I show that subsidies to open-ended contracts were important drivers of fertility by increasing permanent employment for males and females. First, the subsidies policy led to an increase in the probability of male employees entering parenthood by 0.095 percentage points (this corresponds to 4.34% of their average likelihood of entering parenthood), but had no effect on female workers having the first child.2Second, I show that subsidies to permanent employment increased the probability of having a second child for both male and female employees by 0.031 and 0.039 percentage points, which corresponds to an increase of 2.27% and 3.11% in their average probability of having a second child, respectively. Finally, I find that the effect on fertility was lower in magnitude when employees had a high opportunity cost of having children, such as when they were young, highly educated and did not cohabit with a partner. The empirical analysis is complemented with event-study figures providing supporting evidence on the validity of the parallel trend assumption and evidence suggesting that the average amount of the subsidies for which employers were eligible is not correlated with pre-determined characteristics. The paper also provides evidence showing that the main results are robust to: i) the choice of the sample used for the analysis; ii) the set of included control variables and iii) identification and estimation approach. The results are also broadly consistent when using different definitions of the subsidy policy and different choices of the dependent variable.The paper also presents a separate analysis based on a different panel administrative dataset that contains yearly information on the birth and marriage rates in each of the 8108 municipalities in Spain. This aggregate dataset comes from the Spanish National Statistical Institute. In the aggregate analysis, I quantify the incidence of the subsidies policy on fertility and marriage rates for the entire Spanish population, and provide a second set of causal evidence that supports the main analysis. I show that subsidies to permanent employment increased fertility rates, which is in line with the results of the individual analysis. Using the aggregate estimates, I calculate that subsidies increased the total number of births in Spain by 5761 per year over the period of 1997–2004. Given that the yearly average number of births in Spain was 404,000 during the period of analysis and the total cost of the subsidies has been estimated at 874 million euros (García Pérez and Rebollo Sanz, 2007), the policy increased the birth rate in Spain by 1.43% each year it was in place, at the cost of 18,964 euros per child born. I also show that subsidies to permanent employment may have increased marriage rates, which is in line with previous evidence on economic stress increasing partnership separations (Bridges and Disney, 2016).This paper primarily contributes to two strands of literature. First, the paper is relevant to the literature that studies the link between permanent employment prevalence and fertility.3A higher permanent employment rate not only increases job security but also career prospects and wages in the labour market (Arulampalam, Booth, 1998,Bentolila, Dolado, Franz, Pissarides, 1994,Booth, Francesconi, Frank, 2002,Di Cintio, Grassi, 2015,García-Serrano, Malo, 2013,Jimeno, Toharia, 1993). On the one hand, prior studies have provided causal evidence suggesting that decreases in job insecurity raise fertility. For example, using a difference-in-differences approach and a sample of women,Prifti and Vuri (2013)find that a 1990 reform that strengthened Employment ProtectionLegislationin Italy through increases in dismissal costs raised fertility, andClark and Lepinteur (2020)use a difference-in-differences model to show that a 1999 reform that increased dismissal costs of older individuals in France led to an increase in job insecurity for the younger population, which reduced fertility for cohabiting and married individuals. Moreover,Lopes (2020)uses a regression discontinuity type of model and a sample of women to find that a 2003 reform in Portugal that increased the duration of periods of job uncertainty led to decreases in their fertility. On the other hand, higher career outcomes generate two offsetting effects: (i) an income effect that raises fertility (Becker, 1960,Becker, 1965,Black, Kolesnikova, Sanders, Taylor, 2013,Borg, 1989) and (ii) a substitution effect that augments the value of working relative to other activities, thus decreasing fertility (Autor, Dorn, Hanson, 2019,Becker, 1965,Hotz, Miller, 1988,Schaller, 2016,Schultz, 1985). As a response, the effect that a higher prevalence of permanent employment in the labour market may have on fertility is ambiguous. Prior literature has reported that a higher temporary employment rate leads to reductions in the probability of women having the first child (De La Rica, Iza, 2005,Modena, Rondinelli, Sabatini, 2014) and to overall decreases in fertility for the population (Adserà, 2004) due to the implicit higher instability of fixed-term contracts. Moreover,Gutiérrez-Domènech (2008)has reported that these reductions in fertility may operate through women postponing getting married when holding temporary contracts. While the existing literature has therefore so far reported a negative impact of temporary contracts on fertility, causal evidence on this effect is still missing, and so it is unclear whether policies aiming to promote permanent employment are effective ways to raise fertility. I contribute to the previous literature by estimating and quantifying the causal effect of subsidies to permanent employment on fertility, by examining gender differences in this effect and by exploring plausible explanations as to why the previous impact differs for males and females.4I use exogenous variation in subsidies to open-ended contracts in four dimensions as a quasi-natural experiment and a rich administrative panel dataset to estimate the previous effects.Second, this paper contributes to a large number of studies on the importance of job security in the labour market for life decisions. Among them,Barceló and Villanueva (2016)use the aforementioned subsidies to show that when employees are older, they increase their financial wealth if they have a temporary job. More recently,Barceló and Villanueva (2018)have used the subsidies policy to show that higher job security raises the likelihood of employees owning and renting a house.5Related to this, previous literature has found that greater income uncertainty reduces the probability of adults buying a house and increases renting (Diaz-Serrano, 2005,Gathergood, 2011). Furthermore,Becker et al. (2010)show that a decrease in job security among youth raises co-residence with parents and that a decline in the job security of parents has the opposite effect. Besides housing decisions, previous evidence has shown that greater job protection increases long-run investments among workers (Charness et al., 2017) and has important implications for welfare (Belot et al., 2007). I contribute to this literature by showing that increases in job security through policy-making also have an important causal effect on fertility as well as plausible explanations as to why this is the case.The remainder of the article is organized as follows.Section 2explains the subsidies implemented to promote the use of permanent contracts.Section 3describes the dataset,Section 4discusses the empirical model, andSection 5reports the results of the individual analysis.Section 6shows the data, methodology, and estimates of the aggregate analysis.Section 7concludes.",Adrián,None,None
"1. IntroductionEducation in a language other than the mother tongue is a common phenomenon. First of all, there are many multilingual societies1where the use of multiple languages for educational purposes is common, either vertically, with different languages used, for instance, in elementary vs tertiary education, or horizontally, when multiple languages are used as media of instruction within the same class. India and its more than 250 million students, 22 official languages and hundreds of minority languages (Groff, 2017),2represents a particularly prominent case with the country being currently amid a lively policy debate about the language of education (Karthik and Noblit, 2020).In addition, the growing international mobility of students implies that it is becoming more and more common to study in a second language. For instance, in the academic year 2019/2020 despite the impact of Covid-19, 237,800 students went abroad to study in higher education institutions thanks to the Erasmus+ programme of the European Commission.3International migration, as far as it involves school-aged children, also may imply a language other than the mother tongue as medium of education, and UNICEF estimates that, as of 2020, 36 million children were international migrants.4It is therefore important to understand the impact of thelanguage of instructionon students’ performance. This is what we do in this paper using some unique features of the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano (henceforth, the University), a university located in the bilingual Italian province of South-Tyrol, where 65% of the population has German and 27% has Italian as mother tongue.5The university was founded in 1997 with the mission of trilingual education, with three official languages - Italian, German and English. This means that students learn and take exams in all three languages. An economics student may read, for instance, introduction to management in German,microeconomicsin Italian, andeconometricsin English. Each course is offered only in one language, that is determined by the University with the aim of ensuring a balanced share of the three languages during the students’ course of studies, subject to supply constraints, i.e., to the language skills of lecturers, who are, for the vast majority, not trilingual and are able to teach in English and in either Italian or German. Students, who come also from other Italian regions as well as from abroad, have for the vast majority either Italian or German as their mother tongue. Using administrative data from the University, we are therefore able to observe the performance of students speaking German or Italian as their mother tongue as they take exams in courses they attended together, and which are taught and assessed in Italian, German, and English.Our hypothesis - grounded in the cognitiveneuroscienceand psycholinguistics literature that we will briefly review in the next section - is that studying in a language other than the mother tongue entails a cognitive cost. Consistent with this, we show that students put in place a series of strategies to reduce their exposure to courses in a second language, despite having enrolled in a trilingual degree. These strategies involve the postponement or anticipation of courses compared to the standard curriculum when a specific course switches language from one year to the next (e.g., economic policy being delivered in German in 2019, but in Italian in 2020), as well as the choice of courses that students take at other universities, for instance as part of Erasmus exchanges. From a quantitative perspective, however, these strategies do not alter the language composition of the course of study in a significant manner. The choice of optional courses could also be affected, and for this reason we focus our analysis on mandatory courses only.We then estimate the cost of studying in a language that is not the mother tongue using models with studentfixed effects. To account for the potential endogeneity of course language implied by the strategies described above, we use the curricular language - that is, the language of the course as envisaged by the standard curriculum - as an instrument for the actual one, as the two may differ because of anticipation, postponement, or taking the exam while in Erasmus. These complementary IV estimates are, however, very similar to our baseline. We estimate that performance when taking an exam in a course that is not in the mother tongue is 9.5% (or 0.22 within-student standard deviations) lower. We also show that the number of failed attempts is positively affected by the language mismatch between student’s mother tongue and language of the course.This paper contributes to the literature looking at the impact of language of instruction on educational outcomes.Angrist and Lavy (1997)exploit a variation in Morocco, where in 1983 the language of instruction in secondary school changed from French to Arabic. They find a significant decline in French writing skills, as well as of earnings.Angrist et al. (2008)find instead no effect in English proficiency due to a policy change moving the language of instruction in Puerto Rico from English to Spanish.Ivlevs and King (2014)exploit a reform in Latvia in 2004, where the language of the Russian minority schools switched from 100% Russian to 60% Latvian and 40% Russian and show that results in the centralised exam - in Latvian, but with the option to reply in Russian - significantly deteriorated across the board.Jain (2017)looks at colonial India and finds that linguistically mismatched districts, i.e., districts where the official language at the provincial level did not match the district’s language, had 18% lower literacy rates and 20% lower collegegraduationrates compared to linguistically matched districts. The difference disappears after the 1956 reorganisation of Indian states on linguistic lines. These last two papers points to a difficulty in acquiring education in a language other than the mother tongue, but, differently from this paper, they are exploiting reforms that can impact educational dimensions other than the language itself.Also very related is the literature on the educational effects ofbilingual education.Anghel et al. (2016), for instance, evaluate a program introducing bilingual education - in English and Spanish - in primary schools in Madrid and find, for children of parents without a college education, a reduction of 0.2standard deviationsin General Knowledge, the only subject taught in English (but assessed in Spanish). On the opposite,Admiraal et al. (2006)find no negative impact of bilingualsecondary educationin the Netherlands in terms of results ofschool leavingexams for Dutch and subject matters taught through English. In this paper we study education at the university level, where the learning and teaching practices are clearly different from primary or secondary schools.There is also a growing literature on the role of language of instruction on the educational (and other) outcomes of immigrant children.Lleras-Muney and Shertzer (2015)look at the effect of the introduction of statutes requiring English as the language of instruction in the US in the period 1910–1930, finding modest effects on literacy and no effect on labour market outcomes and on measures ofsocial integration. Similarly, no or modest effects are reported bySlavin et al. (2011)andChin et al. (2013). In her review article of US evidence,Chin (2015)concludes that “bilingual education programs (which use some native language instruction) and English-only programs are not significantly different in their impact on standardised test performance”. The context we study is of course very different, as it mostly involves non-migrants.Also relevant is the literature looking at the impact ofmultilingualismon labour market outcomes.Fry and Lowell (2003)andSaiz and Zoido (2005), for instance, conduct their analyses on US data and find only a negligible wage differential for workers and employees who master languages other than English, whereasCappellari and Di Paolo (2018)exploit the reform of 1983 that introducedCatalanalongside Spanish as the official language of education in Catalonia and find that bilingual education increases earnings, but has no effect on employment and hours of work. AlsoGinsburgh and Prieto-Rodriguez (2011)show that language proficiency positively affects wages in a study involving nine European countries. The return to foreign language skills is often observed to be conditional to matching language demand and supply in the job market, which is in line with the body of research inChiswick and Miller (2007)on dominant language proficiency among immigrants in several countries such as the USA, Canada, Israel, and Bolivia (see alsoChiswick, 2009for an overview). Our focus is onacademic performance, as the administrative data we use do not follow students in the labour market.To summarise, there is a wide interest in the impact of language on outcomes in education and other areas like the labour market. We contribute to this by studying the issue in a new context, tertiary education. This is particularly relevant because of the growing importance of international mobility of university students, also due to policies like Erasmus. Moreover, we use an empirical strategy - described in more details inSection 4- that exploits some unique features of the institution we study and that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been used before.The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The next section briefly discusses some relevant literature in cognitive neuroscience and psycholinguistics.Section 3describes the institutional framework of the University, whileSection 4discusses the empirical strategy.Section 5describes the data, while results are shown inSection 6.Section 7concludes, also discussing some policy implications.",Juliana,Mirco,None
"1. IntroductionReturn-to-work policies in Disability Insurance (DI) programs allow beneficiaries to work and collect reduced DI payments under a clawback regime characterized by earnings thresholds, marginal clawback rates, and DI payments. These policies intend to provide financial incentives to beneficiaries to return to the labor force and potentially improve their economic well-being, ensure their broader integration into society, and decrease costs. Previous studies have examined the effects of return-to-work policies on beneficiaries’labor supply decisionsfrom the introduction of return-to-work policies, changes in the DI payments, eligibility, and screening process. The findings from those studies are mixed.1There is incipient work on explaining these mixed findings by considering adjustment costs in beneficiaries’ labor supply decisions (Zaresani, 2020). The increase in work incentives induced by a policy change must be large enough to offset the adjustment cost if the goal is to increase the labor supply of the DI beneficiaries. The evidence on the effects of clawback regimes that influence the size of the induced financial incentives, probably due to the lack of such policy variations, is scarce, and it could be another explanation for the mixed findings. Results in this area would be important for understanding labor supply policies’ ramifications and better design of DI policies.We examine the effects of return-to-work policies’ clawback regimes on DI beneficiaries’ labor supply decisions. Specifically, we compare return-to-work policies in two Canadian provincial DI programs with similar screening, eligibility criteria, and benefits but different clawback regimes. One is Alberta’s “Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped” (hereafter AISH) program, with a generous clawback regime featuring an earnings exemption threshold,2wherein monthly DI payments gradually get reduced as earnings increase. A reform in April 2012 further increased its generosity, allowing the beneficiaries to work more while collecting a larger portion of their DI payments. The second program is the “Ontario Disability Support Program” (hereafter ODSP), with a single rate clawback regime. We estimate the causal effects of AISH’s clawback regime change on beneficiaries’ earnings andlabor force participationdecisions in a Difference-in-Differences (DD) framework using ODSP as a control group.3We also provide suggestive evidence on the relative magnitude of the substitution versus income effects of the reform. To gain further insight into the effects of the reform apart from average effects, we employ a quantile DD framework. Finally, we estimate the elasticity of earnings in the exempted range with respect to a generosity measure of the clawback regime.We use individual-level longitudinal administrative data on monthly earnings of AISH and ODSP beneficiaries spanning one year and a half of pre- and two years of post-reform obtained from the Alberta and Ontario governments. Observing monthly earnings is essential since the earnings thresholds are monthly based. The data also has information on beneficiaries’ characteristics, including gender, age, family structure, type of disability, and location of residence.Our analysis provides three main conclusions. First, a more generous clawback regime causes an increase in the mean labor supply along with both the intensive and the extensive margins. The DD model’s estimated effects, controlling for individualfixed effects, are an 11.91% increase in the average inflation-adjusted monthly earnings and a modest 0.78% point increase in the labor force participation rate.4Second, the estimates are heterogeneous by beneficiaries’ family structure, age, gender, type of disability, and location of residence. The estimates are larger for men, younger beneficiaries, those with dependents, those with psychotic disabilities, and beneficiaries who reside inmetropolitan areas. Suggestive evidence shows that the income effects of the reform are negligible and that a more generous clawback regime affects work incentives. The quantile DD estimates show that the higher percentiles of the earnings are the drivers of the increase in mean earnings. Findings suggest that targeted policies may work better to encourage DI beneficiaries to return to work.Third, an increase in the generosity of a clawback regime decreases the portion of the beneficiaries with earnings in the exempted range. The estimated elasticities suggest that a 10% increase in generosity decreases the portion of beneficiaries with earnings in the exempted range by 11.4% and 3.3% for the beneficiaries without and with dependents, respectively.5Our findings provide evidence on the labor supply responses to different clawback regimes of return-to-work policies in DI programs, an important policy domain. While return-to-work policies aim at getting DI beneficiaries into the labor force, empirical findings on the effectiveness of such policies are not conclusive.Hoynes and Moffitt (1999),Benitez-Silva et al. (2011),Weathers II and Hemmeter (2011)andBütler et al. (2015)find no effects from financial incentives to work in the United States and Switzerland. MeanwhileZaresani (2018),Campolieti and Riddell (2012),Kostol and Mogstad (2014)andRuh and Staubli (2019)find positive responses respectively in Canada, Norway and Austria. Beyond a change in financial incentives, medical reassessment of DI recipients and trial work periods in the United States do not appear to affect the labor supply (Autor and Duggan, 2006).Moore (2015)finds positive effects on the labor supply of those who lost their benefits after the removal of drug and alcohol addictions as qualifying conditions for DI programs in the United States.Borghans et al. (2014)and StaubliStaubli (2011)examine the effects of terminating benefits and stricter eligibility criteria in DI programs in the Netherlands and Austria, respectively. They find that individuals substitute DI benefits by collecting more from other social assistance programs.Campolieti (2004);Fortin et al. (2004);Gelber et al. (2017);Lemieux and Milligan (2008)andGruber (2000)find that providing more generous benefits has negative effects on labor supply in social assistance programs in Canada and the United States. We contribute to this literature by examining the impacts of financial incentives induced by the return-to-work policies’ clawback regime on labor supply decisions.",Arezou,Miguel,None
"1. IntroductionThe role of ethnic immigrant networks in facilitatinginternational tradeis a well-documented phenomenon in the literature. AsGould (1994)explains, the presence of immigrants can reduce the transaction costs of trade and change demand preferences, thus boosting bilateral trade flows between immigrants’ host and destination countries. Recent studies have provided compelling empirical evidence in support of this hypothesis (Ottaviano, Peri, Wright, 2018,Parsons, Vezina, 2017,Rauch, Trindade, 2002). However, does this relationship extend to illegal trade and unauthorized immigrant networks? With the exception of a recent study byMcCully (2021)for the case of Spain, the empirical evidence is limited.In the first part of this paper, we shed more light on this question by focusing on the case of international heroin trade and unauthorized Chinese immigrant enclaves in the early 1990s United States. Between mid-1980s and mid-1990s, upward of 70% of all heroin entering the US originated in Southeast Asia – in an area near the jointbordersof Myanmar, Laos, and Thailand known as the “Golden Triangle” (Figs. 1and2). From the Golden Triangle, the heroin was subsequently smuggled into the US through Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, the entire trafficking operation being controlled by ethnic Chinese criminals (Huang, Liu, Zhao, Zhao, Friday, 2012,Tracy, 1993). In the US, Chinese organized criminals – based in ethnic Chinese communities – dominated the wholesale heroin business and parts of the retail sale (Administration, 1992,U.S. Senate, 1992). Thus, we first examine the relationship between the unauthorized Chinese immigrant enclaves and the local opiate-related1arrests in the early 1990s US. Since no local data on heroin imports exist, we rely on the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting county-level arrest data which – with its coverage of the entire US – provide arguably the best proxy available for local heroin markets.2Download :Download high-res image (127KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1.

Area of the Golden Triangle in Southeast Asia. Southeast Asia’s Golden Triangle (i.e. the yellow triangle on the map) is a mountainous and heavily forested area stretching between eastern Myanmar in the west, northwestern Laos in the east, and northern Thailand in the south (Chalk, 2000,Chouvy, 2013,Lyttleton, 2004). (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)In the second part of the paper, we examine the consequences of Chinese-trafficked heroin by looking at its impact on US Vietnam-era veterans – a group particularly vulnerable toheroin addictionin the early 1990s. Early 1970s saw an epidemic of heroin addiction among US soldiers serving in the Vietnam War (Angrist, Chen, Frandsen, 2010,Frenkel, Morgan, Greden, 1977,U.S. Senate). The cheap, high-purity heroin which made its debut on the streets of Saigon (the capital of the Republic of Vietnam, RVN) in June of 1970, was essentially the same product – manufactured in the Golden Triangle – that would later appear in the US (US Senate, 1992). During the height of this epidemic in the summer of 1971, up to 34% of US soldiers returning from South Vietnam reported having used heroin while in the RVN (Robins et al., 1974). Given the highly addictive nature of heroin, a relatively young age of exposure among US soldiers serving in the Vietnam War, a high incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among these individuals (Kulka et al., 1988), and their poor post-war labor market outcomes (Angrist, 1990), Vietnam-era veterans comprise a group particularly at risk for heroin addiction in the early 1990s. Furthermore, since habitual use of hard drugs in general and heroin in particular have been linked tolower wagesas well as employment andlabor force participationrates (Cho, Garcia, Montes, Weingarden, 2021,DeSimone, 2002,Mezza, Buchinsky, 2021), we focus on the labor market outcomes of Vietnam veterans residing in communities with greater heroin supply in the early 1990s US.The analysis in this paper is therefore twofold. First, we estimate the impact of Chinese unauthorized enclaves on opiates-related arrests using a cross section of 726commutingzones.3The unauthorized immigrants are identified from the 1990 US Census of Population using a so-called residual method (Borjas, Cassidy, 2019,Passel, Cohn, 2014). In order to account for the endogeneity in the concentration of unauthorized Chinese immigrants across the country, we instrument for 1990 Chinese enclaves with their 1900 counterpart. The historical enclaves are constructed using publicly available full-count data from the 1900 US Census of Population. Our identification strategy takes advantage of the strong restrictions that the US government imposed on immigration from China in the period 1882–1965, during which there was virtually no immigration from China into the US. It is unlikely that the factors that determined the location choices of Chinese immigrants in the second half of the 19th century could have driven the settlement choices of Chinese arrivals after 1965.Second, we conduct a triple-difference analysis, comparing (1) Vietnam-era veterans with comparable non-veterans; (2) in 1990 versus 1980; and (3) those who lived in unauthorized Chinese enclaves versus those who did not. To keep the underlying groups as similar to each other as possible, we followAngrist (1990)andAngrist and Chen (2011)and restrict the estimation sample to all men born in 1948–1953 (i.e. those most at risk of conscription through the Vietnam-era lottery draft). However, to increase the external validity of our results, we also re-estimate the triple-difference specification using a sample of all men in prime working age (25–54). The identifying assumption in the triple-difference estimation is relatively weak. The estimator requires that there be no contemporaneous shock that affects the relative outcomes of the Vietnam-era veterans in the commuting zones with unauthorized Chinese immigrants in 1990.The aggregate-level results show that the presence of unauthorized Chinese immigrant enclaves had a strong positive impact on the number of local opiates arrests, especially those related to the drug sale and/or manufacturing (as opposed to possession). In particular, a 1 percentage point increase in the share of unauthorized Chinese immigrants4in a given commuting zone led to 7 more arrests for opiates’ sale/manufacturing per 100,000 residents (0.2 standard deviations). Considering the impact on Vietnam-era veterans born in 1948–1953, we find that those living in unauthorized Chinese enclaves in 1990 had worse labor market outcomes, although the estimated coefficients are small in magnitude. More specifically, we find a 1% decrease (with respect to the sample mean) in their labor force participation, probability of working, number of hours worked per week, and their total annual personal income. We also observe a 14% increase in their likelihood of receiving any Social Security income5coupled with a 17% increase in the total Social Security income collected. Finally, results indicate a 4% reduction in home ownership rates among the Vietnam veterans residing in unauthorized Chinese enclaves in 1990. Considering the sample of all prime working age men, we find qualitatively similar results for Vietnam veterans living in Chinese enclaves in 1990. However, instead of the increase in Social Security income take-up, we observe an increase in the welfare income take-up.6Our paper makes several contributions to the existing economics literature. First, we broaden the understanding of the role of ethnic immigrant networks in facilitating international trade. While previous studies showed that ethnic enclaves increase legal bilateral trade flows between immigrants’ home and destination countries (Ottaviano, Peri, Wright, 2018,Parsons, Vezina, 2017,Rauch, Trindade, 2002), we show that the presence of unauthorized immigrants increase illegal imports – namely smuggling of illegal drugs. This result is broadly consistent with recent findings inMcCully (2021)who – using drug confiscation data – shows that immigrants without legal status drive illegal drug imports into Spain. Our result is particularly appealing given that the legal trade effect of immigrant networks is found to be stronger for differentiated products (Rauch and Trindade, 2002). In fact, heroin imported into the US from the Golden Triangle was clearly differentiable from other types of heroin available in the US at that time. Colloquially known on the streets as “China White”, Southeast Asian heroin had a characteristically white color and its purity was unmatched by any heroin imported from other source countries – namely Mexico and Afghanistan (Administration, 1992,McCoy, 2000).Second, we contribute to the literature studying the labor (and non-labor) market outcomes of Vietnam-era veterans in the US, and their future trajectories with respect to comparable non-veterans. Previous studies found significant earnings losses for Vietnam veterans in the 1970s and 1980s, compared to similar non-veterans (Angrist, 1990,Angrist, Chen, 2011,Angrist, Chen, Song, 2011). However, there was a rapid convergence in earnings throughout the 1990s, partially due to increased schooling among veterans who took advantage of the GI Bill (Angrist and Chen, 2011). Recent studies have also shown a remarkable rise in veterans’ disability compensation (Angrist, Chen, Frandsen, 2010,Autor, Duggan, Lyle, 2011,Duggan, Rosenheck, Singleton, 2010) and social security disability insurance (Davies et al., 2015) since the late 1990s, though these were not necessarily driven by increased incidence of work-related disability (Angrist et al., 2010). We extend this literature by looking at the consequences of the Vietnam veterans’ exposure to the heroin markets in the early 1990s US. Although our findings indicate only small negative impact on most labor market outcomes considered, we do observe a fairly substantial up-take in Social Security income, which was likely driven by an increase in the disability income.Third, our study also adds to the already established literature on the impact of immigration on local crime in the destination countries. Most studies find no or minimal increase in local crime (Bell, Fasani, Machin, 2013,Bianchi, Pinotti, Buonanno, 2012,Butcher, Piehl, 1998,Nunziata, 2015), althoughPiopiunik and Ruhose (2017)do document a large increase in crime in Germany after the inflow of some 3 million ethnic Germans from the (former) Soviet Union in the early 1990s. Contrary to the majority of these studies, our findings suggest that unauthorized immigrant enclaves can boost local crime, and in particular, drug-related offenses. Our sizeable effect on the arrests for sale/manufacturing of opiates (0.2 standard deviations) suggests an important role of unauthorized Chinese enclaves in facilitating heroin trade in the early 1990s US.Finally, closely related to the previous point, we also contribute to the literature studying the relationship between immigrant legal status and their criminal behavior as well as the impact of immigrant amnesty programs on (immigrant) crime.Pinotti (2017)shows that legalization of immigrants in Italy reduced their crime rate by 0.6 percentage points, relative to the baseline crime rate of 1.1 percent. Similarly,Mastrobuoni and Pinotti (2015)find that legal status led to a large (50 percent) reduction in recidivism, explaining up to two-thirds of the observed differences in crime rates between authorized and unauthorized immigrants in Italy. On the other hand,Fasani (2018)argues that the repeated amnesty programs in Italy between 1990 and 2005 had only a small and non-persistent effect on immigrant crime.Considering the largest immigrant legalization reform in US history – the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) –Baker (2015)finds a persistent decline in local crime rate (3–5 percent), mainly driven by a decrease in property crimes. However, asFreedman, Owens and Bohn (2018)point out, the incidence of felony charges filed against more recent immigrants (those negatively affected by IRCA’s employment regulations) actually increased.Gunadi (2020)studies the more recent Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (2012), which provided only temporary deferral status to eligible immigrants. While the program failed to significantly alter the incarceration rate among unauthorized youth, there does appear to be a negative association – on the state level – between approved DACA applications (per 1,000 population) and local property crime rate (Gunadi, 2020).The rest of the paper is organized as follows:Section 2discusses the background. InSection 3, we describe the data, empirical specifications, and the identification strategies. Results and robustness checks are presented inSection 4.Section 5concludes.",Jakub,Isabel,Carlos
"1. IntroductionConfronted with nationwide closures of schools and daycare facilities due to the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020, many parents in Germany suddenly had to overhaul their work-care-arrangements. Only a very limited number of parents who between them had a specific constellation of systemically relevant occupations were granted access to emergency childcare (henceforth referred to as EC). In this paper, we exploit plausibly exogenous variation in eligibility rules across German federal states to evaluate the effect of emergency childcare policies on parental well-being and parenting behavior during the pandemic. Closed schools and childcare facilities, work from home arrangements, social distancing policies, and financial and health-related worries during the first lockdown created a stressful environment for families. These circumstances are likely to increase parenting stress, which in turn, might negatively influence parenting behavior (Abidin, 1992;Jackson and Choi, 2018). Previous research indicates a positive association between negative parenting behavior and higher levels of children externalizing and internalizing problems, even if negative parenting behavior occurs infrequently (Pinquart, 2017). Moreover, harsh parenting has also been shown to be a risk factor for child abuse and neglect (Lee, Grogan-Kaylor, and Berger, 2014).We employ a difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD, or: triple differences) design to identify intention-to-treat (ITT) effects. We leverage cross-state variation in EC eligibility rules during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Germany, and can hence compare outcome changes of systemically relevant parentswithEC access to outcome changes of equally systemically relevant parents in other stateswithoutEC access. This controls for the fact that systemically relevant parents (nurses, doctors and other key workers) are specifically affected in pandemic times, irrespective of EC. This cross-state comparison is based on the assumption that, were it not for EC policies, outcome changes for systemically relevant parents would have been similar across federal states. However, federal states were differently affected by the pandemic and hence reacted differently. To control for state-specific shocks that may have affected parents, we hence additionally use outcome changes for parents with no systemically relevant occupation between them, resulting in a triple-difference design. The ITT parameter resulting from the triple-difference design, i.e. the causal effect of emergency childcareeligibility, is the most policy relevant parameter since eligibility is the lever that policy makers primarily control. However, since substantive two-sided non-compliance in the context of pandemic emergency childcare (due to self-protective parental behavior and fuzzy implementation of the eligibility rules) is to be expected, we provide supplementary IV-LATE analyses to rescale ITT effects and to characterize compliers. TheLATEparameter represents the causal effect of emergency childcareutilization.We draw on unique data from two waves of a German family panel “Growing up in Germany: Everyday Worlds” (AID:A) that surveyed families in 2019 and 4 to 5 months after the first COVID-19 lockdown in 2020. Based on a sample of 646 parents, we find that EC was not able to permanently shelter families from a considerable reduction in parental well-being. However, the provision of EC was effective in diminishing increases in harsh parenting in terms of ‘becoming angry’ among the EC-eligible parents. This effect of EC is evident several months post-lockdown, more pronounced in families with children of preschool-age or younger, and completely cancels out increases in harsh parenting among compliers. Furthermore, for fathers only, we find that EC prevented decreases in positive parenting behavior (child-centered communication), and increases in harsh parenting in terms of ‘punishing harder than merited’. Evaluating short- to medium-term effects, we likely measure lower bounds of immediate effects during the lockdown and identify the persistent component of the overall impact.Our results disentangle effects caused directly by school and daycare closures from general effects of the pandemic since by studying families that use childcare, we are able to compare families that experienced a complete disruption of external childcare provision with those that, thanks to their access to EC, did not. This comparison is most meaningful for children in daycare where EC was quantitatively and qualitatively more equivalent to the pre-pandemic situation than EC for school-children. We find that, while decreasing parental well-being appears to be a general pandemic effect rather than a specific effect of the closures, the observed increase in negative and potentially harmful parenting behavior is largely directly caused by school and daycare closures.These findings contribute to the growing body of empirical literature on how the COVID-19 pandemic affects families and family well-being1. We add to the existing literature by providing a first rigorous evaluation of EC policies, evaluating short- to medium-term (by August, September 2020) rather than immediate effects, by exploiting intra-individual variation in a range of parental well-being and parenting behavior indicators. Furthermore our analysis relates to previous literature evaluating expansions inearly childhood educationand care (ECEC) on maternal labor market participation, parental well-being and child development (e.g.Bauernschuster and Schlotter, 2015;Schmitz, 2020;van Huizen and Plantenga, 2018). We contribute to this strand of literature by evaluating the effects of a temporary disruption in external childcare provision. In a similar vein, our analysis contributes to the economic literature evaluating consequences of schooling disruptions on educational attainment and later earnings (e.g.Belot and Webbink, 2010;Hansen, 2011;Jaume and Willén, 2019;Marcotte and Hemelt, 2008).The paper is structured as follows:Section 2describes the EC policies that were in place during the first COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 in the German federal states;Section 3introduces the data used and describessample selection;Section 4presents the identification strategy; andSection 5reports the main results, as well as complier analysis and robustness checks.

"1. IntroductionHuman capital theorypredicts that workers with specific skills have higher adjustment costs in response to negative demand shocks than workers with general skills, because specific skills cannot be transferred acrossindustries, occupation, or firms. In line with this prediction a large literature documents that workers with specific skills experience larger earnings losses in response to firm closures and mass layoffs (Couch, Placzek, 2010,Gathmann, Schönberg, 2010,Hijzen, Upward, Wright, 2010,Jacobson, LaLonde, Sullivan, 1993,Robinson, 2018). Others show that workers with specific skills experience more difficulties adjusting to technological change (e.g.,Hanushek et al., 2017) and economic turbulence (e.g.,Lamo et al., 2011). Yet, others show that workers with specific skills have larger reallocation costs in response to local labor market shocks stemming, for example, fromindustrial regulationpolicies (e.g.,Walker, 2013) or import competition (e.g.,Traiberman, 2019,Utar, 2018,Yi, Müller, Stegmaier, 2017).However, human capital theory also predicts that increasinglabor demanddrives up the rents to specific skills, because workers with specific skills cannot easily be substituted, such that their outside options and, thus, their bargaining position improves with increasing labor demand (Becker, 1964,Lazear, 2009). Although understanding how returns to specific human capital respond to positive demand shocks provides important insights about the value of specific skills in dynamic labor markets and the substitutability of workers across firms, evidence on this relationship is scarce. A notable exception areJäger and Heining (2019), who show that small firms pay their incumbent workers higher wages in response to positive demand shocks stemming from co-worker deaths.This study uses variation from import and export shocks in Germany as a lens through which it studies the causal effects of negativeand positivedemand shocks on the returns to specific skills. Trade shocks provide an idealquasi experimentfor this purpose. First, trade shocks induce both, negative and positive demand shocks. Second, many papers suggests that trade shocks are related to substantial variation in labor demand by showing that variation of trade shocks leads to substantial employment variation (e.g.,Autor, Dorn, Hanson, 2013,Dauth, Findeisen, Suedekum, 2014). In this sense, Germany provides an ideal context for our analysis, because the country was exposed to a substantial increase in import competition from Eastern Europe and China at the same time that German exports to those countries were accelerating. These dynamics allow us to exploit substantial regional variation within and across different industries and occupations to analyze how returns to specific and general skills vary by negative and positive demand shocks.We combine three unique data sources. First, to measure the specificity of skills, we rely on the BERUFENET, an occupational task data set constructed by the German employment agency forcareer guidanceand job placement. Comparable to the U.S. O*Net, the BERUFENET contains information on the required tasks, equipment, working conditions, and required qualifications for all occupations in Germany. FollowingEggenberger et al. (2018), we use this data to construct a specificity measure that captures the transferability of the skill bundle of a particular occupation to the skill bundle requirements in the overall labor market. This specificity measure, that closely corresponds toLazear’s skill-weights definition of specific human capital, captures the probability of finding a new job that requires a similar skill bundle.Second, to measure the trade flows between Germany and other countries, we followAutor et al. (2014)andDauth et al. (2014)by using trade data from the United Nations (UN) Commodity Trade Statistics Database (Comtrade). This dataset, which contains detailed information about commodity types, provides information on trade flows between more than 170 countries.Third, to follow workers’ careers over long periods, we use register data from the Federal Employment Agency of Germany, the Integrated Employment Biographies (IEB). This data contains highly accurate information about workers’ wages, employment status, and commondemographiccharacteristics (e.g., age, nationality, and education), thereby allowing us to analyze the long-term consequences ofinternational tradefor workers with specific and general skills. Moreover, this data allows us to link workers to firms, so that we can account for detailed firm characteristics.Our empirical analysis relies on two main identification assumptions. First, we assume that German workers and firms were unable to foresee which industries, and therefore which labor market regions, would be affected by the demand shocks stemming from increasing international trade. While this assumption is key to all approaches followingAutor et al. (2014), it is even more important for our specific analysis, because the expected consequences of increasing international trade may have influenced firms’ demand for specific skills and workers’occupational choices. Thus, international trade might influence workers’human capital investments.On one hand, to reduce the negative consequences of import shocks, workers may have chosen occupations and industries that demand less specific human capital. On the other hand, firms may have increased their demand for specific skills in anticipation of new export opportunities. To deal with this concern, we restrict our sample to only West German workers who chose their jobs before 1990, and we calculate their skill specificity according to their baseline job in that year. Before 1990, it was virtually impossible to predict the fall of the Iron Curtain and the resulting acceleration of international trade between Germany and the former Soviet bloc countries in the 1990s and 2000s (Chevalier, Marie, 2017,Fuchs-Schündeln, 2008).Second, we must assume that the trade exposure measures do not reflect domestic shocks to German industries. To tackle this issue and isolate the effects of trade from other confounding factors, we follow common practice by building on the estimation strategy developed byAutor et al. (2013)andDauth et al. (2014): We instrument the increase in trade exposure from China and Eastern Europe to Germany with the trade between these low-wage countries and other “third-party” high-income countries.Our results show that workers with specific skills do not only suffer more from negative demand shocks, they also profit much more from positive demand shocks than workers with general skills. In response to the average increase of exports throughout our observation period, the earnings of a worker with a high level of skill specificity (75 percentile) increased by approximately 14 percent more than the earnings of a worker with an average level of skill specificity. In contrast, specific-skilled workers lost approximately 8 percent more in response to the average rising imports throughout our observation period. Workers with very general skills (25 percentile) gained approximately 12 percent less from exports than the workers with an average level of skill specificity. However, they also lost approximately 7 percent less from average increasing exports.As workers with specific skills profit more from positive demand shocks but suffer more from negative ones, the demand shocks led to more heterogeneous effects for workers with specific skills than for workers with general skills. Thus, our results suggest that investments in occupation-specific skill bundles lead to a risk-return trade-off when labor markets become more dynamic. We also find qualitatively similar results for workers who remain in their firm and occupation. This result highlights that not only job mobility, but also intra-firm wage bargaining is an essential tool for firms in responding to changes in labor demand.Additionally, our results uncover important heterogeneities. We find that specific skills matter less for young workers in response to negative demand shocks—at least, if they are mobile and switch occupations and labor markets. Thus, our results suggest that young workers either adjust to the consequences of demand shocks (Lazear, 2009), or that they are worse matched such that specific skills matter less for them (Fredriksson et al., 2018). Moreover, we show that specific skills matter less for workers who have entered the labor market after the fall of the iron curtain. Most likely, because workers learn about the developments in the labor markets and adjust to the consequences of demand shocks.The results remain robust for different sub-samples and regression specifications. First, the trade shocks are not correlated with our outcome variables throughout the pre-treatment period (the 1980s) suggesting that the implicit parallel trends assumption holds. Second, our results remain robust if we control for a set of very detailed industry dummies thus comparing workers within the same narrowly defined industry. Third, the results hold if we restrict our sample to a very homogeneous sample that only includes workers who hold anapprenticeshipdegree. Fourth, we find similar effects when we run our regressions on the industry instead of the regional level.Our results contribute to at least two strands of the literature. First, our results relate to the literature analyzing how portable human capital is across firms, occupations, and industries (Cortes, Gallipoli, 2018,Gathmann, Schönberg, 2010,Kambourov, Manovskii, 2009,Leighton, Speer, 2020,Poletaev, Robinson, 2008,Robinson, 2018). This literature largely relied on worker mobility in response to negative demand shocks to evaluate the importance of firm specific human capital for worker mobility. By analyzing how the returns to specific skills respond to positive demand shocks, our results demonstrate that the specificity of a worker’s human capital is not purely determined by a fixed “technological” substitutability between the worker’s skill bundle and the skill bundle of other workers. In contrast, the returns to specific skills are endogenous to market parameters. By demonstrating that the earnings of workers with specific human capital change with the labor demand of the relevant labor market, even in the absence of worker mobility, we offer new insights into the micro-economic foundations of the return to specific skills.Second, we contribute to the literature analyzing the labor market consequences of international trade. Within this literature a number of papers emphasize the role of specific human capital as main determinant for the adjustment costs in response to trade shocks.Traiberman (2019)estimates an occupational choice model and shows that the largest share of adjustment costs in response to import exposure arises because workers must switch occupations and lose their rents to occupation specific skills.Utar (2018)finds that workers with manufacturing-specific skills suffer lager losses in response to imports shocks.AlthoughDauth et al. (2021)briefly touch on the relationship between export exposure and industry specific human capital, this is the first paper providing an extensive analysis of how trade shocks affect the returns to specific skills. Thus, we contribute to the literature by showing that both import and export exposure influence the returns to specific skills, such that workers with specific skills are not the main losers of increasing trade exposure. Indeed, in Germany, on average they even profit more than workers with general skills. Moreover, we show that specific skills matter less for young than for old workers, and younger workers change their occupations and labor markets in response to increasing exports. These results suggest that workers adjust to trade shocks in the longer run.The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.Section 2presents our theoretical model.Section 3explains our estimation strategy.Section 4presents the data and explains the empirical construction of our measure for occupational specificity.Section 5shows our empirical results and robustness checks, andSection 6concludes.",Christian,Simon,Uschi
"1. IntroductionIntergenerational mobilityis widely studied and often treated as a marker of a society's level of fairness or opportunity. Recently, with access to the universe oftaxrecords for certain birth cohorts and the ability to link parents and children based on dependent claiming, researchers have been able to study mobility in the U.S. at much finer levels — both geographically and temporally — than was previously possible.Chetty et al. (2014a)focus on mobility for children whose parents are at the 25th percentile of the national parent income distribution. Using estimates at the level of commuting zones (CZs, which are clusters of counties) for children born 1980–82, they find large geographic variation in mobility, both across and within regions.Chetty et al. (2014b)address the question of changes in mobility over time at the national level, and find that upward mobility was close to constant for children born 1971–1993.We revisit these questions of spatial and temporal variation in intergenerational mobility by examining changes in mobility at the CZ level across birth cohorts, using statistics released by the Opportunity Insights project on mobility for the 1980–86 birth cohorts. We find that while mobility from the 25th percentile did not change on average nationally across these birth cohorts, there were large increases and decreases at the local level. We show a map of these changes in mobility inFig. 1, revealing more positive changes in Texas, most of the Southeast, and some of the Midwest, and more negative changes in the West and in Florida.Download :Download high-res image (1017KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. Absolute mobility from 25th percentile, change between 1980 and 1986 birth cohorts.Notes:Mobility statistics for each commuting zone and birth cohort are from Opportunity Insights. Absolute mobility from the 25th percentile is defined as the expected income percentile, measured nationally among the birth cohort at age 26, achieved by children whose parents are at the 25th percentile of the national parent income distribution. See section 2 for further details on the measurement of mobility.Our findings suggest that some of the results inChetty et al. (2014a)are particular to the birth cohorts they study, and that the geographic patterns of mobility can change substantially, even over a relatively short span of time. There is convergence in mobility from the 25th percentile between the 1980 and 1986 birth cohorts, such that places with lower initial mobility tend to experience a more positive subsequent change. Regional differences in mobility become much smaller over this time period: differences in average mobility across the four census regions can explain 25 percent of the overall variation in mobility in the 1980 cohort, but only 5 percent in the 1986 cohort. An example of this phenomenon is thatChetty et al. (2014a)find that mobility is lowest in the Southeast, but this region experiences generally positive changes in mobility between the 1980 and 1986 cohorts, as shown in our map inFig. 1.Chetty et al. (2014a)also find that, on average, mobility from the 25th percentile is lower in urban areas than in rural areas. We find that this gap increased somewhat between the 1980 and 1986 cohorts, from 2.6 to 3.3 percentiles.If mobility from the 25th percentile improves over time in a CZ, this could reflect a general increase in incomes (relative to the national distribution) for all children who grew up in that CZ, or the improvement could be confined to children in the CZ who grew up in low-income households. To address this question, we repeat our analysis using mobility from the 75th percentile. We find evidence of significant divergence in mobility from the 75th percentile between the 1980 and 1986 cohorts. The cross-sectionalstandard deviationof mobility increases by 45 percent over this time period, regional gaps increase, and urban areas fall further behind rural areas on average.Therefore, whileChetty et al. (2014a), studying the 1980–82 cohort, find substantial geographic variation in mobility from the 25th percentile, and less variation in mobility from the 75th percentile, we find that in the 1986 cohort, the situation is very different: because of convergence in mobility from the 25th percentile and divergence in mobility from the 75th percentile, in the 1986 cohort there is more geographic variation in mobility from the 75th percentile. We show that, in a mechanical sense, this can be attributed to a change in the correlation between the height (at the median of the parents’ income distribution) of the rank-rank relationship between children's income and parents’ income and the slope of that relationship. The correlation was significantly negative in the 1980 cohort, so that places with higher rank-rank relationships had flatter slopes. However, in the 1986 cohort, the correlation was slightly positive.Our work complements a growing literature that uses the statistics produced by Opportunity Insights to study geographic variation in mobility. Krause and Reeves (2017),Weber et al. (2017), andWeber et al. (2018)further explore the urban-rural differences in mobility noted byChetty et al. (2014a). Other local characteristics that have been linked to income mobility include historical racial segregation (Andrews et al., 2017), the Great Migration of African Americans from the South to the North between 1940 and 1970 (Derenoncourt, 2022), schoolfinancereforms that equalize revenues across public school districts (Biasi, 2021), residual earnings and marriage rates (Rothstein, 2019), low birthweight (Robertson and O'Brien, 2018), and the level of violent crime (Sharkey and Torrats-Espinosa, 2017).Lefgren et al. (2020)find at most a very weak role for state-level policies in explaining spatial patterns of income mobility.A number of papers have examined changes in mobility over time, both at the national level (Aaronson and Mazumder, 2008;Fletcher and Han, 2018;Hilger, 2017;Lee and Solon, 2009) and over a very long time span by region (Tan, 2019;Connor and Storper, 2020). Our paper documents substantial changes in mobility at the local level even over a much shorter time span.Chetty et al. (2014a)andChetty et al. (2017)both study changes in income mobility for cohorts born in the late 20th century, and are the papers closest to ours.Chetty et al. (2014a)estimate roughly constant mobility across birth cohorts 1971–1993, where mobility is measured as the slope in a linear regression of the child's income rank or college attendance on parental income rank.Chetty et al. (2017)find a decline in the fraction of children who earn more than their parents, with a steady decrease for children born between 1940 and 1960, then a slower decline for children born between 1960 and the early 1980s.Our work also contributes to a small literature that adds some qualifications to the findings produced by the Opportunity Insights project.Gallagher et al. (2019)argue that geographic differences in family characteristics can explain a large share of the spatial variation in income mobility documented byChetty et al. (2014a). Similarly,Rothbaum (2016)finds that some spatial variation in forecasted causal effects of place inChetty and Hendren (2018a,2018b) can be attributed to geographic differences in resident characteristics.",Christopher,Katharine,None
"1. IntroductionSince 1950 the countries of Western Europe have gone from being origin of, to being destination for world migrants. In the last two decades, Western Europe has been one of the most important international destinations of migrants.Ferrie and Hatton (2015)documented that the share of new migrants from Europe in the United States dropped from 56.2 percent in the 1950s to just 13.1 percent in the 2000s and in the same years, United Kingdom and Scandinavian countries first, followed later by Ireland, Italy and Spain, experienced a transition from net emigration to net immigration.Fig. 1(a) using the European UnionLabor Force Survey(hereinafter,EU-LFS) documents this phenomenon and shows that the average share of migrants in the total population almost doubled (on average from 10% to 20%) between 1999 and 2018 in 16 European countries. No single country experienced a decrease of that share. Some countries such as Italy, Spain and France received a very large inflow of migrants over the past two decades and the population share of migrants in these countries more than quadrupled.Download :Download high-res image (423KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. Migration Statistics.There have been important economic and political consequences ofinternational migrationin Western European countries. A large body of research shows their positive contributions to European economic growth (e.g.,Docquier et al. (2014);Cattaneo et al. (2015)). Nevertheless, the relatively sudden arrivals of large numbers of migrants contributed to anti-immigration sentiment and political backlash (Mayda et al., 2018). A very important aspect, in determining natives’ view of migrants, in Europe, is their ability to assimilate into the labor market by finding a job as this is seen as a fundamental step for them to contribute economically.While economists have analyzed economic assimilation of migrants in individual European countries, relating it to local factors and possibly some policies, multi-country analyses are rare. Moreover the gender dimension of assimilation has been relatively neglected even though it is important for several reasons. First, female immigration to Europe increased significantly in the considered period. Second, participation of women in labor markets has also significantly increased. Third, while women have made significant progress in many economic indicators, awareness of the remaining gender gaps has become more acute.Fig. 1(b).1 shows the so called ‘feminization of migration’ in Western Europe, i.e. the relative increase in women immigrants. Female migrants have come to outnumber male migrants in many EU countries in 2018, although female immigration was much lower in the early 2000s. If we look at high-skilled migrants with education above high school level, their sex ratio is even more favourable to women (Fig. 1(b).2). Switzerland had the lowest share of women migrants in 1999 but that share climbed to parity in the most recent survey. Considering the occupation- and sector- distribution of migrants’ employment by gender (usingEU-LFSdata), migrants are more likely to be employed in elementary occupations - a group that employs less than 10% of native workers and over 20% of migrants. Female migrants are even more likely (over 30%) to be employed in elementary occupations than male migrants (slightly below 20%), suggesting a double disadvantage that female migrants face (Fig. A1). The sector-distribution also shows an employment gap that varies by gender. Female migrants are more likely to be employed in house keeping and personalservices sectorin both periods, whereas male migrants are more likely to be employed in the construction sector (in Period 1) and in the hotel and restaurant sector (in Period 2) (Fig. A2).This paper contributes in three ways to the existing literature. First, we provide a comparative and consistent analysis of labor market outcomes of migrants, and of their convergence to natives by gender, for the 16 Western European countries over two decades (1999-2018). The performance of migrants relative to natives in the labor market has been widely studied but most of the research is confined to case studies of individual countries - mainly the English-speaking developed countries (i.e., the U.S., Canada, and Australia).1Comparative analysis on economic assimilation of international migrants is very limited. We offer here a comprehensive picture for European countries and we provide an overview of the factors associated with economic assimilation. Second, we providedescriptive statisticscapturing immigrant gap at arrival and after a decade, and how these vary across countries and over time. The focus of this study therefore is on comparing labor market convergence of male migrants, and female migrants, and examine the variation in initial conditions and subsequent convergence in the period 1999-2018 (i.e., pre- and post-Great Recession). Third, we analyze host country specific factors that may be related to differences in patterns of assimilation by gender in Western European countries. In this context, we provide a rich description by documenting the variation in assimilation pattern across countries and by exploring correlates of such variation. We examine the role of macroeconomic conditions, institutional settings, indicators of gender bias and measures of individual attitudes. While this analysis does not aim at identifying the causal determinants of the patterns observed it may suggest which factors are more strongly associated with immigrants’ assimilation, and specifically of female immigrants’ assimilation. Distinguishing between economic, institutional and attitude-sentiment factors we can provide evidence of which one of these framework is more likely to affect female immigrant assimilation.2The paper is structured as follows: the next section reviews existing studies on labor market effects of migration, migrants’ economic assimilation and the feminization of migration. Section III estimates the size of the initial employment gap and employment convergence for male migrants and female migrants, across countries and in the decade before and after the 2009 economic downturn. Section IV examines the role of the macroeconomic conditions, structure of labor markets, institutional settings, gender indicators and attitudes as potentially associated with measures of employment convergence of migrants. Section V provides concluding remarks.",Taehoon,Giovanni,Martina
"1. DataThe data for this project come from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) linked to administrative earnings and benefit records. The SIPP is a nationally representative sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized population of the U.S. that began in 1984. Each SIPP panel is chosen to be nationally representative of the population at the time of the panel, with the exception of an oversample of low-income households in panels after 1990 that increases the number of cases in and nearpovertyby 15%–20%. There have been 14 SIPP panels since 1984 with each panel lasting between two and four years. Within panels the SIPP is longitudinal, but each panel draws a new sample of 14,000 to 52,000 households. The SIPP GSF linkseach individualin a SIPP household in the 1984, and 1990–2008 SIPP panels to their IRS and SSA earnings and benefits records through 2011.3We use the earnings histories in the SIPP GSF that come from the Detailed Earnings Records (DER), which are co-maintained by the SSA and the IRS. The DER contains all earnings including over the FICA taxable maximum. The SIPP GSF sums earnings across all jobs which provides non-top-coded total earnings from 1978 to 2011, including deferred and non-deferred earnings from all jobs and from self-employment but not under the table earnings not reported to the IRS. Though the dataset also includes FICA taxable earnings back to 1951, the SIPP GSF does not contain the quarter in which the Social Security earnings cap was reached and so does not allow us to impute non-top-coded earnings prior to 1978. For this reason, we focus on the more recent period between 1978 and 2011 for which the data are not top-coded.The complete administrative SSA and IRS earnings history is linked to every individual that is ever surveyed in any of the included SIPP panels. For example, if a 55 year old individual is surveyed in the 2004 panel, the SIPP GSF will include that individual’s (non-top-coded) earnings from 1978 through 2004andfrom 2005 through 2011, and their FICA taxable earnings back to 1951 or the beginning of the individual’s work life.In addition to the administrative earnings records, the SIPP GSF has basicdemographicand human capital variables, marriage histories, fertility histories, as well as self-reported earnings and work hours from the SIPP survey. Variables collected in the SIPP panels that are not linked to administrative data cover only the years of the individual’s SIPP panel. Thus, in this study, race-ethnicity and education are measured at the time of the SIPP panel. The subgroup analysis by educational attainment and by race-ethnicity relies on information from the survey data that is not available from administrative data sources. Educational attainment is not included in thetaxrecords co-maintained by IRS and SSA. Race-ethnicity, while collected by SSA, has not been collected in consistent categories over time.4We include in our sample individuals whose survey records can be matched to administrative earnings or benefit records. The match rate between survey and administrative data for most panels is quite high. In the 1980’s and 1990’s panels, the match rate hovered around 80%. In 2001, the match rate dropped to 47%.5Beginning with the 2004 panel, the match rate increased to around 90% because the Census Bureau changed its matching procedures removing the necessity to explicitly ask for Social Security numbers.6Because we pool panels, the annual match rates for our sample are between 81% and 83% and are constant over time.Table 1shows the demographic characteristics of the overall sample from the SIPP which is nationally representative and the sample matched to administrative earnings or benefit records. The two samples match quite closely with the exception of the matched sample being slightly more likely to have a college degree and to be white.Table 1.

"1. IntroductionWhile the economic principle that different tasks require different vocational skills (Geel et al., 2011) is well known, the question arises as to whether it also applies topersonality traits. The literature on personality traits and their labor market outcomes clearly shows that personality traits correlate with occupation and career choices (e.g.,Jackson, 2006;Caliendo et al., 2014;Wells et al., 2016). However, the within-occupation variance of tasks explains a significant portion of wage differentials between workers (Autor and Handel, 2013). Given that both personality traits and job tasks are predictive of individual labor market success, whether employers prefer applicants with different personality traits for different tasks remains under-researched.Indeed, although two strands of the economic literature—one on job tasks and the other on personality traits—have been growing over the past decade, little is known about the relationship between job tasks and personality. Except for a few studies that focus primarily on interactive tasks (e.g.,Mount et al., 1998;Borghans et al., 2008a;Weinberger, 2014),labor economicresearch remains silent about which tasks require which kinds of personality traits. This research gap is problematic, because analytical and interactive tasks have gained importance due to technological change, while routine tasks have lost their relevance (Autor et al., 2003;Weinberger, 2014). This labor market development sets the agenda for research into the relationship between job tasks and personality traits in terms of hiring decisions.In this paper, we investigate whether firms recruit workers with different personality traits for different tasks. We develop a representative firm survey in Germany (BIBB Cost-Benefit Survey (BIBB-CBS) 2017/2018), in which 1336 recruiters are randomly chosen to participate in a discrete choice experiment on their hiring decisions. In this experiment, recruiters are asked to choose between two hypothetical job applicants—all of whom are graduates of German upper secondary vocational training programs, with five years of professional work experience—in seven rounds of choosing. We frame the experiment as two applicants having already passed the initial stage of selection, based on their cover letters and CVs, and having been invited to participate in a job interview and a trial work day, after which the respondent has to choose to hire one or the other. This recruitment procedure gives the recruiter the opportunity to select according to the specific applicant characteristics that we include in our discrete choice experiment: (1) professional competence; (2) theBig Five personality traits, i.e., openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and emotional stability; and (3) the wage that the applicant asks for.To model personality traits within our experiment, we use attributes values that are validated in large-scale surveys such as the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP).1To obtain measures of job tasks that are relevant to each firm, we (a) relate both the survey question on job tasks and the discrete choice experiment to a reference occupation for which the firm actually recruits and (b) ask about the tasks performed by the firm's latest new hire in this occupation. We distinguish among five different tasks: analytical, interactive, routine, non-routine, and interactive job tasks (Gerhards et al., 2014,Rohrbach-Schmidt and Hall, 2013). To analyze recruiters’ preference heterogeneity relative to the applicants’ personality traits, we interact these traits with the job tasks that have to be performed in the reference occupation—which, while given for each recruiter, varies between recruiters. In total, our data covers 130 different occupations.The strength of our empirical approach is twofold: First, by implementing a discrete choice experiment, we do not depend on observed matching outcomes, in which employers’ and employees’ choices are determined simultaneously (Eriksson and Kristensen, 2014). The discrete choice experiment provides an experimental setting that is preferable to using observed outcomes because (1) all available choice options are observed, including the options that recruiters do not chose, and (2) job attributes vary exogenously. Each recruiter faces seven sets of applicants to choose between. Therefore, in our economic approach, we model a recruiter's choices as dependent observations and allow the preference parameters to differ among recruiters.Second, because the firms participating in our discrete choice experiment are a random subset of representative firms drawn from a national register for survey purposes, our results have a high degree of external validity (Hainmueller et al., 2015). This register from the Federal Employment Agency contains all German firms with at least one employee. We further strengthen external validity by collecting detailed information about the respondent's role in the recruitment process. To ensure a strong overlap between the firms’ actual recruitment process and our experiment, we only included respondents with recruitment power, i.e., actual recruiters.We find that all Big Five personality traits affect a job applicant's probability of being hired. While conscientiousness and agreeableness have the strongest positive effects, openness to experience and emotional stability are also important. Although extraversion and above-average professional competencies are also relevant, they are less important for being selected than the other four personality traits. Furthermore, we find that the relevance of the various personality traits differs strongly between the job tasks for which the firm recruits: for analytical tasks, recruiters prefer open and conscientious applicants, whereas for interactive tasks they favor open, extraverted, and agreeable applicants.Our paper contributes to two different strands of the economics literature. First, we complement the literature on personality traits, in which various studies show that personality traits are important for individual labor market outcomes such asemployability, job performance, and wages (e.g.,Borghans et al., 2008b;Heineck and Anger, 2010;Almlund et al., 2011). Moreover, research shows that personality traits are important for recruiters’ hiring choices (Dunn et al., 1995;Moy and Lam, 2004;Hoeschler and Backes-Gellner, 2018). However, no evidence yet exists on the heterogeneity of recruiters’ hiring preferences relative to an applicant's Big Five personality traits and job tasks. We contribute to this literature by analyzing the relationship between the applicant's Big Five personality traits and the job tasks for which recruiters’ hire new workers.Second, we add to the literature on job tasks, in whichAutor et al. (2003)and subsequent empirical studies (e.g.,Spitz-Oener, 2006;Black and Spitz-Oener, 2010;Autor and Handel, 2013) highlight the importance of tasks in determining the employability and wages of workers. In this literature, studies on the selection of workers into job tasks find that possessingsocial skillsis associated with a higher probability of performing interactive tasks (e.g.,Borghans et al., 2008a;Weinberger, 2014). However, these studies cover only a limited number of personality traits and job tasks. Moreover, as they observe labor market outcomes based on decisions made by both the employee and the employer, they cannot disentangle the role of the employer. We contribute to the literature on job tasks and personality traits by analyzing the heterogeneity of recruiters’ hiring preferences and including the full range of Big Five personality traits and job tasks.The paper is structured as follows.Section 2discusses the literature on recruiters’ hiring preferences, the link between the Big Five personality traits and job performance, and the assessment of Big Five personality traits within the recruitment process.Section 3describes the methodology of our experiment, the underlying data, the measurement of both job tasks and the attributes of the hypothetical job applicants, and thedescriptive statisticsof our working sample.Section 4discusses our empirical model, andSection 5presents the estimation results, including the robustness analyses.Section 6concludes and discusses implications for policymakers.",Caroline,Andries,Harald
"1. IntroductionAs documented byPiketty et al. (2019), Chinese income and assetinequalityrose from a level similar to that of Scandinavia to approaching that of the United States. More importantly, much of this rise was driven by the uneven ownership of the dramatically appreciating housing assets in developed cities. This housing boom in developed cities has been accompanied by massive inflows ofmigrant workersas well as tightening housing constraints.1Could this massive migration inflow and tight housing constraints in these developed cities explain rapidly rising inequality in China? If so, is there any policy we could implement to alleviate this rising inequality?In this paper, we take two approaches to answer both questions. First, using various sources of data, we document that housing costs andincome inequalityare significantly positively correlated with the number of migrant workers in different cities. Second, we construct a spatial equilibrium model incorporating both heterogeneous wage income and heterogeneous housing asset income to quantify the effects of migration and housing constraints on the observed income inequality. In the counterfactual analysis, we find that easing the housing constraints in developed cities can reduce income inequality in China.In the first step, we show four main stylized facts from the data. First, migration in China is overwhelmingly into developed areas. The concentration is accelerating across time because of improvements in the transportation system and the relaxation of theHukousystem.2Second, housing costs have increased drastically over time, especially for cities with large numbers of migrants. There is a positive correlation between housing costs and the net stock of migrant workers across cities. Third, income inequality within cities is positively correlated with the net stock of migrant workers. Fourth, it is housing ownership inequality, rather than wage inequality that caused the observations in stylized fact 3. These four stylized facts give us a preliminary picture of the whole story. As the economy grew, more and more migrants concentrated in large and developed coastal cities. The massive increase in housing demand, together with a highly regulated land supply, pushed up real estate rents in big cities to the benefit of local housing owners. Increasing housing rents then translated into increasing income inequality between local property owners and migrant renters.In the second step, we construct a spatial equilibrium model to quantify the facts, explain the mechanism, and conduct counterfactual analysis. The model comprises heterogeneous workers making migration choices, a representative firm, and a state-regulated housing sector in each city. The key mechanism is that with the universal drop in migration costs and uneven productivities, workers migrate from under-developed cities to developed cities with higher wages. Since housing supply is heavily regulated and inelastic in these developed cities, housing costs increase dramatically, which drives up local property owners housing income. However, due to various frictions, migrant workers cannot participate in their local property market or share any increases in housing values in the living city. They can only earn housing returns in their under-developed home city. As more and more migrants move into developed cities, the housing ownership gap between locals and migrants results in rapidly rising income inequality.Using various sources of data from 2005 and 2010, we solve the model quantitatively. We find that from 2005 to 2010, the average migration costs decreased by 35% for low-skill workers and 21% for high-skill workers. Meanwhile, productivity growth was faster in absolute terms in large cities, which attracted large numbers of migrant workers. These large, developed cities also have slower growth in land supply. Construction land supply increased by only 10% in the largest cities, which together attracted more than twenty million workers. While at the same time, average land supply growth was 40% for cities which lost almost half of their working population. This inefficient land supply policy causes severe housing constraints in developed cities and increases income inequality.3Finally, we conduct counterfactualpolicy reformsto ease housing constraints in developed cities and reduce income inequality. The main counterfactual we impose is a migration-based land supply reform. The idea is straightforward and intuitive: to allocate new land quotas by migration flows. We reallocate the increment of the total land supply quota from 2005 to 2010. Instead of giving more land quota to under-developed areas, we allocate land quota proportionally to the change in the migration inflows to different cities, while keeping the national total land supply constant. That is, cities attracting more migrants are given more quota.4Meanwhile, all revenues from additional lands in developed cities are collected and transferred to under-developed cities who lost quota as compensation. This policy mimics a ”land quota transfer market” (Lu, 2016) where developed cities can buy land quota from under-developed cities and compensate them with direct transfers. Thus, we can achieve balanced development between regions and simultaneously avoid policy distortion. With the counterfactual land supply policy, housing cost increases in big cities are significantly attenuated. Compared with the real world, this policy reduces housing costs in 2010 by 30% in first-tier cities and by 25% in second-tier cities, and also incentivizes more workers to migrate to these developed cities. Simultaneously, within-city income inequality falls by 34% and national inequality by 20%. In another counterfactual policy, we show that a US-level property tax and redistribution policy could also help to reduce income inequality.Literature ReviewOur study extends the current literature in three dimensions. First, we investigate a new mechanism for income inequality and extend knowledge about increasing inequality in China. There are many studies on income and wage inequality. Different papers investigate many causes of inequality, including skill-biased technological change and the increase in the return to human capital (Berman, Bound, Machin, 1998,Card, DiNardo, 2002,Moore, Ranjan, 2005), education inequality (Gregorio, Lee, 2002,Sylwester, 2002), trade liberalization (Goldberg, Pavcnik, 2004,Han, Liu, Zhang, 2012,Verhoogen, 2008), and privatization (Chao, Hazari, Yu, 2006,Cuadrado-Ballesteros, Peña-Miguel, 2018). The closest study to ours isChen et al. (2018). They find that larger cities have higher income inequality and claim that this is because migration inflows into larger cities change the skill composition of the workers, yielding a higher skill premium. In this study, we investigate a new mechanism of migration interacting with housing constraints that can also increase income inequality.Second, this paper contributes to the literature that studies the spatial distribution of labor supply using the EK-Migration framework. SinceAhlfeldt et al. (2015), the literature has extended the canonicalEaton and Kortum (2002)international tradeframework to introduce worker mobility to explicitly model worker location choices in the presence of migration costs and heterogeneous worker preferences regarding locations. Many of these contributions investigate internal migration costs, such asMorten and Oliveira (2014),Bryan and Morten (2019),Ma and Tang (2020),Tombe and Zhu (2019),Yu (2019),Wu and You (2020)andFan (2019). The closet studies to us areTombe and Zhu (2019)andFan (2019). The former focuses on how trade and migration costs affect labor productivity in China without differentiating between worker skill types, and the latter focuses on understanding how international trade affects overall domestic wage inequality and the aggregate skill premium without considering the distribution of property ownership. Our paper aims to understand income inequality stemming from both human capital andwealthownership differences. Guided by this target, our model introduces both high/low-skill workers and heterogeneous housing ownership. Second, instead of inferring wages from the model, which is the most important ingredient for calculating inequality, we manually collect the wages byindustryfor as many Chinese cities as we can from individual city statistical yearbooks. Combining this unique dataset with the population census, we construct a comprehensive and spatially decomposable inequality measure for China and investigate the most realistic policy reforms.Third, this paper contributes to the literature that studies the housing and land market in China. The so-calledGreat Housing Boomof China is well documented inGarriga et al. (2020),Garriga et al. (2017),Fang et al. (2016),Chen and Wen (2017), andGlaeser et al. (2017). The housing boom is unevenly distributed spatially. AsFang et al. (2016)shows, the boom is not universal. More developed cities have seen disproportionate gains in housing prices while less developed cities have seen their housing prices grow more slowly than GDP. Various theories attempt to explain this pattern:Garriga et al. (2017),Liang et al. (2016), andWu et al. (2016). We contribute to this literature by showing that the inefficient land supply policy and massive migration inflows into larger cities jointly caused theGreat Housing Boom. We also provide counterfactual policies for the housing sector, which could lower housing costs and reduce housing inequality.LayoutThis paper is organized as follows.Section 2describes the data and variables.Section 3documents five stylized facts of migration, housing, and inequality in China.Section 4shows the spatial equilibrium model.Section 5quantifies the model and shows the quantitative results.Section 6shows counterfactual policy reforms.Section 7concludes.",Min,Zibin,None
"1. IntroductionOn average, married men seem to earn more than single men. This wage gap persists after controlling for systematic differences in individual attributes. According toDaniel (1995), estimates range from 10 to 30%.Cohen and Haberfeld (1991);Nakosteen and Zimmer (1997)are two influential examples of the wide empirical literature on this topic. Crucially, the empirical evidence seems to suggest no marriage wage premium for women.The traditional explanations for the male marriage wage premium are based on the concepts of ”specialisation” and ”selection”. The selection hypothesis (seeNakosteen and Zimmer (1997)for an example) posits that some unobservable characteristics of men are valued not only in the labour market but also in the marriage market. Based on these unobservables, productive men may be perceived as more attractive partners, thus generating the positive correlation between wages and married status. However, the empirical evidence on this is quite weak.Ginther and Zavodny (2001)find that only up to 10% of wage premium is a result of selection, whereasChun and Lee (2001)go even further and argue that the selection effect is minimal.In turn, the household specialisation argument originates in the work ofBecker (1991). It proposes that marriage increases a man’s productivity, following the labour market specialisation that is possible due to the support of a wife.Korenman and Neumark (1991)provide some empirical support for this hypothesis. They find that wages increase after marriage, married men get better performance evaluations and are promoted more frequently.A growing body of empirical evidence shows that the difference in wages of married and unmarried men stems from selection into marriage directly based on wages and wage growth - crucially, both observable.Grossbard-Shechtman and Neuman (2003)call this the ”breadwinner” effect. Going a step further,Ludwig and Brüderl (2018)propose that the traditional arguments of specialisation and selection should be discarded.This, in fact, seems to reflect existing evidence on the gender asymmetry in the interaction between labour market and marriage preferences and outcomes. For example,Blundell et al. (2016)show that female attachment to the labour market weakens considerably after marriage. In turn,Gould and Paserman (2003)suggest that increased male wageinequalityleads to a decline in marriage rates for women. They also find that women are more selective in the marriage market when female wages increase (a proxy for the value of being single relative to married) and that they are less selective when male wages increase (proxy for the value of being married relative to single). In all these, the analogue is not true for men. They conclude that their findings support a search model of the female marital market. SimilarlyOppenheimer et al. (1995)find that increased economic independence leads to a delay in marriage for women, but not to a substantial decrease in the proportion of women who will marry.Oppenheimer (1988)calls this the “extended spouse search” theory. Once again, they argue that the analogue is not true for men. In all these studies, men’s economic potential is positively related to likelihood of marriage.Bonilla and Kiraly (2013)introduced a theoretical framework of interrelated frictional labour and marriage markets that captures the above asymmetries. They are the first to obtain a marriage premium as a result of search frictions, without relying on the traditional explanations: the result does not depend in any way on any notion of specialisation or male heterogeneity (observed or unobserved). Instead, the causality is in the direction suggested byLudwig and Brüderl (2018). InBonilla and Kiraly (2013), women choose a reservation match in their (marital) search efforts, and this translates into a reservation wage such that they will not marry any employed man who earns less than that. Aware of this, men’s job search is characterised by an optimally chosen reservation wage which may be lower than women’s reservation wage - that is, while they of course hope for a high wage that would be acceptable to women, they will still accept wages that imply women will reject them for marriage, provided these wages are not too low. The gap between the male (labour market) reservation wage and the female (marriage market) reservation wage is what generates the marriage wage premium.The framework has proved useful to study related issues. For example,Bonilla et al. (2019)introduce male heterogeneity as regards to the marriage market (some men are more attractive) and shows that the framework can explain the existence of Beauty Premium - including its links to marriage premium. The theoretical results are successfully tested using British data. Similarly,Bonilla et al. (2021)introduce male heterogeneity as regards to the labour market (some men are more productive than others), and it generates a prediction of the ranking of the marriage premia across men of differing productivities. This is tested successfully using Chinese data. In turn,Bonilla et al. (2017)introduces female heterogeneity as regards to the marriage market (some women are more attractive than others) and show that this can lead to class formation as inBurdett and Coles (1997), but based on the exogenous distribution of productivities and theendogenousdistribution of wages.In this paper we extend benchmark framework inBonilla and Kiraly (2013)by introducing heterogeneity not in the male or the female side of the market, but in thelabour demandside: two types of jobs are available, some are temporary and some are permanent. This results in a clear testable prediction: The marriage wage premium that characterises men on permanent jobs is in general lower than that which characterises men on temporary jobs, when a marriage premium exists at all. The reason is clearly linked to the forces that generate the marriage wage premium in the first place: given a wage earned by the prospective husband, the future is nicer if his job is permanent. As a result, women set lower marital reservation wages for men on permanent contracts, and this translates into lower marriage wage premia for these men.We test the model using Spanish data. Spain seems to be a very good scenario to test our model for at least two reasons: First, the dualisation of its labour market between temporary and permanent workers. In Spain, the share of temporary contracts relative to all wage andsalaryworkers reached a peak of 33% at the beginning of the 1990s (Dolado et al., 2002), and has remained above 20% including at the worst moments of thegreat recession, even though temporary workers where severely affected by employment losses (International Labor Organization, 2014). Second, there is evidence that the link between labour and marriage market dynamics differs across genders in a way closely linked to the heart of the model:De la Rica and Iza (2005)find that there is a delay in the transition to marriage for men on unstable contracts (or indeed not working) relative to men on open-ended contracts, but this difference does not exist for women.Our empirical results are in line with the predictions of the model: the marriage wage premium is higher for temporary workers. Deconstructing this result, we find that among never married workers, a permanent employment is linked to higher wages. In stark contrast, it is linked tolower wagesamong married employees. We see this as evidence that, ceteris paribus, women ‘select’ higher earning men for marriage, and marry workers with undesireable features in the labour market -such as a temporary contract- when this can be compensated with higher earnings. We also present robustness checks broadly confirming our results.Crucially these results are opposite to what would be expected if specialisation or selection based on unobserved heterogeneity were the main forces behind the marriage wage premium. One would expect more labour market specialisation on men on permanent contracts. Following this, the marriage wage premium among men on permanent jobs should be higher. Regarding the selection on unobservables argument, one would expect married men on permanent jobs to exhibit more valuable labour market characteristics, and this to be reflected in a higher wage premium. Thus, this explanation would predict a higher marriage wage premium among men on permanent jobs. If one considers that this is reflected in the nature of the contract itself (open ended vs temporary) instead or jointly with wages, then the selection on unobservables approach does not result in a prediction related to the result in this paper. This view is, nevertheless, not supported by the link between type of contract and wages referred to above.Section 2 introduces the model in detail and derives steady state values for the ensuing analysis, whileSection 3analyses optimal search by women and men respectively.Section 4addresses the equilibria in a scenario with exogenous distributions of wages, s , and finishes with a discussion of the testable predictions, relative to the marriage wage premia. InSection 5we extend the model by endogenising the wage offer distributions, following closely the version of noisy search used inBonilla and Kiraly (2013). The empirical test is addressed in Section 6, whileSection 7concludes.",Roberto,Miguel,Fernando
"1. IntroductionThe term “informal housing” refers to housing that is illegally constructed, exists outside of unified urban planning and government control, and lacks property rights protection (Durst, Wegmann, 2017,Roy, 2009,Zhang, 2018). Because these spaces are largely unregulated and subject to minimal governmental oversight and legal protection, health and safety concerns are often associated with them. And indeed, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, residents of slums and informal housing have been among those hardest hit because they lack basic sanitary conditions and spaces where they can self-isolate. Despite the health and safety issues associated with informal housing, its very existence in various forms throughout the world points to the inadequacy of formal housing markets and public housing projects to meet the demand for affordable living space (Kim, 2016). According to UNHABITAT, an estimated 1.8 billion people were living in slums and informal housing in cities around the world before the pandemic.1Informal housing plays an important role in mitigating the housing issues for the low-income groups (Sullivan and Olmedo, 2015), as well as in alleviatingpoverty(Mooya and Cloete, 2007). Hence, careful evaluation of these informal housing clearance policies and assessment of their impacts is sorely needed.China’s rapid urbanization makes it a good setting for studying aspects of informal housing. Its urbanization rate rose from 17.9% in 1978 to 64.7% in 2021. In recent years, the transformation of large-scale shantytowns and historic neighborhoods has ushered in a new stage in Chinese urban renewal. From 2015 to 2021, a total of 31.32 million shantytowns, a large portion of which are informal housing, were renovated nationwide. The fate of Chinese informal housing has attracted both research and policy attention (Niu, Sun, Zheng, 2021,Wu, Zhang, Webster, 2013). At the end of 2017, a fire broke out in Beijing, causing an unplanned, large-scale clearance of informal housing and thereby providing a natural experiment for evaluating the effects of government policies that remove these structures. This paper uses that event as an informal housing supply shock to evaluate the effects of a city’s informal housing clearance policies on its housing and labor markets and also to study the linkage effects on interrelated cities.International research on informal housing clearance mainly focuses on the specific practices and evaluations of slum clearance in particular cities or regions of developed countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, or developing countries, such as India and Brazil (de Camargo Cavalheiro, Abiko, 2015,Collins, Shester, 2013,Kearns, Wright, Abrams, Hazley, 2019,Zhang, 2018). Research on developed countries more focuses ongentrification, which refers to “a variety of changes in inner cities caused by the displacement of low-income households by high-income households” (Sullivan, 2005). Moreover, research on informal housing clearance in developed countries has focused on both short- and long-term perspectives (Kearns et al., 2019), while corresponding research on developing countries has mainly focused on implementation modes and short-term policy effects. For example, research on developing countries tends to consider policy interventions such as upgrading in place, securing private property rights, and carrying out slum renovations (Sanyal, 2014). Latest research start to study the issue of slum growth or slum demolition from a global perspective that combines the social and economic factors.Alves (2021)studies slum growth in Brazailian cities, and points out that economic growth in cities causes slum growth by attracting large number of low-income households who face higher rent growth for non-slum than slum housing.Rivera-Padilla (2021)takes into account individual location choices in returns to education, productivity, and housing rents, and analyzes the aggregate effects of urban slum demolition policies in India. More such studies are still needed that consider the issue of informal housing that takes into account a range of social and economic factors, such as the housing needs of rural–urban migrants, public health and environmental sanitation, localgovernance, private savings and investment, and land market regulations (Marx et al., 2013).In the Chinese context, analysis of economic impacts of informal housing clearance is insufficient and for the most part limited to studies of individual cities (Huang, Yi, 2015,Lai, Zheng, Choy, Wang, 2017,Liu, Wong, 2018,Yu, Cai, 2013).Niu et al. (2021)quantitatively examines the linkages between urban housing markets and labor markets from the perspective of migrant flows and wages, with a focus on the low-skilled migrant who are mostly likely to live in informal housing. More such studies are needed that consider the linkage effects between cities when examining impacts from informal housing clearance policies in China.To carefully study the impact of informal housing clearance policies on the housing and labor markets, it is necessary to analyze the relationship between the two. Existing literature on the dynamic relationship between the two markets mostly focuses on the policy impact from the perspective oflabor demand(Saks, 2008,Zabel, 2012), but lacking in the perspective of housing supply shocks as those caused by informal housing clearance. In fact, the informal housing clearance policies directly reduce the housing supply for low-income people. As the literature has argued, individuallabor migrationdecisions are mainly based on factors such as wages, housing expenditure, and quality of life (Plantinga, Detang-Dessendre, Hunt, Piguet, 2013,Roback, 1982,Rosen, 1986). Hence, policies of removing informal housing from large cities should cause housing prices to rise and force many low-income workers out of the local labor pool. At the same time, some studies suggest that informal housing clearance and urban renewal have a significant positive impact on a city’s income level (Collins and Shester, 2013), and this overall increase in wages might cause some of the lost labor to return. These findings suggest the importance of studying the interaction between the housing and labor markets from the perspective of labor supply when analyzing the policy effects of informal housing clearance policies.On the other hand, informal housing clearance policies can be regarded as part of a government’s regulation of the housing supply. These policies not only directly reduce the amount of housing supply in the short term, they also affect the housing supply elasticity by raising the accessibility standards in the informal housing market. In areas where government regulations reduce housing supply elasticity, labor demand shocks can cause wages and housing prices to rise, thus reducing employment and economic growth (Hsieh, Moretti, 2019,Saks, 2008). When factors driving economic growth have an impact on wages and housing prices, those cities with more elastic housing supplies witness faster population growth andlower wageand housing price increases. In contrast, cities with less elastic housing supplies tend to maintain the same population levels while housing prices and incomes rise more (Glaeser et al., 2006). These findings imply the importance of studying the housing supply elasticity. However, very little research exists on informal housing clearance from the perspective of housing supply elasticities.Based on the literature, we first empirically evaluate the effect of the informal housing clearance of Beijing in November 2017 using a difference-in-difference (DID) approach. We find that the informal housing clearance has a significant impact on a city’s housing market, particularly on rents. Further, the informal housing clearance significantly reduces the size of the city’s labor supply in the short term, but as the wage level in the city rises, part of the city’s labor force returns, resulting in insignificant mid- to long-term effects on the labor supply. These effects also extend to the housing and labor markets of the receiving cities. We further build a spatial general equilibrium model with different types of labor and formal and informal housing that considers individual location choices. The model calibration is consistent with the empirical results. We then examine the policy effects of increasing formal housing supply elasticities and increasing the threshold of entering the formal housing market. We find that increasing formal housing supply elasticity and decreasing the threshold of entering the formal housing market can mitigate the increase in rents and decrease in labor supply caused by the informal housing clearance policies.As pointed out byRivera-Padilla (2021), the existence of informal housing is a double-edged sword. On one hand, informal housing provides affordable shelter and thus labor market opportunities in urban center to low-skill labor. The informal housing market in Chinese cities facilitates China’s rapid growth in low-cost, labor-intensive manufacturing exports to the global market (Niu et al., 2021). On the other hand, problems with health and safety are associated with informal housing, which bring damages to peoples’ living environment just like the fire occurring in Beijing in 2017. In this case, it is important to evaluate the effect of the informal housing clearance policies on the utility levels. Based on the model framework, we compare the pre- and post- policy utility levels in Beijing and the receiving cities. We find that in response to the informal housing clearance policy, the utility levels of both Beijing and the receiving cities decrease. Increasing formal housing supply elasticity and indemnificatory housing while decreasing the threshold of entering the formal housing market can compensate for the decrease in utility levels caused by the informal housing clearance policies.This paper is also related to the strand of literature that investigates the effects of land property rights and titling programs on a variety of economic variables, including real estate values, labor supply, and poverty reduction (Field, 2007,Galiani, Schargrodsky, 2010,Lanjouw, Levy, 2002).2As noted byGaliani and Schargrodsky (2010), a pervasive manifestation of weak property rights is a large number of people living in urban dwellings without possessing formal titles. The absence of formal property rights clearly constitutes a severe limitation for the poor. Our paper examines the effects of informal housing clearance (i.e., the absence of property rights) on the housing market and labor supply and studies the link between the lack of property rights and utility levels. Our results suggest that informal housing clearance, or the lack of property rights, raises housing rents, reduces the labor supply in the short term, and decreases the utility levels of the city enacting the policy. These results confirm the findings in the literature on the impacts of granting property rights but look at the issue from the perspective of a lack of property rights.This paper makes the following contributions to the existing literature. First, it compensates the literature by analyzing the policy impact of informal housing clearance on the housing and labor markets from the perspective of housing supply shocks. Second, the scope of the study is not limited to policy effects in a single city: through empirical tests and model calibration, it analyzes the linkage effects on cities with interrelated housing and labor markets. Finally, this paper treats informal housing clearance policies as policy measures that directly reduce the housing supply and thus lower housing supply elasticity.The rest of this paper is organized as follows.Section 2describes the data and empirical tests.Section 3presents a theoretical model and model calibration.Section 4presents the policy simulations of increasing commercial housing elasticities and the threshold of entering the formal housing market.Section 5concludes.

"1. IntroductionLabor economists have made tremendous efforts to measure human capital since the inception of this concept. Years of schooling and years of potential experience were originally used as proxies for human capital, and the subsequent development of the literature expands the scope of the measurement to include health status, cognitive skill, non-cognitive skill, andsocial skill(Bartel, Taubman, 1979,Deming, 2017,Griliches, 1977,Heckman, Stixrud, Urzua, 2006,Mincer, 1974). In contrast to the attention given to measuring human capital, efforts to measure the usage of human capital have been limited, perhaps because a perfectly competitive labor market entails an efficient use of human capital through the price mechanism. This is Say’s law in the labor market: An abundance of skill lowers the skill price and skill demanded increases along with the skill demand curve. Rejections of the efficient market, however, are paramount. For instance,Hsieh et al. (2019)report that 20–40% of US economic growth between 1960 and 2010 was induced by resolving the inefficient allocation of talents caused by the division of the labor market by race and gender. Accumulated evidence points to the prevalence ofmonopsonyin the labor market (Ashenfelter, Farber, Ransom, 2010,Dube, Jacobs, Naidu, Suri, 2020,Manning, 2013). Recent studies, furthermore, have investigated the role of gender norms in the apparent underutilization of human capital to explain the persistent gender wage gap (Bertrand, Goldin, Katz, 2010,Bertrand, Kamenica, Pan, 2015). Thus, direct measurement of skill use is indispensable to shed light on skill underutilization and skill mismatch in the labor market. This paper proposes a succinct measure of skill use based on detailed information about tasks implemented on the job, and demonstrates its benefit through examples.The literature on over-education has attempted to measure skill use. In particular, this strand of literature attempts to measure the degree of skill under-utilization by the gap between skill and an occupation’s skill requirement, typically approximated by the minimum requirement of educational attainment or the average educational attainment of workers in the same job. In this exercise, taxi drivers with a university degree are labeled as over-educated, because they have higher educational attainment than the minimum educational requirement, which is typically a high-school degree. Typical studies validate the measurement of over-education by showing that a negative correlation between the degree of over-education and wages.Leuven and Oosterbeek (2011)comprehensively surveyed the literature and criticized this approach, however, because selection into jobs with a low educational requirement is a mere reflection of the lower unobserved ability conditional on educational attainment, and the lower residual wage just reflects workers’ lower ability. This critical survey article provides two important lessons for an attempt to measure skill use. First, skill use should be precisely measured based on detailed information about what tasks are implemented on the job to avoid a mere reflection of the endogenous selection into jobs based on ability. Second, the constructed measure of skill use should be validated against a measurement that is not a trivial reflection of ability.To construct the skill-use measurement, we rely on microdata from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) compiled by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), covering more than 30 countries (of which we use 24 countries). The PIAAC is the best-suited micro data set for our purpose, because it includes measurements on both skills and skill uses: The PIAAC measures the literacy and numeracy skills of adults based on an on-site test, as well as the frequencies of implementing certain tasks requiring a specific skill, such as reading manuals/reference sources or calculating prices/costs. Based on detailed information about the frequency of engaging in various kinds of tasks, we construct measures of literacy and numeracy use drawing onItem Response Theory(IRT), which is widely used to identify the ability of students from their responses to examination items. Applying IRT enables us to construct objective measures of skill use on the job for each individual. The application of a uniform method across countries renders an internationally comparable measure. Furthermore, the proposed skill-use measures of literacy and numeracy exactly correspond to the skill measures of literacy and numeracy, constructed based on IRT, which enables an examination of the determinants of skill use conditional on theskill level.We demonstrate the validity of the newly developed measure of skill use with three applications: The gender wage gap, the impact of parental leave on gender gap in skill use, and the wage gap between natives and immigrants.The first application estimates the role of skill use in explaining the gender wage gap. Literature has demonstrated that the accurate measurement of skill is indispensable to estimate the residual gender wage gap. On the other hand, a strand of literature points to an under-utilization of skill due to the work hours constraint faced by females that causes the gender wage gap, particularly at the top end of the wage distribution (Goldin, 2014). To directly examine if the difference in skill use explains the observed gender wage gap, we examine how much the residual gender wage gap narrows by including skill use measures in addition to the conventional covariates that presumably capture workers’ skill. We find that skills are roughly the same across genders, but there are substantial gender gaps in skill use in some countries. We also find that the gender gap in skill use, along with the gender gap in tenure, explains a substantial part of the gender wage gap in countries where observed gender wage gap is large such as Korea and Japan.The second application focuses on assessing the impact of parental-leave policy on the gender gap in skill use. Motivated by the observation that generous parental-leave policies and the glass ceiling limit femalecareer advancementin Nordic countries, some studies point to the backlash effect of parental-leave policies on female career advancement. A few studies indeed report adverse effects of parental-leave policies on women’s career advancement by exploiting international differences in the generosity of the policy. We collected parental-leave policies in 2011 from the relevant laws in each country, as well as the Working Conditions Laws Database of the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the OECD family database. Exploiting this database, we estimate the impact of the length of parental leave on the gender gap in skill use, paying attention to heterogeneous impacts by skill level. We find that the relationships between the length of parental leave and the gender gaps in skill use differ across skill levels. Among workers in the lowest-skilled group, the length of parental leave is positively correlated with the country-specific gender gap in literacy use. In contrast, among workers with higher skill levels, we find a negative association between the length of parental leave and skill use among higher-skilled women. We show that the relationships still hold after partialling out the effects of other institutions. Our findings suggest that expanding parental-leave policies entails a trade-off: On one hand, parental leave promotes the employment of the least-skilled women, who would otherwise drop from the labor market, while on the other hand, the policy hinders the intensive skill use of moderately skilled women. To highlight the benefit of using the skill-use index, we estimate the policy impact using conventional market outcomes, the employment, hours worked, and hourly wage. We find that the estimated effect of the parental-leave policy is not as clear cut as the results based on the skill-use indexes, assuring the benefit of the skill-use measure.The third application analyzes the source of the wage gap between natives and immigrants. Numerous studies examining the wage penalty of immigrants point to skill mismatch as a source. To directly examine the role of skill mismatch as a source of the wage penalty of immigrants, we examine how much of the residual wage gap is explained by the skill and skill use measures. In 6 of the 16 countries where we found an immigrant wage penalty, the wage gap narrows substantially after controlling for observed characteristics. In these 6 countries, a non-negligible part of the reduction in the immigrant-native wage gaps is attributable to the difference in literacy utilization. We further demonstrate that the our skill use index is useful for shedding light on the mechanism behind the dynamic change of the wage gap between immigrants and natives. We show that the wage gap between immigrants and natives narrows as the number of years since immigration increases. Then, the decomposition shows that the gap explained by the gap in literacy use narrows as the number of years since migration increases. Overall, we demonstrate that the gap in skill use explains the variation in the wage penalty among immigrants relative to natives.Through these three examples, we demonstrate the strength of the proposed skill-use measure. The test batteries to measure skill and skill use in the PIAAC, however, are lengthy and incorporating such test batteries in the conventionallabor force surveyor national census is not realistic. With this backdrop, we propose to merge skill and skill use measures based on common variables in the PIAAC and the conventional dataset. By using occupation codes, we can merge the skill use index with the conventional data set. This exercise is similar to assigning tasks to each occupation using O*net, as done byAutor et al. (2003). We indeed show that the literacy and numeracy use intensities in each occupation measured by the PIAAC and O*net are similar in the US. By usingdemographicvariables such as education and potential experience, we can merge skill index with the conventional survey data. Merging skill and skill use indices with the conventional survey data allows researchers to shed light on the issues beyond the coverage of the PIAAC data set.",Daiji,Takahiro,None
"1. IntroductionThis paper studies the relationship between the adoption of industrial robots and workers’ safety, health, and well-being. Robots and artificial intelligence are radically changing the role of workers in the production process, generating lively discussions on their effects on labor markets (Acemoglu, Restrepo, 2020,Dauth, Findeisen, Suedekum, Woessner, 2021,Graetz, Michaels, 2018,de Vries, Gentile, Miroudot, Wacker, 2020).The reallocation of tasks associated with automation is likely to have effects on work-related health risks. According to theBureau of Labor Statistics (2020), privateindustryemployers in the US reported over 5000 fatal work-related injuries and 2.8 million nonfatal workplace injuries and illnesses in 2019, whose total estimated cost to the nation, employers, and individuals was $171 billion (National Safety Council, 2020), equivalent to 4% of 2019 US government budget. While the rapid adoption of industrial robots presents both new hopes and challenges to workers’ safety and health (CDC, 2021), empirical evidence on robots’ impacts on workplace safety and health remains sparse.The relationship between robots and workers’ physical health and safety is complex. On the one hand, since their introduction, industrial robots have typically been used for physically intensive tasks that are often associated with detrimental effects on health and increased risk of accidents at work.1In this context, automated systems can offer considerable safety benefits to human workers, as robots can help prevent injuries or adverse health effects resulting from working in hazardous conditions. Examples include musculoskeletal disorders due to repetitive or awkward motions (Schneider and Irastorza, 2010), or traumatic injuries (e.g., in poultry processing, where cuts are common). Robots can also prevent multiple hazards in emergency response situations such as chemical spills (Ishida et al., 2006). Besides protecting workers, robots can also minimize risks stemming from human error (Karwowski, Rahimi, Mihaly, 1988,Linsenmayer). If a job is repetitive and monotonous, humans tend to commit a mistake, whereas robots can do these things the same way repeatedly. On the other hand, robots can pose a variety of hazards to workers (Kirschgens et al., 2018). For example, while industrial robots have been designed to operate at a distance from workers, these machines often lack the sensory capabilities necessary to detect nearby humans. Moreover, the spread of collaborative robots, which are intended to directly interact and share workspaces with humans, can lead to additional safety risks (Matthias et al., 2011). Therefore, the direction and the magnitude of the effects of robot adoption on workers’ physical health are theoretically ambiguous and represent an open empirical question.There is also increased concern that the complex relationship between humans and machines may have detrimental effects on workers’ mental health (Robelski and Wischniewski, 2018) and act as an additional stressor at the workplace (Körner, Müller-Thur, Lunau, Dragano, Angerer, Buchner, 2019,Szalma, Taylor, 2011). Furthermore, the labor market effects of robot adoption and automation may increase stress and anxiety even among individuals who are not directly exposed (Venkataramani, O’Brien, 2020,Venkataramani, Bair, O’Brien, Tsai, 2020).In this study, we begin by investigating the relationship between the adoption of industrial robots and work-related injuries using data from the United States (US) and Germany, two of the leading robot adopters in the world. To examine the impact of robots on work-related injuries in the US, we use detailed establishment-level data on work injuries from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Data Initiative (ODI) covering the 2005 to 2011 period, while information on the distribution of industrial robots across sectors and over time are sourced from the International Federation of Robotics (IFR).2Using establishment-level data on injury rates, we find that a onestandard deviationincrease in robot exposure (1.34 robots per 1000 workers) reduces work-related injury rates by approximately 1.2 injuries per 100 full-time workers (0.15 standard deviations; 95% CI:−1.8,−0.53). To gauge the economic significance of the effects, a back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the increase in robots between 2005 and 2011 saved $1.69 billion per year in injury costs (in 2007 dollars). This result largely reflects a reduction in injury rates at manufacturing firms which decline by 1.75 injuries per 100 full-time workers (or 0.22 standard deviations; 95% CI:−2.48,−1.02). The results are robust to several sensitivity checks (for details, seeSection 4.2).We then turn to investigate whether robots have an impact on workers’ mental health in the US. Using commuting zone-level data on mortality (source: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] Vital Statistics) and survey data on mental health problems (source: Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System [BRFSS]), we show that robot penetration leads to sizable increases in drug or alcohol-related deaths and mental health problems. A one standard deviation increase in robot exposure raises deaths due to drug oralcohol abuseby 0.37 standard deviations (10.5% increase with respect to the mean) and the number of days during the previous month when the respondent felt his or her mental health was not good by 0.40 standard deviations (14.9% increase with respect to the mean). However, we find no evidence of significant effects on the suicide rate. Overall, we interpret these findings as evidence suggesting that the labor market pressure and fears induced by robot penetration (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2020) may have detrimental effects on workers’ mental health (see alsoVenkataramani and O’Brien, 2020).Next, we leverage additional data from Germany to provide further evidence. Several reasons make Germany an appealing context to explore and complement the analysis based on the US establishment and regional data. First, Germany is a world leader in robotics whose robot penetration is even higher than that of the US, as shown inFig. 1. Second, evidence suggests that the effect of robot penetration on German manufacturing jobs was largely mitigated by the growth of jobs in services, thereby suggesting that the effects on mental health may be different compared to those observed in the US. Third, the availability of longitudinal survey data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) containing information on occupation, sector, and various health and well-being outcomes allows us to shed further light on the complex effects of robot penetration on workers’ safety using individual-level data and exploiting within-individual changes in exposure to robot penetration. Finally, using the SOEP data, we adopt an alternative identification strategy relying on the probability of exposure to robots based on the occupation associated with one’s vocational training. Thus, we only leverage variation in robot exposure based on the track choice individuals made early in their life. This decision is unlikely to reflect correlates of robots’ adoption and labor market outcomes later in life, and therefore, less likely to be endogenous.Download :Download high-res image (167KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. Trends in Robot Adoption in the US, Germany and Europe - 1993–2016. Notes - This figure shows the number of robots per thousand workers in the US, Germany, and European countries on average between 1993 and 2016. Data are drawn from the International Federation of Robotics.The results based on the German individual panel data show that a one standard deviation increase in robot exposure is associated with a 0.01 standard deviations reduction in the risk of reporting any disability (−5% with respect to the mean) and a 0.02 standard deviations reduction in the likelihood of being employed in a highly physically intensive task (−4% with respect to the mean). We also find no evidence of significant effects of robot exposure on workers’ well-being and mental health. Overall, our results for Germany are consistent with those documented byDauth et al. (2021), who show that robot exposure did not cause disruptive job losses in Germany and that the individual risk of becoming unemployed is even lower among more robot-exposed manufacturing workers who were re-trained. They find that the longer-term shift from manufacturing to services was driven by young labor market entrants, not by actual switches. We argue that this is likely the main explanation for the different effects of robot exposure on mental health in Germany.Our methodological approach is closely connected to some recent studies analyzing the impact of robots on labor market conditions, life course choices, anddemographicbehavior. Recent studies have analyzed the effects of the increase in industrial robot usage on employment and wages across various countries (Acemoglu, Restrepo, 2020,Dauth, Findeisen, Suedekum, Woessner, 2021,Giuntella, Wang, 2019,Graetz, Michaels, 2018,de Vries, Gentile, Miroudot, Wacker, 2020). WhileAcemoglu and Restrepo (2020)andGiuntella and Wang (2019)estimate sizable and negative impacts of the rise in robot exposure on employment and wages across the US commuting zones and China, respectively,Dauth et al. (2021)andGraetz and Michaels (2018)find no significant effects on employment in Germany and for a set of 17 countries, respectively. Using data from 37 countries,de Vries et al. (2020)find that a rise in robot adoption reduces the employment share of routine manual jobs. Recent literature also examines the impact of robotization on family outcomes (Anelli et al., 2021). In a recent study, using data on self-reported health in the US and exposure to robots at the MSA-level,Gunadi and Ryu (2020)find that a 10% increase in robots per 1000 workers is associated with approximately a 10% reduction in the fraction of low-skilled individuals reporting poor health. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only other study analyzing the relationship between robot penetration and physical health. UnlikeGunadi and Ryu (2020), we focus on establishment-level data on work-related injuries and use longitudinal data from Germany on both physical and mental health outcomes of workers. There are two other recent studies analyzing the relationship between automation and mental health.Venkataramani et al. (2020)find evidence of a strong association between automotive assembly plant closure and opioid overdose mortality between 1999 and 2016. In a concurrent work,Venkataramani and O’Brien (2020)show that robot penetration led to a substantial increase in drug overdose mortality between 1993 and 2007. While the present study examines a wider range of outcomes, our evidence on mortality in the US is largely consistent with their findings. Using data from Germany,Abeliansky and Beulmann (2019)find evidence of a decline in mental health associated with increased exposure to robots. While the latter study uses similar data for Germany, we adopt a different identification strategy and focus on a broader set of outcomes, and find no evidence of a decline in mental well-being.By contrast, a growing number of studies investigate the effects of other labor market shocks on injuries and health (Colantone, Crino, Ogliari, 2019,Hummels, Munch, Xiang, 2016,McManus, Schaur, 2016,Pierce, Schott, 2020). For instance,McManus and Schaur (2016)examine the effect of import competition in the US and find that an increase in import competition significantly increases worker injury and illness rates. Further,Hummels et al. (2016)exploit Danish employer-employee data combined with individual health data to demonstrate how rising exports may lead to increases in injuries, severe depression, and hospitalizations because ofheart attackand strokes, whereasColantone et al. (2019)explore the effects of exposure to global trade on mental health.Pierce and Schott (2020)find that areas more exposed tointernational trade policyexhibit relative increases in fatal drug overdoses, specifically.Our work also appeals to the recent few studies analyzing the effects of immigration on task allocation, work-related health risk, and the health of the native population (Giuntella, Mazzonna, 2015,Giuntella, Mazzonna, Nicodemo, Vargas-Silva, 2019). Related to this literature, our study explores the effects of the changes in task allocation induced by robotization, and in particular, its effects on work-related accidents and mental health.Finally, our study contributes to the literature that investigates the relationship between workers and machines, and their consequences on the health and mental well-being of workers.Robelski and Wischniewski (2018)provide a comprehensive review of the literature on human-machine interaction and physical and mental health, underlining the need for more research on the relationship between health and human-machine interaction.The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows.Section 2describes the data.

"1. IntroductionMany progressive American policy analysts point to Denmark as a model welfare state with low levels ofincome inequalityand high levels of social mobility in income across generations. It has in place many social policies now advocated for adoption in the U.S.: free college tuition, universal access to high-quality health care, equality of per pupil expenditures across all neighborhoods, universal high-quality pre-K, and generous childcare and maternity leave policy. In addition, there are well funded social security, disability, and unemployment programs in Denmark.Inequalityin disposable income is much lower than in the U.S.Yet, despite generous social policies, family influence on many child outcomes in Denmark is comparable to that in the U.S. Common forces are at work in both countries that are not easily mitigated by welfare state policies. Denmark achieves lower income inequality and greaterintergenerational income mobilityprimarily through itstaxand transfer programs and not by building the skills of children across generations and promoting their human potential more effectively.1Despite the generosity of the Danish welfare state and equality in access for all citizens, substantial inequality of child outcomes remains across social and economic classes.Figure 1documents these gaps and compares them to their U.S. counterparts. Children of college-educated women do substantially better than children of secondary school dropouts on many dimensions in both countries.2Download :Download high-res image (471KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. Inequality over the life cycle.Note:The figure shows children’s life course outcomes by their mother’s education for Denmark and the U.S. Scale differences for some dimensions impair full comparability across countries. However, the overall pattern with differences in all outcomes across the life persist in both countries. Birth weight is the same scale and outcome levels are lower in the US but gaps top-bottom are the same in the two countries. Data on admission to neonatal units differ in definition and can thus not be compared 1:1. Test scores are also not the same, so we can only compare patterns. Figures A.1 and A.2 plots outcomes across the full life cycle. The data are described in Web Appendix C.Denmark is a laboratory for understanding the origins of inequality and social immobility. In the U.S., inequalities in the public services that are universally provided at a high level in Denmark are major topics in discussions about promoting social mobility. However, if equal Danish provision of services does not eliminate inequality in many important life outcomes, the origins of inequality and social immobility lie elsewhere. Consequently, an uncritical adoption of Danish policy initiatives may not be effective as a way to ensure equality of opportunity.This paper reports three major findings from our ongoing joint research on Danish and American inequality and social mobility.3(1) Intergenerational educational mobility is about the same in both countries for the most recent cohorts. Transmission of skills across generations is equally strong in both countries, despite stark differences in income inequality and offered public services.(2) The traditional literature on the intergenerational transmission of economic status compares snapshots of lifetime incomes of parents and children.4This approach gives only a limited picture of the transmission of lifetime well-being across generations. Using Danish register data on lifecycle income, we find that intergenerational elasticities of income (IGE) of lifetime well-being are much higher than those estimated using incomes measured over a small window of ages. Accounting for uncertainty and credit market restrictions increases estimated dependence in welfare across generations. Well-being is much more tightly linked across generations in Denmark than conventional snapshot measures of lifetime income indicate.(3) We expand the analysis of family influence beyond the traditional analysis of IGEs of income to include choices of neighborhood, peers, and schools as parental investments in their children. We present compelling evidence of purposive sorting by parents in making neighborhood choices. Our evidence calls into question the assumptions underlying the recent neighborhood influence literature – that timing of residential choice is random with respect to the lifetime gains for children.5Public policy should be better informed about the role of the family and markets in shaping child outcomes and in complementing or undermining public policy. Family influence in shaping the child is universally accepted.6Families operate through multiple channels. (i) Through direct parental interactions with children in stimulating child learning, personality, and behaviors. This comes from direct engagement and by setting examples for children to emulate, including supporting, supplementing, and advising schooling and other activities in which children engage. (ii) Through choice of neighborhoods and localities which influence the quality of schooling and the quality of peers. (iii) Through guidance on important lifetime decisions.Public policy and social analysts often ignore these fundamental points and neglect the central role of family influence and family response to policy. Effective public policy has to recognize the “Matthew Effect:”“to those who have more is given.” —Matthew 25:29 RSVMore advantaged families are better able to access, utilize, and influence universally available programs. Universal provision of public services does not necessarily mitigate advantages, and indeed may exacerbate inequality.7Targeted strategies are generally more effective, although they are often rejected as politically unpalatable.8These forces are especially important in understanding neighborhood effects on child development which have received considerable attention in the recent literature in economics.9Families sort by education and affluence. Such sorting has been increasing over the past decades in both Denmark and the U.S. Sorting, coupled with the Matthew Effect, creates neighborhood effects as outcomes of social processes. Put differently, the neighborhood effects reported in the recent literature are likely consequences of the families that sort to them and the synergies so produced. We document the powerful role of Matthew effects in promoting social immobility.A crucial identifying assumption in the recent literature on neighborhood effects is that the timing of the choice of neighborhood is random across the age of children in families. We document purposive early selection of quality neighborhoods for children that is more pronounced for more educated and affluent parents. This point is important because the data from public records available in the U.S. (and other countries) and used in recent influential studies is limited in its information on many important, previously established determinants of family influence, such as family marital arrangements, parental criminal histories, parental education, ability, parenting styles, and other characteristics.10Findings of powerful neighborhood effects in such limited data may just as well be a consequence of the poor quality of the data on family influence, and the sorting of families by socioeconomic status. Neighborhood is a proxy for family characteristics. Therefore, it remains a question whether there exists some intrinsic property of neighborhoods per se that can be eliminated by relocating residents.Our paper proceeds as follows.Section 2presents a brief overview of the evolution of the Danish welfare state and illustrates its divergence from the U.S. counterpart. The section then shows how intergenerational mobility in educational attainmentdeclinedwhen Denmark moved toward universality ineducation policiesand away from targeting the least advantaged groups even though policies such as free college tuition, universal daycare, and support for public education were rolled out during the same period. For the most recent cohorts operating under universality, educational mobility is similar in the two countries, and associations between test scores and family background are also strikingly similar.Download :Download high-res image (228KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 2.Public spending andtransfer payments, as percentage of GDP, Denmark and U.S.Source:U.S. is based onhttps://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/BUDGET-1996-BUD/contextFederal Budget of the United States, from 1948-2000.

We show that intergenerational lifetime well-being is more closely linked than currently used indicators suggest.Section 4shows the purposive sorting of parents across neighborhoods. It documents the similarity of sorting patterns in the U.S. and Denmark. We show the powerful role of parental influence in shaping public expenditure even when equality is mandated. We apply our analysis of the Danish data to interpret the evidence on the validity of recent studies based on limited U.S. data on the power of neighborhoods. Danish data are much richer and allow us to examine in greater detail assumptions used to analyze U.S. data. We demonstrate the strong sorting patterns of families in picking neighborhoods. This analysis sends a clear message about the failure of identifying assumptions invoked in U.S. studies. Estimated neighborhood effects proxy family characteristics and family actions, not some mysterious property of “zip code” or place. Accounting for these characteristics greatly weakens estimates of neighborhood effects and illustrates the power of family rather than place.",James,Rasmus,None
"1. IntroductionRecent work on labor supply has extended traditional labor supply models to account for investment in human capital over the life-cycle, which renders wages endogenous to thelabor supply decision. It has also emphasized the important distinction betweenlabor force participationand labor supply intensity (i.e., hours) decisions. This work suggests that labor supply elasticities may be significantly larger than has been assumed by the conventional wisdom of the economics profession (seeKeane and Rogerson, 2012,2015). More generally, recent work on labor supply emphasizes how labor supply elasticities vary systematically over the life-cycle for individuals, as well as acrossdemographicgroups.Optimaltaxtheory suggests that labor supply elasticities are crucial inputs into the design of thetaxand transfer system. But the implications of recent work on labor supply for the optimal design of the tax and transfer system has received limited attention. My goal here is to discuss the implications of recent labor supply modelling for the optimal design of the tax and transfer system, and to suggest important avenues for future research on this topic. As a by-product I update my survey inKeane (2011)to cover the past decade.Two key points are worth highlighting: First, there is a fairly broad consensus in the economics profession that low tax rates on capital income are desirable. However, we'll see how two results characteristic of recent labor supply modelling – the combination of elastic labor supply and elasticities that grow with age – imply that the optimal tax rate on capital income may be higher than previously supposed. Second, both elastic labor supply and endogenous wage formation (via human capital formation) shift the optimal tax structure towards relatively flat-rate structures with low top rates on labor income. It is interesting that these two implications push in opposite directions politically.Turning to the heterogeneity in labor supply elasticities across demographic groups, a clear finding is that labor supply is very elastic for married women (see, e.g.,Eckstein et al., 2019,Eissa, 1996). But the joint taxation of couples in households has a strong tendency to impose high effective tax rates on married women. Several recent papers point to a clear conclusion that a shift from joint to individual taxation would be welfare enhancing, and that it would lead to substantial increases in married women's labor supply.The outline of the paper is as follows: First, I give some background on optimal tax theory and review some classic papers on optimal tax structure. Then I discuss more recent developments, focusing in particular on the work byConesa, Kitao and Krueger (2009)that clarifies the role of labor supply elasticities in optimal tax calculations. Their paper shows how elastic labor supply and elasticities that increase with age both encourage a high tax rate on capital. Hence, I review in turn the evidence on elastic labor supply and the age pattern of elasticities, and argue it supports both claims. Next, I consider optimal tax calculations that explicitly account for endogenous human capital and/or participation. Finally, I turn to the topic of heterogeneity in labor supply elasticities across demographic groups, and show how the evidence on this topic argues for the efficiency of individual taxation.To conclude, I highlight some gaps in the existing literature. The empirical evidence on how labor supply elasticities differ by age is still rather limited, although the evidence that does exist suggest they are increasing. Given the importance of this issue for optimal tax structure, much more work on this topic is needed. Theoretically, the frontier in the optimal tax literature is to usedynamic stochastic general equilibriummodels with overlapping generations of heterogeneous workers to study optimal tax structure – both income and capital tax – in models that include (i) Endogenous wages, (ii) Participation Decisions, (iii) Workers that differ by education, and (iv) both single workers and married couples. While existing papers tackle a subset of these problems no one has tackled all of them.",Michael,None,None
"1. IntroductionThedivision of laboris generally stronger in different-sex couples than in same-sex couples; as noted in (recent) empirical studies, different-sex partners often end up in traditional families, with men specializing in market work and women in household work (Aguiar, Hurst, 2007,Juhn, McCue, 2017,Ramey, Francis, 2009), whereas same-sex partners tend to be much more similar in how they allocate their time to market and/or household work (Bauer, 2016,Black, Sanders, Taylor, 2007,Giddings, Nunley, Schneebaum, Zietz, 2014,Jepsen, Jepsen, 2015,Jepsen, Jepsen, 2006,Leppel, 2009,Martell, Roncolato, 2016,Prickett, Martin-Storey, Crosnoe, 2015,Tebaldi, Elmslie, 2006). Is there an explanation for these specialization differences?Long before empirical same-sex evidence became available,Becker (1991)already speculated that same-sex couples should specialize less than different-sex couples. According to his theory on comparative advantage and family specialization, partners can mutually benefit if they specialize and take advantage of each others comparative advantage in market and household work; in the absence ofsex differencesbetween partners, Becker argued that same-sex partners are expected to specialize less because they have less to gain from their comparative advantage.But is the comparative-advantage explanation the most compatible one?Casual evidence suggests that there might be other explanations for why same-sex couples specialize less than different-sex couples; among these are traditional gender roles, the likelihood to have children, partner choice, and partnership stability (Black et al., 2007).In this study we examine time allocation decisions in same-sex and different-sex couples from a Beckerian comparative advantage perspective (Becker, 1981,Becker, 1991). Since comparative advantage is often defined in terms of a comparative advantage in earnings potential, which is generally not observable, we take an intermediate approach, relate unobservable earnings potential to observable hourly earnings, and test whether the highest earner in a couple spends more time on market work and less on household work. In particular, we estimate the comparative advantage relationship between time spent on either market or household activities and a dummy for being the highest earner in a couple on samples of same-sex and different-sex couples. We also estimate the same relationship on alternative samples (consisting of less conventional couples, cohabiting couples, childless couples, and younger and thus more recently formed couples) to explore some of the alternative explanations for why same-sex couples may specialize less than differen-sex couples.1Using data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) for the years 2003 to 2019, we find that same-sex couples specialize not as much as different-sex couples. We argue that these differences are driven by the most traditional couples in the sample, that is to say, married couples with wives at home taking care of children and husbands working outside the home. Without those traditional couples, which represent at most 20% of all different-sex couples, we find that partners in same-sex and different-sex are equally responsive to each others’ comparative advantage; that is, the highest-earning partner spends 80 min more per day on market work and 40 min less per day on household work, regardless their sexual orientation. In couples where both partners work, we find that partners continue to specialize, but they specialize less; that is, the highest-earning partner spends about 40 min more on market work and 30 min less on household work, again regardless their sexual orientation. We therefore conclude that for the majority of same-sex and different-sex couples a comparative advantage in terms of a wage rate advantage is equally relevant for the time allocation decisions they make.Our study adds to the growing literature on the economic lives of lesbian and gay couples. First, our study contributes to the literature on same-sex specialization, and suggests that same-sex partners profit as much from each others’ comparative advantage as different-sex partners do.2Second, our study also contributes to the literature on lesbian and gay earnings, and offers specialization as a possible explanation for the observed lesbian premia and gay penalties. If specialization increases the highest earners’ time spent at market work and (because of that) their market skills, specialization differences between same-sex and different-sex couples can explain why most researchers find that lesbian women earn more than heterosexual women and gay men earn less than heterosexual men (seeKlawitter (2015),Valfort (2017)andJepsen and Jepsen (2020)for recent reviews on the topic).The latter contribution also hints at a limitation of our study. The estimation strategy we use assumes that the causal link runs from being the highest earner in a couple (independent variable) to time spent on either market or household activities (dependent variable). If specialization leads to wage rate differences in couples, our key independent variable turns endogenous and the causal link may reverse. This does not mean, however, that we cannot get meaningful estimates. In our case, we can still detect comparative-advantage driven specialization if we assume that the highest earner in a couple was already the highest earner (or the one with highest earnings potential) when the couple was formed.3The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.Section 2describes the data.Section 3discusses our empirical strategy.Section 4presents the empirical results.Section 5explores other mechanisms than a comparative earnings advantage to understand specialization differences between same-sex and different-sex couples.Section 6concludes.",Thomas,Erik,None
"1. IntroductionIn many countries, including the US and the UK,intergenerational mobilityis low (Blanden, Goodman, Gregg, Machin, 2001,Blanden, Gregg, Macmillan, 2007,Chetty, Hendren, Kline, Saez, 2014,Chetty, Hendren, Kline, Saez, Turner, 2014). At the same time, wageinequalityhas been increasing rapidly, especially at the upper tail of the wage distribution (Autor, Katz, Kearney, 2008,Lemieux, 2006,Machin, 2011). These increases at the upper tail of the wage distribution have been linked to skill-biased technological change (e.g.Acemoglu, 2002,Acemoglu, 2002,Autor, Katz, Krueger, 1998,Krusell, Ohanian, Ríos-Rull, Violante, 2000), which has led to a steadily rising college-earnings premium.1Traditionally, studies examining college earnings premia and skill-biased technological change have focused on differences between college-educated workers and workers without a college degree.2More recently, attention has been drawn to the rising wage inequalitywithinthe group of college-educated workers and the role ofpostgraduate educationin explaining this pattern (Altonji, Zhong, 2021,Eckstein, Nagypal, 2004,Lindley, Machin, 2016).In recent decades, an increasing share of first-degree holders also obtain postgraduate qualifications. At the same time, earnings growth for postgraduate-degree holders has been much steeper than for workers who only hold a first degree.3Postgraduate-degree holders now comprise a significant share of the workforce. As of 2018, in the US and the UK, around 15% and 14% of employees have postgraduate qualifications (or around 37% of employed first-degree holders in both countries).4They earn significantly more than employees who only have a first degree (see Appendix Figure A.1) and they are over-represented in the upper tail of the earnings distribution. Given the rising levels of wage inequality and the high intergenerational persistence in earnings, this raises the question of who invests in postgraduate education and what drives individual decisions to obtain a postgraduate degree. Despite the fact that postgraduate-degree holders are the most educated and most highly-skilled group in the population (Lindley and Machin, 2016), surprisingly little is known about what drives this educational choice.In this paper, we aim to fill this gap in the literature and shed light on students’ motives to obtain postgraduate education. In order to do so we proceed in three steps. First, we survey a representative sample of 1002 undergraduate students in England and elicit beliefs about the returns to postgraduate education as well as intentions to enroll in a postgraduate degree. This unique dataset allows us to document individual heterogeneity in perceptions about different immediate and later-life benefits and costs of postgraduate education as well as investigate whether beliefs differ with the socioeconomic background of the respondent. Second, we estimate a choice model in which we allow for differences in beliefs and preferences across socioeconomic groups and examine whether differences in beliefs about returns can account for the socioeconomic gap in students’ intentions to pursue postgraduate education. Finally, we investigate whether students with different socioeconomic backgrounds differ in their undergraduate experiences, and examine whether these experiences predict their perceptions about the immediate benefits and costs of continuing to postgraduate education.We elicit individual beliefs about the returns to postgraduate education using hypothetical investments scenarios. This allows us to overcome the problem that educational choices are consistent with many different combinations of preferences and beliefs (Manski, 2004). More specifically, we ask students to imagine scenarios in which they enroll or do not enroll in postgraduate education. We then elicit their perceptions about a range of different immediate and later-life outcomes that are of pecuniary and non-pecuniary nature. To get a better sense of how students experience studying towards their undergraduate degrees, we administer a novel questionnaire designed to capture students’ actual experiences.Several results emerge from our study. First, undergraduate students who are the first generation in their family to go to university state a 5 percentage point lower likelihood of continuing to postgraduate education relative to continuing-generation students. First-generation students in our sample also perceive a range of different benefits of postgraduate education to be lower. This is especially true for the immediate benefits associated with attendance. Second, the estimates of our choice model and results of ourdecomposition analysisreveal that around 70% of the first-generation vs. continuing-generation gap in students’ intentions to enroll in a postgraduate degree can be accounted for by differences in beliefs about returns. We also find striking differenceswithinthe group of continuing-generation students. Students who have at least one parent with a postgraduate degree state, on average, an 8 percentage point higher likelihood of enrolling in a postgraduate degree relative to students who have at least one parent with a first degree, but no parent with a postgraduate degree. Again, differences in beliefs can explain a sizeable share of this gap.Our last set of results relate to students’ actual university experiences. We document that there are sizeable socioeconomic gaps in how students experience their undergraduate life, how theyfinancetheir studies, and how they allocate their time across different activities. In particular, first-generation students are significantly less likely to enjoy their coursework or have received parental support in their choice of attending university, and are more likely to struggle financially and work alongside their studies. Finally, students’ current experiences are predictive of beliefs about the immediate non-pecuniary benefits of postgraduate education, which is consistent with a theory in which current experiences shape beliefs about likely future experiences.A question which emerges is whether there are actual gaps in the returns to postgraduate education by students’ socioeconomic background. Given the socioeconomic differences we find in terms of how students experience their lives as undergraduates, it may very well be that there are also gaps in the returns to postgraduate education, especially when it comes to the immediate non-pecuniary factors. Similarly, the returns to postgraduate degrees in terms of labor market outcomes may also vary with the students’ socioeconomic background. We provide suggestive evidence on differences in earnings premia by parental education.Our study builds on and contributes to several strands of the literature. First, it contributes to the large and growing literature on the role of beliefs in decision-making. The role of beliefs has been studied in many different contexts.5Our study most closely relates to the work that examines the role of beliefs in students’ decisions to obtain further schooling (e.g.,Almas, Cappelen, Salvanes, Sorensen, Tungodden, 2016,Attanasio, Kaufmann, 2014,Attanasio, Kaufmann, 2017,Belfield, Boneva, Rauh, Shaw, 2019,Boneva, Rauh,Dominitz, Manski, 1996,Jensen, 2010,Kaufmann, 2014). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the role of beliefs in students’ decisions to obtain postgraduate education.Second, our study relates to the role of students’ beliefs in their choice of major, high school track and occupation, or which specific university to attend (e.g.,Arcidiacono, Hotz, Kang, 2012,Arcidiacono, Hotz, Maurel, Romano, 2020,Delavande, Zafar, 2019,Giustinelli, 2016,Giustinelli, Manski, 2018,Giustinelli, Pavoni, 2017,Hastings, Neilson, Ramirez, Zimmerman, 2016,Hastings, Neilson, Zimmerman, 2017,Wiswall, Zafar, 2015,Wiswall, Zafar, 2018,Zafar, 2012,Zafar, 2013). Similar to many of the studies in this literature, we find that non-pecuniary factors, including considerations related to family dynamics (e.g., parental approval), play a major role in the decision to obtain postgraduate education. In contrast to these studies, we examine an extensive rather than an intensive margin choice.Third, we contribute to the literature on the importance of personal experience in belief formation. While other studies have shown that personal experiences can shape beliefs in other domains (e.g.,Giuliano, Spilimbergo, 2013,Hyll, Schneider, 2013,Laudenbach, Malmendier, Niessen-Ruenzi, 2019,Laudenbach, Malmendier, Niessen-Ruenzi, 2020,Malmendier, Nagel, 2011,Malmendier, Nagel, 2016), we show that personal experiences are also predictive of beliefs in an educational context. Shedding light on the relationship between experiences and beliefs is crucial for our understanding of how beliefs are formed.Finally, we contribute to the literature on postgraduate education which has examined postgraduate earnings premia and other benefits of postgraduate education (Eckstein, Nagypal, 2004,Gu, 2019,Lindley, Machin, 2016).Altonji and Zhong (2021)estimate the returns to a broad set of graduate degrees in the US. Relatedly, a number of studies have investigated the returns to specialized postgraduate programs such as MBAs (Arcidiacono, Cooley, Hussey, 2008,Bertrand, Goldin, Katz, 2010,Graddy, Pistaferri, 2000) and medical degrees (Bhattacharya, 2005,Chen, Chevalier, 2012,Ketel, Leuven, Oosterbeek, van der Klaauw, 2016). While these studies examine the benefits of postgraduate education, we contribute to this literature by examining students’ motives for obtaining it.",Teodora,Marta,Christopher
"1. IntroductionThe U.S. safety net was extensively revamped in the 1990s. After a period of experimentation by the states, federal welfare reform replaced the cash transfer program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), with the Temporary Assistance to Needy Family (TANF) program, in 1996. Congress expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) over the period 1994-1996, raising wage subsidies available to low-wage workers. Changes to the Medicaid program, which began in the 1980s, continued during the 1990s to extend health coverage to children in low-income families.An important question is, how did these reforms affect the educational attainment of individuals who were adolescents at the time the reforms were enacted? This question is important for policy purposes, since the goal of policy makers was to change the safety net in ways that would have long-term effects on U.S. society. It may also have important implications for trends ininequality.Several authors have analyzed how specific reforms have affected the schooling of individuals who were adolescents at the time when the reforms were passed.Dave et al. (2012)andKaestner et al. (2003)analyzed how welfare reform affected dropout behavior.Maxfield (2013),Bastian and Michelmore (2018), andManoli and Turner (2018)estimated the effect of EITC expansions on educational attainment. The effect of Medicaid expansions on college attendance has been studied byCohodes et al. (2016),Miller and Wherry (2019), andBrown et al. (2020).Whereas previous authors have sought to estimate the effect of specific programs, our goal in this paper is to estimate their joint effect, that is, their effect as a bundle. One reason is that we might expect the effects of those programs to interact. For example, a healthier adolescent may be better able to take advantage of additional parental expenditures on her schooling.Another reason is that there are at least two channels by which the reforms could have affected individuals who were adolescents at the time they were put into place. The first we refer to as the resource channel. This includes the effects of the reforms on program services, parental time spent with children, and parental income, which in turn could affect the adolescent’s ability to afford post-secondary schooling. The resource channel has been the implicit focus of previous work, as we discuss below. We would expect males and females to be similarly exposed to the resource channel, since they grow up in the same families.However, safety-net reform may have also affected those adolescents via their expectations about the future, including their expectations regarding future safety-net benefits and eligibility.Heckman et al. (2002)present a model that predicts that early-career wage subsidies may reducehuman capital investmentsthat are rivalrous with work. Thus expectations of future wage subsidies could reduce schooling. Studies that focus on the resource channel may miss the expectations channel. In contrast to the resource channel, we would expect the expectations channel to affect males and females differently, since in the pre-reform regime, women were much more likely than men to receive safety-net benefits.We take a difference-in-differences (DD) approach to estimation, comparing two groups across two generations of adolescents. The pre-reform generation consists of the 1961-1964 birth cohorts of the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79). This generation was aged 11-15 in 1975, and in their 30s by the time of safety-net reform. The post-reform generation comes from the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97), whose members were born between 1980 and 1984. This generation was aged 10-15 in 1995, in the midst of the 1994-1996 EITC expansions and just before federal welfare reform. Members of this generation would have been affected to varying degrees by the Medicaid expansions, as well.Within each generation, we define a treatment and a comparison group. The treatment group consists of individuals whom we predict to be at high risk of economic disadvantage during adolescence. We show that this group has characteristics similar to those of groups at high risk of welfare receipt in the mid 1990s. As a result, they should have been affected by safety-net reform. The comparison group consists of individuals at lower risk of adolescent disadvantage, who would have been less affected by safety-net reform.The logic of differences-in-differences here is straightforward. The contrast between the high- and lower-risk groups in the pre-reform generation establishes the baseline difference in their educational attainment prior to safety-net reform. Differencing across generations nets out changes over time in factors that influence schooling which affect both groups similarly. If safety-net reform were the only factor that affected the two groups differently, then the DD approach would identify the bundled effect of the various safety-net reforms. This would include the effects of any interactions as well as effects that arise via resource and expectations channels.Of course, other factors may have affected schooling trends as well. These include differences in the U.S. economy as faced by the two generations as they finished high school. We expand on the basic difference-in-difference approach by adding various macro- and socio-economic controls to account for these factors.Our focus here is on educational attainment at age 25. We consider years of schooling, high schoolgraduation, sub-baccalaureate degrees, and college graduation. We find that safety-net reform may have reduced educational attainment for women, while increasing it for men. Women obtained fewer years of schooling, were less likely to graduate high school, and less likely to obtain a post-secondary degree. However, although all these effects were in the same direction, they were marginally significant. In contrast, men were significantly more likely to obtain a post-secondary degree.To the best of our knowledge, these results provide the first estimates of the bundled effects of safety-net reform on schooling. Our findings for women differ from those of some earlier studies, which focused on the resource channel for specific safety-net programs. To help explain these differences, we analyze annual enrollment and labor supply between the ages of 18 and 22, when most people who attend college would be enrolled. We find that young women are less likely to be enrolled and more likely to work during this period as a result of safety-net reform. This is particularly true for young women with children. As we explain below, this may be consistent with the notion that the expectations channel led to the reduction in human capital among women. In a follow-up paper (Bastian et al., forthcoming), we build on these results, and examine how these changes in human capital affected employment, safety-net participation, marriage, and childbearing up through age 32.In the next section of the paper, we provide more background to motivate our question and briefly discuss the various safety-net reforms. After discussing the data in the following section, we elaborate our empirical approach. A key to our DD analysis involves constructing our treatment and comparison groups, which in turn involves predicting the risk of adolescent disadvantage among the members of our sample. We discuss how we predict risk and how we construct the risk groups. The approach involves a number of decisions whose effect on our results is impossible to gaugeex ante. We discuss the specification-curve approach to inference ofSimonsohn et al. (2020), which allows us to draw inferences across the multiple specifications that result from those decisions.Section 4also presents our results, which show that safety-net reform increased men’s schooling, although it may have reduced it among women. It also provides evidence on employment and enrollment behavior.Section 5discusses the role of resource and expectations channels and offers suggestions for why our results run contrary to recent studies that have analyzed individual components of the safety net.",Jacob,Luorao,Jeffrey
"1. IntroductionGood teachers are an important input to schooling.1Still, most teacher labor markets are characterized by problems to recruit and retain talented teachers (Bacolod, 2007,Corcoran, Evans, Schwab, 2004,Fredriksson, Öckert,Grönqvist, Vlachos, 2016,Leigh, Ryan, 2008). The compressed wage distribution—relative to other occupations—is often put forth as a primary driving force behind these problems, pointing to a greater need for policy-makers to find ways to tie the pay structure more closely to teacher quality.There are several ways to make teacher compensation more responsive to teacher skills (seeJackson, 2012for a discussion). In this paper we study how the teacher labor market is affected by improved career opportunities, taking advantage of a uniquepromotionprogram for Swedish teachers. In response to deteriorating results in international comparisons likePISAand TIMMS, the Swedish government introduced a career step for experienced and skilled teachers by providing separate funding for a new position called ‘career teachers’ (Regeringen, 2013b). Career teachers receive a substantial monthly wage increase (5000 SEK (520 USD), which corresponds to nearly 20 percent of mean pre-reform wages) and continue to teach, but are also tasked to work with the school’s pedagogical development, like being a mentor or initiating and leading development projects (Statskontoret, 2015a).The intention of the program was to improve student outcomes by motivating, retaining and attracting high quality teachers (Regeringen, 2013b). While similar types of career steps also exist in England, New Zealand, Australia, Scotland and Poland (Regeringen, 2013c), we know little about their impact on teachers and students.Due to budgetary constraints, the career teacher reform was rolled-out over four years, and the number of career teacher positions increased gradually. School districts could apply for funding for the career teacher positions, which was allocated in proportion to student population. School districts had discretion to assign career teacher positions to individual schools within the district, and at the schools it was delegated to the local principals to identify and recruit skilled teachers to the new position.2In a descriptive analysis of who was promoted, the most salient pattern is that promotions within schools were given to teachers from the higher wage deciles of a compressed wage distribution, conditional on observable teacher characteristics and schoolfixed effects. We also show that promoted teachers received the stipulated wage increase. Thus, the reform increased wage dispersion both across and within schools, and there is no indication of compensatory behavior towards non-promoted teachers in regular wage negotiations.3We then address two central questions: Is there an effect of the career step on teachers’ separations from their school, and from the profession overall, and is there an effect on the composition of teachers?Because most school-districts participate in the reform from the start, we estimate the impact of the new career opportunities using school-level variation, rather than school district-level variation, in the appointment of career teachers in a difference-in-differences strategy that compares school-level outcomes in schools that have at least one career teacher to schools that do not (never or yet) have career teachers. An empirical challenge with our approach is that school districts haveautonomyover the allocation of career teacher positions across schools and we lack information about their assignment rules. Our main identifying assumption is that thetimingof the introduction of career teachers across schools is unrelated to trends or school-level shocks that affect teacher separations. In line with this assumption, we show empirically that no observable factors beside the number of students systematically influence schools’ timing of the introduction of career teachers within school-districts. Thus, even if school districts were free to allocate the promotions across schools, they did not target the promotions to schools with, for example, high teacher turnover or lowstudent performance. To further assess the validity of the identifying assumption, we also perform an event-study analysis to rule out pre-participation trend differences in wages and separation rates between teachers in promoting and non-promoting schools. Finally, we show that our results are robust to a battery of robustness checks, including specifications that account for school-district-level trends and shocks through school-district by year fixed effects.Our results suggest, once schools introduce career teacher promotions, there is a reduction in teacher turnover, both in general and in terms of teachers leaving the profession. This result is driven mainly by more senior teachers and applies both to teachers who were promoted and to those who were not promoted. In addition, the teaching pool improves in schools that participate in the reform as they are able to retain a higher share of certified and experienced teachers and teachers who themselves have higher compulsory school grades.Our findings contribute to the policy debate about how to improve school quality by tightening the link between teacher pay and performance. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first assessment of the effectiveness of performance-based promotions. Most of the previous literature has focused either on smaller bonus programs (e.g.Clotfelter et al., 2008) or generalsalaryincreases (e.g.Falch, 2011,Figlio, 1997,Gilpin, 2012,Hendricks, 2014,Leigh, 2012). Two recent studies consider the impact of changes from fixed to more flexible pay schemes.Biasi (2021)finds higher effort and teacher quality in school districts in Wisconsin that start to pay high-quality teachers more, compared to districts retaining more rigid pay schemes. In contrast,Willén (2021)finds no support for changes in teacher composition or student outcomes when individualized wage setting was introduced to teachers in Sweden in the 1990s.Besides providing mixed results, these studies highlight the difficulties for policy-makers to achieve a widening of the wage distribution through more local autonomy over teacher pay.4The promotion program we study is different from these flexible pay reforms in several aspects: First, the stipulated wage-increase is financed by earmarked funding from the central government, putting no strain on the local budget. Second, it restricts the number of teachers that can be promoted, preventing principals to raise wages for everyone. Third, the promoted teachers partly have new responsibilities, which could make differential pay seem more acceptable. Consistent with this notion, we find that nearly all school districts chose to participate in the promotion program and that the reform had the intended first-stage impact on the actual wage distribution.Finally, drawing on survey data for around a third of the school districts, we are able to shed some light on how the impact of the promotions vary with the local design of the career teacher positions. These results suggest that the local design matters, in that teaching development appears more important than coaching and mentoring in reducing school separations and exits from the profession. Hence, our results indicate that increasing pay alone may not be enough to get the desired impact onteacher selection.The paper proceeds as follows. It begins by describing the career teacher reform and the data inSection 2.Section 3describes the empirical strategy, andSection 4presents results on how the career teacher reform impacts teacher turnover and teacher composition.

"1. IntroductionIn this paper, we examine the effect of servitization on within-establishment wageinequality. We define servitization as the increase in the share of workers with service occupations in total employment within establishments. For our analysis, we use disaggregated German matched employer-employee data covering the years from 1994 to 2017. The time period is not only marked by pronounced shifts in the labor composition at the establishment level toward workers in service occupations. We also observe distinct wage growth and dispersion of wages across different occupation-skill groups and an economy-wide increase in wage inequality by approximately 12% during the period of observation.We find that establishment-level servitization explains about 7% of the observed establishment-level increase in wage inequality in themanufacturing sectorduring the 1994 to 2017 period of observation. The current paper is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to identify establishment-level servitization as an additional cause of increasing wage inequality. Increasing wage inequality is the result of underlying heterogeneous wage responses by occupation groups as the occupational composition of establishments changes towards a higher share of service occupations. While servitization causes alower wagelevel for otherwise identical workers in almost all occupations, the wage decrease is particularly pronounced for low-skilled manufacturing workers and workers at the lower end of the wage distribution. For instance, wages for low-skilled workers with manufacturing occupations fall on average by 11% as the result of an increase in the establishment’s service share by onestandard deviation. Wages of workers in high-skilled manufacturing occupations decrease by merely 3%. Generally, the effects are more pronounced in the manufacturing sector than in theservice sector.Our paper is motivated by three stylized facts: (i) Structural change at the sectoral level has been identified as one of the main drivers of wage inequality.Blum (2008)reports that changes in the sectoral composition account for approximately 60% of the relative increase in the wages of skilled workers between 1970 and 1996. (ii) Recent research has shown that structural change is not only a sectoral phenomenon but also occurs at the firm (and even establishment) level.2In Germany, the share ofservice workersin the manufacturing sector increased by approximately 28% during the 1994 to 2017 period. In 2017, nearly 36% of the workers in the manufacturing sector held service occupations (Boddin and Kroeger, 2021a). (iii) As we show in the current paper, the lion’s share of wage inequality occurs within rather than across establishments. We show with a variance decomposition that 79% of residual wage variance occurs within establishments. It is thus natural to ask whether servitization drives establishment-level wage inequality.This paper contributes to the growing literature on wage inequality and its underlying causes in industrialized economies and in Germany in particular (cf.Dustmann et al. (2009)andCard et al. (2013)for seminal contributions). These studies report an increase in the wage dispersion which can partly be explained by changes in the labor composition within firms and assortative matching processes between workers and firms. Other potential causes of increasing wage inequality at the aggregate level include increasing trade and offshoring opportunities as well as automation.3Goldschmidt and Schmieder (2017), for instance, document that outsourcing contributes to about 9% of the increase in overall wage inequality for Germany since the 1980s.Recently, within-firm inequality has gained increasing attention. For the United States for instance,Song et al. (2019)attribute a third of the increase inincome inequalitybetween 1978-2013 to within-firm developments. For Korea,Kim and Konings (2019)show that a substantial share of wage inequality originates from within-establishment differences. Larger firms and those owned by international business groups exhibit higher inequality than smaller firms. For the UK,Mueller et al. (2017a)andMueller et al. (2017b)find that within-firm wage inequality increases in firm size, mainly because larger firms pay higher wages for employees at higher skill or hierarchy levels. For Germany,Antonczyk et al. (2010),Felbermayr et al. (2018), andBaumgarten et al. (2020)show that a large part of wage inequality stems from within establishments, a finding we confirm and build on here.So far, there are few studies that consider drivers of within-firm wage inequality even though it has been shown to have significant economic implications on workers’ performance and firms’ outcomes.Barth et al. (2012)show how performance pay may lead to within-firm wage inequality.Heyman (2005)studies how within-firm wage dispersion affects white collar workers’ wages. He finds that higher within-firm wage dispersion is associated with higher pay for workers in white collar occupations. Within-firm wage inequality that is not clearly associated with productivity differences across workers has adverse effects on firms’ output (Breza et al., 2018).As one potential driver of within-firm wage inequality,Smeets and Warzynski (2008)assess wage inequality between hierarchy levels within firms.Friedrich (2020)shows that recent trade shocks affected hierarchy structures within firms and hence the labor composition. This is associated with an increase in within-firm wage inequality. For Norway,Barth et al. (2020)show that the implementation of industrial robots raises within-firm wage inequality through higher wages for high-skilled workers relative to low-skilled workers. We add to this literature by establishing the firm’s labor composition as an important source of within-firm wage inequality, thereby connecting research on wage inequality to recent studies on structural change.4The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. InSection 2, we introduce the data. We then present stylized facts on wage inequality and wages in Germany inSection 3.Section 4introduces our empirical strategy and documents the effects of servitization on establishment-level wage inequality and, subsequently, on wages of occupation groups.Section 5concludes.

"1. IntroductionTechnological progress in the past few centuries has had an enormous impact on the labor market, shifting workers between occupations and sectors and changing the types of tasks workers are required to do. Even though it has been frequently argued that machines may eliminate human jobs altogether “rendering the population redundant”1, the labor force has been able to adapt to all these new technologies and employment-to-population ratios did not change much in the past. In fact, technological progress overall benefitted the society by increasing workers’ productivity and wages and requiring workers to do less repetitive and strenuous work. The transitions, however, may not always have been easy for workers with specialized skills that suddenly became obsolete or not competitive with new machines or other workers. The transitions were likely most difficult for older workers, who had accumulated more specialized skills compared to their younger peers and who expected to spend a shorter time on the labor market to benefit from adopting the new technologies. When an older worker experiences the obsolescence of her skills, she may decide to retire earlier than she originally planned.In this paper we focus on a particular innovation: computerization, arguably the most important technological change of our era, and we estimate how it affected the labor market outcomes of older workers during the last 35 years from a longitudinal perspective that emphasizes the potential mismatch between the computer-related skills possessed by workers and the skills needed to carry out the tasks demanded by employers of workers in those occupations. Our main research question is: “How has the advance of computer technology and the introduction of personal computers (PCs) and the Internet since the 1980s affected the decisions of older workers about retirement and the length of working life in those occupations that use computers most intensively relative to workers in less computer intensive jobs and why?” We define the state of computer technology broadly to include the current capabilities of existing types of hardware (e.g., mainframes, PCs, mobile phones); software including word processors, spreadsheets, statistical programs, graphics programs; storage includingfloppy disks, hard drives, cloud; internet bandwidth; connectivity and communication through the internet, etc.Over time the astounding increases in CPU speed, storage capacity and communication speeds has enabled a proliferation of ways of producing new and existing products and services which, in turn, has had major effects on the distribution of employment and wages across occupations.Autor et al. (2003)argue that these changes stem from the fact that worker productivity depends on the set of tasks required by their job and that the productivity of computers and software depends on the tasks that computer routines can be programmed to carry out. The impact of computerization on the distribution of employment and wages depends on both supply-side effects on worker productivity and demand-side factors that influence own- and cross-elasticities of demand for labor of each type.Computerization affected birth cohorts at different part of their life cycles. We define “Retiree Cohorts” as those birth cohorts who were first affected by computerization on the labor market, after they finished their formal education. By 2017 people who had reached age 65 and thus were eligible for both Social Security and Medicare benefits were born in 1952. These people reached high schoolgraduationat age 18 in 1970 at a time when mainframe computers were just beginning to be used for scientific and accounting work in large organizations. This implies that nearly all Americans born before 1952 who were observed to retire before 2017—that is, nearly all Americans who have ever retired—finished their high school degree before computerization became a significant influence in the job market. In addition, as we show in this paper, the introduction of the IBM PC in 1982 and shortly after by the Internet was associated with an acceleration of computer use at work and home. This cohort perspective implies that the human capital developed by these Retiree Cohorts during their education and early careers may have been poorly suited for jobs that required the use of computers. Facing competition from younger cohorts, we show that members of the Retiree Cohorts who did not learn to use computers in occupations in which computer use was prevalent suffered wage decreases which reduced their incomes and the marginal value of work. In effect, computerization was a form of creative destruction that imposed a loss of the value of human capital on members of the Retiree Cohorts, likely lowering the capital value of the lifetime earnings of the Retiree Cohorts through obsolescence of their human capital, while creating new opportunities for younger cohorts.To our knowledge, the literature on the growinginequalityof wages and the polarization of the job market has not addressed the implications of computerization for the labor market and retirement behavior of older workers.2However, the analysis in this paper is related to a wide range of theoretical and empirical literature inlabor economicson inequality and polarization of occupations, education and wage.In the empirical part of this paper, we first track the fraction of workers who used computers and the Internet at work and at home between 1984 and 2017 in detailed occupation and age groups, using the computerization supplements of the Current Population Survey (CPS). We measure the size of the computerization shock by the gap between the fraction of younger and older workers in a given year and occupation who used computers at work. We show that this “knowledge gap” tended to be larger in highly skilled occupations that were computerized earlier, but importantly it was temporary, and it largely disappeared by 2017, as computer use among older workers and younger workers converged. We made this knowledge gap measure available online and it can be merged to other datasets.3We hypothesize that the knowledge gap signaled a pressure on older workers at the time to either adopt the new technology or to leave these jobs or the labor market altogether. Then we test how the knowledge gap affected the labor market outcomes of older workers at the time when it affected their own occupation and birth cohort using millions of observations from the CPS, and additional data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Our empirical models use time-series variation in computerization for identification. A growing recent literature has used occupation measures, based on the O*NET or the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT), to study how workers’job characteristicsaffected their labor market outcomes. These measures, however, only provide cross-sectional variations based on the workers’ occupations. We, instead, directly control for skill and timefixed effectsin our models. These specifications hold workers’ skills constant and compare birth cohorts that were affected by computerization at different times in their careers, while controlling forgeneral economicconditions with year fixed effects.We find strong evidence that computerization (i.e. the knowledge gap) temporarily shortened the working lives of older workers and it decreased their wages. The main results of the paper are robust to many methodological assumptions, such as the definition of “skills,” the type of control groups, or the use of control variables. We also look at other outcomes, such as transitions into less skilled occupations, and into part-time jobs; or being depressed. Finally, we also carry out detailed subgroup analysis, to understand if the effect of computerization varied bydemographics(such as gender) or job types. Our paper starts inSection 2with a brief overview of the history of computerization and the relevanteconomic theoryabout how it may affect retirement.Section 3introduces the CPS and the HRS datasets that we use in this project.Section 4presents our main empirical results, andSection 5concludes.",Péter,Robert,None
"1. IntroductionGender differencesinlabour force participation, education andpolitical participationhave narrowed in recent decades. Despite these significant advances, gender disparities in the labour market remain large.1This is particularly evident in top leadership positions, where women continue to be severely under-represented and where gender wage gaps remain substantial. To address these issues, many European countries such as Norway, Italy, Belgium and France have passed laws introducing gender quotas in the corporate boards of directors of publicly-listed firms.2In this paper, we investigate if greater female representation in top management positions raises relative female employment and wages in the rest of the firm. In other words, does having more women with decision-making power at the top of the firm hierarchy lead to improved outcomes for women further down the firm hierarchy?To answer this question, we first construct a stylised model of statistical discrimination. We model firms as organisations with distinct hierarchical layers. Within each layer individuals perform tasks that vary in complexity. Hiring andpromotiondecisions for the individuals in each layer are taken by managers higher up in the firm hierarchy. Managers only have imperfect information about potential candidates since their skills are only partly observed at the point of making these decisions.3We introduce gender differences by allowing agents in the model, i.e. workers and their managers, to be one of two types: male or female. Following the recent work of (Flabbi et al., 2019), we assume that female managers assess the skills of other females with greater precision compared to male managers. Under the plausible assumption that profits from a worker-job match are concave in workers’ skills, our model predicts that female managers are relatively more likely to hire and promote female candidates. Consequently, a greater share of women in a given layer increases the share of women hired and promoted in the adjacent subordinate layer, which in turn affects the next layer below. As such, the impact of higher female representation at the top of the firm on gender gaps may trickle down the firm hierarchy. The extent of these trickle-down effects is determined by exogenousjob turnoverand promotion rates within firms.We then test our model’s predictions empirically by estimating the effect of the share of women on corporate boards on gender gaps at each layer of the firm hierarchy using French administrative data. To do so, we exploit a 2010 reform imposing gender quotas on corporate boards in France. This law, called theLoi Copé-Zimmerman, mandated publicly-traded firms to have at least 20%women on the board of directors by the 1st of January 2014 and 40%by the 1st of January 2017.4Firms that failed to comply with the reform would have been fined, dissolved or banned from paying existing directors. Crucially, the implementation of theLoi Copé-Zimmermangenerates instruments for the share of women on corporate boards, which is likely endogenous. Following (Ahern and Dittmar, 2012) and (Bertrand et al., 2018), we instrument the shares of female board members using the share of female board members in 2010, the year prior to the implementation of the reform. The intuition behind ourinstrumental variablestrategy is simple: companies that started with a lower share of women on their board have had to increase their share of women relatively more to comply with the quota.We find that, consistent with the predictions of our model, a rise in female board membership (layer 1) narrows gender wage and employment gaps at the top layers of the firm, namely among senior executives and professionals (layer 2) as well as among middle management (layer 3). For instance, an increase in the share of women on corporate boards by 10 percentage points (pp) has a statistically significant effect of raising the share of women by 2.4 and 2.5 pp in layers 2 and 3 respectively. In addition, it lowers the gender wage gap in layer 2 significantly by approximately 2.4 percent.In our analysis of the reform period, we find that no statistically significant impact is observed on gender and representation gaps at the lowest layer (layer 4), which comprises of administrative, sales, security and blue-collar workers. To explore the extent of trickle-down effects to lower layers in the long term, we run a panel vector auto-regression analysis (P-VAR) on our data from 1999 to 2016. We find that even over a ten-year period, an increase in female board share has limited trickle-down effects on the lowest layers of the firm. A counterfactual exercise using the estimates from our P-VAR suggests that an increase in the share of women in middle management (layer 3) would have a greater impact on gender gaps at the lowest layer of the firm. As such, while corporate board quotas do mitigate gender gaps at upper layers of firms where these gaps are widest, other policies should be considered if the aim is to improve the labour market outcomes of a broader section of women.We make two main contributions in this paper. First, we construct a theoretical model, which formalizes how an increase in female representation at the top of the firm hierarchy can affect gender-specific outcomes such as gender wage gaps and representation gaps at lower layers. Second, we contribute to the literature by studying the impact of gender quota reforms on gender-specific outcomes at each hierarchical layer of the firm. Previous literature has highlighted that these changes have no statistically significant effects at the firm level. In contrast, we show that changes in gender quotas improving female representation at the top of the firm hierarchy have differing effects on gender-specific outcomes across the lower layers of the firm hierarchy.Related LiteratureA growing literature has focused on the role of female leadership in determining labour market outcomes for females, albeit with little consensus. One strand of this literature has identified a positive impact of female leadership on labour market outcomes of women. For instance,Cornell and Welch (1996)find that women in general are likely to be more sensitive to the issue of gender representation, discriminate less and be able to better assess their female co-workers relative to men. In the corporate setting, authors including (Cardoso and Winter-Ebmer, 2010),Bhide (2019),Cardoso and Winter-Ebmer (2010)andKunze and Miller (2017)have found a general positive impact of female leadership on the wages and representation of female subordinates. A similar literature in political economy has discussed the positive impact of female political leadership on gender bias (e.g.Beaman et al., 2009andGagliarducci and Paserman, 2012).On the other hand,Adams and Funk (2012)have presented evidence showing that women that do break the glass ceiling and make it into top management positions might behave as their male counterparts and may not necessarily have a positive impact on female labour market outcomes. Likewise, recent evidence from academic committees shows that having a higher share of women can have a negative effect on the probability that a woman is hired (Bagues, Sylos-Labini, Zinovyeva, 2017,Deschamps, 2018).We contribute to this on-going literature, both theoretically and empirically, by examining if a greater share of women on corporate boards significantly mitigates gender wage and representation gaps in firms. At a theoretical level, our work contributes to two strands of the literature. First, our model borrows from the literature oninternal labour markets(e.g.Pastorino, 2015) and from papers studying the role of female leadership in determining the gender-specific outcomes of subordinates (e.g.Flabbi et al., 2019). Specifically,Flabbi et al. (2019)propose a signal extraction model where employers have incomplete information about workers’ productivity, which is in turn influenced by their gender. They assume that executives are better-equipped to assess the skills of employees of the same gender. This is in line with recent works in the socio-linguistic literature (e.g.Canary et al., 2009andScollon et al., 2011) and survey evidence (e.g.Angier and Axelrod, 2014andEllison and Mullin, 2014) suggesting the presence of communication frictions between men and women at work. We adopt a similar framework in this paper. However, in our model, we allow for different managerial layers within firms and for the dynamic evolution of the gender composition in each layer. This helps us to endogenise potential trickle-down effects induced by changes at the top of the organisation on gender gaps across the rest of the firm hierarchy.Second, our work relates to a recent strand of the literature aimed at explaining the internal organisation of firms, the formation of hierarchies within firms as well as the assignment of workers across firm hierarchies (seeCaliendo, Monte, Rossi-Hansberg, 2015,Garicano, Van Zandt, 2012and references therein). Yet, this set of papers has so far abstracted from the role thatorganisational structurehas to play in determining gender-specific outcomes within firms. We complement this literature by exploring the role that organisational hierarchies play in propagating gender gaps.At an empirical level, our work relates to the literature examining the role of female representation on the board of directors on firm-level gender outcomes, exploiting two similar board quota reforms (seeBertrand et al., 2018for Norway andMaida and Weber, 2019for Italy).5Both these papers use a similar identification strategy, originally employed in (Ahern and Dittmar, 2012), and find no evidence ofspillover effectson the representation of women at the top on women in the rest of the firm.6We contribute to this strand of literature by distinguishing the effect of this policy at different hierarchical layers within the firm. In particular, we conjecture that since corporate board members are more likely to interact with workers at the upper layers of the firm hierarchy, the impact of board quota reform should be more pronounced at these upper layers. Furthermore, not only does the framework of internal firm hierarchies allow us to distinguish the differing effect of the policy on the top and the bottom layers of the firm but it also facilitates predictions on the trickle-down effects of such a reform.OutlineThe rest of the article is organised as follows. InSection 2, we present the administrative data used in the paper. InSection 3, we describe the reform. InSection 4, we present our theoretical model.Section 5introduces our empirical strategy and displays our empirical results. InSection 6, we conclude our analysis and discuss further avenues of research.",Nicolò,Aseem,Joanne
"1. IntroductionBoth policymakers and the general public are very interested in what makes for successful entrepreneurship. The general public hears and reads a great deal about entrepreneurship, following well-known figures like Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, Oprah Winfrey, and Sir Richard Branson as though they are inspirational and intellectual leaders. Policymakers follow entrepreneurs because, going beyond the general public, they wish to craft policy tools that foster entrepreneurial growth. And finally, it is important to note that entrepreneurs themselves, or those hoping to become entrepreneurs, are very interested in learning about what makes a great entrepreneur.There is, not surprisingly, a voluminous literature on entrepreneurship, aimed at identifying the traits of successful entrepreneurs. Thus, one must ask, what will this paper add to that literature? The literature has focused largely on the personal traits of entrepreneurs and less so on the successes of their businesses.1That is, researchers have looked at who becomes an entrepreneur and his/her motivations for doing so, not so much at what accounts for their success. This latter omission was driven to a considerable degree by a lack of data in the past. By and large, good data on entrepreneurial success has only become available fairly recently.2Our goal is to determine what factors are important in making a young person a successful entrepreneur. A founder is said to be successful when his or her firms have high sales, growing sales, or are highly productive. We use Danish data, which has been used previously to study other facets of entrepreneurship, but we focus on the sales of young firms over many years. We match to these sales data the personal traits of founders and their families. We will be following firms from allindustries, not just high-tech firms, for 2001-2016. We also go back to 1990 to define who is a serial entrepreneur.Our specific goals are to follow young entrepreneurs as they age, to compare the more successful entrepreneurs to their less successful counterparts, and to draw limited conclusions as to why some are much more successful. In anticipation of one key conclusion, one indicator of success is whether the young person becomes a serial entrepreneur, because serial entrepreneurs have higher sales than novice entrepreneurs, who are those who run only one firm. Our results are then interpreted, addressing whether serial entrepreneurs appear to be a select group of people, or whether the decision to open a second firm is endogenous to the first firm's success. In following young serial entrepreneurs, a second indicator of success is whether he or she evolves from running a first firm as a sole proprietorship (SP) to running a second firm that is an incorporated LLC firm. The LLC protects the founder from incurring personal debts and thus encourages risk-taking. And with family background data, we test whether afamily historyof entrepreneurship leads to running LLC firms.Our data is observational data – entrepreneurship is rarely studied in an experimental setting since it cannot be randomly imposed.3Therefore, we will make clear theeconometricchallenges that we face and the limitations of our conclusions. One methodology we use is personfixed effectsto follow the success of serial firms, holding fixed the innate unobserved quality of the founder. We also have a rich set of firm and personal characteristics, to interpret our results. Finally, we introduce firm fixed effects to follow the growth of firms as founders age. For novices who run only one firm, the growth of that firm is their way of succeeding.Given the focus on young entrepreneurs, we look to the literature on age and entrepreneurship, which is also quite large.Azoulay, et al. (2020)most recently show that most successful entrepreneurs found their companies when they are in their mid-40s. The hypothesis that successful entrepreneurs start later in life has been addressed in the past, butAzoulay, et al. (2020)have better data, using U.S. LBD data containing 2.7 million observations on founders for 2007-2014. Others who have looked atage effectshave also pointed out that very young people found firms less often than those closer to age 40.4Even when the focus of a research paper is not on age, the age implications surface. For example,Chen (2016)has good data on serial entrepreneurship and shows a very clear quadratic pattern in the effects of age on success.Though it has been shown elsewhere that the average age of founders is in their 40s, we show that the founder who starts young can achieve the same, or even greater, success because the young founder invests in himself and in his firms. This paper watches these young entrepreneurs grow and improve over time, even though the average successful entrepreneur is middle-aged.5Since we aim to follow the evolution of young entrepreneurs as they age and as their firms grow, we want to permit small-firm entrepreneurs to enter our data, and therefore we require a broad definition of an entrepreneurial firm. We define an entrepreneur as a person who runs a firm that has a minimal level of revenue liable to theValue Added Tax(VAT). We include SPs but exclude “hobby firms” that don't have revenue or employees.Another reason we use the broadest possible definition of entrepreneurship is that governments making policy decisions to support entrepreneurship, like in U.S. and Europe, care about the founders of small firms. For example, entrepreneurs who run small firms in the U.S. may sell their products through Etsy, which is a website that offers a huge range of products made by people who craft each product individually. Also, these small-firm entrepreneurs may be raising money for themselves through Kickstarter, which is a website that allows people to request and aggregate very small amounts of money from a lot of people.From a traditional economics literature perspective, we are essentially estimating age-earnings profiles by following the implied earnings of young entrepreneurs as they age. Our measure of success is the revenue and productivity of their firms, not personal wage income, but the growing productivity of firms translates into growing incomes for their founders. Whether wage or entrepreneurial income, income is growing in a concave profile with age: wage-earners move to higher paying firms with age and entrepreneurs open second firms or grow their first firms. Also, the large and long-standing literature on traditional age-earnings profiles, based on wage income, has made clear the issues of selectivity and endogeneity that hamper clear conclusions, and those issues are relevant here. At the end of this paper, we will return to the traditional age-earnings literature to briefly draw analogies between what we have learned and what others learned.The outline of the paper is as follows.Section 2presents the theoretical and empirical frameworks for the regressions to be estimated.Section 3describes the data and presentsdescriptive statistics.Section 4displays data distributions of sales for different subgroups that we study later.Section 5estimates the basic sales and productivity regressions, withSection 6introducing tests for growing sales with age.Section 7examines the gains to incorporation, and also the growing incorporation rates with age.Section 8adds information on family background, to see how families might shape the success of the young.Section 9shows that success in sales for all subgroups of firms depends on having a small number of firms with enormously high sales, an outcome that policymakers want when they encourage founders to start firms. The conclusion then follows.",Kathryn,Anders,None
"1. IntroductionThe measurement of scientists’ productivity as a function of age dates back at least toDennis (1956). Scientists accumulate experience, reputation, and a professional network, but their productivity decreases because of age-related factors (Barrett and Riddell, 2016,Desjardins and Warnke, 2012,Green and Riddell, 2013,Skirbekk, 2004).1Young scientists stand on the shoulders of their older counterparts but are healthier, strongly incentivized, easily adopt new technology and methods, and are likely to generate novel concepts (Weinberg and Galenson (2019)).2However, influence is not the same as productivity. Although scientists become less innovative as they age, the number of their papers in highly cited journals and among highly cited papers continues to rise (Cui and Zhong, 2013,Gingras et al., 2008,Rauber and Ursprung, 2008).3Thus, it may be asked whether the influence of scientists reflects the Matthew effect of accumulated advantage, where “the rich get richer and the poor get poorer” (Allison et al., 1982,Ek and Henrekson, 2019), or whether it reflects a non-monotonic trend.The question in this paper is what does the average relationship between age and influence of leading economists look like. Our motivation is beautifully illustrated by the example of Gary Becker.Fig. 1shows Becker’s publications and citations by year of publication and by year of citation. Becker had three particularly productive periods in terms of the number of publications: in his mid-40s, in his early 60s, and in his late 70s. The most frequently cited papers were published during the first of the three peaks. However, the number of citations took off only when he was in his 60s.Download :Download high-res image (437KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. Publications and citations of Gary Becker. Note: The figure presents the 5-year moving average of Gary Becker’s publications and citations, listed on his RePEc author page, by Becker’s age.Becker (1962)predicted that “The next few years should provide much stronger evidence on whether the recent emphasis placed on the concept of human capital is just another fad or a development of great and lasting importance.” Thehuman capital theorywas motivated by the contemporary economic growth (Weiss (2015)), but the rise of its influence was also affected by external factors, i.e., emergence of high-quality microdata and cheap computational power, which led to the development of structuraleconometricmethods and from there to an enormous body of empirical work based on Becker’s theory.4Accordingly, Becker received the Nobel Prize in 1992 at age 62.The external factors that can explain the time lag between Becker’s most influential publications and their citations do not apply to all leading economists. Yet arguments with respect to the effect of external factors are made inJones and Weinberg (2011), who write that “age creativity relationship varies substantially more over time than across fields,” inChiappori and Levitt (2003),Jones et al. (2014),Azoulay et al. (2010), and inReschke et al. (2018). Moreover,Aizenman and Kletzer (2011)find that although deceased authors lose potential citations (an observation that shows that citing is a strategic decision), influence of Fischer Black and Amos Tversky soared posthumously, indicating the role of external factors.5Our second observation comes from comparison between disciplines. InFig. 2, we compare Nobel laureates in economics to Nobel laureates in physics and literature. The horizontal axis is the age at the time of receipt of the Nobel (the figure considers prizes awarded from 1990 to 2019). The vertical axis for laureates in economics and physics is the number of years since Ph.D.graduationand for laureates in literature it is the number of years since publication of the first book. The figure shows that the distribution of ages at the time of receipt of the Nobel varies across disciplines. All Nobelists in economics except Esther Duflo were at least 50 years old. Nobelists in literature had a similar age range as economists but a wider range of experience. By contrast, a significant number of Nobelists in physics were younger than 50 and had less than 20 years of experience, even if some Nobelists in physics were very old, including the oldest person ever to receive the prize. In this sense, economists are more similar to writers than to physicists. In our context, the lack of young Nobelists in economics indicates uncertainty about the influenceof economic research. This observation refers to the discussion inFriedman (1953)about similarity (and dissimilarity) of economics and physics, which is essentially the question whether economics is “story telling” rather than a positive science. What makes the reference to Friedman’s essay even more intriguing is the fact that it was published fifteen years before the Nobel prize in economics was even established. Yet decades of Nobel Committee’s decisions perfectly fit Friedman’s hypothesis.Download :Download high-res image (167KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 2. Age and experience: Nobel laureates in economics, literature, and physics. Note: The figure covers Nobel Prizes awarded from 1990 to 2019. The level of experience for Nobel laureates in economics and physics is the number of years since Ph.D. graduation. The level of experience for Nobel laureates in literature is the number of years since publication of the first book or the equivalent.Our research design departs from the dynamics of influence within a closed group of leading economists. The approach is to consider the overall influence as a constant term that is distributed between top authors. We aim at the identification of the intergenerational competition. We employ to this end a rich and systematic database of RePEc6monthly rankings. We estimate the gradient of the rankings with respect to age when we control for individualfixed effectsandautoregressionof the residuals.7RePEc calculates the 37 rankings from its data on citations, publications, journal pages, abstract views, downloads, scientific network, and number of students. The citations and the publications are measured by a set of indices, which use different weighting schemes along the quantity / quality/ coauthorship/ time lag dimensions. Constrained by the RePEc policy of publishing explicit rankings of only top 5% of its members, the agents that we analyze are economists that are continuously included in this group. Yet this group is not small. The largest possible (in terms ofN×T) balanced panel that can be constructed from these data consists of 1,335 economists who are ranked over 100 months.We find that the relationship of rankings with age follows a U-shape, where the lowest point indicates the best ranking. This “optimal” age is 60, which corresponds to around 30 years after Ph.D. graduation.8Therefore, our results indicate that a twenty-year lag between peak of productivity, which is around age 40 (Cui and Zhong, 2013,Gingras et al., 2008, andRauber and Ursprung (2008)), and peak of influence, discussed above for the case of Garry Becker, is the average pattern among leaders.In the empirical analysis, we distinguish between Nobelists and other top RePEc members. The Nobel Prize is an external recognition of the scientist’s “unquestionable” influence (Hirsch (2005)), independent of RePEc. It is therefore not easy to find a proper comparison group for the Nobel laureates. A natural comparison group would be the nominees who did not win the prize (Baffes and Vamvakidis (2011)), but this data is released with a 50-year lag. Therefore, we take an advantage of the fact that in RePEc data, Nobel laureates can be consistently compared to top non-Nobelists.9We find that differently from other leaders, current and future Nobelists do not experience a U-shaped relationship of age with rankings for indices of the number of works and citations discounted by recursive impact factor. That is to say, the marginal effect of age on their rankings does not deteriorate with age. Moreover, for breadth of citations across fields, the marginal effect of age on Nobelists’ rankings improves with age.10The rest of the paper is organized as follows. InSection 2, we introduce the data and providedescriptive statistics. InSection 3, we describe the estimation procedure. InSection 4, we present the results.Section 5concludes.",Pavel,Yoram,None
"1. IntroductionSince the seminal work ofBadgett (1995), a large bodyof economics literaturehas developed documenting the differences in labour market outcomes faced by those with minority sexual orientations.1In contrast, the economics literature has remained relatively silent on the economic outcomes of transgender individuals – a minority group which is estimated to represent 1.4 million (0.6%) adults in the US alone (Flores et al., 2016). “Assigned sex” refers to the designation of a person, typically at or before birth, as either male or female while “gender identity” refers to an individuals’ deepest sense of self as being male, female, or another gender. Where a persons’ assigned sex and gender identity conform, they are said to be cisgender. For example, a cisgender man is a person assigned male at birth who identifies as a man/male. I use the term transgender (‘trans’) in its broadest sense to refer to anyone whose gender identity and/or gender expression differs from the sex they were assigned at birth.Societal awareness of the transgendercommunityhas increased in recent years, with transgender representation throughout popular media becoming more common (GLAAD, 2019,McInroy, Craig, 2015). There has been a similar increase in public policy discussions and legal debates on issues which impact the lives of transgender people, and the US Supreme Court recently ruled to outlawemployment discriminationon the basis of gender identity (Bostock v. Clayton County, 2020).2A small qualitative literature has documented the lives of transgender people, but these public policy discussions have occurred with relatively little quantitative social science evidence to inform them.Schilt and Lagos (2017)draw a parallel with the use of social science research in legal debates around gay rights in the US and point out the need for additional quantitative research to shed light on the lives of transgender people in order to direct these public policy discussions.The study of the transgender population offers a unique opportunity to researchers interested in theeconomics of gendermore broadly. Many in the transgender community have the rare experience of being perceived as male and as female at different times in their lives. These life experiences offer researchers a kind of quasi-natural experiment to explore how the economic outcomes of an individual changes as society’s perceptions of their gender switches. However, quantitative research on the transgender population has been hampered by a lack of data sources. This paper is among the few to analyse empirically the relationship betweenminority genderidentity status and labour market outcomes. I contribute to the existing literature by providing new descriptive evidence on the associations between transgender identity and labour market outcomes using the 2015 United States Transgender Survey (USTS).The USTS is the largest and most detailed social survey of transgender adults ever conducted with over 27,000 respondents.3This large sample size, together with the USTS’ exceptionally detailed gender identity information allows me to analyse and compare the labour market outcomes of four separate minority gender groups: (1) MTFs (‘male-to-female’, trans women); FTMs (‘female-to-male’, trans men); (3) AMAB GQNBs (assigned male at birth, genderqueer non-binary identifying); and (4) AFAB GQNBs (assigned female at birth, genderqueer non-binary identifying).4The USTS contains much richer data on the lives and transition experiences of transgender people than earlier studies, allowing me to explore potential underlying mechanisms for differences in labour market outcomes among sub-groups of transgender individuals.I use the 2015 American Community Survey (ACS) sample to estimate income and employment gaps between the wider non-transgender population and each of the minority gender identities in the USTS. Compared with similarly situated ACS men, all trans groups have significantly lower incomes, are more likely to be living near or below thepovertyline, unemployed and, conditional on being in employment, are more likely to be working part-time.Across transgender groups, income is negatively correlated with trans people who have transitioned but do not ‘pass’ as their gender identity. Next, I estimate outcome gaps between the two main transgender categories: (1) genderqueer non-binary people who were assigned male or female at birth (i.e. AMAB GQNBs and AFAB GQNBs) and (2) trans men and trans women (i.e. FTMs and MTFs). I find that, within each of these groups, those who were assigned female at birth (AFAB) have lower incomes and are more likely to be in part-time work than their similarly situated counterparts who were assigned male at birth (AMAB).The USTS sample contains a diverse range of trans people with a wide range of information on respondents’ gender identity, life experiences, and stage of transition. To my knowledge, this is the first paper to use this information and explore some of the potential reasons for differences in the labour market outcomes of trans people. I identify significant heterogeneity in the outcomes of trans people by their transition status, the degree to which they are ‘out’ as transgender, and the age at which they began living as their current gender identity rather than their assigned sex.I find that the incomes of those in the trans (FTM and MTF) group are sensitive to the age at which they transition or begin living full-time as their gender identity. Transitioning to living full-time as your gender identity at a younger age is associated with higher incomes for FTMs and lower incomes for MTFs. Thus, the younger trans people transition, the more their income profiles reflect their gender identity rather than the sex they were assigned at birth. These results provide descriptive evidence in support of a traditional cisgender pay gap, with ‘maleness’ being associated with an income premium over ‘femaleness’ in the workplace. Overall, the results of this paper demonstrate that quantitative research which treats the transgender population in a monolithic way risks concealing the significant heterogeneity associated with the economic outcomes of different minority gender identities and sub-groups within each identity group.",Matthew,None,None
"1. IntroductionUnderstanding the mechanisms of intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic status is key for the design of policies aimed at promoting equal opportunities. SinceBecker (1973), parental human capital has been considered to be the engine of intergenerational transmission of advantage.1Parental assortativematingin education – the tendency for individuals with the same education to mate with one another more frequently than would be expected under a random mating pattern – can also affect intergenerational transmission by generating segmentation in the distribution of parental human capital. This segmentation results in an increasing share of households characterized by high (or low) levels of human capital for both parents, so parental sorting can act as an amplifier of intergenerational persistence in human capital (Doepke et al., 2019).In this paper, we study the contribution of parental educational sorting to the intergenerational transmission of human capital. We develop an empirical model of educational correlations within the family in which human capital of parents is generated by factors shared between parents due to assortative mating, some of which can be fully transferred to children, while other factors are not passed on to children. In addition, each parent may transmit human capital independently to their children due to factors that are not shared with the co-parent. Therefore, in our model intergenerational persistence can arise both from the joint contribution of the parents and from the independent contributions of each parent.We estimate the model using educational attainment from Danish population-based administrative data for over 400,000 families. Identifying the contribution of parental assortative mating to the intergenerational transmission of human capital is achieved by exploitingfamily quartetscomposed of two parents and two children. We find that about 75 percent of the intergenerational correlation in education is driven by thejoint contributionof the two parents, while theindependent transmissionfrom each parent is only one sixth of the size of the joint parental contribution, with father-specific transmission being larger for sons, and mother-specific transmission being larger for daughters. This pattern suggests that most of the persistence in educational attainment is due to factors that both parents share and transmit to theiroffspring.Exploring trends over time, we document that parental assortative mating in Denmark has declined by 38 percent for parents born between 1920 and 1952.2While the raw correlations also show decreases in father- and mother-specific intergenerational transmissions of educational attainment, our model shows that once we decompose all factors of intergenerational mobility, the share of intergenerational transmission accounted for by parent-specific factors increased from 7 to 27 percent. This increase in parent-specific intergenerational transmission reflects a corresponding fall in joint intergenerational transmission from both parents, leaving total intergenerational persistence unchanged. The nature of intergenerational transmission is changing, with a growing importance of one-to-one parent-child relationships.This finding about the nature of intergenerational transmission can, in part, be explained by the increase in the time parents have been spending with their children over recent decades in Denmark and across other western countries, especially on activities enhancing child human capital potential with an increasing involvement of fathers (e.g.,Sandberg and Hofferth, 2001;Sayer et al., 2004;Guryan et al., 2008;Gimenez-Nadal and Sevilla, 2012;Sani and Treas, 2016). The composition of parental time with children has also changed with the emergence of intensive parenting, including activities in which both parents spend time together with their children (joint family time) but also activities in which children are spending time with only one of the parents (Craig et al., 2014).This paper relates to a growing literature in economics on the relationship between assortative mating and intergenerational transmission. One strand of the literature focuses on educational sorting in theoffspring generation, taking the view that non-random sorting among offspring might affect measures of intergenerational mobility, slowing down regression to the mean in socioeconomic status between parents and children (e.g.,Chadwick and Solon, 2002;Ermisch et al., 2006;Holmlund, 2020).Another strand of the literature, which is closer to our study, examines the effect of sorting in theparental generationon the socioeconomic status of the offspring generation. Although this literature has mostly focused oninequality(e.g.,Fernández and Rogerson, 2001;de la Croix and Doepke, 2003,Fernández et al., 2005;Bratsberg et al., 2018), the influence of parental sorting on intergenerational mobility may be even more important than on inequality (e.g.,Kremer, 1997). Nevertheless, the empirical evidence on the link between parental sorting and intergenerational mobility is still limited. Among the few existing studies,Güell et al. (2015), exploit the joint distribution of surnames and economic outcomes and provide evidence of a decrease in intergenerational mobility in Catalonia throughout the 20thcentury, suggesting the increase in assortative mating to be an important driver of this secular fall in intergenerational mobility.Collado et al. (2019), exploit extended families to infer the characteristics of multi-generational transmission and find a predominant role of assortative mating for explaining intergenerational persistence.The empirical model of educational correlations within the family that we develop in our study contributes to this literature in three ways. First, we decompose parental assortative mating into intergenerational and intragenerational components, where only the former contributes to parent-child educational correlations. Second, we quantify how much parental assortative mating contributes to intergenerational persistence relative to factors that are passed on to children from each parent independently from the co-parent. Third, we trace out how the components of educational correlations within the family have evolved over time.The time evolution of the relative importance of joint versus parent-specific contributions is also related to the literature documenting the evolution of assortative mating, which concludes that changes in assortative mating over time have a limited impact on overallincome inequality(e.g.,Eika et al., 2019;Frémeaux and Lefranc, 2017). We contribute to this literature by showing that the impact of the declining importance of assortative mating for intergenerational transmission observed in Denmark is compensated by countervailing trends in parent-specific transmission of education to children, leaving total intergenerational persistence unchanged.The approach we propose in this paper is not without limitations. Most importantly, although it is intuitive to allow for joint versus parent-specific transmission of human capital, we cannot identify all the factors that can account for this distinction. Differences in parental time allocation and its evolution over time is one among several possible explanations. The model also focuses on overall trends of assortative mating without allowing for differences in marital sorting across educational groups; trends that have been found to differ both within and between countries. Our proposed model offers a decomposition of intergenerational persistence and assortative mating in education that complements other approaches in the literature.The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In the next section we describe the data source and provide a summary of raw statistics on the extent of intra-family correlations in education. InSection 3we outline theeconometricmodel of educational correlations of family members, while inSection 4we present the estimation results. InSection 5we provide a concluding discussion.",Paul,Lorenzo,Konstantinos

"1. IntroductionA long-standing finding in theinternational economicsliterature is that trade increases welfare and productivity through the reallocation of resources across firms,industries, and countries. In theory, although workers are displaced from industries affected by import competition, the long-run impact of openness to trade on employment could be non-negative as workers relocate to expanding industries (Melitz, 2003). However, the process by which firms adjust to increased import competition and the type of labor market frictions that workers face are likely to impact the adjustment process of workers, and have aprioriambiguous distributional implications for workers who differ by gender and skill (Acemoglu, Autor, Dorn, Hanson, Price, 2016,Autor, Dorn, Hanson, 2013,Autor, Dorn, Hanson, 2016,Dix-Carneiro, Kovak, 2019,Do, Levchenko, Raddatz, 2016,Galor, Weil, 1996,Goldberg, Pavcnik, 2007,Sauré, Zoabi, 2014,Weinberg, 2000).While numerous empirical studies have found that exposure to import competition leads to a long-term decline in the employment rates of low-educated men (Autor, Dorn, Hanson, 2013,Dix-Carneiro, Kovak, 2017,Ferreira, Leite, Wai-Poi, 2010), there is no consensus on the impacts of openness to trade on the demand for female workers or the gender gap in the labor market (Autor, Dorn, Hanson, 2019,Erten, Keskin, 2020,Gaddis, Pieters, 2017,Juhn, Ujhelyi, Villegas-Sanchez, 2014). Moreover, the evidence on the persistence of these effects over time is even more scarce (Dix-Carneiro, Kovak, 2019,Erten, Leight, Tregenna, 2019,McCaig, Pavcnik, 2018). In this paper, we add to this growing literature by providing novel evidence on the effects of import competition on the gender gap in employment andlabor force participationin Peru and examine differences of the labor market adjustments between male and female workers in the long-term.Our empirical strategy relies on China’s accession to theWorld Trade Organization(WTO) in 2001. It uses variation in exposure to Chinese imports across Peruvian provinces according to their initial industrial composition before China entered the global market (Autor, Dorn, Hanson, 2013,Dix-Carneiro, Kovak, 2017,Topalova, 2007). The mapping of trade shocks across local labor markets follows early studies byBartik (1991),Blanchard and Katz (1992), andBorjas and Ramey (1995), as well as more recent work on the labor market effects of trade liberalization in developing countries (Chiquiar, 2008,Gaddis, Pieters, 2017,Kovak, 2013,Topalova, 2007,Topalova, 2010), and on the labor market effects of Chinese imports competition on U.S. workers byAutor et al. (2013).1Unlike trade liberalization policies in other Latin American countries (such as Brazil or Mexico) or the United States, both male- and female-intensivemanufacturing industriesin Peru were exposed to a large influx of Chinese imports after 2001.While China’s entry into the global market was arguably unrelated to increased Peruvian demand for Chinese goods and did not coincide with other technological or productivity shocks domestically, we address any remaining endogeneity concerns using aninstrumental variablestrategy. Specifically, we use changes in Chinese imports of Peru’s neighboring countries or other upper-middle-income countries to instrument for changes in Peru’s imports from China (Autor et al., 2013). Furthermore, in contrast to much of the prior literature, we identify the industries that contribute the most to the variation in import exposure followingGoldsmith-Pinkham et al. (2020). In particular, we verify that the labor market shares of industries in trade-exposed markets are not correlated with other baseline local labor-market characteristics, such as the shares of female employment and college-educated people and the employment shares of the manufacturing and tradable sector.Our main results show that the persistence of the trade-induced employment effects differs by gender. We find that both female and male low-educated workers in markets with greater exposure to Chinese imports experienced large short-term employment losses. However, while the negative employment effects for men dissipate over time, the adverse effects on women’s employment and labor force participation are long-lasting. These results are robust to controlling for baselinedemographicand labor market characteristics and, key to our identification strategy, to the inclusion of pre-trends in these demographic and labor market characteristics between 1998 and 2001.The persistent impact of import competition on women’s employment reflectsgender differencesin labor market adjustments. Specifically, we find that between 1998 and 2008, the employment share of low-educated women in the tradable sector fell by an average of 3.7 percent following an average increase of $170 in import competition per worker. We also find that women adjusted to the new labor market conditions by either moving to the non-tradable sector or by leaving the labor force, resulting in only a partial sectoral reallocation. In stark contrast, we find no evidence of reallocation between the tradable and non-tradable sectors for male workers. Although men’s employment share in the tradable sector declines shortly after China’s entry, the negative employment effects do not persist over time, there is no evidence of sorting into the non-tradable sector, or a decline in their participation rate. Thus, the results indicate that men adjusted to the new labor market conditions by reallocating to expanding industries within the tradable sector.These reallocation results are robust to using an alternative set of instruments, controlling for a measure of export exposure, and excluding labor markets with a small number of observations or dropping Metropolitan Lima and the Constitutional Province of Callao. Furthermore, they are not explained by gender differences in workers’ migration patterns searching for better employment opportunities.Importantly, we also find that exposure to import competition shifts the composition of workers who continue to be employed. For instance, we provide evidence that the decline in the employment share of low-educated women is primarily driven by a decrease in informal employment without a corresponding increase in the formal sector.2In contrast, we find evidence that low-educated men reallocate from the informal to the formal sector in response to greater import competition, indicating improved labor market options.These results differ from prior studies in developing countries which have found that men working in import-exposed labor markets move to the informal sector or the non-tradable sector (Dix-Carneiro, Kovak, 2017,Ferreira, Leite, Wai-Poi, 2010,Menezes-Filho, Muendler, 2011). The results are also different compared to prior studies which have found no change in the employment gender gap in import-exposed markets (Autor, Dorn, Hanson, 2019,Dix-Carneiro, Kovak, 2019,Erten, Leight, Tregenna, 2019,Gaddis, Pieters, 2017,McCaig, Pavcnik, 2018), and studies which found that import competition increases the demand for female labor (Anukriti, Kumler, 2019,Erten, Keskin, 2020,Juhn, Ujhelyi, Villegas-Sanchez, 2014).In addition to providing novel evidence on gender differences in labor market reallocation, the paper contributes to the existing literature by investigating the mechanisms through which the impact of trade liberalization differs by gender. For example, our results are not consistent with a pro-competitive channel that increases the demand for high-educated workers (Acemoglu, 2002,Thoenig, Verdier, 2003,Topalova, Khandelwal, 2011), lowers the demand for physically intensive skills (Galor, Weil, 1996,Juhn, Ujhelyi, Villegas-Sanchez, 2014,Weinberg, 2000), or reduces the cost oflabor market discrimination(Becker, 1957,Black, Brainerd, 2004,Ederington, Minier, Troske, 2009,Standings, 1989). Instead, the results are consistent with a mechanism in which expanding industries in the tradable sector do not increase their demand for female workers either because of occupational gender segregation or imperfect substitutability between male and female workers (Do, Levchenko, Raddatz, 2016,Gaddis, Pieters, 2017).The paper proceeds as follows.Section 2provides a conceptual framework and reviews the existing literature.Section 3describes the data and defines local labor markets and the import competition shock.Section 4discusses our empirical strategy.Section 5reports the main results andSection 6discusses potential mechanisms.

"1. MotivationAn immense literature has examined the effects of beauty on labor-market outcomes and economic success more generally (summarized inHamermesh, 2011). This literature is still burgeoning, as shown by recent research on beauty and labor markets for the U.S. (Scholz and Sicinski, 2015;Monk et al., 2021), for Australia (Borland and Leigh, 2014), and for many other countries (Sierminska, 2015). Our question is whether these now very well-established findings also characterize the economic well-being of the most economically successful people on the planet—billionaires.To answer this question, in Section II we describe the sample of plutocrats, including explaining how we evaluated their attractiveness. Section III presents the analysis of the data that were developed, focusing on the relationship between the billionaires’ assets and their rated beauty and educational attainment, and controlling for other objective characteristics that might affect differences in net financial worth. In Section IV we present reasons explaining our results and offer another example, using the 2018 AmericanCommunitySurvey, that helps to rationalize the findings about billionaires and that illustrates a generaleconometricpoint.In a nutshell, our results show that a sample that is taken from the extreme tail of the dependent variable no longer exhibits the systematic patterns seen across the distribution. Billionaires are better-educated and better-looking than the general public. But among billionaires, attractiveness does not predictwealth. This finding has important implications for any empirical study where the sample is highly selected. Empirical regularities that are common in the general population may not hold up among atypical subsets of the population, whether drawn from the elite (e.g., Olympic athletes, Fortune 500 CEOs) or the most disadvantaged (e.g., prisoners, the homeless). Within these groups, outcomes are more likely to be due to unobservables and pure chance than observable traits.",Daniel,Andrew,None
"1. IntroductionLabour research has recognised the importance of discontinuity in the labour supply and the implications of it for wage estimation sinceHeckman (1979). Controls for the selection into labour force have become a standard element in wage estimations and are particularly important in estimating the wages of female employees. For women in contemporary economies, the supply of labour increasingly reflects their decision about the number of hours they spend on paid work, rather than the decision about whether or not to participate in the labour market.Blau and Kahn (2017)note that the wage and income elasticities of women declined substantially between 1980 and 2000, and they have approached the elasticities for men.A large literature on the gender wage gap has investigated the differences in the average wage rates and the wage distributions for men and women, with varying degrees of success in explaining the gap. The unexplained wage differentials, which are suspected to be due to gender wage discrimination, may still actually be due to other factors that have not been identified. A substantial part of the gender wage gap literature pursues wage decompositions, which separate the explained gap in the differences in productivity characteristics from the unexplained or discriminatory gap in the differences in returns to productivity characteristics (Oaxaca, 1973;Machado and Mata, 2005;Fortin et al., 2011;Firpo et al., 2009). The literature on wage decompositions focuses on productivity enhancing human capital endowments such as education and work experience that are used in the production process, and for which the price may vary substantially, depending on the frictions in labour supply and demand. Unlike human capital endowments, working hours are real and easily measurable units of work effort and have a more direct relationship to wages.O’Neill and O’Neill (2005)conclude that working time and effort have more power to explain the gender wage gap than thegender differencesin human capital endowments do.The recent literature on the gender wage gap has paid increasing attention to the entire wage distribution beyond the differentials in mean wages. The results show substantial heterogeneity in the gender wage gap across the wage distribution, but without unequivocal evidence for the part of the wage distribution with the most distinctive wage gap (Blau and Kahn, 2006;del Río et al., 2011;Kassenboehmer and Sinning, 2014;Selezneva and Van Kerm, 2016).The empirical evidence for how wage differentials are dependent on working hours is still limited, though the theoretical arguments for a nonlinear hour-wage relationship emerged several decades ago (Barzel, 1973;Moffitt, 1984). The likely reason why there is little empirical evidence on the relationship between wages and working hours is that the endogeneity of working hours adds more challenges to the bundle of empirical complications that are encountered in estimating wages (see alsoKunze, 2008).Tummers and Woittiez (1991),Wolf (2002)andGicheva (2013)explicitly estimate wages conditional on endogenous working hours, and all of them find that while wages depend on working hours, the estimated relationship varies in shape and strength across the hour-distribution.I investigate how the wages of men and women relate to working hours and whether the gender differences in wage-work-hour patterns offer further insights into the gender wage differentials. To do this I control simultaneously for non-random selection into labour market participation at the extensive margin of the labour supply, and into desired and actual working hours at the intensive margin, allowing for a quadratic functional relationship between wages and working hours.1The American Working Conditions Survey (2015) contains a representative sample of individuals who report their desired and actual working hours, their wage and their tenure, along with a number of workplace and individual background characteristics. In a simultaneous estimation framework with three dependent variables for wage, desired hours and actual working hours, I estimate the gender effect on thehourly wage rate.The paper continues with a literature review inSection 2, outlining the research foundations and findings on the relation of wages to working hours, and on how non-uniform distributions of working hours impact gender wage differentials.Subsection 2.3introduces the underlying model based onGoldin (2014)andAkerlof (1976).Section 3is in two parts, whereSubsection 3.1introduces the data sources, and describes the variables and the analysis sample with illustrative descriptive figures, whileSubsection 3.2presents theeconometricestimation approach.

"1. IntroductionIn many economies, unions and employer federations bargain skill-specific wage floors in collective contracts that are binding also for workers and employers not affiliated to any of the bargaining parties. For example, it is well known that the coverage of collective contracts in countries like France, Germany, Italy or Spain exceeds by far the fraction of workers affiliated to unions.1A literature assumes that as the whole structure of wages is bargained infrequently, collective contracts introduce widespread downward nominal andreal wagerigidity that, in turn, helps to propagate adversemacroeconomicshocks.2An alternative view of collective contracts is that they only bind for the set of workers whose earnings are close to the bargained wage floors without necessarily hampering the responses of the rest of wages to the business cycle.3However, the link between individual wages and wage floors set by collective agreements is not well known, mostly due to the unavailability of data. This study combines a novel dataset on more than 15,000 skill-specific wage floors and 1000 signature dates of collective contracts in the Italian and Spanish metalworkingindustrywith detailed longitudinal employment histories in Social Security data and proposes a way to test which of the models of the labor market is consistent with the evolution of worker’s earnings over the business cycle. Importantly, the wage setting institutions differ in their degree of centralization (complete in Italy, regional in Spain) and renegotiation frequency (fixed in Italy, variable in Spain). According toCalmfors and Driffill (1988)those aspects have dramatic implications on wage and employment outcomes.The test is the following. If collective contracts shaped the whole distribution of earnings, and those wages were completely rigid between renegotiation periods, then wage growth and the structure of wages should mainly reflect the labor market conditions back at the time when the prevailing collective contract was signed. A higher unemployment rate at the time of contract renegotiation would erode unions’bargaining powerby lowering their outside option so wages would be lower than in the case that labor market conditions had been more favorable. Conversely, if collective contracts affected only the earnings of workers close to the wage floors, the compensation of employees well above those minima should reflect contemporaneous labor market conditions. Hence, we assess the relevance of each model by regressing monthly earnings of workers on the current local unemployment rate and on the unemployment rate at the time of the collective contract renegotiation, allowing for heterogeneous responses depending on the distance between workers’ earnings and their corresponding wage floor -and controlling for individual and establishmentfixed effectsthat capture worker’s innate ability and firm’s compensation policy.4Importantly, we leverage on variation in wage cyclicality between the bottom and the rest of each collective contract band during the period 2005–2013, spanning theGreat Recession, which witnessed around 6 p.p. increase in the national unemployment rate in Italy and as much as 20 p.p. in Spain. Furthermore, we extend our period of analysis back to 1995 to test whether the differential wage adjustment at the bottom versus the rest of the contract band is asymmetric (downward wage rigidity during recessions but no upward wage rigidity during expansions). We document three findings.First, we present graphical evidence on the distribution of the percentage difference between individual earnings and the (province)-skill-year specific wage floors to document that wages set in collective contracts are binding indeed (the wage cushion, seeCard, Cardoso, 2021,Cardoso, Portugal, 2005andDolado et al., 1997). We document concentration around negotiated minimum wages: in both countries 3–4% of workers have wages very close to (at most 2.5% above) the bargained wage floor that corresponds to theirskill leveland (in Spain) the province of the employer. Furthermore, only a small fraction of workers receive monthly earnings below the corresponding minima. Secondly, we estimate how wage floors and actual wages adjust somewhat over the business cycle. A 1 p.p. increase in the unemployment rate back at the time of renewal decreases wage floors bargained in collective contracts by about 0.2% in both countries, a fact qualitatively consistent with previous findings.5However, the unemployment rate at the time of renewal has a limited impact on the full structure of monthly earnings in the metalworking industry, and these effects are confined to workers with monthly earnings close to the wage floors. Namely, for workers earning at most 10% above the wage floors, a 1 p.p. increase in the unemployment rate back at the time of contract renewal reduces monthly earnings by about 0.1%. For this set of workers, wages could reflect the labor market conditions at contract renewal for several years up until the next renegotiation round takes place (seeKudlyak, 2014for a similar mechanism). For workers earning at least 50% above the wage floors, a 1 p.p. increase in current unemployment diminishes their nominal wages by between−0.54 and−0.87%.6We obtain similar estimates when we study cyclicality within firm-employee matches, as suggested byGertler et al. (2020).While the main results are similar in both countries, we detect differences in the way wages adjust to the cycle across theterritory. In both countries, there is a large gap in economic performance across regions. We show that the bite of collective contracts is high and the cyclicality of wages is low in the South of Italy -a country where the metalworking agreement sets common wage floors across the country. In Spain instead, decentralization ofcollective bargainingat the province level results in a more homogeneous bite and cyclical wage response across regions.Finally, we adapt previous work fromCengiz et al. (2019)on the impact of minimum wages and examine and explore how contemporaneous changes in the unemployment rate affect the full distribution of the average monthly (Spain) and daily (Italy) wage cushion. An increase in the unemployment rate by 1 p.p. reduces the fraction of workers earning at least 1.5 times their corresponding wage floors by 0.6 p.p., and increases accumulation at wage floors by between 0.4 (in Italy) and 0.2 p.p. (in Spain). When we decompose the margins of the response across different types of workers and firms, we find that adjustment mechanisms differ across the two economies. In Italy, all changes in the wage structure along the business cycle happen among job stayers, while in Spain new entrants account for about half of the observed cyclicality. In both countries, increases in the unemployment rate result in accumulation at wage floors only for workers in small firms.Taken together, those results suggest that, while the determinants of wages vary over the earnings distribution, for most workers in the metalworking sector in Italy and Spain, earnings do adjust over the business cycle. In that sense, our results suggest that collective bargaining agreements may introduce downward wage rigidity but for workers whose monthly earnings are at most 1.1 times above the relevant wage floor (roughly 10% of the workforce in the sector in each country, according to our estimates). For the rest of the distribution, wage responses are similar in magnitude to those in other European countries (Verdugo, 2016).7We make three contributions to the literature on wage cyclicality and collective bargaining. Firstly, we provide comparable estimates of the distribution of workers’ wages around wage floors in two economies where collective bargaining agreements are widespread. Several studies have estimated wage cushions for a single country, using different datasets and methods.8Our study provides visual comparisons of how many workers are likely affected by wage floors in the metalworking sector in Italy and Spain. Both countries differ in key wage setting features (national vs provincial bargaining, pre-specified vs varying duration), so we can examine if those characteristics alter the bite of collective bargaining. For example, the differencial economic performance between the North and the South of Italy is often attributed to very high wage floors established in nationwide collective bargaining (Boeri et al., 2021). By using similar datasets and methods, we can compare the regional distribution of the wage cushion in Italy to that in Spain, a country with bargaining decentralized at the province level.Secondly, we exploit longitudinal data and estimates of the distance between a worker’s wage and the relevant wage floor. That information allows us to assess the role of the wage cushion in shaping changes in earnings during a recession while controlling for worker- and firm-level heterogeneity. For example,Fanfani (2019)and other studies note that average earnings growth correlates with wage growth bargained in collective contracts -a finding that supports the notion that whatever the determinants of growth of negotiated minimum wages are, they spill over the full distribution of earnings.9Indeed, we provide visual evidence of an apparent stability of repeated cross-sectional distributions of the wage cushion in both countries during the onset and aftermath of the Great Recession. However, once we examine within-worker wage changes and account for the distance between workers’ earnings and the wage floor, most wages do react to changes in contemporaneous unemployment.10The apparent stability of the wage cushion is the consequence of job quality changes over the business cycle (well-studied inSolon et al., 1994orCarneiro et al., 2012).Thirdly, a large literature infers the degree of wage rigidity from the response of wages to changes in national unemployment or other cyclical measures. Some studies document that wages are cyclical while others stress that they are rigid, possibly because of the existence of collective agreements.11We propose a new test that allows for the existence of both models in a joint framework, evaluate the relevance of each of them at different points of the distribution of the wage cushion and link the differential responses to direct measures of the bite of collective contracts.",Effrosyni,Ernesto,None
"1. IntroductionIn 2019, before the turmoil caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the 27 member states of the European Union spent 3.4 percent of their GDP (i.e., 473 billion Euro) on primary andsecondary education, and a significant share of these resources were invested in foreign language teaching. In Europe (including EFTA/EEA and candidate countries) compulsory foreign language teaching accounts for 5 to 10 percent of total teaching hours inprimary educationand for 10 to 20 percent in secondary education (Eurydice (2017): 117).1Grin (2003)estimates that Western European countries spend, on average, between 5 and 15 percent of their total education budget on second language teaching.There are many reasons why European governments invest resources inforeign language education, including: promoting cooperation and mutual understanding with neighbouring countries, broadening the cultural horizons of pupils and students, reducing communication costs in trade and in productive activities, as well as facilitating the international mobility of labor (European Commission (2008);European Commission (2012b)). The Council of the European Union considers foreign language skills as one of the eight “key competences for lifelong learning” together with literacy, and numerical, scientific and engineering skills (among others) (Council of the European Union (2018)). From an individual’s perspective language skills not only increase the set of goods and services that can be consumed, but they are also a specific kind of human capital that might improve one’s labor market prospects.Therefore, several empirical analyses have addressed the question of whether foreign language skills bring about higher incomes for individuals. This question is particularly complex because the returns to foreign language skills are subject to several context-specific factors, includingeducation policyand the degree of openness of a country’s economy. This article contributes to the literature by investigating the returns to foreign language skills induced by education policy in Germany (focusing on English), which is an interesting example of a highly export-oriented and internationally integrated economy backed by a strong publiceducation system.Our analysis is based on two waves of the German Socio-Economic Panel’s Innovation Sample (SOEP-IS), a representative, longitudinal survey of private households in Germany, which contains novel and high-quality data on languageskill levelsat the individual level derived from the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). This considerably reduces the bias due to misclassification error stemming from self-evaluation of language skills on imprecise competence scales that many empirical studies on returns to language skills suffer from (seeSection 5.2below). The rich dataset not only allows us to control for various sources of individual heterogeneity, including cognitive skills and individuals’ motivation, but also provides information about the modes of language acquisition that can be used to identify causal effects of English language skills based on aninstrumental variable(IV) approach. Our identification strategy exploits exogenous variation in exposure toEnglish language learninginduced by official language policy. We propose two novel instruments for foreign language skills that are informed by the history of language education policy in Germany and by findings inbilingual educationstudies. The first instrument captures whether learning of English was mandatory when respondents were in school, while the second instrument refers to the age at which respondents started to learn the language during childhood. Our findings show that native German speakers of working age (25-64) who have English skills earn, on average, 13 percent higher wages than those individuals that do not speak English. Returns accrue not only to individuals with advanced skills, but also to individuals with basic and intermediate skills. IV estimates indicate an average return to each additional skill level (basic, intermediate, and advanced) of about 11 percent.2The remainder of the article proceeds as follows: To contextualize our study, the next section explains why English language skills are an important asset in the German labor market and provides a brief presentation of the history of language education policy in Germany.Section 3reviews the existing literature on the relationship between foreign language skills and labor market outcomes.Section 4introduces our dataset and providesdescriptive statistics. InSection 5, we discuss the methodological challenges and explain our empirical strategy.Section 6presents estimation results, robustness checks and a brief heterogeneity analysis.Section 7summarizes and concludes the article.",Sabrina,Michele,None
"1. IntroductionOne of the greatest changes in production activities over recent decades is the introduction and expansion of information and communication technology (ICT). The prevalence of new technology could result in a change in the relative demand for different types of labor, and thus, a change in their relative wages. According to the concept of capital–skill complementarity (Griliches, 1969),1if ICT equipment is more complementary to skilled labor than unskilled labor, the increased use of ICT would raise the relative demand for skilled to unskilled labor, and thus, the relative wages of skilled to unskilled labor. Nevertheless, it is unknown the extent to which the increased use of ICT can account for changes in the relative wages of skilled to unskilled labor in many advanced countries.We examine this issue by estimating a sector-level production function extended to allow for complementarity between ICT and skills. Our approach builds upon the aggregate production function developed byFallon and Layard (1975)andKrusell et al. (2000). We focus on the relative wages of skilled to unskilled labor, which is referred to as the skill premium or sometimes as the college premium. The skill premium is a key metric used to evaluate the level of wageinequalityand its differences across countries. Changes in the skill premium can be interpreted as the outcome of the race between supply shifts due to advances in education and demand shifts due to developments in technology (Goldin, Katz, 2010,Tinbergen, 1974), and thus, can be decomposed into a part due to shifts in the relative supply of skills and a part due to shifts in the relative demand for skills. We refer to the supply shifts as the relative labor quantity effect. The advantage of our approach is that it enables us to decompose the demand shifts into a part attributable to observed factors such as specific capital and labor quantities and a part attributable to unobserved factors such as factor-augmenting technology. We refer to the former as the capital–skill complementarity effect and the latter as the relative factor-augmenting technology effect. Consequently, we can evaluate the extent to which changes in the skill premium are attributable to the expansion of ICT equipment. The impact of policies that increase skilled labor depends on the mechanisms through which the skill premium has changed over recent decades. This study aims to expand our understanding of the sources and mechanisms of changes in the skill premium by measuring the quantitative contribution of the three effects to changes in the skill premium in the goods andservice sectorsof advanced countries.For this purpose, we make use of cross-country and cross-industry panel data from 14OECDcountries for the year 1970 to 2005. This brings two major advantages to the analysis. First, we can exploit the large variation in relative factor quantities across countries over time, which helps identify theelasticities of substitutionbetween different types of capital and labor in production. In doing so, we exploit demand shocks in the service (goods) sector as a source of exogenous variation in factor supply in the goods (service) sector. Second, we can examine the sources and mechanisms of the differences in changes in the skill premium across countries. It is unclear from the literature the extent to which international differences in changes in the skill premium can be attributed to specific capital and labor quantities. Using the estimated production function, we decompose the sources of differences in changes in the skill premium across countries, as well as those of changes in the skill premium for each country and sector.The main findings of this study can be summarized as follows. First, the estimated elasticity of substitution between ICT equipment and skilled labor is much smaller than that between ICT equipment and unskilled labor. This result supports the capital–skill complementarity hypothesis that ICT equipment is more complementary to skilled labor than unskilled labor. Second, the capital–skill complementarity effect associated with a rise in ICT equipment is large enough to account for a rise in the skill premium in the goods and service sectors of most OECD countries. The capital–skill complementarity effect is greater for the goods sector than the service sector in most OECD countries. Third, when ICT equipment is distinguished from non-ICT capital, changes in the skill premium are attributable mainly to observed capital and labor quantities in the goods and service sectors of the majority of OECD countries. Fourth, as its consequences, a large part of the differences in changes in the skill premium among those countries can be explained by the relative quantities of ICT equipment, skilled labor, and unskilled labor. Fifth, a rise in the relative demand for skilled to unskilled labor is attributable to a fall in the rental price of ICT equipment in the goods and service sectors of most OECD countries. Finally, a rise in skilled labor has a greater effect on reducing the skill premium in the presence than in the absence of capital–skill complementarity. This result points to the possibility that the contribution of higher education expansion to reducing the skill premium would be understated if capital–skill complementarity is not taken into account.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section briefly reviews the related literature.Section 3presents the sector-level production function used to account for changes in the skill premium.Section 4describes the data and variables used in the analysis.Section 5outlines theeconometricspecifications and techniques.Section 6discusses the estimation results and their implications.

"1. IntroductionOne of the central goals of familytaxsystems around the world is to encourage and support parental employment. This is evidenced by large endowments of fiscal instruments that are designed to do so. However, given the prominence of these instruments in national fiscal systems, it is interesting to note that there are large cross-country differences in the actual mix of fiscal policies targeted at working parents. For example, Scandinavian countries direct much of their public support to child care subsidies (Kleven, 2014,OECD, 2015), whereas Canada and the US rely more on in-work benefits (Immervoll and Pearson, 2009).1And although these policies may differ to some extent in their objectives, a common goal is to stimulate employment of parents with young children.2A large body of literature studies the employment effects of child care subsidies (and related programs like pre-kindergarten and pre-school)3, and a similarly large body of literature studies the employment effects of in-work benefits for families with children.4These two policy instruments are typically shown to have a positive effect on parental employment, However little is known about their relative effectiveness in terms of additional employment per dollar or euro spent. Cross-country comparisons of these policies are inevitably obfuscated by differences in the respective institutional and cultural settings, and within-country comparisons can be distorted by differences in timing of the reforms. It is therefore difficult to infer which policy works best for stimulating parental employment. This exercise is complicated further by the targeting of these policies, which is also highly country-specific.5Indeed, the policy responses may be heavily influenced by targeting, and the optimal targeting strategy is likely to depend on the relative importance of labor supply responses on the extensive margin (participation) and intensive margin (hours worked per employed) (Saez, 2002).In this paper, we offer a systematic analysis of child care subsidies and in-work benefits for couples with children, assessing their effectiveness in stimulating couples’ labor supply.6Leveraging a structural model and large reforms of the Dutch family tax system, we quantify the public spending required per additional parent employed for several considered policy instruments. In doing so, we take into account parents’ behavioral responses to the policy instruments. Furthermore, we consider to what extent the targeting of these instruments at different income groups matters for their effectiveness. In this way, we study the equity-efficiency trade-off of family tax policies. We also consider how the effects of in-work credits based on individual earnings differ from those based onjoint householdearnings.Our analysis rests on a structural discrete choice model of household labor supply and child care use in the Netherlands.7We use a large and rich administrative household data set, the Labor Market Panel ofStatistics Netherlands (2012), for the period 2006–2009 to estimate the couples’ work and child care preferences. We distinguish between the couples with the youngest child aged 0–3 (pre-primary school age) and couples with the youngest child aged 4–11 (primary school age). The model allows for the simultaneous choice of labor supply by the mother and the father, and the use of formal child care.8In our preferred specification, we model unobserved heterogeneity using the random preference approach ofVan Soest (1995). As a robustness check, we also estimate a more flexible specification of our model using the latent-class framework (Apps, Kabátek, Rees, Van Soest, 2016,Pacifico, 2013,Train, 2008). The identification of the structural parameters benefits from a major reform of child care subsidies and in-work benefits for working parents that took place in the period of observation, generating large exogenous variation in the couples’ budget sets. We also compare the predictions for the reform effects to the results of a differences-in-differences analysis. Furthermore, we consider an out-of-sample prediction, withholding the data for 2009 from the estimation of the structural parameters, and predicting the corresponding labor supply and childcare responses using our model. Finally, we also consider the contribution of the reform to the overall increase in the participation rate and hours worked of mothers and fathers in couples with young children.Our main findings are as follows. First, we find that the most effective fiscal stimulus for working parents is an in-work benefit targeted at secondary earners that rises with their individual income. This policy provides incentives both on the extensive and the intensive margins of labor supply, and it is targeted at workers who are relatively elastic in their employment choices (mostly women with young children). Second, we find that child care subsidies are less effective than in-work benefits for secondary earners. The underlying reason is that childcare subsidies incentivize parents to substitute away from other, informal types of child care arrangements. This substitution drives up public expenditures, since the parents who switch child care types are often already employed. However, child care subsidies are still much more effective than in-work benefits for both primary and secondary earners, because the labor supply of primary earners is rather unresponsive to financial incentives. Third, we find that the effect of child care subsidies is not much lower when targeted at low-income households, compared to the policy targeted at middle- and high-income households. However, the knock-on effects (i.e., changes in public expenditures and receipts due to workers’ behavioral changes) are more favorable for the policy targeting the middle and higher income families, which is attributable to their higher tax burdens. So in the end, there is still a trade-off between equity and efficiency when it comes to the targeting of fiscal stimuli for working parents. We also show that implementing an in-work credit based on household as opposed to individual income would be detrimental to labor supply in the Netherlands, in particular for women with young children.We make several contributions to the existing literature. We have a large and rich data set, combining high-quality administrative data, including working hours, hours of formal child care use, with relevant survey data on e.g. education and job search, for several years in which there was a large reform of child care subsidies an in-work benefits for families with young children. Hence, we can split the sample into subgroups, and estimate the model for families with pre-school children, and families whose children are in primary school, and allow for a rich set of interactions of preferences. This allows our model to capture differences by manydemographicdimensions, like age of the youngest child, education and migration background. The reform also provides us with credible exogenous variation in budget sets, in contrast to previous structural analyses of labor supply and child care that mostly relied on cross-sectional variation. Furthermore, we can also relate the simulated reform effects of the structural model with to a differences-in-differences analysis (Bettendorf et al., 2015).9Also, the structural model enables us to decompose the labor participation effect of the reform package into the effects caused by changes to the child care subsidies and the effects caused by changes to the in-work benefits. In addition, because our structural model is fully integrated with a detailed tax-benefit calculator, we are also able to study the effectiveness of fiscal stimuli for working parents in terms of additional employment generated per additional public euro spent. The integrated model allows us to go beyond back-of-the-envelope calculations of policy effectiveness (Blau, 2003,Lokshin, 2004). Although we study reforms implemented in the Netherlands, we argue that our findings are relevant for other developedOECDcountries as well. Indeed, the participation rate of mothers and fathers in the Netherlands, as well as public spending on formal child care and pre-primary education, takes an intermediate position between Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon countries (OECD, 2015b). We show how a reform akin to the EITC in the US and WFTC in the UK, and the related CTC reforms, could impact labor market outcomes for couples in the Netherlands.The paper is organized as follows.Section 2describes the labor market andpolicy environmentin the Netherlands.Section 3outlines the structural model, the empirical methodology and data used to estimate the preferences, and it also presents the empirical results in terms of simulated labor supply and price of child care elasticities. We also compare the predictions of the structural model for thepolicy reformsin the data period with a differences-in-differences analysis. InSection 4we study the effectiveness of different fiscal stimuli for working parents, and also relate these policy reforms and estimated effects to the policies that are in place in the UK and US (like the WFTC and EITC, respectively).Section 5discusses the significance our findings and concludes.

"1. Introduction and literatureGender differencesin confidence are well-documented and have been used to explain differences in labor or career-related decisions like the choice of major at university or the willingness to enter a competitivework environmentresulting in the gender wage gap (Buser, Peter, Wolter, 2017,Croson, Gneezy, 2009,Gneezy, Leonard, List, 2009,Gneezy, Niederle, Rustichini, 2003,Niederle, Vesterlund, 2007,Niederle, Vesterlund, 2008,van Veldhuizen, 2018). Gender differences in confidence may also affect decisions on the demand side of the market. For example, if employers do not sufficiently account for gender differences in confidence when making their hiring decisions, they may discriminate against women whose self-assessments are less confident. Such discrimination would also be costly if it prevents employers from selecting the most productive candidates (Reuben et al., 2014).While gender differences in confidence and their consequences are well studied, less is known about the moderators of these differences.1This is surprising as previous literature suggests that the level of observed overconfidence differs by numerous factors, such as the difficulty of the task (Moore and Healy, 2008) or the image concerns related to the self-assessment (Ewers and Zimmermann, 2015). Moreover, it has been found that gender differences in confidence seem to increase if the task is considered to be stereotypically male (Bordalo, Coffman, Gennaioli, Shleifer, 2019,Coffman, 2014), or if overconfidence can be observed by others (Ludwig et al., 2017).In this paper, I study whether the mode of self-assessment, either in public or private, affects men and women differently. I run a real-effort experiment in which subjects ex-ante self-assess their performance relative to others (i.e., their placement) in a familiar and simple math task. Following previous literature, I modify the image concerns related to the self-assessments by having treatments that differ in whether or not self-assessments are public and verifiable by others (Ewers and Zimmermann, 2015). In contrast to previous experiments, the self-assessment is elicited prior to the relevant real-effort task and I implement a setting in which subjects can work longer to increase output and live up to their assessment.2Giving subjects the possibility to increase effort to live up to their self-assessments is an important extension of previous literature for three reasons. First, it reflects practice in the professional world. Consider for example a job interview. While the employer might be able to infer your performance in previous jobs based on references, she would actually like to know, and might also ask you, how well you will be doing on the tasks in your new job. These tasks are probably similar to the tasks you have performed in your previous job but you are able to affect your performance in the upcoming tasks based on the effort you are going to provide. This feature is captured by the elicitation of ex-ante self-assessments on a familiar task in which performance depends on ability and effort. Second, the change in timing might decrease observed gender differences in confidence if they are caused by women who are afraid of receiving negative feedback (Croson, Gneezy, 2009,Niederle, Vesterlund, 2007) because negative feedback can be avoided by increasing effort. Third, comparing output between treatments with ex-ante and ex-post self-assessments allows me to identify whether there is a motivational effect of an (overconfident) ex-ante self-assessment. Together, the setup contributes to the literature on the gender gap in career success by identifying moderators of gender differences in observed confidence. This is a first step toward developing measures to mitigate the distortionary effects of overconfidence in the labor market.The main findings of my paper are as follows. Consistent with the previous literature, I observe that many subjects tend to overplace themselves, i.e., they overestimate their placement. Overall, I qualitatively replicate the results ofEwers and Zimmermann (2015), that self-assessments are higher when they are made public rather than private and lower when there is public feedback, however, this pattern is overwhelmingly driven by women. The finding that women state higher self-assessments when they are made public indicates that overplacement is driven by a preference to signal ability to others rather than by biased beliefs about own performance.3In addition, it suggest that social approval might be more important for women than for men. I also find that self-assessments are significantly higher when elicited prior to the real-effort task as compared to ex post. Again this effect is only driven by women. Finally, I investigate whether subjects who are ex ante too optimistic regarding their relative performance try to live up to their self-assessments and work harder in comparison to treatments in which subjects assess themselves ex post. I do not find any evidence for such behavior.Relation to the literature.Most closely related to my paper isEwers and Zimmermann (2015)who show that self-assessments change if they are made public and if public feedback is provided. These authors find that making self-assessments public induces a positive shift of self-assessments; they also find that this effect only occurs when the actual performance remains private, i.e., there is no effect when feedback is public. This result suggests that subjects overstate their placement because of image concerns.Schwardmann and van der Weele (2019)go one step further and suggest that subjects might deceive themselves, i.e., make themselves believe that they are of high ability, to be able to convince others. In a lab experiment, they show that informing subjects that they will have to convince an employer of their ability increases overconfidence in a private self-assessment. While there is no strategic component to the self-assessment in my experiment, i.e., there are no employers, subjects might still want to inflate their beliefs to convince observers of their ability. Another close match to this paper isExley and Kessler (2019). In a series of experiments, the authors identify different moderators of gender differences in self-promotion. In contrast to this paper and previous literature, they ask subjects to evaluate their performance on a subjective scale (using adjectives) rather than on an objective scale (using, e.g., output quantiles). They find that gender differences in self-promotion are very persistent and cannot be explained by differences in objective performance beliefs.I add to previous research by explicitly testing for gender differences in image concerns and by investigating how timing affects self-assessments. Precisely, I investigate whether self-assessments change if subjects can affect their placement by comparing self-assessments in a treatment in which self-assessments are elicited before the real-effort task to a treatment in which self-assessments are elicited after the real-effort task.The focus on gender differences in image concerns is important, because it may affect employment decisions. This holds true particularly if differences in self-assessments increase with the level of observability.Ludwig et al. (2017)show in a principal-agent setting that women’s self-assessments decrease when principals can observe the accuracy of their self-assessments, while men do not react. The authors provide evidence that women decrease their self-assessment significantly more than men because they are more susceptible to the feeling of shame. In comparison to their study, my results are obtained without a principal being affected by the self-assessment and, therefore, in the absence of social responsibility toward other subjects. Thereby my design allows me to test for gender differences in the feeling of shame from overstating one’s ability withoutsocial preferencespotentially confounding the effect. Another important reason to consider gender differences in image concerns and the resulting differences in confidence is provided byNiederle and Vesterlund (2007). The authors show that overconfidence plays an important role in understanding gender differences in the willingness to enter competition using lab experiments.4Understanding the roots of differences in the willingness to compete is crucial as they are an important determinant of labor market success (Buser et al., 2014).Buser et al. (2021)investigate whether gender differences in the willingness to compete (rather than confidence) change if the decision to enter a competition is made public and if there is public feedback on the outcome of the competition. They find suggestive evidence that men are more likely to enter competition when the decision is made public. However, in general, the effects of observability are negligible in their experiment. This result suggests that observability does not affect the size of gender differences in competitiveness. I add to their paper by investigating gender differences in self-assessments rather than competitiveness.In addition, I investigate whether subjects are willing to exert additional effort to live up to an overly optimistic ex-ante self-assessment, i.e., overplacement, adding to the discussion of a motivational value of overconfidence (Bénabou and Tirole, 2002). Typically, the motivational value of overconfidence is based on the idea that overconfident individuals overestimate their gains to effort.Chen and Schildberg-Hörisch (2019)test for the motivational value of overconfidence in a real-effort experiment. They find that subjects’ effort is indeed associated with overconfidence. In particular they provide evidence that subjects who spend more time on the real-effort phase do so because they overestimated their return to effort. However, they also find that providing feedback on the accuracy of the self-assessment reduces overconfidence and effort provision. Therefore, the findings ofChen and Schildberg-Hörisch (2019)are consistent with subjects having unconscious, erroneous self-assessments. An overestimation of the returns to effort is ruled out by design in my experiment as I continuously provide subjects with feedback on their output. In contrast, I investigate whether conscious overplacement results in an increase in effort.A motivational effect of an ex-ante self-assessment is plausible if subjects wish to avoid feelings of shame from overly optimistic self-assessments, in particular, when feedback is public (Ludwig et al., 2017). It can also be rationalized if the ex-ante self-assessment sets a reference point, as discussed byKöszegi, Rabin, 2006,Köszegi, Rabin, 2007andAbeler et al. (2011)because not living up to the self-assessment will be perceived as a loss. In this way, reference points are similar to endogenously set performance goals, which have been shown to increase effort provision if set ambitiously (Locke and Latham, 1990). In a series of field experiments,Goerg and Kube (2012)investigate, among other things, the effect of non-binding and non-incentivized goals and confirm a performance-increasing effect. In a similar vein,Koch, Nafziger, 2011,Koch, Nafziger, 2020provide a theoretical model as well as experimental evidence showing that non-binding self-set goals can increase effort provision and may be used as a commitment device for present biased individuals. Non-incentivized, endogenous goal-setting has also been used to motivate students’ performance, e.g.,van Lent and Souverijn (2017)orClark et al. (2017). Both studies find positive effects on performance in final exams. However, the effects differ both by size and statistical significance, indicating that the effectiveness of goal-setting may depend on the specific setting.",Simone,None,None
"1. IntroductionTournaments are institutions shaping individuals’ behavior. Typically, they elicit greater effort and higher performance across many different situations, ranging from sports to the workplace. However, studies have established that competitors’ performance in tournaments varies with gender.1Moreover, women seem to perform worse when they compete against men (Gneezy et al., 2003;Backus et al., 2016;Booth et al., 2018;Booth and Yamamura, 2018;Dolder et al., 2020), or when they compete against men in male-oriented tasks (Günther et al., 2010). These studies find that females’ competitive performance in tournaments is lower in mixed-sex environments than in single-sex, findings that are of considerable general interest.2If competitors’ gender matters, placing females too early in mixed-sex competitions may have wider performance implications. For example, if a workforce becomes more male-dominated at higher levels, women's lower willingness to compete against men might contribute to explaining gender differences in remuneration, and policies might be devised to mitigate this.Our objective in the present paper is to examine how tournament performanceover timeresponds to the gender composition of the group with whom a participant is competing. Does women's behavior evolve with experience as they adjust to competing against men? What are their performance patterns like from the time they make their debut? How does this compare to male behavior? In this paper we provide answers to these questions using unique field data from a single occupation. To our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the impact of the sex-composition of the competing group on individuals' tournament-outcomes from debut onwards.Experimental economists can randomly assign subjects into treatments – single-sex or mixed-sex groups – and hence eliminate worries about selection. However, it is rare to find studies using field data that randomly allocate individuals into single-sex and mixed-sex environments each time they participate.Booth and Yamamura (2018)– henceforth B-Y (2018) – used field data from the japanese speedboat racing association (JSRA) to see how male and female performance varies in mixed-sex and single-sex environments. Their data cover 7 of the 24 stadiums over the period 2014 to 2015. For each race, the JSRA randomly assigns racers into two treatment groups: single-sex and mixed-sex, and racers are not permitted to refuse an allocation. Thus, selection is not an issue when investigating the impact of single-sex or mixed-sex groups on performance. B-Y (2018) found that women's race time is slower in mixed-sex than all-women races, whereas men's race time is faster in mixed-sex than men-only races. Further, in mixed-sex races, men are more likely to display their skill at lane-changing than are women.Owing to data availability, B-Y (2018) did not examine how gender differences evolve over the course of multiple interactions, nor look at agents’ performance from debut. Yet this is potentially important, for tournaments are frequently designed to encourage individuals to provide effort in a dynamic context. From the time they first enter a particular tournament, individuals learn how to adjust their strategies depending on their relative place in the competition, and on the gender mix of the tournament.3Since B-Y (2018), we gained access to additional data allowing us to explore dynamic issues. In the present paper, we investigate the evolution of gender differences in performance in single-sex and mixed-sex environments using JSRA data from all 24 stadiums and following racers from their debut into this occupation.4Our estimating sample comprises over one million person-race observations of all men and women who made their racing debut in the observation window 1997 to 2011. The randomization enables us to establish some basic stylized facts about male and female debut racers as they gain experience, and to shed light on learning in single-sex and mixed-sex environments. We explore skill differences between male and female racers at an initial point of time, and then analyze the subsequent process ofskills formationby comparing women with men in this novel setting. The research questions of this study are whether men and women differ in their returns to experience in competitive environments, and whether (gender-specific) returns differ depending on whether the competitive environment is mixed- or single-sex.Our main result is that – while everyone improves their racing skills and techniques (proxied by lane-changing in the initial period of turnaround) and performance with experience – men are more competent in single-sex and mixed-sex races than women. However, women's returns to experience are higher than men's in single-sex races and lower in mixed-sex races.5This implies that the learning effect from experience on skills and performance varies according to competitive environments.Our paper is set out as follows. Section II outlines the institutional background of the JSRA. Section III provides an overview of the data. Section IV explains the estimation approach, while Sections V and VI present the estimation results for two performance measures – lane-changing and place-in-race. Section VII concludes.",Alison,Ryohei,Eiji
"1. IntroductionOccupational licensing covers one-fourth of the US workforce, more than are affected by minimum wagelegislationor unionization (Kleiner, 2006). This growing regulation imposes an entry barrier that reduces jobs, limits consumer access to service, and raises prices (Friedman, 1962). By contrast, proponents of licensing argue that minimum worker standards protect consumers against incompetent workers (Leland, 1979). Measuring both the supply and quality effect at the same time provides practical information for policymakers about whether a license policy is welfare-improving.In this study, I examine the licensing effect on workers and consumers by leveraging an Illinois reform on real estate licenses in 2011. The Illinois legislation offers unique features that facilitate an evaluation of the quantity-quality tradeoff of licensing. Under the new policy, both new and existing practitioners had to obtain more training. Existing agents had a one-year grace period to meet the new requirement, or their licenses expired. With the possible departure of existing agents and more training for all agents, the legislation should have immediate quantity and quality impacts on the economy.1Because the policy aimed to protect home sellers and buyers from agent misbehavior, misconduct incidents offer an appropriate measure to assess policy effectiveness.2Lastly, compared to previous licensing studies in specific industries, the real estate sector has far bigger economic impacts that affect a broad array of workers and consumers.My empirical analysis primarily exploits the state administrative records of real estate licensees. Compared to national surveys, which are common data sources in the licensing literature, the official information on individual licensure dates accurately measures the stock, inflow, and outflow of real estate agents.3Because the policy intention is to combat misconduct, I supplement the main licensure data with disciplinary cases of real estate agents which are official records of misconduct. Although the number of disciplinary cases is an intuitive quality measure, they were rarely analyzed in the licensing literature because manual transcription of legal documents is onerous. To estimate a causal effect of the policy, I primarily employ the synthetic control method (SCM) to address policy endogeneity (Abadie, Diamond, Hainmueller, 2010,Abadie, Gardeazabal, 2003).4The essence of this approach is to compare Illinois with a more reliable control group that could mirror counterfactual Illinois based on more balanced characteristics, including the pre-treatment outcome and demographic/housing covariates.I find that the increased training requirement reduced real estate licensees by about 20% primarily due to a spike of non-renewals in the first policy year. In absolute terms, there was a loss of about 20,000 registered agents. Exploiting also the licensee characteristics in the records, I find that female and novice agents are more likely not to renew the license after the policy. In theory, the licensee record captures the policy effect on potential agent supply. In practice, it may not reflect the actual employment status. Cross-checking the employment information in a national household survey (the AmericanCommunitySurvey), I also find a significant decrease in real estate employment and a stronger impact for females. Overall, the increased training requirement reduced both agent availability and actual employment in the real estate sector in Illinois. The policy also created a harder environment for female and novice agents.By contrast, the effect on misbehavior is less conclusive. There was a drop in new misconduct cases for some years, but the effect size is not precisely estimated. At best, my analysis does not find strong evidence of fewer cases in a statistical sense. To enrich the analysis about the potential impacts on real estate consumers, I also analyze the county housing statistics pooled from a third-party private company.5There was a significant reduction in home sales on average, implying that the decreased agent availability had an immediate consequence on consumers.This paper extends the analysis of occupational licensing in two important ways. First, measuring the license status of a worker has been a huge obstacle in the licensing literature.6Gittleman et al. (2018)documented significant measurement errors from the self-reported license status in household surveys, which are the major data sources for previous licensing studies. In this paper, the official licensee record allows me to accurately capture potential supply in a sector of significant influence for economic output. The similar results by both the licensee record and the national survey also give credence to the use of household surveys (despite possible measurement errors) in future licensing studies. Second, the worker flow is a valuable but under-studied aspect in the licensing literature.7The unique policy context and the richness of the administrative data allow me to identify the source of supply reduction (i.e. a prompt agent outflow) and what worker characteristics are more vulnerable in response to a licensing shock.This paper also provides crucial updates to the knowledge about real estate licenses.Carroll and Gaston (1979)are among the first to assess the licensing impact in thereal estate market. They find that more restrictive licensing (measured by exam pass rate) is associated with a longer duration of vacancy of a property. Later studies making use of state differences in real estate licensing requirements tend to find that more restrictive licensing regimes are associated with fewer practitioners, and no or slight improvements on quality standard (Ingram and Yelowitz, 2021,Johnson, Loucks, 1986,Shilling, Sirmam, 1988). Leveraging a contemptuous policy change and a unique licensee dataset, this paper offers a sharper identification of both the supply-side and quality effect of licensing in the real estate business.",Bobby,None,None
"1. IntroductionOver the past three decades, progress in information and communication technologies (ICT) has made it easier to perform tasks outside of the workplace; in part due to cheaper, more user-friendly computers and better connectivity through broadband internet. This made working from home (WfH) feasible for a wider range of tasks, and likely reduced the employer’s costs of providing such arrangements (Vazquez and Winkler, 2017). Consequently, and even before the Covid-19 pandemic, there had been a major expansion of WfH in many advanced economies such as the US, Nordic and Central European countries.1Among certain groups of workers, such as managers, WfH had already become a mainstream practice (Bloom et al., 2015). With the need for social distancing induced by the Covid-19 pandemic, WfH has become even more widespread.2After the pandemic, WfH a few days a week is likely to be a widely used practice (Barrero et al., 2021).Yet, despite its growing relevance, little is known about how this work practice relates to workers’ careers and well-being. The limited empirical evidence is mixed and has not fully taken into account that outcomes likely vary across workers with different private responsibilities. In general, more flexibility in where to work is expected to benefit primarily those who face private restrictions, such as mothers. This is why flexible working arrangements may help reduce gender gaps in the labour market, especially among parents. Yet, while this may be true for labour supply responses, the theoretical expectations are far from clear-cut when it comes to wages and other career prospects. On the one hand, WfH may improve wages and career prospects if it raises productivity due to a beneficialwork environmentat home, or to workers’ willingness to extend their availability beyond usual office hours. On the other hand, if WfH mainly serves to reconcile work and family responsibilities, it may give rise to a wage penalty if it is costly to employers.This paper contributes to the limited and inconclusive evidence on WfH by providing novel and comprehensive insights on how the adoption of WfH relates to a whole set of labour market and well-being outcomes. We use data for Germany from the end of the 90s until 2014, a period of massive expansion of WfH practices. In this pre-pandemic period, WfH was mostly used as a complement to on-site work, as we expect it to be after the pandemic. The paper is thus an interesting benchmark for the near future. Our findings suggest that:(i)the incidence of WfH in Germany increased, on average, by more than 60 percent between 1997 and 2014, but it almost doubled among parents, suggesting that WfH is likely to be driven by both firms’ demands as well as supply-side motives of reconciling family and work responsibilities;(ii)among childless workers3, WfH take-up is related to an expansion of overtime hours and higher job satisfaction, despite no compensation in terms of wages or time-off, suggesting that childless employees value the increased flexibility that WfH allows;(iii)among parents, WfH take-up comes with reducedgender differencesin contractual hours and monthly income;(iv)saving time on daily commutes, as well as the ability to work in the evening and better share childcare responsibilities are mechanisms that enable mothers to work longer hours with WfH;(v)for fathers, hourly wages are higher after WfH take-up, while wages remain unchanged for mothers unless they change employers. This could be due to gender differences in bargaining within established employer-employee relationships;(vi)there is no evidence of higher job satisfaction for parents after WfH take-up despite positive labour market outcomes, indicating that related advantages may be counterbalanced by WfH-related conflicts between private and professional needs.These results should be taken as descriptive as it is difficult in our setting to assign a causal role to WfH take-up. Indeed, other unobserved changes could take place simultaneously. However, the paper makes several contribution to the literature. Compared to experiments (Angelici, Profeta, 2020,Bloom, Liang, Roberts, Ying, 2015), we use a sample of individuals that is representative of the whole labour market and that we can follow over a long time period to document how WfH is related to changes in contractual hours, overtime hours, hourly wages, and monthly earnings.4We also investigate the role of compensating wage differentials using information on job satisfaction, and take into account other schemes used to compensate overtime such as time off. In this way, we complement earlier studies that focus on responses in working hours and disregard compensations for increased working hours other than wages. Moreover, we study the case of employees working from home at least once a month or once a week, hence departing from the older literature that focuses on the less common case of home being the only workplace (Edwards, Field-Hendrey, 2002,Oettinger, 2011), and covering the type of mixed working arrangement that is likely to be the prevalent way of using WfH after the pandemic (Barrero et al., 2021).As a second contribution, we describe how the links between WfH and labour market outcomes differ acrossdemographicgroups, i.e. by gender and parental status. The existing literature often fails to dig deeper into this heterogeneity, despite the fact that the impact of WfH is likely to vary with opportunity costs of working and labour force attachment. By carving out the differences by gender and parental status, we contribute to the debate on the role of schedule constraints as a source of gender differences in working hours and wages (Cubas, Juhn, Silos, 2019,Goldin, 2014,Goldin, Katz, 2011) and the role of flexible work arrangements and “family friendly” workplaces as a means of reconciling work and family responsibilities (seeAllen, Golden, Shockley, 2015,Angelici, Profeta, 2020,Hotz, Johansson, Karimi, 2017, among others).Thirdly, we are able to explore several mechanisms and confounding factors behind the link between WfH and labour outcomes by exploiting the richness of the data. We follow individuals over a long period of time and are able to use WfH take-up contrary to most previous studies that often use cross-sectional data only (Gariety, Shaffer, 2007,Leslie, Manchester, Park, Mehng, 2012,Schroeder, Warren, 2004,Weeden, 2005). These studies likely suffer from a bias since WfH schemes are more frequently offered by high performing firms to workers who are positively selected among the firm’s workforce (Bloom, Van Reenen, 2006,Kelly, Kalev, 2006,Osterman, 1995). We can partly address these concerns by accounting for time-invariant unobserved individual heterogeneity in abilities, preferences and working attitudes, and by controlling for an extensive set of time-varying demographic and job-related variables. We also control for gender-specific industry and occupation fixed-effects to account for unobserved heterogeneity in the composition of the workforce across jobs. Still, our estimates should be considered descriptive as we cannot control for all potential biases.5Reassuringly though, our main results are robust to including further occupational and regional characteristics as well as the partner’s employment status and earnings. In order to address unobserved shocks that affectlabour supply decisionsas well as the decision to work from home, we also examine whether selection into paid employment due to changes in unobserved preferences or characteristics affects our results using a control function approach in a panel data setting. None of these robustness checks alter the main findings. Finally, we provide novel insights into the channels underlying the effects of WfH by providing suggestive evidence on the role of commuting, flexible schedules and changes in childcare responsibilities. We also examine to what extent the take-up of WfH is accompanied by changing firm or job position within a firm to shed light on the role of such career events in explaining part of the WfH-related labour market outcomes. If WfH take-up comes with higher wages, it is informative to understand whether this applies only to workers with simultaneous career movements or whether it also applies to workers with otherwise unchanged jobs.The rest of the paper is organised as follows. InSection 2we discuss the theoretical expectations regarding the effect of WfH on various outcomes and review existing findings.Section 3describes the data and provides some facts and trends in WfH incidence and labour market outcomes across different groups of workers. We discuss the empirical strategy inSection 4. We present the results, robustness checks and discuss the mechanisms inSection 5. The last section concludes and discusses how the evolution of WfH practices during the pandemic might strengthen or alter insights from the pre-pandemic period.",Melanie,Sarra,Francesco
"1. IntroductionTeacher absence is a widespread phenomenon in many developed countries. On a typical school day in the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, three to six percent of teachers are absent (Griffith, 2017). Despite the importance of this phenomenon, empirical evidence on the causal effect of teacher absence on productivity is scarce.2Even less is known about the potential mitigating impact of substitute teachers. When a teacher is absent, how does it hurt her productivity? How easily can substitute teachers mitigate this effect?I offer an empirical answer to these questions using a comprehensive administrative French panel dataset covering the 2007–2015 period, and matching, for each absence spell, each missingsecondary school teacherto her substitute teacher. This paper estimates, for Math, French and History ninth grade teachers and their pupils: (a) the effect of the number of non-replaced days on pupil test scores; (b) how this impact can be mitigated by the assignment of substitute teachers; (c) how the impact of substitute teachers depends on their quality, measured by their certification status (certified versus non-certified teachers).The main empirical challenge is the endogeneity of teacher absence and substitution. Existing literature suggests that teacher absence is correlated with observed and unobserved teacher and pupil characteristics (Ost and Schiman, 2017). I implement a two-wayfixed effect modelwith teacher and classroom fixed effects to address this empirical challenge. This model exploits the longitudinal dimension of the data with teacher-school fixed effects. It also exploits the cross-sectional dimension of the data: in secondary school, teachers are subject-specific, and pupils stay with the same peers in the same classroom throughout the school year and for all subjects. This allows me to use variations within classroom, across subject. I perform several robustness checks to confirm that the results are not driven by (a) reverse causality: teachers are more absent when assigned to low performing pupils, and it is more difficult to find substitute teachers for these pupils; (b) the fact that absences are only a reflection of poor on-the-job teacher productivity.Based on the analysis of more than 100,000 teachers and three million pupils, I show that teacher absence has a statistically significant negative impact on pupil test scores: one additional day of absence reduces pupil test scores by 0.03% of astandard deviation. This is consistent with previous causal estimates in developed countries (Clotfelter, Ladd, Vigdor, 2009,Herrmann, Rockoff, 2012). As teachers miss an average of 13 days per year, the average effect of their absence is to reduce pupil test scores by around 0.40% of a standard deviation. The fraction of replaced absence days does not have any statistically significant compensating effect. However, one additional replaced day with a certified substitute teacher (as opposed to a missed day at school) mitigates 26% of the marginal impact of non-replaced days. The marginal impact of a replaced day with a non-certified substitute teacher (as opposed to a missed day at school) is not statistically significant.I also estimate heterogeneity by teacher and absence spell characteristics to give suggestive evidence on the underlying mechanisms highlighted in a conceptual framework. I begin by estimating heterogeneity by length of absence spell. One of the predictions of the conceptual framework is that the longer the absence spell, the more pupils or their parents can adjust and put in place alternative compensating strategies such asprivate tutoring. I observe that the marginal impact of one additional day of non-replaced absence decreases with the length of the absence spell. This suggests that one long absence spell is less harmful to pupils than multiple shorter absence spells. I then turn to the role of the gap in general human capital between the regular and the substitute teachers. The main prediction from the conceptual framework is that the larger this gap, the smaller the mitigating effect of substitution. I use teacher experience as a measure of general human capital because the link between teacher experience and teacher productivity is well established in the literature (seeKoedel et al., 2015for a review). I find that the mitigating effect of certified substitution is not significantly impacted by the experience gap. This suggests that the results cannot be entirely explained by this mechanism. Next, I investigate the role of the specific human capital gap: teaching requires specific human capital that can be acquired only through prolonged and repeated interactions with pupils. First, I perform a heterogeneity analysis by month of the school year. I do not find that substitute teachers have a smaller compensating impact at the end of the school year, when the gap in specific human capital between the absent and the substitute teacher is the largest. Second, I compare planned absences with unplanned absences: with planned absence, absent teachers have the opportunity, prior to their absence, to reduce the gap in specific human capital with their substitute teachers by sharing content with them and giving them guidelines. I find that planned absences are slightly less disruptive for pupils. Thus, overall, evidence on the importance of this mechanism is mixed.This paper makes several key contributions to several strands of the literature. First, my paper combines teacher fixed effects with classroom fixed effects to further deal with the endogeneity of teacher absence and substitution. Classroom fixed effects further address the issue of reverse causality. This is an advancement on previous literature on the causal effect of teacher absence on productivity (Clotfelter, Ladd, Vigdor, 2009,Duflo, Hanna, Ryan, 2012,Herrmann, Rockoff, 2012,Miller, Murnane, Willett, 2008) which to date has only relied on teacher fixed effects.Second, my paper provides an in-depth analysis of teacher substitution. I analyse whether absence spells are actually covered by a substitute teacher and, if so, by whom. Most previous papers on the causal effect on teacher absence do not analyse substitute teachers. OnlyClotfelter et al. (2009)analyse substitute teachers, and they only compare the marginal effect of the number of absences covered by a certified substitute teacher to the marginal effect of the number of absences covered by a non-certified substitute teacher. I am able to identify the marginal effect of non-replaced and replaced days, irrespective of the type of substitute, where the counterfactual is a missed day of class. Given the important administrative and budgetary cost of substitute teachers, identifying the impact of non-replaced and replaced days is relevant for policy makers regardless of the substitute teachers’ certification status. From this perspective, my paper also contributes to the literature on instruction time (Lavy, 2015,Pischke, 2007). This literature finds that longer instructional time has a positive impact on pupil test scores and one-time grade progression. While these papers focus on variations in planned instruction time defined by law, I analyse how pupil achievement is affected by variations in the number of hours of instruction caused by non-replaced days of teacher absence.Furthermore, I show that non-certified substitute teachers have no statistically significant impact on pupil test scores in the French context, where the certification process is very demanding and has low passing rates. This is an advancement onClotfelter et al. (2009), who analyse the role of substitute teachers’ certification in the US context, where teacher certification is neither selective nor competitive (Koedel, 2011) and where existing evidence suggests that teacher certification is, at best, a weak predictor of teacher quality. While my results only apply to substitute teachers, they still provide suggestive evidence that a demanding and selective certification process may contribute to better teacher screening. This is consistent with the emerging literature on effective teacher screening (e.g.,Jacob et al. (2018)).Third, I perform several heterogeneity analyses by substitute teacher characteristics and absence spell characteristics, which allows me to explore some potential mechanisms underlying the impact of teacher absence on pupil achievement. I am able to test several hypotheses with respect to teacher substitutability, and the role of specific human capital. Existing evidence on worker substitutability and the role of specific human capital focuses on non-educational settings (Grinza, Rycx, 2020,Hensvik, Rosenqvist, 2016,Jäger, Heining, 2019). Teaching is particularly appropriate for the analysis of the relationship between human capital specificity (pupil-specific, grade-specific etc., seeOst (2014)) and substitutability because it is a complex, multidimensional task, based on direct, personal and prolonged interactions with the “output” (pupils).The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.Section 2describes the French educational context.Section 3presents a highly stylised conceptual framework to illustrate the mechanisms through which teacher absence and substitution affect pupil outcomes.Section 4presents the data anddescriptive statistics.Section 5describes the empirical strategy,Section 6the baseline results, andSection 7the robustness checks.Section 8details the heterogeneity analysis.Section 9discusses the main policy implications of the baseline results.Section 10concludes.",Asma,None,None
"1. IntroductionIn many countries, the labor market has become polarized, with marginal groups finding it increasingly difficult to find employment. In particular, low-skilled youth and migrants from refugee countries make up a large and increasing share of the unemployed (Förster et al., 2017). In parallel, there is a rise of a new form of non-traditional work—gig jobs—with considerably lower entry barriers compared to most traditional wage jobs.3An important question is therefore if these easily accessible—but low-paying—jobs provide labor market experience that is useful for marginal groups on the traditional labor market.In this paper, we shed light on this question by studying how employers hiring on the traditional labor marketvalue workexperience from the gig-economy. We conducted a correspondence study in the Swedish labor market, submitting fictitious applications to entry-level vacancies. We compare the number of positive responses from employers for young applicants currently (i) employed by a well-known gig company; (ii) employed in a similar job in the traditional labor market; and (iii) in an ongoing unemployment spell lasting 7–15 months. We focus on young applicants since we are interested in the value of gig-job experience for labor market entrants. We also study the heterogeneous responses for applicants with Swedish vs. Arabic-sounding names, since abundant evidence shows that the latter group experiences particular difficulties of finding jobs on the traditional labor market. The choice of applicants is also relevant since youths and immigrant males are overrepresented in the gig-economy in our context (seeSection 3).Compared to unemployment, gig-experience could send a positive signal to employers about applicants’ motivation and effort. But, the low entry barriers in gig jobs, which are rarely preceded by a formal screening process, may lower the information value of such past work experience. Gig-experience could also signal a lack of options on the traditional labor market, and the solitary nature of many gig-jobs may make it more difficult for employers to verify the work experience. A priori, it is thus not clear how employers perceive experience from the gig economy, and consequently if gig-jobs are useful as stepping stones to traditional employment or if workers are involuntarily stuck in these lower-paying working arrangements.4Our findings suggest that for natives, experience in a gig job increases the call-back rate from employers compared to unemployment, but not as much as similar experience in the traditional labor market. More specifically, we find that gig-experience improves the contact rate by around 2 percentage points (or 11%) compared to unemployment, while the impact of traditional experience is about twice as large. While this pattern suggests that participation in the gig-economy can lead to a slight improvement on the traditional labor market for the majority group (compared to unemployment), some caution is warranted, as only the difference between traditional employment and unemployment is statistically significant at the 5% level.Consistent with prior evidence from Sweden and elsewhere, we find that the callback rate of applicants with Swedish-sounding names is almost twice as high as the callback rate of applicants with Arabic-sounding names, indicating substantial ethnic discrimination in the Swedish labor market. The average callback rate across all three experience treatments is 10% for applicants with Arabic-sounding names, and 19% for applicants with Swedish-sounding names. But in stark contrast to the findings for the majority group, we find that no form of labor market experience (neither gig- or traditional employment experience) increases the call-back rate compared to unemployment for applicants with Arabic-sounding names. This striking result is consistent with employers having such strong negative priors against this group that higher qualifications in terms of more experience do not improve the call-back rate. But it could also reflect that recruiters internalize the perceived circumstances faced by the job candidates (e.g., adverse labor market conditions for minorities), generating a less negative signal from past unemployment when the candidate belongs to a minority.5While we have to leave further exploration of these mechanisms to future research, we conclude from our findings that gig-jobs do not seem to be an important stepping stone to traditional wage jobs for this group.Our paper contributes to a growing literature (summarized inSection 2) on the extent and role of non-traditional work arrangements. Recent studies, mainly focusing on taxi drivers, suggest that workers value the flexibility and independence of gig-jobs (Chen, Chevalier, Rossi, Oehlsen, 2019,Hall, Krueger, 2018). At the same time, several studies indicate that many temporary and on-call workers would prefer permanent employment with regularly scheduled hours to their current employment arrangements (Boeri, Giupponi, Krueger, Machin, 2020,Datta, 2019,Mas, Pallais, 2017).Despite this, the question of how participation in the gig-economy impacts workers’futurelabor market prospects has received surprisingly little attention. One reason is that gig-workers are difficult to identify in existing data sources (seeAbraham et al., 2021, for a detailed discussion about measurement of non-traditional workers). However, even if participants in the gig-economy were easily distinguishable from other types of workers, an inherent concern is that it is difficult to separate the effects of working in a gig-job from the effects of other important worker characteristics which are observed by the recruiting firms but not by the researcher, potentially leading to biased estimates due to unobserved heterogeneity. In a recent study,Jackson (2020)combines variation in gig worker demand driven by the geographic roll-out of gig economy platforms, and individuals’ propensity for gig work to estimate the impact of gig work opportunities following job loss. Her results suggest that unemployed workers experience lower earnings losses in the short run, but that the availability of gig jobs is associated with earnings losses two to four years later.6In relation to our study she also finds that take-up of platform-based gig work after unemployment leads to lower re-employment rates. Our main contribution is to document precisely the return to gig-experience in the job search process.We also relate closely to the literature using correspondence experiments to estimate the impact of past unemployment and type of work on the likelihood of being contacted by employers (e.g.,Eriksson, Rooth, 2014,Farber, Herbst, Silverman, von Wachter, 2019,Kroft, Lange, Notowidigdo, 2013). To our knowledge, this is the first paper in this vein to inform about employers’ valuation of gig vs. traditional wage job experience.The paper is structured as follows:Section 2gives an overview of the relevant literature;Section 3provides a short description of the context—the Swedish labor market;Section 4describes the experiment;Section 5presents the empirical model and main results; andSection 6concludes.",Adrian,Lena,None
"1. IntroductionPopulation agingthreatens the financial stability of existing public pension schemes. In response, governments across the globe have pursued extensive retirement reforms.1Most of these reforms revolve around incentivizing workers to postpone retirement and encouragingpensionersto return to work (OECD 2015). However, while there is a rich literature examining the impact of financial incentives on workers’ decision todelay retirement(e.g.,Laun 2017;Malkova 2020;Haller 2021), there is no evidence on the effect of financial incentives on pensioners’ decision to unretire andre-enter the labor force.In light of increasing efforts to activate the older population, understanding how full-time retirees respond to financial incentives is important. Between 2016 and 2050, the percent of the world's population aged 65 and over is expected to increase from 9 percent to 17 percent (NIH 2016). Thus, without effective policies that extend the working lives of the population, and encourage retirees to reenter the workforce, the public finance effects will be substantial. However, a lack of exogenous variation in pension income among full-time retirees has prevented previous literature from examining the relationship between income and pensioners’ decision to unretire.In this paper, we overcome this obstacle by exploiting a feature of the Swedish pension system that caused differential and unexpected benefit cuts among otherwise identical pensioners in aregression discontinuity design. This allows us to provide the first estimates in the literature on the labor supply response to income shocks among full-time retirees. Understanding thelabor supply behaviorof fully-retired individuals is of independent interest and provides important insights on labor supply decisions across the lifecycle. In addition, it provides vital guidance to policymakers tasked with adapting current pension systems in face of ongoing demographic changes.The feature of the pension system that we exploit is known as the automatic balancing mechanism (ABM). The ABM automatically ensures the solvency of the public pension system by tying pension payouts to the ratio of assets to liabilities in the system. When this ratio drops below one, pension benefits are cut to eliminate the deficit. When the ratio recovers and exceeds one, a period of catch-up occurs with higher rates ofindexationand accumulation. The catch-up period ends when the pension benefits are equal to what they would have been absent ABM activation. Thus, the income lost due to the ABM is never recovered. First introduced by Sweden in 2001, a number of countries across the globe – including Canada, Germany, and Japan – have introduced elements of this mechanism into their pension systems. As this feature is becoming increasingly integrated into pension systems around the world, understanding its effect on pensioners is crucial.The Swedish pension system fell out of balance for the first time in 2010. Consequently, the ABM activated and cut pension benefits. The ABM remained in effect until 2018, and between 2010 and 2018 almost $7.8 billion was lost in pension benefits.2This is equivalent to the total public expenditure on health care and social welfare by the national government in any given year (2018/19:SoU1 2018). The largest loss occurred in 2011, in which already retired individuals lost between 0 and 7 percent of their total annual pension benefits. This loss is equivalent to more than 9 months of the average pensioner's total food consumption in that year (MinPension 2020). Importantly, this is a sizable benefit change compared to other international pension benefit reforms,3and therefore represents an ideal setting for studying the labor supply response of retirees to income shocks.4By lowering pension benefits, the ABM unintentionally incentivizes pension-eligible workers to remain in the labor force, and retired pensioners to return to work. We use rich population-wide administrative data to examine how this shock affected the labor market behavior of individuals who had left the labor force and entered full-time retirement prior to the activation of the ABM. While institutional restrictions prevent us from studying the impact of the shock on older workers’ decision to delay retirement, questions related to delaying retirement have been studied at length elsewhere (e.g.Jensen and Richter 2004; Coile and Gruber 2007;Behaghel and Blau 2012;Laun 2017).5The causal effect of adverse income shocks on individuals’ decision to unretire, however, has to the best of our knowledge never been examined before. Importantly, retirement is not an absorbing state— between 6 and 14 percent of retirees reverse their retirement decision after having exited the labor force in Sweden (Pettersson 2014), and more than 26 percent of retirees do the same in the US (Maestas 2010). Pettersson (2014) also shows that higher pension benefits are negatively correlated with unretirement. This implies a potentially important role for financial incentives in altering the unretirement behavior of individuals, and understanding the causal link between unretirement and financial incentives is therefore of great independent value.We use a regression discontinuity design, leveraging the fact that the magnitude of the shock changes discontinuously at pre-specified thresholds in the pension scheme. Specifically, pensioners who received almost identical public pensions prior to ABM activation were exposed to substantially different shocks depending on which side of a specific benefit level threshold they were located, with income losses ranging from 0 percent to 7 percent of their annual pension benefits. We exploit these discontinuities (each corresponding to a loss of approximately 3.5 percent of their annual pension benefits) to examine the impact of negative income shocks on the labor market outcomes of pensioners who had left the labor force and entered full-time retirement prior to the ABM. We also conduct a detailed analysis on the effect of the income shock on the health of the affected individuals, proxied by their utilization of the health care system. This is motivated in part by existing evidence on a positive relationship between income and health, and in part by the idea that any potential unretirement behavior among retirees may translate into worsened health. To correctly identify the value of the running variable required for our RD design, the baseline analysis is restricted to single households with no private pension insurance. InSection 6, we show that including individuals with private pension insurance, or restricting the sample to married individuals, has no impact on the results.The main contribution of our paper is to provide novel evidence on the labor supply of already retired individuals. This is a difficult question to address empirically, because the political cost of cutting benefits for already retired individuals is extremely high. There is therefore very little plausibly exogenous variation in benefit cuts among the retired population. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper in the literature to examine the labor supply of already retired individuals, and the first paper to provide an estimate of the income elasticity of the retired population. However, there are several relevant strands of literature that have explored the impact of financial and other retirement incentives among older (non-retired) workers.First, there is a rich and growing literature examining the effects of the Earnings Test for Social Security (AET) in the US, which reduces theSocial Security benefitsof individuals if they earn above a certain amount and decide to retire prior to the normal retirement age. Prior studies on the AET have found moderatesubstitution elasticitieson the intensive margin (e.g. Friedberg, 1998; Friedberg, 2000; Song and Manchester, 2007;Gelber et al., 2020a; Engelhardt and Kumar 2009; Engelhardt and Kumar 2014), and more recent work has identified effects on the extensive margin as well (e.g.Gelber et al., 2020b). However, the AET provides a marginal incentive (a change in the net-of-tax rate, i.e. the marginal gain from additional earnings), and has no income effect for full-time retired individuals. This policy can therefore not be used to examine the labor supply of already retired individuals. In contrast, the Swedish ABM creates a pure income effect for full-time retired individuals, providing us with an ideal setting for exploring the relationship between income and unretirement.More broadly, the paper contributes to the literature on financial incentives and retirement behavior (e.g.,Jensen and Richter 2004; Snyder and Evans 2006; Coile and Gruber 2007;Behaghel and Blau 2012;Chetty et al., 2013;Brown 2013;Johansson et al., 2016;Manoli and Weber 2016;Laun 2017;Malkova 2020; Seibold 2021;Haller 2021). These papers exploit exogenous variation intaxrates and pension benefits to study the interaction between the labor supply of older workers and their financial situation. A number of these studies have found significant labor market effects induced by incentives that are of a very similar magnitude to those studied in this paper. For example, Snyder and Evans (2006) exploits a social securitynotchthat generated a four percent change in annual income – similar to the difference between any two of our groups – and find statistically significant and economically meaningful labor market effects.6However, recent papers in this literature also suggest that responses to purely financial incentives may have more modest effects, especially compared to the influence of reference ages (Behaghel-Blau 2012;Manoli-Weber 2016, 2018; Seibold 2021). Responses may therefore be smaller, or even zero, for already-retired individuals. The distinct contribution of our paper is to examine how pensioners that have exited the labor force respond to negative income shocks, something that cannot be identified in these papers.Finally, the paper contributes to the literature on unearned income effects in labor supply more generally, where evidence is limited and based on specific contexts, such as winning a lottery (e.g., Imbens et al. 2001;Lindahl 2005; Cesarini et al. 2017). This literature finds modest reductions in labor supply as a result of increased unearned income. However, none of these have been able to isolate the effects of income shocks on existing retirees. Studying full-time retirees is of great independent interest, not only because their behavior likely differs from working individuals for many reasons, but also because it represents a particularlyvulnerable groupthat cannot adjust their labor market behavior on the intensive margin.We provide two sets of key results. First, we estimate precise null effects of the income shock on the labor market outcomes of full-time retirees, and conclude that pensioners in retirement do not return to work despite losing a meaningful share of their annual income. Specifically, we can rule out response elasticities larger than 0.051 at the 95 percent confidence level. Importantly, this precisely estimated null effect extends to retirees who have limited savings (proxied bywealthand lack of private pension savings), who face little demand-side obstacles to reentering the labor force (proxied by the local unemployment rate), who recently entered full-time retirement, and to the youngest age cohorts in our sample. The lack of an employment response is an interesting result given existing studies which have used considerably smaller-sized income shocks to identify meaningful labor supply responses among workers. For example,Haller (2021)studies pension reforms in Austria that generated a 1.25 percent reduction in future benefits, and finds that this 1.25 percent change in benefits leads to an increase in employment at age 60 of around 10 percent.Mullen and Staubli (2016)examines a series of disability insurance reforms in Austria, some of which led to no more than a 1 percent change in disability insurance benefits, and finds significant increases in disability insurance claiming. Snyder and Evans (2006) find that a four percent change in annual income caused individuals to delay retirement.7These papers illustrate that financial incentives of smaller or similar magnitudes to those examined in the current paper have been shown to alter the labor market behavior of individuals in meaningful ways. While we acknowledge that the above studies have focused on individuals of working age rather than on retirees, we believe that it is of great independent value to understand whether individuals who have left the labor force and entered retirement are equally responsive to such shocks. Specifically, it helps us better understand the relationship between financial incentives and unretirement, and how large financial shocks may have to be in order to induce extensive margin response among retirees.Our second key result is that the negative income shock has no effect on the health of retirees, as measured by health care utilization. While this is consistent with papers documenting a lack of health effects associated with income changes among older individuals (e.g.Adams et al., 2003;Lindahl 2005;Michaud and van Soest 2008), we are the first to show that this also holds for retired pensioners – a group of individuals who cannot respond to income shocks along the intensive margin of labor supply.In terms of contextualizing our findings, Sweden is located in the middle of the OECD ranking in terms of public pension generosity, slightly above the US and Canada but far below countries such as Austria and Portugal (OECD 2017). Thus, while one may expect any potential effects to be larger in settings where the baseline pension is lower, and smaller in settings where the baseline pension is higher, the Swedish setting is likely informative of similar-sized cuts in a large number of OECD countries.The results from our analysis have important policy implications. Specifically, the almost perfectly inelastic labor supply response to income shocks demonstrates that policies that alter the income of pensioners in retirement will likely not induce them to return to work; at least not at the margin relevant to policymakers and social planners. Specifically, provided that the income shock is large enough, it will eventually force individuals to unretire. However, in terms of international comparisons, a 3.5 percent drop in pension benefits is relatively substantial. For example, Norway raised the minimum pension with $400 a year in 2020, Sweden raised public pensions with $40 per month in 2021, New York raised the contribution requirement with 3 percent following the financial crisis in 2008, and Austria has engaged in several pension reforms over the past 30 years, some of which shifted the average pension income of individuals by less than 3 percent.8Thus, changes to the benefit levels of existing public pension systems are oftentimes of a magnitude similar to that studied in the current paper, and studying the labor supply response to this shock is therefore of particular interest. However, we also acknowledge that retirees will respond to an income shock provided that the income shock is large enough. An interesting avenue for future research is therefore to understand how big the benefit change must be for inducing individuals to unretire, and we encourage future research on this topic.In addition to the policy implications associated with the null result on labor market behavior, the lack of health care utilization effects suggest that the externalities associated with the ABM approach of ensuring macro-level fiscal sustainability of the pension system may be small. That is, the lack of an employment and health utilization response suggest that a reduction in benefit levels may have little impact on individuals in our context while at the same time ensuring financial sustainability of the system. At the height of a global crisis where pension funds are rapidly losing value, these results may be particularly important.The rest of the paper proceeds as follows: InSection 2, we provide detailed information on the Swedish pension system and the automatic balancing mechanism; InSection 3, we introduce the data, discuss our estimation strategy, and examine our identifying assumptions; InSection 4, we provide our main results on benefit cuts, labor market outcomes, and health utilization; InSection 5, we discuss heterogeneoustreatment effectsacross genders, age, wealth, and prior labor force attachment; InSection 6we explore the robustness of our results; Section 7 concludes.",Julian,Alexander,None
"1. IntroductionLabormarket efficiencydepends critically on effectively matching workers with firms. As cities have been decentralized and specialization has increased,spatial mismatchhas been hypothesized as a potential barrier preventing workers from finding employment at firms and in occupations that best fit their abilities. As first highlighted byKain (1968),1spatial mismatch occurs when workers are spatially disconnected from jobs as a result of limited residential mobility or a scarcity of local jobs. A stream of the spatial mismatch literature specifically emphasizes the lack of transportation resources such as private vehicles (i.e., transportation mismatch) as an important cause of disconnection between workers and jobs. Although spatial or transportation mismatch can play an important and growing role in the labor market, evidence for its empirical effects on labor market outcomes and the effectiveness of policies designed to address it remains scant. Previous studies often lack exogenous variation of job accessibility, which is subject to the problem of reverse causality between accessibility and labor market outcomes.In this paper I analyze the causal effects of improved job accessibility using recentpolicy reforms: granting driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants. Prior to the reforms, many undocumented immigrants were unable to drive legally because of restrictions on driver’s licenses, which exacerbated the spatial mismatch they experienced. Beginning especially in 2013, a wave of state-level reforms removed legal barriers to obtaining licenses, granting undocumented immigrants significantly greater mobility and independence. To explicate these ideas, I first present a simple search-and-matching model that illustrates the employment effects of reducedcommutingcosts resulting from license reforms. Then, using the policy variation in event-study, difference-in-differences, and triple difference models, I identify the impacts of the license reforms on vehicle ownership and commuting patterns. I then examine the consequences for employment outcomes and two underlying mechanisms behind the employment effects, which are spatial frictions and the level of vehicle-dependency associated with a given occupation.The analysis in this paper depends crucially on identifying undocumented immigrants from survey data, which does not usually reflect such sensitive information. To do so, I use an imputation method to identify undocumented immigrants in survey data, originated byWarren and Passel (1987)and developed byBorjas (2017). I first identify documented immigrants among the foreign born in the datasets using characteristics such as citizenship status or year of US entry. The residual group of all the other foreign born individuals is then classified as potentially undocumented immigrants.2I find that driver’s license reforms resulted in economically meaningfully improvements in labor market outcomes for undocumented workers. I first show significant increases in vehicle ownership and the probability of car commute for undocumented immigrants. The vehicle ownership rate and probability of commuting by car increase by 2 to 3 percentage points. This result confirms that the license reforms had large first-order policy effects on undocumented immigrants, improving their accessibility through increases in vehicle ownership. I then show that granting driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants increases their employment rate by 1 percentage point.There are two main mechanisms underlying the commuting and employment effects of issuing driver’s licenses to the undocumented: spatial frictions and the level of vehicle-dependency associated with a given occupation. First, the effects of license reforms are examined by reference to area-level accessibility for undocumented immigrants, which is measured by the difference in the mean transit time between undocumented and documented immigrants. I find that the positive impacts of license reforms are large in localities where undocumented immigrants suffer from poorer accessibility with longer transit times than documented workers experience. These localities tend to be rural areas and smaller cities, where jobs are scarce and public transportation is limited.Second, the effects of license reforms are broken down according to the extent to which each occupation requires workers to drive vehicles. The measure of occupation-related vehicle-dependency, which shows how important driving vehicles is to job performance, is obtained using O*NET tasks and activities data. For undocumented immigrants, the positive employment effects are concentrated in more vehicle-dependent occupations, such as agriculture workers, manufacturing workers, construction laborers, plumbers, or sales workers. These occupations tend to be more male-dominated, resulting in larger employment effects on males than females, and higher paying for undocumented immigrants. In contrast, I find negative employment effects in low vehicle-dependent occupations, such as maids and housekeeping cleaners. This implies that undocumented workers shifts from low vehicle-dependent to high vehicle-dependent occupations as a result of license reforms3This paper makes the following contributions to the existing literature. First, it adds to the spatial mismatch literature using a novel policy variation that can directly improve employment accessibility for minorities. There is a voluminous body of literature on the spatial mismatch hypothesis, such asBrueckner and Zenou (2003),Hellerstein et al. (2008),Andersson et al. (2018).4Also,Ong (2002),Raphael and Rice (2002),Cervero et al. (2002),Gurley and Bruce (2005),Baum (2009)focus specifically on “transportation mismatch,” analyzing the relationship between vehicle ownership and labor market outcomes.5An empirical challenge to identifying a causal effect of spatial or transportation mismatch on employment outcomes has emerged, however, because of reverse causality or omitted variable bias (Glaeser, 1996). Unlike previous papers, many of which use primarilyinstrumental variablesto address these problems, I analyze an exogenous policy reform that can directly improve job accessibility. Moreover, I show empirically that the effects of issuing driver’s licenses is stronger in places characterized by lower accessibility, connecting the traditional spatial mismatch literature with the transportation mismatch literature that emphasizes the role of private vehicles. Furthermore, I examine shifts inoccupational choiceinduced by improved job accessibility, which has not been fully explored in prior works on spatial (or transportation) mismatch.6The second contribution involves analyzing the policy effects of granting driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants. In particular, I show the large impacts of license reforms on vehicle ownership and means of commuting in this population. Other works have examined the effects of driver’s license policy targeting undocumented immigrants.Cáceres and Jameson (2015)study how restricting undocumented immigrants from obtaining driver’s licenses in the earlier periods affected insurance premiums.Lueders et al. (2017)focus on the impact of license reform on accidents in California.In a recent paper that was released while this paper was in progress,Amuedo-Dorantes et al. (2020)also examine the effects of license reforms on labor market outcomes for likely undocumented immigrants using the same dataset. My paper differs substantially from that study, however, in the following ways. First, I find first-order policy effects on vehicle ownership and car commuting, which is an important link between license reforms and labor market outcomes. Also, I establish the labor market findings more rigorously, especially significant employment effects that are not shown in the other paper, with a number of robustness and heterogeneity analyses.7In addition, I identify the spatial and occupation mechanisms behind the positive employment effects on undocumented immigrants, which provides a more complete picture of the effects of license reforms. Moreover,Amuedo-Dorantes et al. (2020)restrict the sample to low-skilled non-citizen Hispanics, while I do not impose such a restriction, showing the effects on the general undocumented population using the methodology recently introduced byBorjas (2017).8The paper proceeds as follows. InSection 2, I provide a conceptual framework for the effects of license reforms. InSection 3, I sketch the timeline of license reforms. InSection 4, I describe the data and introducedescriptive statistics. InSection 5, I outline empirical strategies used in the analysis. InSection 6, I discuss the effects of license reforms on vehicle ownership. InSection 7, I analyze how license reforms affect commuting and employment outcomes.Sections 8and9focus on the two mechanisms underlying the license reforms: spatial and occupation mechanisms. I conclude inSection 10.",Heepyung,None,None
"1. IntroductionTechnology has transformed economies throughout history, fundamentally altering production possibilities and processes, consumption patterns, as well as the rewards for the different kinds of skills that workers bring to the labor market. Modern technologies such as machine learning and robotics are set to continue this trend, perhaps at an unprecedented speed and scale.We can readily see signs of the transformative effects of new technologies on labor markets. During the last 40 years we have witnessed sizable shifts in the wage and occupational structures of the economy, reductions in the share of income accruing to labor in many sectors and countries, and systematic changes in the types of skills demanded by firms.1Yet, researchers and policymakers are still trying to grasp the scale and impact of these changes and how policy should respond.To better understand how new technologies transform labor markets, and what the consequences are for workers and society, Labor Economics put together a special issue on “Technology and the Labor Market.” The issue includes seven articles shedding light on a wide range of topics such as the technological drivers of sectoral and occupational employment shifts (Bárány and Siegel, 2020,Gaggl et al., 2021); the consequences of these shifts for individual workers and how workers adapt to the changing labor market environment (Blien et al., 2021;Cortes et al., 2020); the effect of government policy, namely the minimum wage, on technology adoption and labor demand (Downey, 2021); and finally, emerging phenomena such as the gig economy (Bracha and Burke, 2021) and the rising demand for skills related to artificial intelligence (Alekseeva et al., 2021).We briefly summarize these articles inSections 2–5. We discuss some of the lessons learned inSection 6.",Georg,Pascual,Oskar
"1. IntroductionMany countries are home to large numbers of unauthorized immigrants.3Despite lacking the right to reside or work legally, unauthorized immigrants contribute in significant ways to the economies of the host countries. Roughly 11 million unauthorized immigrants live in the United States, comprising 5% of the labor force and contributing over 3% of GDP (Edwards and Ortega, 2017). Legalization of undocumented workers is widely debated by policy-makers and social scientists. While questions of human rights and ethics are foundational to these debates, so are questions related to the economic effects of legalization for host countries.A large body of literature shows that the wages and working conditions of undocumented immigrants increase when they gain legal status. In the context of the United States, many studies have supported this claim based on the 1986 IRCA legalization (Amuedo-Dorantes, Bansak, Raphael, 2007,Kossoudji, Cobb-Clark, 2002,Lozano, Sorensen, 2011,Pan, 2012,Rivera-Batiz, 1999) and, more recently, on the 2012 DACA program providing temporary work permits to undocumented youth (Amuedo-Dorantes, Antman, 2017,Pope, 2016).However, the previous evidence is insufficient to answer some key concerns in the debate about the economic effects of legalization, such as the aggregate effects on GDP and on government coffers. Answering these questions requires distinguishing how much of the wage increase upon gaining legal status can be attributed to a gain in productivity versus other factors, such as the loss of employers’ ability to exploit undocumented workers. While the latter mainly entails income redistribution from employers to formerly undocumented workers, productivity increases generate a net increase in income (and tax revenue) for the host country. Quantifying the undocumented productivity penalty is crucial in structural analyses aimed at estimating the net economic contribution of undocumented workers and simulating the effects of legalization on GDP, the wage structure and government coffers (Edwards, Ortega, 2017,Machado, 2017,Ortega, Edwards, Hsin, 2019,Peri, Zaiour)).Identifying the productivity gains associated with gaining legal status is a challenging task. While hard to quantify with precision, several studies have shown that unauthorized immigrants suffer wage exploitation (Bartolucci, 2014,Brown, Hotchkiss, Quispe-Agnoli, 2013,Gleeson, Gonzales, 2012). At the same time, there is clear evidence that (implicit) occupational barriers lead to occupational mismatch and diminish worker productivity (Hsieh, Hurst, Jones, Klenow, 2019,Weeden, 2002). The labor market opportunities of undocumented workers are almost certainly diminished by occupational barriers in similar ways (Abrego, 2011,Amuedo-Dorantes, Antman, 2017). These barriers vary importantly across occupations, reflecting regulatory constraints, such as legal residence requirements associated with licenses, as well as the nature of the specific tasks involved in each occupation. For instance, the need to hold face-to-face interactions with customers or government agencies, or to travel extensively, exposes undocumented workers to apprehension and deportation. Besides reducing the productivity of undocumented workers in these occupations, these entry barriers are likely to distort theiroccupational choices.Our paper presents a new strategy to identify the productivity penalty associated with lack of legal status. We lay out a theoretical model where heterogeneous workers choose occupations (as in the Roy model). Some occupations entail tasks that require legal status. As a result, undocumented workers in these occupations suffer a productivity loss that entailslower wagesand acts as an entry barrier into those occupations and distorts their occupational choices. In addition, employers may exploit undocumented workers in all occupations, paying them wages below productivity. The theoretical analysis suggests an empirical strategy to identify which occupations have entry barriers for undocumented workers, clarifies the factors that determine the productivity and wage gaps between documented and undocumented workers, and shows how to estimate the undocumented productivity penalty. Additionally, the model also illustrates the labor market effects of legalization in terms of occupational switching, wage growth and net economic gains. An important lesson of our analysis is that exact identification of the undocumented productivity penalty is infeasible due to endogenous occupational sorting in terms of unobserved idiosyncratic productivity. However, even in this scenario, we derive alower boundfor the productivity loss associated with lack of legal status.The second part of the paper goes on to implement this strategy using a special extract of theAmericanCommunitySurvey(ACS) that also includes a sophisticated imputation to identify likely undocumented individuals. Our empirical analysis has two main findings. First, we identify the occupations with the largest entry barriers to undocumented workers. Many of these occupations require legal status (e.g. teachers and nurses) or entail tasks that involve driving, long-distance travel or face-to-face interaction with the public and government officials (e.g. managers, secretaries or salespersons). These tasks cannot be accomplished in full by undocumented workers, reducing their productivity in these jobs and distorting their career choices. Secondly, we estimate that the productivity penalty associated with lack of legal status is upwards of 12 percent and affects roughly one third of all undocumented workers. This finding implies that legalization would increase GDP and we quantify this increase to beat least0.96% per year.Our analysis is not only relevant in the United States. Unauthorized immigration is pervasive in high-income countries that are in geographical proximity to countries with demographic, economic or political pressures (Orrenius and Zavodny, 2016). Several studies have used European data to analyze the economic effects of legalization. For instance,Monras et al. (2017)empirically analyze a large legalization process in Spain. Among other findings, they show that legal status increased the labor market opportunities of immigrants. Along similar lines,Devillanova et al. (2018)study the effect of theprospectof legal status on the employment of undocumented immigrants in Italy, finding a positive effect. Inevitably, an important factor in the discussions on whether to provide legal status to undocumented workers in receiving countries is the consequences of such a policy for GDP and the public coffers. As argued above, these effects rely crucially on whether legal status increases the productivity of undocumented workers or simply redistributes income from employers to employees.The structure of the paper is the following.Section 2summarizes the relevant literature.Section 3presents our theoretical analysis.Section 4presents the data anddescriptive statistics.Section 5estimates the gaps in occupational shares between documented and undocumented workers,Section 6estimates the undocumented productivity penalty, andSection 7concludes.",Francesc,Amy,None
"1. IntroductionAs a response to the outbreak of COVID-19, many countries have implemented far-reaching measures to contain the spread of the virus, leading to a mass social experiment in remote work arrangements. Due to severe contact restrictions, the number of people who work from home increased substantially. Various recent studies have documented the extent of remote work during the pandemic and measured the ability toteleworkin different occupations.1Yet, it is still unclear how this experience will affect the willingness of employers to offer teleworking in the future.Changes due to the pandemic may have long-lasting effects on the organization of work. While remote work used to be rather the exception than the norm in many firms, employers might increasingly consider such arrangements. First, the experience during the pandemic could have changed the attitudes towards teleworking. If workers can be equally productive at home, skeptical employers might have become more positive towards remote work arrangements. Also workers might have learned about benefits of teleworking that they were not aware of before. Second, many firms have invested in hardware and internet access to make teleworking feasible during the crisis, and workers have learned how to use collaborative software.In this study, we analyze how the pandemic has affected remote work options of new vacancies in the first year of the crisis. We examine the job description of vacancy postings on the largest online job board in Austria and match expressions that are commonly used to describe remote work. We define a vacancy asteleworkableif at least one such expression is mentioned. Using these matches as proxy for the willingness of employers to offer teleworking allows us to quantify whether remote work options have become more common during the crisis.Our results show that the number of job postings with teleworking reference increased substantially during the course of the pandemic. 14 months after the onset of the crisis, we observe that employers are 2–3 times as likely to offer remote work options to job applicants. This effect is particularly pronounced for jobs that require at least a degree from a higher secondary school. This group of jobs already offered teleworking more frequently before the crisis. Analyzing changes in occupations, we further show that this effect is not driven by an increase in the demand forteleworkableoccupations. We neither find evidence that the change can be attributed to a relative increase in vacancies byteleworking-friendlyfirms, that is firms which frequently offer teleworking in their job postings. This suggests that employers have become more willing to offer telework options. Although many restrictions were loosened again during the summer of 2020, the impact persists throughout the year.To validate our results, we repeat the analysis using two alternative teleworking measures, which are constructed from the O*NET database and the American Time Use Survey (seeDingel and Neiman (2020);Hensvik et al. (2020)). Merging these measures to occupations of job ads, we observe a high correlation between all three classifications. In line with our previous finding, neither of the two alternatives provides evidence for an increase in the relative demand for teleworkable occupations.Our measure of telework options should be interpreted with caution. Even for more educated workers, who have a degree from a higher secondary school or (applied) university, the share of job postings with references to remote work was just 1.5 percent before the crisis and, despite substantial relative increases, remained on a low level one year after the onset of the crisis (3.5%). The absence of a teleworking reference in ad texts does not imply that employers will never offer it. And vice versa, if we observe a reference, it is not clear if and to what extent workers make use of such an option. The measure should rather be regarded as a proxy of general employer attitudes towards teleworking, which can foster both full-time telework arrangements and hybrid models.Several papers document the prevalence and consequences of working from home.Oettinger (2011)investigates the growth in home-based work from 1980 to 2000. His findings suggest that employer costs of providing home-based work arrangements have decreased and that advances in information technology might be an important source of these falling costs. There is little evidence of the productivity gains or losses from switching to remote work arrangements yet. Conducting a randomized controlled trial within the call center of a Chinese travel agency,Bloom et al. (2015)show that working from home can increase performance. Many workers would also welcome more telework options.Mas and Pallais (2017)document that the average worker is willing to give up 8 percent of wages to work from home.Since the beginning of the pandemic, there has been a remarkable volume of research on the potential of remote work to respond to the crisis.Dingel and Neiman (2020)use occupational descriptions from the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) to estimate the degree to which different occupations in the United States can be done remotely. They find that 37 percent of jobs in the United States can be performed entirely at home.Boeri et al. (2020)find similar results for Italy (24%), France (28%), Germany (29%), Spain (25%), Sweden (31%) and the United Kingdom (31%).Recent survey evidence shows how the pandemic has affected telework. According to a survey conducted in 26 EU countries byEurofound (2020), 37 percent of workers started to telework due to the pandemic. Austria is among the countries with the largest proportion of workers who switched to remote work arrangements (41%). Pointing to the potential benefits of teleworking, the same study finds that in countries where more people began working from home, fewer workers reported that their working time decreased. For the United States,Bick et al. (2020)find that about 35 percent of the workforce worked entirely from home in May 2020, up from 8.2 percent in February 2020.Brynjolfsson et al. (2020)report that nearly half of the individuals they surveyed said they were working from home during the first week of April 2020. Survey evidence byBarrero et al. (2020)shows that both workers and employers have become more positive towards remote work arrangements during the crisis.Our study adds to this literature by providing direct evidence on how employers change their demand for teleworking as a response to the pandemic. We interpret our finding as an increase in the willingness of employers to offer remote work if the job can be done remotely. While new communication technologies make it increasingly possible to work from home, the pandemic might further accelerate the shift towards more flexible work arrangements. This pattern is in line with evidence from a recent study byHershbein and Kahn (2018), who show that recessions can accelerate structural changes in the labor market.",Omar,Lennart,None
"1. IntroductionWe use the natural experiment of local resource booms and busts in Indonesia as an opportunity to study the response of family formation outcomes toeconomic conditions. Our analysis is motivated by several studies documenting the effects of resource booms on wage and employment growth (Black, McKinnish, Sanders, 2005,Jacobsen, Parker, 2016,Marchand, 2012,Michaels, 2010), and the long literature studying the relationship between income andwealthand the demand for children (Amialchuk, 2013,Bar, Leukhina, 2010,Black, Kolesnikova, Sanders, Taylor, 2013,Clark, 2005,Galor, 2005,Heckman, Walker, 1990,Kearney, Wilson, 2018,Lindo, 2010).In this paper, we estimate the effect of economic shocks, through oil booms and busts, on fertility decisions usingIndonesianCensus data from 1970 to 2008. Our analysis compares women’s fertility across regions experiencing a more or less severe boom or bust, depending on the local economy’s oil intensity. Our identification strategy exploits the interaction between exogenoustime seriesvariation in global oil prices and regional variation in resource abundance. For the same change in the world price of oil, regions with more oil experience larger shocks than regions with less oil. Our proxy for resource abundance is the size of preexisting oil endowment in a regency. We argue that economic shocks are independent of unobserved factors correlated with the fertility decision because oil endowments depend on geology and the oil price is set on the world market and exogenous to individuals’ fertility decisions.We find that an increase in oil endowment value per capita increases the probability of having a child in a developing country. The increase in fertility is driven by women of all ages and by both first and higher parity births. We find no evidence that oil endowment value per capita affectsbirth spacing. Taken together, these results suggest the overall increase in fertility is not only driven by women having desired children sooner, but also reflects an increase in completed fertility.We also explore several mechanisms through which oil shocks may affect fertility. We use supplemental data from Indonesia’slabor force surveys, socioeconomic household surveys, and village census to estimate effects of oil endowment value per capita on labor market outcomes,government expenditures, and proxies for healthcare access. We find evidence that oil shocks have a positive effect on households’ economic outcomes, indicating that a positive income effect is an important mechanism.Prior work has found both positive and negative relationships between measures of economic prosperity and fertility, and is mainly from industrialized countries. Several papers have documented the link between higher incomes and significant declines in fertility using time-series data (the “Fertility Transition” or “Demographic Transition”) and a general finding using cross-country data is a clear negative relationship between income and fertility.1More recent work identifies causal effects using exogenous shocks to households’ economic prospects and finds positive income effects on fertility.2We contribute to the existing literature by demonstrating positivenatural resourceshocks lead to increased fertility in a developing country and by providing additional evidence consistent with positive income effects and children being normal goods. Our results are explained mostly by an increase in total fertility, with no changes in birth spacing. Our findings in the context of a country undergoing a demographic transition are interesting in light of documented decliningfertility ratesduring such transitions in other countries, as well as the negative cross-country income-fertility relationship. Indeed, Indonesia provides a very different context from existing work examining the United States. The United States is considerably wealthier, local economies in Indonesia depend to a larger extent on natural resources, and in Indonesia, government programs exist to limit fertility while in the United States (and other developed countries), policymakers are instead considering the long-run negative implications of low fertility rates.The paper proceeds as follows.Section 2provides background on oil production and fertility in Indonesia.Section 3details the data andSection 4outlines our empirical strategy.Section 5presents our main results.Section 6then discusses and empirically explores potential mechanisms. Finally,Section 7places our findings in context with prior work and concludes.",Margaret,Paul,None
"1. IntroductionReliability testing of self-reported subjective measures and scales is quite common in the field of psychology but very rare in economics. Reliability refers to the consistency of a measure, and it can be expressed as the proportion of true variance of the variable of interest relative to the total observed variance.1An exception in the economics literature is the study byKrueger and Schkade (2008), who tested the reliability of self-reportedlife satisfactionusing the test–retest methodology.2It is important to test the reliability of subjective self-reported measures in economics with a suitable methodology because the use of this type of variables to explain individuals’ economics decisions has grown dramatically during the last decades.Consider that a researcher wants to evaluate the decision that students face after finishing secondary schooling. They can enter the labour market or continue with university studies; if they decide to pursue higher education, they must also choose a subject to study. The decision to attend higher education is one of the most important of an individual's life since it implies incurring substantial costs. Therefore, in this context, it is not only the individual's tastes or cognitive abilities that play a role in the decision. According tohuman capital theory, one of the most important variables for such a decision is the earnings expectations in different scenarios, that is, with or without university studies. During the last two decades, interest in knowing students’ earnings expectations has increased, and several studies have reported positive results regarding how valuable information can be obtained (Dominitz and Manski, 1996;Manski, 2004). In this regard, we agree withJensen (2010), who claimed that, “Though many studies estimate these returns with earnings data, it is the perceived returns that affect schooling decisions, ” (page 1, abstract).In this context, the initial interest in earnings expectations stems from an interest in using this variable to explain schooling andoccupational choices. Recent evidence has shown that expected earnings elicited in surveys determine individuals’ choice not only of the level of education to achieve (Attanasio and Kaufmann 2014;Belfield et al. 2016;Boneva et al., 2021) but also of the type of university studies to undertake (Arcidiacono et al., 2012;Schweri and Hartog, 2017). Further, empirical evidence has indicated that wage expectations can easily become self-fulfilling in terms of reservation wages (Caliendo et al., 2017), which in turn will determine future earnings in the labour market. Taking all these studies into account, no one can cast doubt on the importance of self-reported earnings expectations in economic analysis.In the literature, some papers analysing earnings expectations have claimed that this variable is likely to be affected by random measurement errors (Arcidiacono et al., 2012;Attanasio and Kaufmann, 2017;Huntington-Klein, 2015;Reuben et al., 2015;Zafar, 2013). However, despite the awareness of the problem, no papers have analysed it. In this literature, due to the lack of empirical evidence on the magnitude of measurement errors, it is most common simply to disregard these concerns or add a very general discussion about reliability. In this paper, we test for the first time the reliability of students’ earnings expectations. We use the test–retest methodology, and we quantify the magnitude of the random measurement error.3We believe this analysis to be important since, as some previous studies cited above have suggested, random measurement errors could be an important concern.Measurement errors in survey questions can occur for many different reasons, and, in this context, it is important to make clear the difference between “validity” and “reliability”. The questions could be vague and open to interpretation and misunderstanding, and the respondents could answer untruthfully or their answer might be driven by some kind of cognitive bias. These types of errors are somehow systematic and related to validity. In previous studies, the proposed solutions to this problem have consisted of reformulating and improving questions to avoid logical inconsistencies (Dominitz, 1998;Manski, 2004;Zafar, 2011). Measurement errors can also occur to different degrees if an interview is conducted or if the respondents self-report the answers; for example, respondents may fail to read the question carefully or mistakenly give the answer incorrectly. These types of errors can be random instead of systematic and affect the reliability of earnings expectations. In this paper, random measurement errors are the type of errors that we study. It is important to keep in mind that the test–retest approach that we use here only capturesrandommeasurement errors. Accordingly, measurement errors that are systematic, such as the ones that we explained above, will not be revealed by this methodology. For example, if the same misinterpretation is made on both test occasions, it cannot be detected in a test–retest study.The concerns regarding the use of variables containing a random measurement error originate from the fact that it will have a harmful impact on regression models. For example, if earnings expectations are measured with errors and used as an explanatory variable, the coefficient associated with this variable and its variance will be biased and the conclusions from the model will not be correct (Carroll et al., 2006). A common assumption is that measurement errors are independent of the true variable, and these are referred to asclassical measurement errors. Textbooks covering measurement errors in linear regression models have often shown that the estimated coefficient for a covariate measured with errors will tend to zero; that is, there is anattenuationbias.Stefanski and Carroll (1985)analysed the problem of covariates measured with errors in logistic regression. The attenuation bias is present in most situations for logistic regression, but they also clarified that, if there is a high imbalance in the sample regarding the amount of zeros and ones, the bias can be in the opposite direction.We study random measurement errors in students’ earnings expectations, and our three main contributions are the following. Firstly, we propose and perform a test–retest analysis of earnings expectations, elicited through a survey carried out with a sample of university students enrolled in a degree in economics and management. Secondly, we quantify the reliability and the measurement error variance, and the random measurement errors in students’ earnings expectations are found to be important. Thirdly, we clarify how random measurement errors can be dealt with in analyses using students’ earnings expectations as a covariate. We show how the measurement error variance that we estimate in our study can be used to gauge the sensitivity of the results from regression models to random measurement errors. Our results indicate that the reliability of students’ earnings expectations is low.The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.Section 2discusses the related literature. InSection 3, we introduce the theoretical foundations of measurement errors and review how reliability in a measure can be evaluated and how this information can be used in other studies.Section 4explains the data. InSection 5, we assess the degree of random measurement errors found in earnings expectations, and illustrate how to use this information with external data. Finally, inSection 6, we summarize and discuss the main implications of our results.",Luis,William,None
"1. IntroductionForced migration around the world has reached unprecedented levels; according to theUNHCR (2021), 79.5 million people were forcibly displaced at the end of 2019. Of these, 26 million were refugees and 73% of these refugees live in countries neighboring their countries of origin. However, the majority of existing studies on the labor market impact of migrant labor supply shocks have focused on developed countries. This paper examines the effects of the mass migration of Syrians on the labor market outcomes of natives in Turkey as of the end of 2015.1The Syrian civil war displaced 13.1 million Syrians—half of the country's population—5.6 million of whom took refuge in other countries by February 2018 (UNHCR, 2018). Turkey was the largest recipient of Syrians and has hosted the highest number of refugees in the world since 2015. By the end of 2015, 2.5 million Syrians were registered in Turkey,2of whom very few had work permits and hence most worked in the informal sector.3In our analysis, we use micro-level data from the 2004–2015 Turkish householdlabor force surveys(THLFS). For identification, we use the variation in the ratio of migrants to natives across 26 NUTS-2 level regions in Turkey over time in a difference-in-differences framework. A threat to identification in our study is that the distribution of supply shocks across regions may not be random because migrants take into consideration labor market conditions across potential destinations in choosing their destination. Therefore, we also use aninstrumental variableapproach that employs a variant of the standard distance instrument in the literature. In identifying the effect of the migrant influx, the massive size of the influx in our context is critical, simply because it dwarfs virtually all other events—correlated with the distance instrument and taking place after the arrival of migrants—that could potentially contaminate the results.The bulk of the studies that examine the labor market effects of immigrants in host countries are in the context of developed countries of North America and Western Europe. Many of these have utilized natural experiments in a context where there is a sudden shift in the labor supply resulting from an exodus of immigrants due to political events in sending countries—as in our context.4The evidence from these studies yields mixed results. While some studies find no notable adverse effects of migrants on competing natives (e.g.,Card, 1990,Hunt 1992,Friedberg 2001), others find much larger adverse effects (e.g.,Glitz 2012,Dustmann et al. 2017). A lively debate continues (e.g.,Borjas 2017vs.Peri and Yasenov 2019), perhaps because disentangling the migrant impact poses several measurement and statistical challenges. Although forced displacement due to armed conflict is becoming increasingly common across less developed countries, few studies exist on the labor market effects of forced migrants.5Therefore, a study examining the labor market effects of a massive forced displacement for the host regions with a credible identification scheme provides valuable knowledge, particularly for less developed countries.In the recent debate on the impact of migrants, a key issue is the identification of native groups who are most likely to be affected by the migrant shock. An important feature of our study is that the institutional setting makes it easier to isolate native groups who are threatened by migrants and those who stand to gain from them. While native workers in the informal sector are threatened by the arrival of Syrians, the fact that very few Syrian migrants in Turkey had work permits serves to shield the native workers in the formal sector from the arrival of Syrians.An important dynamic of the Turkish labor market prior to the arrival of Syrian migrants was that the formal sector had seen a tremendous increase in employment at the expense of employment in the informal sector. According to the THLFS, the percentage of 18- to 64-year-old men employed in the formal sector rose from 41.2% to 49.2% between 2004 and 2011, while that employed in the informal sector dropped from 29.7% to 24.2%.6Moreover, for women, important trends were observed inlabor force participationand employment in this period. The fraction of women in the labor force increased from 26.3% to 33.0% and the fraction of women employed rose from 23.3% to 29.2%.7At the same time, significant regional differences exist in labor market outcomes in Turkey. Hence, not accounting for differential trends in the pre-shock period across regions could cause significant bias both in our OLS and IV frameworks—as shown by a number of recent papers in other settings (Jaeger et al., 2020;Goldsmith-Parkin et al., 2020;Christian and Barret; 2017). Therefore, we pay due attention to the potential pre-existing time trends across regions in our estimation and assess the plausibility of our instrument under various specifications for pre-existing trends.We find that the migrant shock has a null effect on native men's total employment but a positive effect on their average wages. However, we also find suggestive evidence of a reduction in men's wage employment, which is compensated by the rise in their self-employment and unpaid family work. In the informal sector, men's total employment and wage employment fall substantially—particularly in construction, agriculture, and manufacturing. Moreover, the substitutability between native andmigrant workersin the informal sector decreases with rising levels of education and with age for natives. No evidence exists that regional migration flows of natives contribute to the fall in informal employment of native men. On the other hand, the migrant shock has a strong displacement effect on temporary wage workers, many of whom areseasonalmigrant workers from other regions—which is a significant phenomenon in Turkey, particularly in agriculture and construction.In the formal sector, men's employment increases, neutralizing the drop in informal employment. This effect particularly stems from wage employment in themanufacturing sectorand self-employment in theservices sector. We also find a positive effect on men's wage employment and suggestive evidence of an increase in men's wages in the formal sector, which is consistent with an outward shift of thelabor demandcurve. We provide explanations for this rise in labor demand in the formal sector.General equilibriumeffects and capital investment play an important role, in addition to the complementarity between informal Syrian workers and formal male native workers. We find evidence for a rise in prices in the product market, as migrants increase the consumption base more than the production base. An increase in capital investment in the treatment regions also takes place, as the productivity of capital in these regions increases with the massive labor supply shock.For native women, although no adverse effects on average wages exist, we find suggestive evidence of a reduction in wage employment. Unlike for men, self-employment and unpaid family work do not make up for this reduction. Women's total employment also decreases among less-educated and older women. The migrant impact on women's part-time employment is particularly adverse. In terms of the sector of employment, the negative effects onwomen's employmentare primarily driven by agriculture and services. Most women who lose their jobs leave the labor force, and we do not observe an increase in unemployment. In terms of total employment, the migrant impact is more adverse for women than men primarily because native women do not benefit from the migrant shock in terms of increased employment opportunities in the formal sector—unlike native men.The mass migration of Syrians into Turkey has already drawn the attention of researchers on its impact on natives’ labor market outcomes (Ceritoğlu et al., 2017;del Carpio and Wagner, 2016). Before concluding our paper, we demonstrate with replications important methodological limitations of these papers and compare our findings with theirs—some of which are significantly different. Moreover, these studies do not allow for differential pre-existing time trends across regions in their estimation; however, we show that this creates a substantial bias for several key outcomes in this setting.8In our paper, we use richer data; the number of refugees in 2015 is significantly higher than those in earlier years. Our paper is also more methodical in its analysis of labor market outcomes by formality status, gender, age, and education of natives so that we can understand the distributional effects of the migrant influx at a finer level.We not only improve upon the data, methodology, and scope of the existing work but also introduce several novel elements. First, we uncoverchannelsthat help explain our findings, including general equilibrium effects and capital investment. Second, our analysis by type and sector of employment of natives and our examination of wage and wage employment together so as to be able to interpret the findings in a labor market equilibrium framework are novel. Third, we have several key novel findings: (i) wages in the formal sector increase for men (particularly for non-college-educated, younger (below 40), and full-time workers); (ii) a transition occurs from wage employment to self-employment and unpaid family work for men; (iii) men's full-time employment rises at the expense of part-time employment, (iv)women's wageemployment in the formal sector falls, especially for less-educated and older women—the groups for which the post-2008 employment subsidy program generated the most jobs, (v) temporary wage workers, many of whom areseasonalmigrant workers, are substantially displaced while no evidence exists for a change in outmigration of less-educated natives from the treatment regions; (vi) increases in consumer prices and net firm openings contribute to the rising demand for formal native workers.9In comparison to studies in other contexts of forced migration, while some of our findings are essentially similar, others are peculiar. The fact that the mostvulnerable groupsin the labor market—such as temporary wage workers, less-educated or young workers in the informal sector, and women who are part-time employed or self-employed—are adversely affected by the migrant shock is similar to the findings for Colombia (Bozzoli et al., 2013;Calderon-Mejia and Ibanez, 2016;Morales, 2017).10However, while adverse wage effects on natives are more pronounced in the Colombian context, adverse employment effects dominate in the informal market in Turkey. We find that employment of natives in the formal sector expands, which is similar to the findings ofAlix-Garcia and Bartlett (2015)andRuiz and Vargas-Silva (2015)for Sudan and Tanzania, respectively. However, in our context, it is not only the better-off individuals who benefit in the formal sector; employment of less-educated natives also substantially expands in the formal sector. Another unique finding for the Turkish case is the strong positive employment and wage effects in the formal sector, especially for the manufacturing sector. At the same time, it is important to note that these are relatively short-term effects. AsMorales (2017)finds in the Colombian setting, these effects might dissipate over time. Finally, as in several other studies in less-developed countries, we find a positive impact of refugees on consumer prices.11This fact, coupled with the adverse labor market effects on the most vulnerable groups, implies thatpovertymight increase among these native groups.12",Ege,Refik,Murat

"1. IntroductionThe starting point of the search-and-matching approach tolabor market analysisis that it takes time and effort for workers to find desirable employers and for firms to find suitable employees. This approach can rationalize the coexistence of unemployed workers and vacancies, a key feature of labor markets, and it provides a coherent framework with which to study the process of matching in labor markets. While the empirical literature has documented a large set of facts about workers’ job-search process, including the speed of job finding and its dependence on workers’ observable characteristics and labor market conditions, the firm side of the market has been studied much less, largely due to a lack of appropriate data. A deeper understanding of when and how firms recruit, however, is essential for attaining a complete picture of the workings of labor markets both at the micro and at the macro level.This paper uses uniquely detailed data from Denmark to document a novel set of empirical facts about firms’ search process. We find that firms’ vacancy-posting is associated with a significant increase in the hiring rate over several months and that the magnitude and timing of this increase is heterogeneous across firms of different sizes, growth rates, productivity andindustry. Furthermore, we find that vacancy-posting increases following a rise in a firm’s separation rate, consistent with replacement hiring, and following growth in firm output, measured by revenue or value added.We merge a large dataset of online jobadvertisementsfrom 2003 to 2009 with a matched employer-employee dataset, with detailed information about individual labor market spells and transitions, and a firm-level VAT-account dataset, which provides information on firm revenues, purchases and value added. We measure firm recruiting effort at the extensive margin (whether the firm posts any advertisements in a given month or quarter) and the intensive margin (the firm’s vacancy rate in a given month or quarter) and call this effort “vacancy-posting”.The first part of our analysis examines the association between vacancy-posting and hiring outcomes at the firm level. At the extensive margin, we find that vacancy-posting is associated with an increase of 4.4 percentage points in a firm’s monthly hiring rate, a rise of more than 70% over the baseline no-vacancy hiring rate. We find that 85% of this effect occurs in the month of vacancy-posting and the subsequent month. The hiring rate when no vacancies are posted is quantitatively large, consistent with the findings in the literature (e.g.Davis et al., 2013). At the intensive margin, we find a relatively weak linear association between the vacancy rate and the hiring rate.Bagger and Galenianos (2021)use a more flexible specification that allows for a nonlinear association on the same data and find a quantitatively and statistically significant relationship. Our findings suggest that online advertisements play an important, though not exclusive, role in firms’ recruiting process and that this process can be quite lengthy and diverse across firms.We decompose the vacancy-posting and hiring rate relationship into hiring from employment and non-employment, based on newly-hired workers’ labor market status in the previous month. Vacancy-posting is associated with a doubling of the hiring rate from employment and a 50% increase in the hiring rate from non-employment, and that the former materialize at a slower pace than the latter.In our firm heterogeneity analysis we find that, following vacancy-posting, firms with lower employment,lower wages, lower labor productivity and higher employment growth rates experience a larger increase in their hiring rates. Furthermore, the response materializes faster at larger firms, low wage (low productivity) firms, and fast-growing firms. Additionally the magnitude and timing of the hiring response to vacancy-posting varies considerably across industries. Overall, we find evidence for substantial heterogeneity in terms of the hiring response of different types of firms where, interestingly, the magnitude and the speed of the response do not necessarily co-move across firm types.Turning to the determinants of vacancy-posting, we explore the effect of separations on the probability of posting a vacancy. We find that a onestandard deviationincrease in the separation rate is associated with an increase in the vacancy rate by 1 percentage point, a 100% increase over the no-separation baseline. The full effect takes 3 and 4 months to materialize. Furthermore, separations to employment have more than three times the effect on vacancy-posting than separations to non-employment. These findings are consistent with replacement hiring at the firm level, which generates vacancy chains and propagates labor market shocks (see, for example,Elsby, Michaels, Ratner, 2019,Mercan, Schoefer, 2020).Finally, we explore the relationship between revenue and value added growth and vacancy-posting. A one standard deviation change in revenue growth is associated with a 9–11 percentage point change in the quarterly probability of vacancy-posting. Negative revenue growth is associated with larger (in absolute value) vacancy-posting responses than positive revenue growth, and we find evidence of concavity in these responses. Value added growth generates similar responses, though slightly smaller in magnitude.Bagger et al. (2021)explore this further by separately estimating the effects of permanent and transitory output shocks on the vacancy-posting probability.These empirical findings have implications for theoretical modeling of the labor market. First, theoretical models should account for the large heterogeneity in the hiring response to vacancy-posting across firms of different size, productivity and growth rates. Second, they should account for the finding that separations predict vacancy-posting. Third, they should account for the asymmetric and non-linear relationship between output growth and vacancy-posting. We discuss these in some more detail inSection 6.Our paper contributes to the empirical literature that studies the effect of vacancies on hiring outcomes, early contributions to which include (Burdett, Cunningham, 1998,van Ours, Ridder, 1992).Davis et al. (2013)is probably the most prominent work in this literature and uses the US firm survey JOLTS to document several interesting features, particularly about the heterogeneous hiring outcomes of vacancy-posting across different establishment types and the large share of hires that occur without reporting an available vacancy.Carrillo-Tudela et al. (2021)andMueller et al. (2020)combine vacancy information with matched employer-employee datasets in Germany and Austria, respectively, and study the determinants of vacancy duration and vacancy yield. Our paper is also related to empirical work on vacancies using online job board data such asBanfi and Villena-Roldan (2019);Davis and Samaniego de la Parra (2017);Hershbein and Kahn (2018);Marinescu and Wolthoff (2020);Modestino et al. (2019)among others.The rest of the paper is organized as follows:Section 2describes the data that we use in our analysis.Section 3examines the effect of vacancy-posting on hiring rates, including a detailed firm-heterogeneity analysis.Section 4examines the effect of separations on vacancy-posting, andSection 5examines the effect of output growth on vacancy-posting.Section 6briefly discusses some the implications of our findings for theoretical models of the labor market and for future empirical work.",Jesper,Francois,Manolis
"1. IntroductionThe importance of freelance work has been growing. In a survey for the US,Katz and Krueger (2019)find that the fraction of workers in alternative work arrangements rose from 10.7 percent in 2005 to 15.8 percent in 2015. Part of this increase can be ascribed to the rise of the gig economy: a growing share of freelance suppliers of work are matched to customers on online platforms (Kuhn and Maleki (2017)). Tracking the number of open projects and tasks posted on a sample of such platforms,Kässi and Lehdonvirta (2018)document that the demand for online gig work has grown by about 21% from May 2016 to January 2018.1One of the key differences between classicalemployment relationsand freelance work is the flexibility of labor supply. While workers in classical employment relations are bound by contractual working hours over considerable time horizons, freelancers can frequently vary the quantity of work they offer or the number of assignments they accept. Firms employing them therefore face a dual incentive problem: ensuring both the quality of work in each assignment and getting freelancers to provide enough labor.2This results in a trade-off related to the classical trade-off between risk and incentives. When objective performance measures are available, effort on a given assignment is best incentivized by paying freelancers a pure commission. Yet, such a payment scheme induces income uncertainty. This may reduce freelancers’ incentives to accept a sufficient number of assignments.3As a consequence, it may be optimal for the platform to reduce commission rates and introduce a fixed payment per assignment. We argue that this trade-off between incentives for performance and labor supply may not only be affected by freelancers’ risk aversion, but also by their intrinsic motivation for the task at hand: workers with a high task motivation should reduce their effort per assignment to a lesser extent when the commission rate is reduced than workers with a lower motivation. The key intuition behind this hypothesis is that more motivated workers react less sensitively to differences in extrinsic incentives as their effort is to a larger extent driven by their own motivation for the task.To test our hypotheses we implement a natural field experiment in the gig economy. Our intervention changes freelancer compensation in a way that insures them against earnings fluctuations. This allows us to address two research questions. The first focuses on our setting, where the firm’s objective is to increase freelancers’ labor supply without substantial performance losses: given workers’ preferences, should the firm continue to pay workers a pure commission or reduce the commission and add a fixed, certain payment per order? The second question is broader and has policy implications in other settings where freelance or atypical work is also common: how do workers with different task motivation andpersonality traitsrespond to compensation that reduces not only their earnings uncertainty but also their material performance incentives?We first present a principal-agent model that captures a central feature of our empirical setting and of freelance work more generally: workers’ ability to choose both how much work to provide and how much effort to invest. Our pre-registered hypotheses predict that the intervention will increase freelancers’ labor supply and decrease their sales performance overall. The model further predicts that greater risk aversion will be associated with larger labor supply increases while the negative sales performance effect will be the less pronounced, the greater a worker’s intrinsic motivation.For the field experiment we partnered with Zalon, an online provider of curated fashion shopping. The firm is part of Zalando, the largest online fashion retailer in Europe.4Zalon relies on freelancers to provide remote styling services to fashion shoppers. It pays these stylists a pure commission on realized sales. Unlike gig workers on other platforms, Zalon’s freelance fashion consultants are selected based on their fashion affinity and on formal qualifications for the styling service. Many of the stylists, for example, are designers, tailors, and fashion students. As a consequence, intrinsic motivation is likely to play an important role in their freelance work. This differentiates our study from previous papers on the gig economy, which have focused on low-skilled, standardized and repetitive tasks.All 202 new stylists starting work for Zalon between October 2016 and August 2017 participated in our RCT without knowing that they were part of a field experiment. We randomly allocated new stylists to the treatment or the control group sequentially - as they were hired. To increase power, we did so within four predicted labor supply strata. The individual treatment period consisted of the first two calendar months of stylists’ work for Zalon. Control group stylists received a pure commission of 15% of the sales each of their styling jobs generated. Treatment group stylists received a commission of 7.5% of sales plus a piece rate of €6.50 per order. We elicited workers’ risk aversion and intrinsic motivation for the task in a pre-experimental online questionnaire. Labor supply and sales performance are measured using Zalon’s order-level administrative data. Our proxy for labor supply is the total number of desired slots of each stylist during the treatment period; our measure for sales performance is net merchandise value (NMV) per order. Our setting is particularly suited for a field experiment asspillover effectsare substantially less likely to appear than in typical firm-level field experiments: (i) stylists work independently from home and (ii) we only include newly hired stylists who hardly get in contact with each other.We find that overall, the intervention did not significantly affect average labor supply. While the labor supply response also did not vary significantly by risk aversion, we find strong support for our hypothesis of a heterogeneoustreatment effecton sales performance by intrinsic information, resulting in economically sizeable differences. More specifically, and in line with standard reasoning, the intervention reduced sales performance by 17% among less intrinsically motivated stylists (as classified by a median split). For the intrinsically more motivated stylists, however, the intervention increased performance by 10%. Hence, in this group, the performance reduction was not only mitigated as we hypothesized, but the better insurance even led to a higher motivation to perform. This is not only true in our main specifications, but also when we take into account that intrinsic motivation may be confounded by other personality traits or lower ability. It also holds when we consider customers’ repurchase rate as an alternative performance measure: in the group of workers with above-median intrinsic motivation for the task as measured by our pre-experimental survey, the treatment raised repurchase rates by 41%, while the treatment reduced repurchase rates by 53% in the less motivated group. Finally, while less intrinsically motivated agents reduced their labor supply when the commission rate was reduced, this was not the case for more motivated agents.Hence, the treatment neither reduced labor supply nor sales performance for the more motivated agents, but tended to increase both. This pattern was not predicted by our model based on standard economic considerations. We provide a possible interpretation of this finding in the light of psychological Self-Determination Theory (see e.g.Gagné and Deci (2005),Ryan and Deci (2017),Ryan and Deci (2019)). This theory distinguishes between autonomous and controlled motivation, where the former is driven by one’s own volition, while the latter is based on extrinsic rewards orsanctions. A key claim in this literature is that autonomous motivation facilitates effective performance, in particular for those with a stronger need forautonomy. By providing better insurance and less performance-contingent pay, the treatment may thus have fostered autonomous motivation and, in turn, raised the performance of those who did the job more for the task’s than for money’s sake.Our paper contributes to the literature on motivated agents (see e.g.Besley and Ghatak (2005),Delfgaauw and Dur (2008),Gerhards (2015),Ashraf et al. (2014),Fehrler and Kosfeld (2014),Carpenter and Gong (2016),Dur and van Lent (2018),Berg et al. (2019),Cassar (2019)).5In particular, the finding that the reduction in performance pay did not reduce sales performance of workers who exhibit a high task motivation provides field evidence for the claim that, to raise performance, performance pay and intrinsic motivation can act as substitutes. Moreover, our results show that for motivated workers, the provision of insurance against income fluctuations may lead to higher performance even when material incentives become lower-powered.Our findings also contribute to a nascent literature on the gig economy in appliedmicroeconomics.Hall and Krueger (2018)present a detailed characterization of Uber’s U.S. driver-partners documenting, for instance, their greater similarity to the general workforce than to taxi drivers. The authors identify the flexibility to set hours as a key determinant of driver-partners’ decision to work with Uber.Angrist et al. (2020)use an RCT at Uber to study the value to ride-hailing drivers of working with Uber as compared to a scenario similar to working as an independent taxi driver. Their experiment offers Uber drivers the opportunity to reduce the farebox share they have to pay Uber by purchasing a virtual taxi medallion lease. They use drivers’ self-selection into the treatment to quantify how valuable it is for gig workers to be able to drive without a lease. Based on this they argue that Uber’s existence creates a welfare gain for would-be entrepreneurs who would not purchase a taxi medallion. Our paper is similar toAngrist et al. (2020)in that both studies experimentally vary the incentive intensity on a gig-economy platform and study the response of freelancers’ labor supply. Our focus is very different, though: while they estimate the value of a specific gig-economy platform to its freelancers, we investigate costs and benefits of insuring its gig workers against income uncertainty.6The results of our paper also complement the growing field experimental literature analyzing the impact of incentives on performance in firms (see, e.g.,Bandiera et al. (2007),Burgess et al. (2010),Hossain and List (2012),Delfgaauw et al. (2013),Delfgaauw et al. (2014),Friebel et al. (2017),Hong et al. (2018), andManthei and Sliwka (2019)). A smaller body of field experimental work has started to investigate the role ofindividual motivationand personality traits in affecting the impact of incentives on performance, so far mostly studying service providers in developing countries (e.g.,Ashraf et al. (2014)orDonato et al. (2017)). As we do, these papers collect a measure of individual traits that may drive motivation for a real-world task, experimentally vary extrinsic incentives for the task in an RCT, and then study heterogeneous treatment effects. The existing results are to some extent contradictory.Ashraf et al. (2014), for instance, find that monetary incentives have a stronger impact among workers with a higher intrinsic motivation which would indicate a complementarity between the respective trait and monetary incentives. InDonato et al. (2017), however, monetary incentives raise performance only for workers scoring low in conscientiousness (i.e. the Big-5 personality trait associated with diligence and dependability) but do not raise performance for conscientious workers. Our results are more in line with the latter, supporting the view that monetary incentives and intrinsic motivation are substitutes rather than complements.7Finally, our results may have implications for policy makers. Among (mainly legal) scholars, lawmakers, regulators and in the public domain there is an ongoing debate about whether gig economy firms should be required to treat freelancers as regular employees (Means and Seiner (2015),Cherry and Aloisi (2017),Kuhn and Maleki (2017),Prassl (2018)).8This would have implications, for instance, for unemployment insurance, fair labor standards, and other labor market laws and regulations.9Businesses facing potential regulation might fear that such rules would drastically increase costs and reduce the performance of their workforces. If, for example, gig economy firms had to convert their freelancers into regular employees, they would probably have to comply with minimum wage provisions. While our intervention does not test the introduction of a minimum wage for freelancers, its fixed payment per order in effect introduces an earnings floor per unit of time the freelancer makes available. Consequently, our results may be useful for policy makers trying to assess the costs (through potential losses in workers’ performance) that stricter regulation would impose on gig economy firms.",Sebastian,Roberto,Patrick
"1. IntroductionSpatialinequalitiesin economic outcomes are very persistent in many countries (seeMoretti, 2011, for a recent survey). The UK is no exception:Giovannini et al. (2019)argue it is the country with the highest level of regional inequality in Europe. These inequalities may also have political consequences: voters in ‘left behind’ areas seemed to play an important role in theBrexitvote (Fetzer, 2019).In principle, mobility from depressed to booming areas should reduce these disparities, though this adjustment process inevitably takes time. There is evidence that migration does respond to differences in economic opportunity (for a thorough, though quite old, survey seeGreenwood, 1997). The classic reference for the US isBlanchard and Katz (1992)who concluded that negative locallabour demandshocks cause a short-run rise in the unemployment rate, but that migration causes unemployment rates to be equalized within 5–7 years, a relatively short time. The recent marked fall in residential mobility in the US (Molloy et al., 2011,2014;Dao et al., 2017) has made people wonder whether this remains true.Amior and Manning (2018)argue that the migration response is slower than estimated byBlanchard and Katz (1992), that local demand shocks are highly persistent, and the interaction between these two factors induces high persistence in unemployment differentials. The conventional wisdom about Europe (e.g.Pissarides and McMaster, 1990;Decressin and Fatas, 1995;Overman, 2002;OECD 2005) is that adjustment is slower than in the US, though recentlyAmior and Manning (2019)find that the net migration response to unemployment in the UK is higher and more similar to the US than commonly believed. Although these studies provide convincing evidence that migration responds to economic opportunities, there is still surprisingly little evidence on the process in recent years1given the renewed concern about regional inequalities associated with the rise of political populism. This paper aims to contribute to our understanding of internal migration in three ways.The first contribution is to consider very detailed information on location. Most existing studies of residential mobility use aggregate, region, state, or city level data. Sometimes, this is a choice dictated by data availability. But there is also a view that the ideal level of aggregation is local labour market level (what are called Travel to Work Areas – TTWAs - in the UK) and economic opportunity is best measured at this level of aggregation. However, there is evidence that labour markets are more local than TTWAs imply: most commutes are short andManning and Petrongolo (2017)present evidence that vacancy filling rates are best explained by unemployment at neighbourhood level. If a TTWA is a single labour market, one would expect that all neighbourhoods within a TTWA should offer the same economic opportunities. As we show later, though, there is considerable variation in unemployment rates within TTWAs, even controlling for composition.If labour markets are more local than TTWAs imply, it is important to take account of this both in estimating how residential mobility responds to unemployment and in designing policy. For example, very local interventions may be more effective the more local are labour markets.Amior and Manning (2019)show that the economic opportunities available to residents of an area can be summarized by a composition-adjusted employment or unemployment rate. Following their work, we will use unemployment as a measure of economic opportunities. To investigate the role of very local labour markets in modelling residential mobility, we estimate models including both a local (neighbourhood) level of unemployment as well as unemployment at the local labour market (TTWA) level. We find that both unemployment at the TTWA level and neighbourhood unemployment are important in explaining residential mobility. Even though residential moves tend to be local, often within the same TTWA, they tend to be from high to low unemployment neighbourhoods, and these very local moves play an important part in re-allocating labour from areas doing badly to those doing well.The second contribution is to assess whether differences in economic opportunity across areas are more important in explaining in-migration or out-migration i.e. are people more likely to leave areas of high unemployment (an out-migration effect) or, given mobility, are they less likely to move to areas of high unemployment (an in-migration effect). This is relevant, as the elasticity to local unemployment may be different in these two sides of the problem. Although this is a question with a long pedigree (see the discussion inGreenwood, 1997) the literature on separate determinants of in- and out-migration is small.Coen-Pirani (2010)andMonras (2018)have argued, using aggregate US data, that in-migration is more sensitive toeconomic conditionsthan out-migration. Using aggregate UK data,Jackman and Savouri (1992)show that high unemployment raises out-migration and lowers in-migration to a similar extent. Our analysis show that both a high level of local unemployment and high level of TTWA unemployment increase out-migration on the one side and decrease in-migration on the other side. Both local and TTWA unemployment have an impact on mobility, both inflows and outflows.The third contribution is to consider heterogeneity in the responsiveness of migration to unemployment. There is an extensive literature on how individual characteristics affect the probability of migration (again, seeGreenwood, 1997, for a review, orBound and Holzer, 2000orBütikofer and Peri, 2021), considering factors like age, education, family circumstances and housing tenure. There is a much smaller literature on how individual characteristics affect the responsiveness of migration to unemployment (or some other measure of economic opportunity).2This is important because the view that migration will tend to equalize economic opportunity is based on the idea that migration reduces competition for jobs in the areas left and increases it in the destination areas. Such a conclusion may not be justified if, for example, it was the best educated or the most ambitious who leave an area after a negative labour demand shock3– this would alter the skill mix in a way that might worsen labour market prospects for those left behind. In addition, studies of individuals that consider the impact of area economic opportunity on migration, tend to focus on out-migration because there is only one area an individual can leave at any time but a very large number of potential destinations. Those studies (e.g.Dahl, 2002;Kennan and Walker, 2011) that do consider a range of potential destinations typically have a relatively small number for computational issues. Our study provides evidence on how the impact of both destination and origin unemployment rates varies across individuals when a very large number of possible destinations are considered. We find that elasticity to unemployment at the destination level is more heterogeneous than at the origin level. People who are younger, married, homeowners, employed, and better educated tend to be more sensitive to unemployment at destination, while ethnic minorities tend to respond less. The reaction to TTWA unemployment is instead less heterogeneous. We will also provide two extensions to the individual model. The first analyses differences in the estimates with respect to reasons for moving, while the second re-estimates the models considering the choice to be a household choice.The plan of the paper is as follows. InSection 2we provide description of the Census data and some initial descriptive analysis on the mobility of people within the UK.Section 3illustrates the empirical model we use for the Census data.Section 4illustrates the analysis on the longitudinal data and its extensions.Section 5concludes.",Monica,Alan,None
"1. IntroductionMost countries currently provide new parents with some form of paid leave. Parental leave programs aim to decrease the gender gap in the labor market, promote couple stability and fertility, and support children’s development. These claims formed the basis of expansions in the duration of benefits over the past years. Indeed, numerous countries now provide at least one year of paid leave.1By 2008, many governments, such as Austria, Norway and Sweden, also offered benefits for periods varying between 1.5 to 2 years, with others such as Finland, France, Germany and Spain, even extending the duration of leave to more than 3 years (Ruhm, 2011).As further discussed below, an extensive body of literature documents that leaves that are shorter than one year typically have either positive or insignificant impacts on a range of family outcomes. However, critics argue that in contrast to their intended goals, longer periods of benefits can have undesirable effects. This claim is supported by mounting evidence that prolonged time off from work hurts women’s careers by decreasing their labor supply and earnings (Rossin-Slater, 2018). Nonetheless, it is still not well understood how extended periods of leave affect other aspects of household behavior and child development. Answering this question is of critical importance for countries that are currently expanding the duration of benefits. It is also informative for governments that already provide lengthy periods of benefits and that are considering decreasing the duration of leave. For example, in 2008, the Czech Republic reduced the length of leave from 4 to 2 years.The scarcity of evidence on this topic is mainly attributed to difficulties in identifying causal effects. Specifically, a major challenge is overcoming selection bias arising from the fact that taking long periods of leave is likely correlated with unobservable factors such as socioeconomic background, that may also affect outcomes of interest. In this paper, I exploit a unique extension of benefits in France—of approximately 3 years—to examine howlengthyperiods of paid leave impact parents’ labor market behavior and children’s development.My analysis focuses on a French parental leave program, which offered either one or both parents a flat-rate monthly cash allowance to take up to 3 years of time off from work after the birth of their child. During this time, a parent had to either work part-time or be out of the labor force, and the latter option provided a higher amount of benefits. To identify causal effects, I leverage a change in this program’s eligibility conditions. Initially, only parents of three children and more qualified for the leave. On July 25, 1994, benefits were extended to parents whose second child was born on or after July 1, 1994. Second-borns’ parents were also eligible for up to 3 years of job-protected unpaid leave both before and after the reform. Hence, the reform effectively increased parents’ access to cash benefits for up to 3 years without changing the length of job-protection. Since the reform was announced after the cutoff date of July 1, 1994, parents had little opportunity to manipulate the date of birth of their second child in order to become eligible for the leave. I therefore overcome selection into leave-taking by using aregression discontinuity designthat compares households on either side of the date of birth cutoff. The main assumption in this design is that households that are barely eligible due to the second child’s date of birth, are similar to those that are barely ineligible.I first document an increase in intra-household specialization in the years couples are eligible to receive the leave. Barely eligible women are around 23 percentage points more likely to be out of the labor force compared to those who are barely ineligible, suggesting that mothers are taking the maximum amount of benefits. Although the program is gender-neutral, men do not take up benefits, as they do not alter theirlabor force participationor part-time work decisions. The reform however induces fathers to work for an additional 2.8 hours per week. Since beneficiaries receive a fixed amount of cash benefits—and are thus unlikely to get full earnings replacement—this finding could imply that fathers are compensating for a loss of household income due to mothers taking the leave. The reform’s effects on parents’ do not persist after eligibility for leave benefits expires (i.e., in the fifth through seventh years after childbirth).Increased household specialization has important consequences. Recent studies show that the divergence in men and women’s labor supply and earnings after parenthood persists in the long run (Angelov, Johansson, Lindahl, 2016,Bertrand, Goldin, Katz, 2010), and that it explains most of the remaining gender gap in the labor market (Kleven et al., 2019). My results thus suggest that lengthy leaves can exacerbategender differencesin the labor market. While I can only test for leave-induced specialization for up to seven years after childbirth, the French reform was shown to have negative effects on women’s wages for up to 10 years after childbirth (Lequien, 2012). Another potential consequence of specialization is areinforcementof traditional social norms regarding couples’division of labor.I also find that offering a long period of leave is detrimental to children’s development. Results indicate that compared to children born just before the cutoff, those born just after are between 3.1 and 5.6 percentage points more likely to have below-normal scores on various tests that assess their verbal skills at ages 5 to 6. Given that mothers likely become the primary caregivers for 3 years as a result of the reform, a potential explanation for these adverse effects is that maternal care is replacing higher quality childcare arrangements. Spending more time in their mothers’ care could also decrease the amount of time that children spend with other adults and children. The adverse effects can thus be driven by reduced social interactions, since interacting with other individuals is typically beneficial for children’s development (Dustmann and Schönberg, 2012). As discussed inSection 6.3, other channels that could explain the main results are reduced time spent with fathers, a potential loss of household income and the fact that the reform affected second-born children.In summary, I show that providing a long period of paid leave reinforces a traditional division of labor within the household and has a detrimental impact on children’s verbal skills. By doing so, this paper makes several contributions to the existing literature. First, to the best of my knowledge, this paper provides some of the first evidence that a single extension in leave benefits can work against several of these programs’ intended goals. Parental leaves are typically designed to decrease the gender gap in the labor market and promote child well-being. Instead, I show that long periods of benefits can have the opposite effect on all these outcomes.Prior evidence on how lengthy periods of leave affect household behavior and child development is relatively scarce. Most previous work looks at leaves that are shorter than one year (seeRossin-Slater, 2018). Studies on longer periods of leave mainly focus on their impacts on women’s labor market opportunities. For example, several previous studies document that the French reform induces women to exit the labor market and that they incur a wage penalty after returning to work (Lequien, 2012,Pailhé, Solaz, 2006,Piketty, 2005).2However, these studies are different than mine as they do not examine fathers’ response or children’s outcomes. The few papers that provide more comprehensive evaluations of extended periods of leaves yield results that are significantly different than mine, as they report positive or no effects on fertility, marriage and child outcomes (Danzer, Halla, Schneeweis, Zweimüller, 2017,Danzer, Lavy, 2017,Ginja, Jans, Karimi, 2020,Lalive, Schlosser, Steinhauer, Zweimüller, 2014,Lalive, Zweimüller, 2009). While these settings diverge from mine along several dimensions, one potential reason for why my findings are different is that the French reform provides access to up to three years of paid leave. Compared to the rest of the literature, this is the largest one-time expansion in the duration of parental leave benefits. This is important given that many countries have recently increased the length of paid leaves.Second, this paper adds to the literature by showing that leave programs can increase household specialization, through inducing fathers to raise their work hours. While previous studies show that leaves can reduce women’s labor supply, less is known about men’s response to these programs. Most of the literature concerning fathers examines how their leave-taking affects subsequent labor market responses and division of housework. A key difference in my study is that fathers do not increase or alter their leave take-up. I therefore document that mothers’ leave-taking affects men’s labor supply, even if fathers do not take up leave.3Finally, this study builds on a large body of literature which investigates the relation between leave programs and children’s outcomes. Studies looking at the introduction of paid and unpaid leaves find positive effects on children’s health and long-term education and earnings (Carneiro, Løken, Salvanes, 2015,Rossin, 2011,Stearns, 2015). However, subsequent expansions in coverage—for up to one year—have no impact on short-term health, cognitive development or long-run education (Baker, Milligan, 2008,Baker, Milligan, 2010,Baker, Milligan, 2015,Dahl, Løken, Mogstad, Salvanes, 2016,Liu, Skans, 2010,Rasmussen, 2010). My finding that children are adversely affected contrasts with most of the previous literature on parental leaves. One exception is the study byDustmann and Schönberg (2012), which documents a small negative effect on children’s educational achievement at age 14 following an increase in the length of unpaid leave from 18 to 36 months in Germany. I complement their results by showing that larger extensions in the duration of paid leave can also hinder child development.The rest of this paper is organized as follows.Section 2provides detailed information on the institutional setting.Sections 3and4respectively present the data and identification strategy.Sections 5and6show the results and robustness checks.

"1. IntroductionThe Affordable Care Act (ACA), signed into law in March 2010, enacted major provisions targeting the uninsured population in the United States. To increase access to publichealth insuranceamong low-income adults, the ACA proposed a nationwide expansion of Medicaid income eligibility limits to 138% of the federalpovertylevel (FPL). On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled out the ACA’s Medicaid expansion to be an obligation for states with a 7 to 2 majority decision inNational Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, in turn resulting in one-third of the states not expanding coverage to the poor. Although not all states participated in the program, the ACA has increased Medicaid coverage among newly eligible and previously eligible adults (Frean, Gruber, Sommers, 2017,Aslim, Mungan, Navarro, Yu, 2020).The availability ofpublic health insurancecan influence the costs associated with non-portability of employer-sponsored health insurance (ESHI). In 2017, 56% of the population secured health coverage through an ESHI plan (Berchick et al., 2018).2The potential loss of health coverage can limit workers to devote resources toward finding a better employer match as well as alternative activities that contribute to the welfare of individuals. This is an important concern for productivity and, hence, economic growth if workers pursue a job primarily to secure health coverage, a phenomenon referred to as “job lock” (Madrian, 1994).General equilibriummodels that account for worker and firm heterogeneity in labor markets suggest a sizable shift from full-time to part-time jobs under the ACA (Nakajima and Tuzemen, 2016).The equilibrium models provide certain economic channels through which the ACA affects labor market outcomes. A worker’s characteristics such as age, preference for leisure, medical expenditures, and productivity contribute to the decisions for transitioning from one employment state (e.g., full-time work with health insurance) to another (e.g., part-time work with no health insurance). Moreover, age can impact both the average productivity and medical expenditures, and hence the consumption, of a worker. The objective of a worker is to maximize the utility obtained from employment transitions conditional on the health insurance decision.3These models yield two important insights regarding the labor market. First of all, prime age and near-elderly workers with high disutility of labor transition into part-time employment under the ACA. For that reason, part-time employment is concentrated mainly among prime age and near-elderly workers rather than young workers.4There is also empirical evidence that some of these old workers exit the labor force under the ACA (see, e.g.,Duggan et al., 2020). Second, decomposing different policy features of the ACA theoretically predicts that the Medicaid expansions and health insurance subsidies contribute substantially to the increase in part-time employment, suggesting that the main channel through which the ACA affects employment transitions is the labor supply channel. It is particularly critical to test these predictions empirically and explore whether shifts from full-time to part-time work exist in data following the ACA’s Medicaid expansion.This paper provides a novel approach to investigate potential employment transitions resulting from the expansion of public health coverage to low-income adults under the ACA. The main group of interest is adults without dependent children (“childless adults”) since they had limited access to Medicaid coverage prior to the ACA.5I exploit the changes in Medicaid eligibility for childless adults near the income eligibility cutoff of 138% FPL. Specifically, I employ aregression discontinuity designthat compares Medicaid coverage and labor market outcomes for childless adults who are slightly below the eligibility cutoff to the outcomes for childless adults who are slightly above the eligibility cutoff.6To isolate the effect of the ACA’s Medicaid expansion from other time-invariant attributes of states, I combine the RD analysis with the difference-in-differences (DD) method, coined as “difference-in-discontinuities.” To my knowledge, this is the first study to use this approach to investigate the employment effects of the ACA’s Medicaid expansion.7Furthermore, I construct an eligibility measure using two data sets, the March CPS and the monthly CPS, wherein the former has information on household income and health insurance status and the latter includes labor market outcomes for each month.8To mitigate the effects of behavioral adjustments (via changes in employment status) to achieve eligibility, I restrict the sample to pre-expansion years. I conduct a series of data-driven tests on the running variable to confirm that there is no statistically significant bunching near the eligibility cutoff. Finally, I provide first stage estimates on Medicaid coverage and runevent studyspecifications that do not depend on eligibility assignment to address issues related to a potential measurement error in the running variable.I find that the ACA’s Medicaid expansion has increased Medicaid coverage at the eligibility cutoff in expansion states. There is no evidence that childless adults move out of the labor force or transition into unemployment after the ACA’s Medicaid expansion. I find evidence of employment transitions from full-time to part-time employment in expansion states after the policy change. Specifically, I show that the transitions are salient for jobs with less than 20 working hours. Further, I find the transitions to be stronger and statistically significant among females, low-educated adults, and individuals aged 45–64. Falsification checks show no coverage and employment effects in non-expansion states. These estimates are robust to the inclusion of early expansion states, increasing bandwidths, and varying functional forms of the running variable.More broadly, this paper contributes to two bodies of literature in health economics andlabor economicsthat study labor supply responses towelfare programs, particularly the Medicaid program. There are mixed findings in the literature on the employment effects of public health insurance, especially in the context of the ACA’s Medicaid expansion. Exploiting the variation in states’ expansion decision under the ACA,Gooptu et al. (2016),Kaestner et al. (2017), andLeung and Mas (2018)find little to no effect on employment. Relating to the earlier work,Duggan et al. (2019)indicate that workdisincentivescreated in areas with higher potential exchange enrollment offset the employment effects in areas with higher potential Medicaid enrollment.This study relates to work byDague et al. (2017)andKim (2016)that find a statistically significant reduction in employment in Wisconsin and Connecticut, respectively, resulting from the expansion of Medicaid eligibility. Moreover, there is evidence that contractions of eligibility increase employment (Garthwaite et al., 2014). The empirical design in this study not only allows me to explore the changes in outcomes separately in expansion and non-expansion states, but provides tools to assess the validity of the estimates by testing for discontinuous breaks that may be due to changes inlabor demandrather than labor supply. I provide evidence to rule out a plausible demand side mechanism that increases part-time employment. This is an important contribution to the literature since I am not aware of any other studies exploring employment transitions along these dimensions, particularly in the context of Medicaid expansions.Finally, this paper contributes to the literature on early retirement.Aslim (2019)andWood (2019)find the employment effects of the ACA’s Medicaid expansions to be salient among adults aged 55–64. These findings suggest that the expansion of public coverage increases the probability of early retirement.9Prior studies focusing on aggregate effects - not restricting the sample to workers who are likely affected by the policy changes under the ACA - might not have enough power to identify statistically meaningful changes in part-time employment. In this paper, I emphasize the importance of assessing the effects of the ACA’s Medicaid expansion across different populations, including various subgroups near the eligibility cutoff, with heterogeneous labor supply responses.In what follows,Section 2introduces the data, sample, and variables. The empirical strategy is discussed inSection 3.Section 4presents the results.Section 5concludes with a discussion.",Erkmen,None,None
"1. IntroductionThe 2012 German SVR-migration survey revealed that parental assessment of schools with a high percentage of immigrant children was poor and that parents were reluctant to enroll their children in such schools. This assessment is shared by the immigrant population; immigrants in Germany are also less willing to send their children to a school with highethnolinguisticdiversity (SVR-migration, 2012). As a result, in ethnically diverse neighborhoods, families, particularly those with a strong educational background, opt out of the assigned or the closest school because they fear it will disadvantage their children. If policy makers want to address the segregation and resulting disadvantages for children from immigrant families, they need a better understanding of the effects of ethnolinguistic diversity on the development of children. Policy makers need to know whether it is the heterogeneity of the group or the quality of the schools that needs improvement. If the ethnic composition does not explain lower educational achievement, the focus should be on school quality. For example, needs-based funding schemes could be a suitable policy option. If, however, the ethnic composition of schools causes lower educational achievement, then school assignment policy ought to be addressed as well. This study contributes to the discussion by exploring the causal effects of ethnic composition, measured by linguistic diversity, in early education.Although several studies have shown the importance of early education for early-life skills, lifetime educational attainment, earnings, and the probability of employment (seeAlmond and Currie, 2011,Elango et al., 2016, andAlmond et al., 2018, for detailed reviews of the literature), little is known aboutpeer effectsin early education on child development. In particular, the effects of linguistic diversity need more research, as this diversity has been growing in preschools, in recent decades, along with the increase in immigration flows. Immigrants choose whether to speak to their children in their mother tongue or in the language of the host country, and a rise in the number of children who do not speak the language of the host country at home increases linguistic diversity in preschools. This diversity may influence early educational attainment, for instance, through social interaction, teaching quality, creativity stimulation, and cultural assimilation.We investigate the effects of linguistic diversity in kindergartens on child development, using administrative records from the school entrance examinations (SEE) of four cohorts for a city in Germany.1The SEE is a compulsory examination to assess health status and school readiness of all children at ages five to six (Makles and Schneider, 2017;Cornelissen et al., 2018;Felfe and Lalive, 2018). SEE contains a wide range of cognitive measures, including language skills, counting, and quantity comparison, in addition to measures of visual and motor skills and selective attention, from which we construct one indicator for child development.The SEE data also allows us to identify the language spoken at home, defined as the language to which the child was exposed during early development, and to compute the share of non-German speakers in the kindergarten-cohort. Yet the share, the conventional measure of immigrant concentration in the literature (e.g.,Bossavie, 2020;Frattini and Meschi, 2019), does not capture the extent of dissimilarity within immigrants and between immigrants and natives. We, therefore, also construct a measure of linguistic diversity that indicates the expected linguistic distance between two randomly selected children from a kindergarten-cohort. This allows us to explore whether linguistic diversity and also the extent of linguistic diversity are potential channels underlying the impact of immigrant concentration on educational outcomes of immigrants and natives.Parental choice of the language spoken at home and parental choice of kindergarten determine linguistic diversity in kindergartens. At the same time, the expected diversity in kindergartens might also affect the parental choice of language spoken at home. These parental choices leave us with two main challenges in identifying the effects of linguistic diversity. The first challenge is the selection problem that has been widely discussed in the peer effects literature (Manski, 1993;Epple and Romano, 2011;Angrist, 2014). Children are selected into kindergartens based on their parental residential choices and parental educational preferences (Black, 1999;Hoxby, 2000). Kindergarten composition is, therefore, associated with neighborhood characteristics and socioeconomic background of children.We overcome the selection problem by including cohort and kindergartenfixed effectsand exploiting the variation in linguistic diversity across cohorts within kindergartens. Intuitively, we examine whether children in cohorts with low linguistic diversity outperform children in the same kindergarten in cohorts with higher linguistic diversity. The identifying assumption is that the within kindergarten variation in linguistic diversity across cohorts is uncorrelated with other determinants of child development. To provide support for this assumption, we show that the variation in observed individual characteristics across cohorts and within kindergartens does not significantly differ across low and high linguistically diversified kindergartens.The second challenge arises because the parental choice of language spoken at home might be affected by the parental expectation of linguistic diversity in kindergarten. Therefore, even after accounting for non-random sorting due to parental kindergarten choice, the effect of linguistic diversity on early child development could not be given a causal interpretation because of the potential endogeneity of language spoken at home. Children of native-born parents arguably speak German at home, regardless of the languages spoken by their peers. Immigrant parents, however, decide on the language spoken at home, possibly depending on the need and propensity to integrate.2In fact, we find evidence that children with at least one foreign-born parent are more likely to speak German at home if they attend a kindergarten with low linguistic diversity.To deal with the endogeneity of language spoken at home, we exploit aninstrumental variableapproach to identify arguably exogenous variation in kindergarten-cohort linguistic diversity. In designing the instrument, we draw on a recent and growing literature on social interactions among individuals in partially overlapping peer groups (Bramoulle et al., 2009;De Giorgi et al., 2010;Ahn and Trogdon, 2017;Nicoletti et al., 2018). We assume that children interact with their kindergarten-cohort peers and, at the same time, with their residential neighbors. We also assume that children do not interact with their kindergarten-cohort peers’ residential neighbors who donotattend the same kindergarten. This implies that a child's residential neighbors, who do not attend the same kindergarten as the child, affect the child's kindergarten-cohort peers only through affecting that child. We, thus, use the average linguistic diversity among those neighbors who attend other kindergartens to instrument linguistic diversity in the kindergarten-cohort. To support the assumption of the exogeneity of the instrument, we provide evidence that the decision of non-German-born parents to speak German with their child at home is uncorrelated with our instrument.To study the effect of linguistic diversity on our indicator of child development, we begin with an OLS model without fixed effects. We document a negative correlation between the concentration of non-German speakers and child development, no matter whether we use the share on non-German speakers or linguistic diversity to measure the concentration. In the next step, when we include cohort and kindergarten fixed effects to account for self-selection, the correlation goes down to zero and becomes insignificant. Our findings hence suggest that the negative correlation in the model without fixed effects reflects parental preferences and other unobserved socioeconomic characteristics which affect their choices of kindergarten. This result is consistent with the findings ofGeay, McNally, and Telhaj (2013). They show that, when they only control for studentdemographics, the proportion of non-native speakers, defined as students who spoke a non-English language during early development, is negatively associated with the schooling achievement of native speakers in primary schools in England. (Geay, McNally, and Telhaj (2013)) then include various controls and school fixed effects and show that an increase in the share of non-native speakers has no impact on schooling achievement in fixed-effects models.In a final step, we address the endogeneity of language spoken at home by using our instrumental variables approach. It turns out that, even after overcoming the endogeneity issue, the concentration of non-German speakers has no significant effect on our main measure of child development. However, when we estimate the effect of linguistic diversity on different measures of cognitive ability, our results reveal that the share of non-German speakers and linguistic diversity both adversely affect German language skills. The effects are, however, modest. Compared to an average score of 75% in the item “correct use of preposition” and of 78.9% in the item “forming plurals,” a onestandard deviationincrease in the share of non-German speakers decreases a child's score in the former by 1.8 percentage points and in the latter by 2.6 percentage points. The sizes of these effects are similar when we use our index of linguistic diversity. This suggests that the linguistic proximity of foreign languages to German does not explain the underlying impacts of immigrant concentration better than the share of non-German-speaking children.To better assess the peer effects and provide insights into how to design policy, we shed light on the mechanisms underlying the effects (Lazear, 2001). Non-German-speaking children with a low level of German proficiency need more attention from kindergarten educators, thus reducing teaching quality for German-speaking children. And besides, German speakers do not benefit in language skills from their non-German-speaking peers who experience linguistic difficulties. Therefore, an increase in the number of non-German speakers may interfere with the German speakers’learning process, but not with non-German speakers’. We provide evidence on this mechanism by estimating the effects within subgroups of German and non-German speakers. Our results support the hypothesis. The share of non-German speakers has a negative impact on the achievements of German speakers, but it does not have any effect on non-German speakers. Our findings show that a one standard deviation increase in the share of non-German speakers decreases German speakers’ scores in the correct use of prepositions by 17.7% of a standard deviation and in forming plurals by 13.5% of a standard deviation.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We provide an overview of the related literature in Section II. In Section III, we discuss the data and the index of linguistic diversity.

"1. IntroductionChoosing the right education is one of the most important choices facing many young adults as it has lasting effects on both one's future job and earnings. Although the returns to different college majors vary considerably (see for exampleAltonji et al., 2016, andAltonji & Zhong, 2021), most of the education literature has focused on estimating the effect of an additional year of schooling while ignoring different fields of study.In a seminal contribution,Kirkeboen et al. (2016)argue that one can only identify the returns to one field of study relative to another. They focus on estimating the return to field of study for students on the margin between two broad fields (e.g., Social Sciences vs. Science) and conclude that students sort into broad fields based on comparative advantage. We also study one's chosen specialization in terms of field of study, namely its impacts on earnings and how students sort into different fields of study. In addition to earnings, we consider the effect of one's chosen field of study on skill utilization in one's future job. UnlikeKirkeboen et al. (2016), our focus is on how the similarity of the applicant's preferred and next-best alternatives is related to these outcomes.Our hypothesis is that individuals’ field choices affect future job opportunities such that candidates in two relatively similar fields will tend to work in jobs requiring more similar skill sets and have more similar earnings. Therefore, we expect that comparative advantage should play a larger role and generate larger earnings differences when the preferred and next-best fields are less alike.We use aregression discontinuity designto estimate the causal effect of admission to one's preferred field of study on earnings and subsequent skill use. Students in Denmark rank up to eight programs and are admitted into their highest ranked program for which they are qualified according to whether their high school grade point average (GPA) exceeds the program's GPA admission criteria. We combine data on these preference rankings with earnings data, baseline characteristics, and data on high school GPA from the Danish administrative registers. Finally, we use data from the near population of Danish online job postings. Inspired byDeming and Kahn (2018), we identify keywords indicative of nine different skill categories and construct measures of skills intensity for each occupation category.Some applicants only list a single narrow field of study, as presumably the difference in benefits relative to their next-best field is rather large. We refer to these applicants asOnly Oneapplicants. When we consider the similarity of the listed preferences and their impact on the returns to admission in one's preferred field, we focus on applicants who listed two or more narrow fields. We divide applicants with at least two listed narrow fields intoBetweenapplicants if their preferred and next-best fields lie in different broad fields andWithinapplicants if their preferred and next-best fields lie within the same broad field (e.g.Archeologyand History).1When we considerBetweenapplicants, we find that students, on average, realize higher returns to studying their preferred field, consistent with the findings ofKirkeboen et al. (2016). On the other hand,Withinapplicants do not realize an increase in earnings on average from marginally exceeding the admission threshold in their preferred field. These earnings results are mirrored when we consider the effects of field of study on skills sets required in subsequent jobs. We find significant differences in skill usage in subsequent jobs forBetweenstudents, but no such difference forWithinstudents. These results agree with our hypothesis.The regression discontinuity design allows us to causally estimate the effect of admission threshold crossing on earnings and skills. However, this design does not necessarily lend itself to counterfactual comparisons of the returns to threshold crossing between two groups of applicants. To check that such comparisons are credible in our case, we exploit that some applicants apply to three or more fields. A subset of these applicants have applied to at least two narrow fields within a broad field as well as to two narrow fields in different broad fields. Whether this subset of applicants becomeWithinorBetweenapplicants is determined by the admission requirements for the programs they have listed. We find that those who end up on the margin between two broad fields realize similar earnings gains relative to the ordinaryBetweenapplicants. Analogously, those who end up on the margin between two narrow fields within a broad field tend to see similar earnings effects as the ordinaryWithinapplicants, lending credibility to a comparison of the effects of threshold crossing forWithinandBetweenapplicants. We contribute to the literature by comparing the effect of admission to one's preferred field of study forWithinandBetweenapplicants, allowing us to investigate the nature of comparative advantage in a larger portion of the applicant pool.We also contribute to the literature by showing that the effect of threshold crossing on earnings for those on the margin between different broad fields is persistent for at least 14 years after admission. We find suggestive evidence that skill differences also persist as skills and earnings differences appear to go hand in hand. Our results suggest that different fields of study open doors to jobs that require different skill sets, but we are not able to say whether the effect of field of study is due to human capital accumulation or signaling.Finally, we consider a simple cost-benefit analysis using applicants on the margin between two broad fields, between two narrow fields, and those who just list one narrow field. Our results imply that amarginalloosening of the GPA requirements will increase subsequent labor market earnings by improving the allocation of students across fields and by allowing more students to begin studying earlier.The literature using a regression discontinuity design to study the effect of post-secondary education generally finds significant positive effects ongraduationof being admitted into one's preferred field. However, evidence is mixed concerning the findings on earnings.2Kirkeboen et al. (2016)andHastings et al. (2013)have used college admission data from Norway and Chile, respectively, to examine whether students sort into fields of study based on comparative advantage.Hastings et al. (2013)find small earnings gains from admission to one's preferred field, but do not find strong support for students sorting into fields by comparative advantage. In contrast,Kirkeboen et al. (2016)find that students, on average, have considerably larger future earnings in their preferred field and that students sort based on comparative advantage.Our results can rationalize the mixed evidence on the gains of admission to one's preferred field of study provided in the literature, e.g.,Kirkeboen et al. (2016)andHastings et al. (2013).3When we followKirkeboen et al. (2016)and distinguish between each student's preferred and next-best broad fields and only consider applicants whose preferred and next-best programs lie indifferentbroad fields, we also find fairly large earnings gains from being admitted to one's preferred field. However, when we consider students whose preferred and next-best fields lie within thesamebroad field, we do not find significant earnings gains from admission. The analysis ofHastings et al. (2013)includes both types of applicants, and therefore based only on this difference in inclusion criteria, their earnings effects ought to be smaller than those found byKirkeboen et al. (2016).Four recent studies use the regression discontinuity design in the Danish college enrollment system. Humlum et al. (2014) find that crossing the admission threshold increases the speed with which students enroll in and complete university, enter the labor market, and begin a family. In independent work,Andersen et al.(2020),Heinesen (2018), andHeinesen and Hvid (2019)study threshold-crossing on completion, earnings, and gender gaps. The study ofHeinesen and Hvid (2019)is closest to our paper as they use the set-up inKirkeboen et al. (2016). Their results are broadly consistent with our earnings results for individuals who are the margin of two different broad fields, the subgroup of applicants that they consider.The paper is organized as follows. Insection 2, we discuss the institutional details of higher education in Denmark. Insection 3, we consider theeconometricframework employed in this paper.

"1. IntroductionThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) legislated in March 2010 has been the largest healthcare reform in the United States since the introduction of Medicare in 1965. One of its key provisions was to extend dependent coverage up to children's 26th birthday. Before the ACA reform, children's healthcare coverage via their parents lapsed upon turning the age of 19; thus, about one-third of young adults aged 19–25 years were uninsured (Antwi et al., 2013). After implementing the ACA dependent coverage mandate (ACA-DM), the share of young adults aged 19–25 years withhealth insurancecoverage increased from 64% to 73% between September 2010 and June 2011 (Sommers and Schwartz, 2011). This implies that about 2.5 million young adults newly gainedhealth insurance coverage. Much of the increase came from their parents’ employer-sponsored health insurance (ESHI) (Antwi et al., 2013).A direct consequence of the ACA-DM for employers is an increase inlabor costs, as they are required to provide additional dependent coverage for employees with children aged 19–25. In response to this burden, employers may reduce wages or labor inputs, such as the number of employees or work hours, which leads to a deadweight loss in the labor market. However,Summers’ (1989)seminal work on the incidence of ESHI implies that parents could acceptlower wagesin return for extended dependent coverage. If wages are fully adjusted to the employer's increased health insurance costs, employment or working hours will not decrease, and thus there will be no efficiency loss.Given the large size of the young adult population who gained new health insurance coverage via the ACA-DM, it can be of great interest to policymakers and researchers to understand to what extent this reform has caused efficiency loss in labor markets due to the increase in labor costs. Since existing studies mainly focused on the labor market impacts of workers’ownbenefits, there is little direct evidence on the labor market impacts of workers’dependentbenefits. To answer these questions, this study investigates how the ACA-DM affected labor market outcomes of parents with children aged 19–25 years, using data from the AmericanCommunitySurvey (ACS). For the identification, we compare changes in the labor market outcomes of parents with eligible young adults (aged 19–25 years) before and after implementing the ACA-DM with those of parents with non-eligible young adults (aged 17–18 years and 26–28 years) using a difference-in-differences (DID) approach.The DID analysis results show that the ACA-DM reduced the annual wages of parents with children aged 19–25 years by $2636, about 4% of the average wage during the pre-reform period. The estimate is statistically significant at the 1% level. By contrast, the ACA-DM marginally decreased the probability of employment by 0.4 percentage points, weekly working hours by 0.48 hour, and the probability of full-time work by 0.1 percentage points. Compared with the pre-reform averages, the estimates of labor inputs are small in magnitude, although the estimate of the employment probability is statistically significant at the 5% level. Our back-of-the-envelope calculation indicates that the reduced wage amount is almost equivalent to the increased insurance premium of a family plan due to the ACA-DM, implying a full shift of the additional cost of expanded dependent coverage to workers. The results are robust to various alternative specifications. Our findings suggest that the extended provision of dependent health coverage to children aged 19–25 years via the ACA reform did not cause any significant deadweight loss in the labor market for parents with young adult children.This study contributes to the literature by investigating the impact of dependent health coverage on labor market outcomes. Several empirical studies examining the labor market impact of workers’ownhealth benefits document that mandated health benefits decrease workers’ wages with ambiguous impacts on labor inputs depending on workers’ valuation of health benefits (Baicker and Chandra, 2006;Gruber, 1994;Gruber and Kreuger, 1991;Kolstad and Kowalski, 2016;Lahey, 2012). While this literature provides important insights into the role of health benefits in the labor market, these findings cannot be directly applied to understand the labor market impacts of dependent health benefits. For example, workers’ demand for dependent coverage can be lower than that of their own coverage, particularly when dependent children are healthy (e.g., young adults aged 19–25 years). Alternatively, parents might demand children's health insurance coverage regardless of their children's health, because dependent health coverage can provide peace of mind to working parents when they know that their young adult children have access to health insurance through their employment (Kim and Koh, 2022). We contribute to this literature by providing novel evidence on the impact of dependent health coverage for children on parents’ labor market outcomes.Additionally, this study contributes to the scant literature on the labor market impact of the ACA-DM (Antwi et al., 2013,Barbaresco et al., 2015,Busch et al., 2014,Chua and Sommers, 2014;Goda et al., 2016;Kim, 2016;Yörük and Xu, 2019). While the literature mainly focuses on young adults’ labor market outcomes,Goda et al. (2016)is closest to our work in that they also examined the earnings of workers with children eligible for extended dependent coverage under the ACA-DM. Using data from the Survey of Income Program Participation (SIPP) 2008 panel, the authors compared changes in labor market outcomes between states with and without pre-existing dependent coverage mandates before the ACA for the identification, and found no evidence that the ACA-DM reduced the earnings of parents with eligible young adults. We argue that the difference between our results and theirs is likely driven by differences in the empirical strategy. The underlying assumption ofGoda et al. (2016)is that the effects of the ACA-DM on young adults’ health insurance coverage would be greater in states without pre-existing dependent coverage mandates. However,Antwi et al. (2013)showed that it was difficult for young adults to satisfy the requirements of state-level mandates prior to the ACA. As a result, the authors found little heterogeneity in the health insurance coverage impacts of ACA-DM between the two groups of states. This lack of the first-stage effect can explain the lack of evidence of wage reduction among parents with eligible young adults inGoda et al. (2016).1Moreover, the parallel trend assumption between states with pre-existing dependent coverage mandates and states without those mandates is likely to be violated if any lagged effects of an existing dependent coverage mandate subsided by the time the ACA was enacted.Goda et al. (2016), however, did not show evidence that would allow readers to judge the validity of the parallel trend assumption. We provide novel evidence on how ACA-DM affects parents’ labor market outcomes by overcoming the above-stated limitations.Finally, this study contributes to the literature by estimating the degree of the pass-through of employers’ costs for employees. Several studies have investigated the labor market impacts of employers’ cost burden and reported widely mixed results from zero to full incidence on workers, contrary toSummers’(1989)clear theoretical prediction.2Recently, a few studies have focused on heterogeneity in labor market institutions to reconcile the mixed results of the pass-through rate (Kim et al., 2021,Bozio et al., 2020;Saez et al., 2019).Saez et al. (2019)shows that pay fairness norms could explain why the wage response to payroll taxation deviates from the prediction of the canonicallabor market model.Bozio et al. (2020)and (Kim et al., 2021) investigate the roles of tax-benefit linkage and labor market competitiveness, respectively, to explain variations in the pass-through rate ofpayroll taxes. Our study provides consistent evidence with the findings ofBozio et al. (2020)and (Kim et al., 2021) that the pass-through rate is likely to be higher in a competitive labor market with a salient tax-benefit linkage.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.Section 2provides a brief background of ACA-DM and the conceptual framework of this study.Sections 3and4describe the data and empirical strategy, respectively.Section 5presents the empirical results, andSection 6concludes the paper.",Seonghoon,Kanghyock,None
"1. Theory linking occupation-based employment polarization and rising wage inequalityAcemoǧlu and Autor (2011)introduce a theoretical model to link occupation-based employment polarization to rising wageinequalityin the United States; less formal discussions of the theory appear inAutor, 2015a,Autor, 2015b. A common element of these accounts is that investments in computerization and automation lead to the elimination of routine tasks, thereby reducing demand and wages for workers in middle-skill occupations (and causing them to crowd into low-skill occupations characterized by manual tasks). At the same time, these investments are complementary with the so-called cognitive tasks of workers in high-skill occupations, raising theirlabor demandand wages.10The key wage inequality facts to be explained are shown inFig. 1. While the difference between log wages at the 90th percentile and the median has been growing steadily since 1973, trends in the lower part of the distribution have been less simple. The difference between the median and the 10th percentile rose considerably in the 1980s, then remained roughly stable until the mid 2010s.Download :Download high-res image (317KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1.

On the one hand, the displacement of workers from middle-wage occupations to low-wage occupations increases supply of low-wage workers; on the other hand, demand for low-wage services may rise along with the increasing numbers of high-wage workers. Together, these shifts imply increased low-wage employment but have ambiguous implications for wages. Nevertheless, early writing on U.S. polarization11has been understood by many readers to imply that employment polarization provides empirical support for a link between computerization and wage inequality,12even though the later literature is more circumspect.13We believe the theory linking rising wage inequality and employment polarization implies that the share of workers in low-wage occupations should rise, ceteris paribus. Because this link, along with changing worker welfare, motivates our interest in employment polarization, two of our three approaches to assessing employment trends require an absolute increase in the share of workers who are low-paid for polarization to be present. If the low-paid and middle-paid shares both decline, we see this as evidence of upward mobility rather than polarization even if the decline in the low-paid share is less marked. Later in the paper, our emphasis on individual wages rather than occupation mean wages distinguishes us from some of the previous literature. Naturally, there is no single correct definition of employment polarization, but rather various definitions appropriate for the testing of various hypotheses.",Jennifer,Ryan,None
"1. IntroductionThe growing numbers of global refugees in recent decades, particularly the experience of large refugee inflows to many EU countries in 2015, has sparked interest in the question of how public policies can help refugees get a footing in their destination countries. Many destination countries have programmes designed to help refugees adjust to their new environments, often providing financial support to help them meet basic needs as well as offering job-search assistance. In doing so, they acknowledge the challenges that refugees face. At the same time, however, there is increasing concern about the growing burden of welfare expenditures on refugees.Refugee children are a particularly vulnerable population, as their families often arrive in a foreign location with few or no resources. Whilst there is a substantial body of literature documenting the long-run consequences of child poverty and the benefits of targeted public policy, there is very little research documenting the role of targeted policies for refugees on the outcomes of the refugee children, despite the importance of the topic.1In this paper, we examine the role of refugee-specific government aid on the medium-term outcomes of refugees who migrate with their families as children (aged 1 to 14) and young adults (aged 15 to 24).A divided Germany in the post-WWII era provides us with a unique historical setting to examine the impact of refugee aid on refugees who arrive as children and young adults. From the end of the war in 1945 until theBerlinWall was built in 1961, an estimated 2.6 million East Germans escaped from the communist German Democratic Republic (GDR) and migrated to the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), or West Germany.2A large fraction of those refugees arrived as children or young adults.3Whilst all GDR refugees had access to West German social security and welfare benefits, only the subgroup with political escape motives became eligible for refugee-specific aid. This aid programme entailed a range of measures compensating for the losses the refugees had incurred and fostering their socio-economic integration. Importantly for our purposes, the aid programme included student allowances that allowed refugee children to attend university.A distinguishing feature of our study context is the similarity between the GDR refugees and the West German host country population, which bears similarity to the large and increasing numbers of internally displaced people observed in many countries today. Like refugees from other countries, East Germans left their belongings and social ties behind when they escaped from the East. They thus faced the economic, social, and psychological hardship brought about by the flight experiences. However, because East and West Germany were one country until 1945, GDR refugees were physically indistinguishable from the host country population and shared the same language, institutions, andculture, as well as similar historical experiences. Whilst this may constrain the one-to-one generalisability of our results to other groups of refugees, our specific context allows us to narrow the range of potential mechanisms that typically influence a refugee’s integration. These include language and cultural differences, mismatch of educational and vocational degrees amongst the parental generation, andlegal issuesrelated to residence or work permits. Overall, because of these similarities, we can better isolate the impact of governmental aid on the socio-economic success of refugees migrating as children and young adults.In the empirical analysis, we exploit the fact that the refugee-specific aid programme we are interested in was only introduced in 1953, i.e. eight years into the refugee influx. Based on the year of arrival to the West, we show that the selection of refugee parents did not change over time in a way that poses a threat to identification. We are thus able to identify the effect of access to aid based on the differential exposure of those who were eligible for aid and arrived in 1953 or later relative to those aid-eligible refugees who arrived prior to 1953. In addition, we can directly compare a treatment group of aid-eligible refugees with a control group of non-eligible refugees. To detect communist spies and infer strategic information, all GDR refugees were initially housed in camps, where they underwent severe screening by West German, U.S., British, and French authorities before they were accepted into West Germany (Kimmel, 2005,Limbach, 2011). During the screening, the refugees’ escape motives were rigorously examined. All refugees from the GDR had access to social security and welfare benefits. However, only the subgroup with political – as opposed to economic – escape motives was eligible for the refugee-specific aid programme that addressed their specific needs as refugees. Finally, we also include native West Germans in our study to account for structural changes in the West German economy.We distinguish the effects of refugee-specific aid on refugees who arrived as children (at ages 1 to 14) and as young adults (at ages 15 to 24). Age at arrival is an important determinant of integration success, typically for reasons that have to do with language proficiency (Bleakley and Chin, 2010).4In our context, given that the refugees speak the same language as the natives, the institutional connection to the host country is the most important reason for accounting for age at arrival.5Children below the age of 15 were still subject to compulsory schooling. Their choice of a given school track had important implications for whether they would later pursue higher education or enter the labour market more quickly, e.g. afterapprenticeshiptraining. By contrast, refugees arriving at ages 15 to 24 were less connected to the educational system. These young adults were faced with the decision of pursuing higher education, doing an apprenticeship degree, or immediately starting to work. In the absence of refugee-specific aid, economic necessity may have precluded these young adults from pursuing higher education, which could impact their socio-economic integration in the host country.We employ richmicrocensusdata collected in West Germany in 1971. For three reasons, these data are particularly suited to assessing the impact of refugee-specific aid. Firstly, we observe the entire pool of GDR refugees, rather than having to rely on country of origin as an indicator of “likely refugees” as is typically done in this context (see, for example,Borjas, 2000,Cortes, 2004,LoPalo, 2019). Our identification strategy further exploits the fact that, at the individual level, we can identify and compare those refugees eligible for aid with their non-eligible counterparts, and that we observe their age and year of arrival. Secondly, we observe a range of socio-economic outcomes in 1971, at least 10 years after arrival in the host country. We therefore focus on the medium-term effects of the aid programme. Finally, our data capture detailed information on the father’s education, the mother’s education, the father’sindustry, and the father’s occupational status. We control for this information in our analysis, since historical accounts identify such criteria as important observable characteristics that determined whether a family in the GDR was considered to be potential “class enemies” who needed re-education and other interventions to become “good socialist citizens”. In addition to being important control variables per se, the parental background characteristics may have also influenced whether West German and Allied authorities considered a family to be genuinepolitical refugees, which meant that they became eligible for refugee-specific aid.For male refugees migrating as young adults (at ages 15 to 24), we find that immediate eligibility for government aid significantly improved the likelihood that they completed a higher level of education by 13.4 percentage points. In line with this large effect on human capital, these refugees also had higher-status jobs and higher net monthly incomes in 1971. The results suggest that government spending makes a decisive difference in situations in which parents are highly liquidity constrained. These effects tend to be somewhat stronger for male refugees from relatively lower socio-economic status (SES) families. Among females who arrived as young adults, we find that access to aid upon arrival increased the probability that they obtained a high academic qualification by 8.1 percentage points and increased wages by 17.3 percent. Similar to what we find for the young male adults, the effects tend to be somewhat stronger for female refugees from relatively lower socio-economic status (SES) families.Among those who arrived as children (ages 1 to 14), we find evidence of targeted aid having an effect on boys. For these refugees, targeted aid led to a 10.1 percentage point increase in the probability that the child enrols in the academic track instead of the vocational track of secondary school. We find no such effects for girls.We should stress that our estimates capture the effects on the outcomes of aid eligibility rather than aid receipt. That is, we are estimating an intention-to-treat effect. We see this as the relevant policy measure, since policymakers may decide upon the offer of aid but not the take-up. Moreover, the intention-to-treat effect is not confounded by a potentially endogenous take-up of aid.We contribute to the surprisingly small body of literature on how welfare affects the success of refugees, much of which does not look at the effects of migrating as a child.Andersen et al. (2019)study a 2002 reform of social assistance in Denmark that cut refugee benefit levels by up to 50 percent and changed the modalities of how social assistance is paid. Whilst the authors find immediate increases in male employment that fade over time, the reform reduced femalelabour force participation. In additional analyses of the “unintended” effects of the reform, the authors investigate how the reform affected children who became residents at different stages of childhood. Consistent with our results, young adults (18-year-olds in their case) opt for contributing to family resources instead ofinvestment in educationwhen faced with the trade-off. Focusing solely on adults,LoPalo (2019)analyses the effects of cash aid paid to refugees as part of the United States’ refugee resettlement programme. She finds that cash aid increases wages for the employed, with the largest wage effect seen amongst the highly educated, but does not alter employment.6In addition, a recent literature looks at the effects of cash transfers on refugee children in poorer destination countries. Consistent with our findings,Aygün et al. (2021)find that an increase in household income made it significantly more likely that Syrian refugee children in Turkey went to school rather than engaged in child labour. Another cash transfer programme in Lebanon had a positive impact on school attendance among Syrian refugees already enrolled in school (De Hoop et al., 2019).7In a broader sense, our study contributes evidence to the discussion on whether governments should pursue a “work-first” or “train-first” strategy when it comes to refugee integration programmes, a discussion that so far focuses on adult refugees.Arendt (2022), for example, analyses a reform in Denmark in 2016 that shifted the focus of government policy away from training refugees first and towards a faster take-up of employment. He finds that the shift towards the “work-first” policy did indeed speed up the entry into jobs for men; however, the quality of jobs that they obtained was lower.Our study also relates toFalck et al. (2012), who use the same historical setting and analyse the same government aid programme as we do but focus on people expelled from Central and Eastern Europe after WWII. Moreover, they focus on individuals who had already finished their education before 1939 (i.e. on average, they were already about 31 years old in 1939). In contrast to what we find for the GDR refugees, their overall conclusion is that the programme did not foster expellees’labour market integration. The combined evidence from both studies allows a comprehensive assessment and understanding of the workings of the programme.8The paper is structured as follows.Section 2explains the historical background;Section 3describes the data, samples, and main variables;Section 4presents the empirical framework; andSection 5includes the analyses and results.Section 6provides sensitivity analyses and robustness checks.

"1. IntroductionThe United States is often depicted as the “land of opportunity,” where people believe they can achieve success regardless of their social origins or family backgrounds. However, in striking contrast to this perception, the U.S. is currently one of theleastintergenerationally mobile developed countries (Corak, 2013). According toChetty et al. (2017b), the upward mobility, defined as the fraction of children earning more than their parents, decreased sharply for the cohorts born after 1940—from 90% for the 1940 cohort to 50% for the 1980 cohort.1Also, upward mobility fell the most for middle-class children: being born to a middle-class family is no longer a guarantee of middle-class life for the children themselves. In other words, the bigger problem is not that the economy does not grow any longer, but rather the growth is not sufficiently shared among those who are from less advantaged families.2Contemporaneously, another even more notable trend is the so-calledJob Polarization(Autor, Dorn, 2013,Goos, Manning, 2007) in the U.S. since 1980, with the “hollowing out” of middle-skill jobs and expansion of both good and bad jobs in relative terms.3The literature (e.g.,Autor and Dorn (2013);Autor et al. (2003);Goos and Manning (2007);Goos et al. (2014)) hypothesizes and confirms with data that such job polarization is primarily driven by middle-skill-task-replacing automation technology.4Because the tasks subject to recent technological substitution are typically routine or repetitive (Autor et al., 2003), this hypothesis is calledroutine-biased technological change(henceforth RBTC,Goos et al. (2014)). According toAutor and Dorn (2013), RBTC has had nearly neutral effects on employment rate but changed the composition radically: numerous routine middle-skill jobs (e.g., production, operation, clerical and administrative jobs) have been replaced by non-tradable low-skill service jobs (e.g., retail, food delivery) for the employment of less-educated people.5Compared with the former, service jobs typically pay less and provide fewer opportunities for career progression. A manufacturing job often helps a person without a college degree have a middle-class lifestyle, which is hardly the case for the majority of service jobs. In contrast, the more educated workers who perform non-routine cognitive tasks have improved their earnings, as recent automation technology tends to complement their skills.This paper finds suggestive evidence that RBTC has contributed to the sharp decline in recent cohorts’ upward mobility. As addressed above, the literature has established that less educated people are becoming worse off in terms of their earnings because of RBTC, while the opposite is true for more educated people. It is not apparenta prioriwhether a child will be positively or negatively affected by RBTC upon her entry into the labour market, which depends on her skill or educational level. This paper primarily asks whether the effect of RBTC relates to one’s family background and finds supporting evidence. Compared with the existing literature, this paper also provides a novel perspective through which we can better understand RBTC’s labour market impacts: the relationship between family background and children’s educational attainment, and how this relationship is shaped by RBTC.To motivate my empirical analyses, I extend (Becker et al., 2018) model and derive novel testable implications (Appendix A). According to my theory, whether a child will be positively or negatively affected by RBTC upon her entry into the labour market is uncertain and depends on her family background, among others. My model predicts heterogeneous effects of RBTC on mobility across the family income distribution. Specifically, RBTC makes disadvantaged children less likely to move upward and more likely to move downward while strengthening advantaged children’s advantage. This is because routine jobs serve as an alternative way to move upward if disadvantaged children cannot go to college and find a high-skilled job, which is often the case. As these jobs decline, it is harder for disadvantaged children to escapepoverty.By exploiting the geographic variation of historical industrial specialization patterns that determine local labour markets’ exposure to RBTC, my empirical results largely confirm these predictions: I find that a greater exposure to RBTC is robustly associated with a reduction in upward mobility, and an increase in downward mobility for children from almost all family backgrounds.Numerically, holding other things equal, the probability for children to move from the bottom quintile to the top quintile is 1.24% less likely for those living in areas with the exposure to RBTC at the 75th percentile than their counterparts in areas with the exposure at the 25th percentile. As a benchmark, the national average probability for such a movement is 7.5%. The basic idea is that RBTC leads to more skewedlabour demandin terms of skill requirements and disproportionately rewards the high-skilled workers (e.g., college graduates). In contrast, RBTC makes less skilled ones (e.g., high school graduates) more likely to take jobs traditionally held by low-skilled workers. As a result, RBTC has made it harder for disadvantaged children to climb up the social ladder by finding a decent job. In theory, all children have the chance to benefit from RBTC if they manage to become high-skilled. Nevertheless, most disadvantaged children fail to do so because their families typically lack the necessary resources (money, parental human capital, etc.) to prepare them for high-skilled jobs (Bartik and Hershbein, 2018). Further, a follow-up decomposition practice shows that the exposure to RBTC is a quantitatively important explanatory variable for upward mobility among other relevant predictors identified in the literature.On the other hand, regarding the “relative mobility,” which is a summary measure of both upward and downward mobility and often referred to as “mobility” in the literature, I find that it has nearly zero association with the exposure to RBTC. This seemingly null result likely reflects a mixture of opposite effects of RBTC at different segments across the family income distribution, providing a plausible explanation for the puzzle that relative mobility has stayed constant in recent decades despite the rapidly increasinginequalityin the U.S. (Chetty, Hendren, Kline, Saez, 2014,Lee, Solon, 2009). My analysis suggests that RBTC has decreased the upward mobility of the disadvantaged children (making the lower half more persistent) and increased thedownwardmobility of more advantaged children (making the upper half less persistent). These two effects of RBTC on relative mobility work in the opposite direction and almost entirely cancel out each other.In this paper, I also find suggestive evidence for 1. the negative relationship between the exposure to RBTC and upward mobility is primarily driven by males and much more moderate for females; 2. This relationship is concave in the exposure to RBTC; 3. This relationship is weakened by the presence of a large mining sector, but largely unaffected by the presence of a largeagricultural sector; 4. RBTC has increased the college attendance rates for families with almost all income levels (thus leading to an “educational upgrading”); 5. RBTC has shortened the gap in attendance rates between high- and low-income families; 6. Nevertheless, RBTC has widened the gap in collegequalityby family income. These results suggest that when exposed to RBTC, disadvantaged children are moreeducationallyupward mobile in terms of college attendance, but this is not enough to offset the negative impacts RBTC has exerted through the labour market on their upward mobility in terms of income.My results are robust under a series of sensitivity checks, which are presented in the appendix B. First, using Census data (1980–2000), I show suggestive evidence that RBTC has indeed led to an educational upgrading and widened the gap in children’s incomes by their family origins, consistent with my baseline results. More interestingly, I carry out a placebo test suggesting that the polarizing effect of RBTC on income was present in 1990 and 2000, but not in 1980, when RBTC was starting to take place. Finally, my results generally hold using alternative measures and specifications.My paper makes at least three contributions: 1. Contribute to understanding the determinants of the considerable geographic variation in mobility within the U.S., identified byChetty, Hendren, Kline, Saez (2014), and find suggestive evidence that RBTC has played a quantitatively important role. 2. Give a plausible explanation for the remarkable decline of upward mobility in the United States; 3. Help to understand the distributional effects of technology. Technology makes us better off collectively, but it may also make some of us worse off. While the relationship between technology and inequality has drawn much attention (e.g.,Acemoglu (1998);Autor and Dorn (2013);Autor et al. (2003)), my paper adds to this literature from the intergenerational perspective.The rest of the paper is organized as follows.Section 2lays out the background of this paper.Section 3describes the data and measures used and provides some motivating evidence.Section 4introduces the empirical model.Section 5documents my main empirical results and discusses how they help crack a puzzle in the literature.Section 6investigates the mechanisms behind my results.

"1. IntroductionMany countries have witnessed stagnation in the narrowing of the gender pay gap in recent decades, contrasting with the rapid advances in the educational attainment and labor market experience of women (Albrecht, Björklund, Vroman, 2003,Bailey, 2006,Blau, Kahn, 2017,Bruns, 2019,Goldin, 2014). The recent literature has attempted to reconcile this conflicting evidence by studying the role of firm-specific premiums in the gender wage gap (Card et al., 2016) and its evolution over time (Bruns, 2019,Casarico, Lattanzio, 2019). Gender differentials in firm-specific premiums explain a sizable proportion of the gender pay gap and play a central role in explaining recent trends in wageinequality(Abowd, Kramarz, Margolis, 1999,Barth, Kerr, Olivetti, 2021,Card, Cardoso, Heining, Kline, 2018). Indeed,Bruns (2019)provided strong evidence for the role of firm pay premiums in the marked slowdown in gender convergence in Germany since the 1990s. These effects could be attributed to “changes in employers’ pay policies that have been detrimental to women.”While the literature on firm-specific pay premiums provides novel insights into the evolution (or stagnation) of the gender pay gap, little is known about how public policy can affect these premiums. In this paper, we analyze the effect of Chile’s 2009 Equal Pay for Equal Work Law (EPL) on firm-specific wage premiums. We first assess firms’ contribution to the gender pay gap using matched employer-employee data from Chile for the 2005–2013 period. We estimate a wage model with two high-dimensionalfixed effectsfollowingAbowd et al. (1999)(AKM, hereafter). This approach permits us to compute the firm-specific pay premium for males and females in connected firms (by workers’ mobility) and decompose them into sorting effects, i.e., the effect due to female workers sorting into low-paying firms, and bargaining power effects, i.e., the effect due to workers’ ability to extract firm rents when negotiating, followingCard et al. (2016)(CCK, hereafter).1We then use CCK’s framework to assess the effect of Chile’s 2009 EPL on the contribution of firms to the gender wage gap (firm-specific gender pay gap). The law established equal remuneration for work of equal value in firms with 10 or more workers and monetary penalties that increase with firm size, as measured by the number of permanent workers. It also mandates firms with 200 or more workers to disclose information about their wage-setting and promotional procedures by providing a registry of all positions or functions in the company according to their essential technical skills (disclosure requirement). Thus, we estimate AKM models for male and female workers before and after the law, allowing us to implement a difference-in-differences (DID) analysis to assess whether the law affected the firm-specific gender pay gap (captured bygender differencesin firm fixed-effects). By implementing a simple reweighting scheme, we show that our DID results correspond to the effect of the EPL on the bargaining power effect. We also perform comparisons of sorting and bargaining power before and after the law using firms with fewer than 10 workers as a benchmark. Finally, we assess whether the law affected sorting patterns following an approach similar to that ofCasarico and Lattanzio (2019). In particular, we estimate the effect of the law on the probability of moving to a firm in a higher/lower quartile of the pay premium distribution. We do so using a DID approach, using females as the treated group and males as the untreated group, before and after the law.We find that firms explain approximately 39% of the gender pay gap, which averaged 25 log points in the analyzed period (2005–2013). Sorting effects account for approximately 32 to 36 pp (82-92%), and bargaining power effects account for 3 to 7 pp (8-18%). The EPL helps to reduce the gender pay gap explained by firms by 1.5 pp (6.1%). The reductions are larger in firms with 200 and more workers exposed to higher fines and the disclosure requirement, ranging between 1.9 and 2.5 pp (7.8–10.2% of the pay gap). We find that the effect of the law manifests through bargaining power only, with no impact on the sorting channel. We argue that the limited effect of the law is due to the reduced share of the bargaining power effect relative to the sorting effect of the firm’s total contribution to the pay gap.Our paper contributes to the literature in three ways. First, it is the first paper, to the best of our knowledge, to assess the effects of an EPL on the firm-specific pay premium gap. The Chilean case provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the impact of an EPL on the contribution of firms to the gender gap. While many countries passed EPLs in the 1970s or earlier, when no matched employer-employee data existed, Chile passed its EPL in 2009, when this type of data was already available.2Indeed, we have access to rich administrative matched employer-employee data from the Unemployment Insurance registry (UI), allowing us to construct a large monthly panel dataset with 60 million observations. Second, we can decompose the law’s impact on bargaining power and sorting channels using the framework of CCK. Third, our paper provides estimates of bargaining power and sorting effects in the context of a medium-income country with labor market institutions different from those of the developed world.Our paper relates to three broad streams of the literature. First, our study contributes to the literature studying the role of firms in determining the pay gap. Using matched employer-employee data from Portugal,Card et al. (2016)showed that gender differentials in the firm-specific pay premium explain approximately 20% of the gender pay gap. As described above, they decomposed firms’ contribution to the gender gap into sorting and bargaining power effects, finding that sorting effects explain most of the gap (80%), with bargaining power explaining approximately one fifth.3Our paper also relates toBarth et al. (2021), who analyzed workers’ movements within and across firms to measure shifts in the salaries of men and women over the lifecycle. They found that differential mobility between firms by gender could explain approximately 27% of the widening of the overall gender pay gap for college-educated workers.Our paper also contributes to the literature on EPLs and their effects on the gender pay gap. Evidence on the effectiveness of EPLs remains scarce.Gunderson (1975)assessed the effect of equal pay legislation on male-female pay differentials using Canadian data. Using ordinary least squares (OLS), he found no significant effect of the law on Canada’s gender pay gap.Neumark and Stock (2006)studied the effects of sex and race discrimination laws on employment and earnings in the US. Using a difference-in-difference-in-differences approach (DDD), they assessed how changes in employment and earnings differ among states that did and did not pass sex and race discrimination laws. They found a negative effect on employment and a negative short-term effect on earnings, “but with a growing positive effect over time that offsets this.”4Finally, since the EPL includes a disclosure requirement for large firms, our study relates to the literature on the effect of transparency laws on wage inequality. For example,Mas (2017)studied the effect of a transparency mandate in California that required all municipal salaries to be posted online. He found a 7% decline in average compensation of top managers and a 75% increase in their quit rate; these results are consistent with the hypothesis of aversion to excessive remuneration.Baker et al. (2019)examined a similar policy that disclosed the salaries of university faculties in Canada when they exceeded specified thresholds, finding a decrease in average salaries and a contraction of the gender wage gap.The rest of this paper is organized as follows.Section 2describes the institutional background, andSection 3describes the data.Section 4presents the empirical models,Section 5reports the results, andSection 6concludes the study.",Gabriel,Tomás,None
"1. IntroductionReliance on self-reported work hours from survey data, which are prone to non-classical measurement error, has long been viewed as an impediment to studying the determinants of work hours (Heckman, 1993;Rodgers et al., 1993). In particular, the vast majority of research on labor supply has necessarily used survey data on self-reported work hours, although showed that the correlation between self-reported and payroll hours is only about 0.6.1Administrative data have led to important advances in the understanding of earnings determination andlabor mobility, but they generally do not include information on work hours. The gap is limiting because the determination of work hours plays such a central role inlabor economicsandmacroeconomics.This paper examines the quality of administrative records on paid work hours reported by employers in the State of Washington. In order to manage and administer unemployment insurance (UI), all states require employers to report the earnings of each employee on a quarterly basis, but employers in Washington must in addition report quarterly paid work hours.2Hours reporting is mandatory because eligibility for UI in Washington is determined by the number of work hours a UI claimant has accumulated in roughly the year before a claim.3Questions have long been raised about the suitability of UI administrative earnings records for research. Because they are central to financing and administering UI, most states randomly audit employer earnings reports (Blakemore et al., 1996;Burgess et al., 1998). Accordingly, it is not surprising that existing validation studies have concluded that UI earnings records, despite drawbacks, provide a good, and sometimes preferable, alternative to survey data for evaluation studies.4We begin by examining the distribution of work hours in the Washington administrative data and comparing it with the hours distribution in the Current Population Survey outgoing rotation groups (CPS).5We find that the Washington data and the CPS are consistent in suggesting that about half of employees work close to 40 hours per week. The main difference of substance between the Washington data and the CPS is that a larger proportion of workers report working more than 43 hours per week in the CPS. We interpret this as evidence that a substantial percentage of salaried workers are being paid to work 40 hours per week (as reported in the administrative data) but have actual work hours greater than 40 per week.Second, we assess the ratio of signal to noise in the Washington hours records by estimating slope coefficients in regressions of changes in log earnings on changes in log hours for workers who did not change employers. We find this slope coefficient is 0.80 for data analyzed at a quarterly frequency. Assuming that, for job-stayers, quarter-to-quarter earnings vary stochastically around a fixed per-hour wage, the estimates imply a high ratio of signal-to-noise in the Washington hours data.Third, we construct a measure of hourly wages by dividing quarterly earnings by quarterly hours. We show that the distribution of thishourly wage rateexhibits a spike at the Washington minimum wage, and that the spike moves with year-to-year increases in Washington's minimum wage, which is indexed. Finally, we conduct a consistency check of the hours data by estimating Mincer-style regressions using log hourly wage rates and show that the age-wage profile, returns to education, and gender wage and earnings gaps are similar to analogous estimates based on survey data.Our findings have implications for any analysis of paid work hours and for economic variables constructed using hours in the denominator, like hourly wage rates and output per hour (Ramey, 2012). They also have implications for the use of administrative data in analyzing employment-to-employment worker transitions, as we show in the concludingSection 7. In the policy domain, the findings have implications for estimating the benefits and costs of income transfers, as well as for understanding the impacts of labor market regulations, notably minimum wage and overtime regulations under the Fair Labor Standard Act (Quach, 2021).The rest of the paper is organized as follows.Section 2describes the Washington administrative data, andSection 3compares the distributions of work hours in the Washington data and the CPS.Section 4develops a regression-based test of signal-to-noise in the Washington hours data.Section 5examines nominal hourly wage distributions generated by the Washington records (by year) and examines those distributions in relation to changes in the Washington minimum wage.Section 6describes estimates of log wage and log earnings regressions estimated using the Washington data, and the final section offers some concluding observations.",Marta,Alexandre,Stephen
"1. IntroductionLabour markets have become increasingly focused on knowledge-basedindustries, which require higher levels of technical skills. There is a resulting widening of the gap between the skills needed in the marketplace and those available from existing workers, with companies unable to fill vacancies and grow at the rate which they would like. As a result, the wage disparity between high- and low-skilled workers has grown (Acemoglu, 2002). Many workers with few or obsolete skills face diminishing demand, and worsening labour outcomes. These forces have combined to increase the polarization of job quality and income, leading to wideninginequality(Autor and Dorn, 2013;Autor et al., 2006;Goos and Manning, 2007;Goos et al., 2014).Providing effective pathways for unemployed and underemployed workers into sustainable and sustaining employment is a criticalpolicy issueto combat bothpovertyand inequality. Active Labour Market Programmes (ALMP) provide potential interventions to improve worker outcomes, and training programmes are a common type of ALMP (Brown and Koettl, 2015;Kluve, 2010). These educational programmes have the potential to increase the human capital of these workers, better positioning them in the workforce landscape with in-demand skills. There are several types of programmes aimed at workforce development through increasing human capital, including formal post-secondary education (four-year and two-year college), vocational and career education,apprenticeships, job training programmes, and on-the-job training. These differ in the funder, the provider, and the format of the training. These types of programmes have shown promising returns in some settings, albeit not in every instance. Publicly-subsidized training programmes are typically medium-length (often between one week and one year) and have training provided by various entities, including community colleges, private training organizations, employers, and the government itself. Such programmes have existed in the United States and Europe for several decades and have a robust research base. The existing literature has found that the programmes can be effective, but are not always so (Van Horn et al., 2015;Fortson et al., 2017;Brown and Koettl, 2015).Two of the issues that hurt the effectiveness of training programmes are high attrition and mismatches between skills provided and locallabour demand. To that end, the New Orleans Office of Workforce Development (OWD) designed and implementedCareer Pathways, funded by a US Department of labour (DOL) Workforce Innovation Fund (WIF) grant. WIF grants are authorized under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) passed in 2014. Career Pathways offered training for unemployed and underemployed individuals relevant for medium-skilled jobs in the advanced manufacturing, health care, and information technology (IT) sectors. OWD purposefully chose the industries and developed the curriculum in coordination with local firms, critical features of successful programmes referred to as demand-driven training. Further, to combat programme attrition, potential trainees were screened by various profiling tools before they were allowed entry into the randomization pool and thus into training. For evaluation purposes, the programme was implemented as a randomized controlled trial (RCT).In this paper, we examine new and important aspects of the impact of the Career Pathways programme. InBaird et al. (2019), we evaluated the Career Pathways and found it to lead to increased earnings, especially for those unemployed at entry into the programme. We add to those findings and to the overall literature on effectiveness of job training programmes in several ways. First, while we are examining the same intervention as inBaird et al. (2019), we obtained more data than used in that report, expanding from that analysis of 13 training cohorts to 20 cohorts in this paper, as well as examining post-training outcomes for an additional six months. Additionally, the programme allowed for persons randomized into a control group to enter later randomization pools, resulting in some individuals moving from the control group to the treatment group in later quarters. We account for these individuals in a different manner than inBaird et al. (2019)(particularly important given our longer timeline and 7 additional later cohorts), eliminating the risk of bias from the selection of motivated repeaters out of the control group.This paper also differs fromBaird et al. (2019)by focusing on an important moderator of the outcomes, the individual's baseline employment status (has a job, short-term unemployed, long-term unemployed).Baird et al. (2019)grouped short and long term unemployed together in evaluating this moderator, and did not examine it across all the outcomes examined here. Understandingtreatment effectheterogeneity is important, as it helps to shed light on how trainees are or are not benefiting, which can be used for targeting of interventions, developing appropriate post-training supports (in areas where they are not succeeding), and building best practices.We find that the training is effective in terms of increasing earnings: the intent-to-treat (ITT) estimate of $436/quarter yields about a 12 % increase over the control group; the local average treatment effect (LATE) estimate using aninstrumental variableestimator for those who attended training is $1054/quarter for about a 30 % increase over the control group. The effectiveness of the programme is largest for short-term unemployed trainees, a group of particular interest. For them, the ITT estimate is $1450. This group also has positive and significant estimates for the impact of the programme on the probability of being employed. We also find that trainees were more likely to work in target industries, although this effect does not seem as differentiated amongst employment groups.The paper proceeds as follows.Section 2describes the prior literature regarding job training programmes for adults.Section 3discusses the context, provides a conceptual framework, and presents the data sources used in this analysis.Section 4describes the methodology used in the paper, whileSection 5presents the results of our analyses.Section 6concludes.",Matthew,John,Italo
"1. IntroductionA growing body of literature shows that family-related employment interruptions negatively affect the subsequent careers of women. After interruption periods, women experience negative employment and wage effects (see, for example,Beblo, Bender, Wolf, 2009,Drange, Rege, 2013,Evertsson, 2016), loweroccupational mobility(see, for example,Evertsson, Grunow, 2012,Evertsson, Grunow, Aisenbrey, 2016) and a reduced probability of receiving job-related training (Puhani and Sonderhof, 2011). Recent studies show that interruption periods also contribute to the gender gap in wages and income (see, for example,Angelov, Johansson, Lindahl, 2016,Goldin, 2014).Kleven, Landais, Posch, Steinhauer, Zweimüller, 2019a,Kleven, Landais, Søgaard, 2019bestimate the child penalty defined as a percentage of women falling behind men after childbirth in different countries. They report a significant short- and long-run penalty in earnings for all countries; however, for Germany, they report the largest penalty of 61%.Table 1.

The presented examples refer to training goals that are often listed on the training voucher. The category “others” contains different types of training programs with very few participants.Policies to address these earnings penalties focus mainly on instruments influencing the length of employment interruptions after giving birth (for a recent survey, see,Cortés and Pan, 2020). This focus is reflected in the economic literature that investigates the impact of parental leave and job protectionlegislationon mothers return behavior and their employment outcomes (e.g.,Kluve, Schmitz, 2018,Lalive, Schlosser, Steinhauer, Zweimüller, 2014,Lalive, Zweimüller, 2009,Schönberg, Ludsteck, 2014). In a recent study in Germany, Kluve and Schmitz (2018) analyze a reform of the parental benefit system that introduced very generous but temporally limited benefit payments that could be divided between parents. The reform changed women’s interruption behavior and positively affected their employment rates and job quality after return. However, women career patterns remain characterized by interruption periods and episodes of part-time work that increase the gender wage gap over the employment life cycle (Schrenker and Zucco, 2020).Little is known about the effectiveness of policies to re-integrate women once they decide to withdraw from the labor market for shorter or longer durations. In this paper, I investigate the impact of publicly funded vocational training for women in Germany who intend to re-enter the labor market after family-related interruptions. Hence, my study contributes to understanding the effectiveness of a policy instrument that could alleviate gender penalties in wages and employment when the interruption period has already occurred. Women can return to the labor market in different ways. I focus on the subset of re-entrants that register at a local employment agency in Germany to use the services provided by the public employment service (PES). Re-entrants with a family-related interruption period of at least 12 months are defined as “job returners” and are eligible for placement services andactive labor market policies(ALMP). Therefore, German legislation recognizes the relevance of the successful re-integration of returning women.Vocational training programs are expected to improve the labor market prospects of job returners for various reasons. First, they provide occupation-specific knowledge and job-related skills to participants, and the certificates are an important signaling device for potential employers. Second, the attendance of such courses is an opportunity to meet women in similar situations and to build networks that have been found to positively affect labor market opportunities (e.g.,Calvo-Armengol and Jackson, 2004). Especially after long interruption periods, these programs may provide a first chance to make contact with potential co-workers. Third, program participation may serve as an exercise in managing work and family life with respect to time constraints and childcare facilities.In Germany, publicly funded vocational training is assigned through training vouchers. A challenge in this study is that the assignment of these vouchers is likely endogenous. Responsible caseworkers in the agency decide whether to award the voucher and are likely to base their assignment decision on women’s job-finding probability after participation. To identify the causal effects of being awarded a training voucher, I apply a matching strategy to account for selection based on observable characteristics. I perform an analysis using the population of female job returners who receive a training voucher from 2003 to 2005 and a random sample of non-treated job returners from German administrative data. These data contain daily records of the pre- and post-interruption periods as well as a large set of characteristics including the employment histories of the women before their labor market exit. Conditional on these determinants, I argue that the job returners are randomly awarded a training voucher. Many robustness checks support the identifying assumptions and justify a causal interpretation of the findings.My findings suggest that vocational training programs could alleviate gender penalties in wages and employment when the interruption period has already occurred. The award of a training voucher translates into a 12 percentage point (ppoint) higher probability of employment and higher monthly earnings of 210 Euros/250 US dollar (USD) six years after treatment compared to not receiving it. This is a very sizeable effect as it reduces the gap between pre- and post-interruption earnings in the counterfactual of not receiving a training voucher by as much as 77%. Furthermore, job quality improves and job stability increases. Job returners who receive training vouchers have a significant higher probability of working full-time and receiving at least their previous earnings. Moreover, the probability of experiencing unstable marginal employment decreases permanently, and treated job returners are more often employed in stable jobs.Analyzing effect heterogeneity in terms of job returners’ qualification and their participation in different program types reveals interesting insights. I find a training voucher to be most effective for job returners without a vocational degree. However, it also contributes to the successful re-integration of medium-skilled women with a vocational degree. For the highest skilled job returners with academic degrees, awarding a training voucher is ineffective. A decomposition of the overall effect by the redemption decision reveals a zero effect for unredeemed training vouchers. Conditional on voucher redemption, the effectiveness of training increases with the length of the courses and intensity of human capital provided in the different program types.My paper relates to several fields in the literature. It is the first study to estimate the impacts of vocational training for female job returners on their subsequent labor market outcomes. Thus, it adds to the literature evaluating active labor market programs focusing on women (for an overview, see,Bergemann and van den Berg, 2008) and especially to the rare literature that focuses on programs targeting women after family-related employment interruptions (see,Bergemann, van den Berg, 2014,Diener, Götz, Schreyer, Stephan, 2013). In contrast to these studies, I focus on a sample of women that have a manifested return idea. Moreover, none of the programs evaluated in these studies are comparable to vocational training programs in terms of content or intensity.Bergemann and van den Berg (2014)evaluate anadult education programfor young, low-skilled mothers with small children in Sweden. The program provides general skills to low-educated mothers to improve theiremployability. The findings suggest positive effects on wage and employment rates; however, enrollment is low. In recent years, the German Federal Employment Agency initiated a modular program targeting women considering a return. The modules consist of informative events, short training measures and intensive counseling.Diener et al. (2013)report significant positive effects on the probability of working full-time for women who finish all the modules.This paper also relates to the large body of literature concerning the effectiveness of vocational training for unemployed individuals in Germany, other EU countries (e.g.,Doerr, Fitzenberger, Kruppe, Paul, Strittmatter, 2017,Lechner, Miquel, Wunsch, 2011) and the US (e.g.,Andersson, Holzer, Lane, Rosenblum, Smith, 2013,Heinrich, Mueser, Troske, Jeon, Kahvecioglu, 2013). A detailed overview of the effectiveness of these programs is provided byMcCall et al. (2016). By definition, these studies exclude the population of job returners because they restrict their evaluation samples to individuals entering unemployment directly out of employment. Observations of job returners who enter unemployment out of inactivity are not considered. However, the study byDoerr et al. (2017)is most closely related to this paper. They study the effectiveness of training vouchers in Germany for the same period and with the same data for the regular unemployed. The authors report significant positive effects on employment probability and wages that are much lower in size than the effects presented here. For regular unemployed, they find small employment effects of two percentage points and no effect on monthly earnings. They find no significant differences by gender. The effectiveness of vocational training is much higher for job returners than for regular unemployed women.More broadly, this study also relates to the literature that focuses on the effects of parental leave and benefit policies on interruption durations and female labor market outcomes.Dahl et al. (2016);Kluve and Schmitz (2018);Lalive et al. (2014);Schönberg and Ludsteck (2014)for example, investigate such policies in European countries and, e.g.,Baker et al. (2008);Rossin-Slater et al. (2013)do so in the US and Canada. In contrast, this paper focuses on how an active labor market policy, namely, the opportunity to receive vocational training, affects the employment situation of women after family-related employment interruptions that last beyond the usual maternal leave period.The remainder of this study is structured as follows. The background information and a description of the institutional setting follow inSection 2. The data description and sample definitions are presented inSection 3.

"1. IntroductionThe majority of workers switch jobs without experiencing a spell of unemployment. In the US, 2.6% of employed persons change employers each month, a flow that is more than twice as large as employment to unemployment (Fallick and Fleischman, 2004). Moreover, employer-to-employer (henceforth EE) transitions play a key role in job ladder models, the leading framework inlabor economicsfor studying the evolution of wages.Despite the importance of EE transitions, the lack of the exact start and end dates for employment spells in most datasets limits our understanding of the impact of EE transitions on individual and aggregate labor market outcomes. Misclassified transitions affect not only the direct importance of the EE transition rate compared to the UE rate, but they also affect policy conclusions based on models that use the EE rate as a key input. Indeed, EE transitions are interpreted as coming from search and recruiting efforts that improves the allocation of labor resources (Mortensen, 2003). Misclassifications of EE transitions are referred to as time aggregation bias. It arises when employment relationships (i.e., jobs) are not measured continuously but are aggregated over some time period. Prominent examples are administrative datasets recorded at the annual or quarterly frequency from the US.How does the EE rate differ when job spells are measured at different frequencies? Is misclassification more severe in loose labor markets? This paper proposes answers to these questions, and proposes a way to correct for time aggregation bias using earnings information and not just start and end dates of employment spells. To do so, we use employment spell data measured at the daily frequency from Denmark for the period 2008-2019. The dataset we exploit is unique in Europe as it covers all jobs in a flexible and dynamic labor market as in the US. For example, American and Danish men are twice as likely to make an EE switch compared to their French and Italian peers throughout their careers (Engbom, 2020).The main result of this paper is that time aggregation bias overestimates the EE transition rate by up to 30%. Indeed, the quarterly EE transition rate is approximately 3.75% using the daily information. By aggregating to quarterly data, and defining an EE transition as having two jobs in adjacent quarters, the quarterly transition rate is 5.45%, which is 30 % too high. Using a more conservative approach, which defines EE transitions as having two different jobs within the same quarter (within approach), the EE transition rate is around 3.22%, i.e., 14% too low. The reason for the latter result is that the within approach misses true EE transitions that happen right between quarters.Next, we show that misclassification is procyclical. Increasing the unemployment rate by two percentage points decreases the difference between the quarterly EE and daily EE rates by 11%. This result is driven by the fact that non-employment spells are shorter in expansions. This makes it more likely to wrongly classify a job change involving a non-employment spell as an EE transition. Our results suggest that, in recessions, the large drop in the EE rate is partly driven by time aggregation bias. This result confirms the conjecture ofMoscarini and Postel-Vinay (2018)andFujita et al. (2020).Having demonstrated the importance of correcting time aggregation bias in measuring EE transitions, we propose an algorithm that is less prone to measurement errors. The algorithm uses workers’ earnings before and after job mobility, and not just start and end dates of jobs, to redefine EE transitions. We exploit workers’ earnings as the data reveals that it is highly predictive of EE misclassification. Indeed, we show that jobs that have low earnings in either the origin or the destination firm are likely to be misclassified EE transitions. This is especially true for transitions identified from the quarterly adjacent approach, but not the within approach. This also makes intuitive sense. Jobs present in adjacent quarters, but not in the same quarter and that have low earnings in either the origin or destination firm are likely to have a shorter non-employment spell between them. The algorithm significantly improves the EE rate accuracy using only quarterly data while making fewer misclassification errors. Because it relies solely on earnings information, it can be easily used in other settings, e.g., the LEHD data in the US have the necessary needed to use the algorithm. The algorithm faces a basic trade-off: Reclassifying an EE transition to a non-EE transition can make both a type 1 and a type 2 error. We show that almost all of the additionally identified EE transitions using the adjacent approach at the quarterly frequency, which have low earnings in the last quarter in the origin firm or low earnings in the first quarter in the destination firm, are wrongly classified. Thus, for this group, there is basically no trade-off.Related literature.This paper contributes to the understanding of employer-to-employer transitions.Engbom (2020)documents large differences in EE rates across countries.1We are not aware of a European study that focuses on the measurement of EE transitions. For the US, there are two recent studies. The first study is by economists from the US Census Bureau (Hyatt et al., 2017). Their paper documents the measurement of employer-to-employer by the Census Bureau. Administrative data sources are especially important for the measurement of EE transitions as measuring them in the CPS dataset is challenging since a redesign of the survey questionnaire was redesigned in 2007. Indeed,Fujita et al. (2020)document that an increase in missing answers leads to the spurious appearance of declining EE transitions after 2007.Mercan (2017)andMazumder (2007)use the SIPP dataset instead of the CPS. However, the survey design creates additionalmeasurement issues. Respondents are interviewed every four months, which gives rise to recall and response biases (Nakamura et al., 2020).The importance of EE transitions is motivated by the central role of these transitions in studies of earnings dynamics at the individual and at the aggregate level (Faberman, Mueller, Sahin, Topa, 2017,Manning, 2011,Moscarini, Postel-Vinay, 2018). For example, EE flows in job ladder models can explain wage dispersion for similar workers, or firm dynamics over the business cycle (e.g.,Mortensen (2003)Moscarini and Postel-Vinay (2012)). Empirically,Haltiwanger et al. (2018)in the US, andBertheau et al. (2020)in Europe, document the role of firm heterogeneity to explain EE transition rates over the business cycle. Specifically,Bertheau et al. (2020)uncover a tight link between EE flows and the creation of jobs by the most productive firms.The paper proceeds as follows.Section 2describes the data used and the institutional details.

"I. IntroductionIt is well noted in economics and management literature that technology companies are increasingly exposed to time-based competition (Stalk and Hout, 1990). They are pressed by global market competition to better manage time in innovation,new product development, production, and distribution (Griffin, 2002;Lukas, Menon and Bell, 2002;Carbonell and Rodriguez, 2006;Chen, Reilly and Lynn, 2012;Cankurtaran, Langerak and Griffin, 2013).With innovation races among technology firms becoming ever more competitive due to first-mover advantage, increasing international competition, and stronger IP protection, innovating firms are under growing pressure to complete research projects and introduce products to the market as quickly as possible.Agarwal and Gort (2001)studied how long first-mover advantage was preserved for 46 major product innovations and discovered that the average time span between the commercial introduction of a new product and the entry of later competitors was almost 33 years at the turn of the century and had already declined to 3.4 years by 1967–86.Nagaoka, Igami, Walsh and Ijichi (2011)report that the time elapsed from the launch of a research and development (R&D) project until the journal submission of a paper on the project becomes shorter if the perception of competitive threat is higher.How would innovating firms respond to time pressure vis-à-vis the management of the research enterprise? Accelerating research production implies an increase in output per unit of time. To increase outputs, R&D firms will, in general, increase all types of production inputs for research, including equipment and materials. The extensive margin of labor is certainly another dimension that can be affected in this endeavor. In other words, firms may put together a team with more R&D personnel to hasten the invention process. In this study, we empirically investigate whether R&D firms respond to time pressure with a larger research team size.For this investigation, we utilize two types of data, both collected from U.S.patentrecords. We first investigate the impact of a natural experiment that took place in 1995 when U.S. patent law was amended with a special provision that provided an incentive for firms to hasten research.After 12-year long negotiations among 123 countries, theUruguay RoundAgreements of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) were signed on April 15, 1994; these included the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects ofIntellectual Property Rights(TRIPS). In the U.S., the Uruguay Round Agreements Act was enacted on December 8, 1994. One key change implemented in this Act was an amendment to the U.S. patent law, which was put into effect on June 8, 1995, exactly six months after the Act was passed.Prior to 1995, U.S. patent protection ended 17 years after the patent issue date.1The amendment changed the patent term to 20 years after the patent filing date for patent applications filed after June 8, 1995. A special provision of the new law designed to ease the transition guaranteed that patent applications that were filed between December 8, 1994 and June 7, 1995, but not issued as of June 8, 1995, enjoyed a patent term of 17 years post issuance or 20 years post filing, whichever was longer.This provision presented an incentive for research firms to file before the deadline on June 8 inventions that were expected to have a longermonopolyperiod under the old system than under the new system.2,3Firms were thus encouraged to speed up the research on such inventions. Our first investigation tackles the question of whether patents filed just before the deadline had a larger number of inventors than the predicted trend.4Although the 1995 amendment as a natural experiment provides us with an excellent opportunity to study the effect of time pressure, it is likely that R&D firms did not change capital and production scale when they acted upon the knowledge of the upcoming law amendment because the benefit was temporary. Therefore, the special provision of the new law did not induce long-term, comprehensive responses by R&D firms in the form of labor input, which may not be applicable to the situation of time-based competition that innovating firms constantly face. Thus, we seek additional evidence for the long-term impact of time pressure on team size by studying U.S. patent data on the examination process of patent applications.When a patent application is filed at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), it is randomly assigned to an examiner from among expert examiners in the relevant trade. The application then goes through a back-and-forth process between the applicant and the examiner, which is also known as patent prosecution and is similar to the review process that academic papers undergo. Our strategy to identify applicants (firms) under time pressure is based on the assumption that such applicants will spend less time in responding to office actions from the USPTO during prosecution to have the patent granted as early as possible. We then check whether applicants with shorter response times are associated with patents with larger team sizes.In this strategy, we note a potentialendogeneity problemof an applicant's response time in the analysis of team size for at least two reasons. First, a patent with more inventors can afford more personnel who can be deployed to respond to the USPTO's actions, which can reduce the response time. This concern pertains to reverse causality. The second reason is related to the omitted variable problem. A patent that lists more inventors may relate to a more complicated invention and is, therefore, likely to take more time to respond to the office's actions with an argument or an amendment to the patent.As a remedy for the endogeneity problem, we employ theinstrumental variableapproach, where we utilize the patent office's practice of randomized assignment of patent examiners to applications.Righi and Simcoe (2019)show that examiners in some cases are not randomly assigned, but rather specialized in particular classes of technologies as well as in particular patent assignees (that is, filing firms). Our analysis takes up their suggestion to control for technology classes and applicant identities in constructing our instrumental variable. We discuss this issue further in Section V.A.Our inquiry into the main question of this study is motivated by stylized facts about research. Increasing teamwork in science and research is well documented in numerous studies using various data sources. In the U.S. patent data, the average number of inventors listed on a patent, a measure of the size of a research team, rose from 1.70 for patents filed in the first half of 1975 to 2.67 for those filed in the second half of 2000 (seeFig. 1). The data show that while 47.1 percent of the U.S. patents filed in 1975 listed multiple inventors, the same was true of 69.8 percent of the U.S. patents filed in 2000.Download :Download high-res image (408KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. Average number of inventors per patent in a half year.Note–Data from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) patent data project. Application years on the horizontal axis; 1975.F and 1975.S denote the first and second halves of 1975, respectively.Increasing team size has been witnessed in academic publications in science as well (Jones et al., 2008). The average number of authors of scientific papers written in top U.S. universities increased by approximately 50 percent over the period 1981–1999 (Adams et al., 2005). In the natural sciences, 1.9 authors were listed per paper on average in 1955, compared to 3.5 authors in 2000 (Wuchty et al., 2007).Our probe of firms’ response to time pressure will shed light on how they respond to time-based competition and provide a plausible explanation for the rising team size in research. As innovating firms compete globally under more severe time pressure, it is expected that they would put together a team with more R&D personnel to complete research projects quicker.From a broader perspective, this study is also related to a fertile research area in recent years that studies the impact of legal policies on innovation. Exploiting an event of compulsory licensing after World War I when the U.S. Trading with the Enemy Act made all German-owned patents available for licensing to U.S. firms,Moser and Voena (2012)andBaten et al. (2017)show that compulsory licensing increased industrial inventions in the United States and Germany.Williams (2013)finds that gene-level intellectual property rights on existing technologies lead to reductions in subsequent innovation. In this study, we investigate the impact of patent policies on the quantity (patent count) and quality (speed) of innovation.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.Section IIprovides a simple theoretical framework to guide our analysis. InSection III, we describe the data. InSection IV, we investigate the impact of the 1995 Patent Law Amendment on team size. We explain the empirical strategy and specification for our analysis and report the empirical results from the analysis in this section.Section Vpresents the empirical findings from the analysis of the response times during patent prosecution. InSection VI, we discuss the implications of our results for rising team size in research and conclude the paper.",Jinyoung,None,None
"1. IntroductionHead Start, the largest preschooleducation programin America, has served the country’s poor children for more than 50 years. Head Start has always been a program with broad goals: it encourages parent participation and tries to improve family functioning and parenting through the use of social workers, home visits and parental education. In addition, it serves as free childcare. This makes parents, and mothers in particular, another group who may be directly impacted by the program. Justifiably, the research into Head Start’s impacts has focused on the children it serves, finding long-run benefits in terms of education, earnings and criminality (Bailey, Sun, Timpe, et al., 2020,Carneiro, Ginja, 2014,Currie, Thomas, 1995,Deming, 2009,Garces, Thomas, Currie, 2002,Ludwig, Miller, 2007,Thompson, 2018). Understanding how the program impacted mothers of attendees is important both to learn more about the impacts of pre-school programs in general, and to suggest mechanisms through which Head Start achieved these long-run benefits for children.Due to the breadth of services that Head Start provides, it is theoretically unclear if and how mothers would have changed their behavior under its influence. If it acted primarily as additional years of primary school, it should mirror the labor supply impacts of kindergarten and encourage entry into the labor market, as inCascio (2009). If the training, volunteering and informational aspects of the program were most impactful, it could change mothers’ behavior in other ways. For example, if Head Start’s social workers help families receive more public assistance to which they are eligible, they may be disincentivized to work and remain on public assistance for longer. If the program teaches mothers that being at home with their child is important for development, it may change the cost/benefit calculation of employment and result in dropping out of the workforce.In this paper I consider Head Start’s impacts on the short and long run labor supply, welfare use and education of mothers. To identify these effects, I use a discontinuity in Head Start availability for the 300 poorest counties in a regression discontinuity (RD) design framework. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first paper to estimate the causal effect of Head Start on long run maternal outcomes, and one of the first to look at maternal outcomes more generally. This time period is especially compelling for two reasons. The first, because the policy landscape and counterfactual were much simpler than today. Poor mothers were not expected to work to receive public benefits and there were far fewer options for formal child care available to the poor (Cahan, 1989). This allows me to estimate the effects of Head Start without the added complications of interactions with other policies shifting maternal work and childcare options. The second is that these are the cohorts for which much of the long-run effects of Head Start on children have been found. Understanding more about what Head Start affected outside the classroom can potentially shed light on how the early years of the program were so successful and thus why modern childcare and schooling programs may yield different effects.Using restricted Census data and a sample of welfare case-files, I focus on two subgroups of mothers: single and non-white, while also showing results for all mothers and the intersections of these groups. The literature on school entry and maternal labor supply typically finds the largest effects for single mothers.1Non-white children, and African American families in particular, were over-represented among enrollees in the program’s early years (Project Head Start, 1970). Both groups are more likely to be income-eligible for Head Start. I find that non-white mothers whose youngest child is eligible for Head Start show a large increase in employment rates and hours. However, for single mothers, there is a cleardecreaseinlabor force participationand hours worked and suggestive evidence of an increase in welfare receipt. This is driven by mothers who are both single and white, with no effect on single non-white mothers. As expected, women whose youngest child is the one eligible for Head Start show more positive employment effects in response to the program. In the medium and long run, 5 and 10 years after their child was Head Start eligible, both non-white and single mothers work less. For the non-white mothers this reversal seems related to more household stability (higher marriage rates), while for single mothers it is likely due to increased welfare receipt. There is also evidence of a return to school for these mothers. When I split the sample by both marital status and race, it’s clear that among non-white women it is those who are married in the long run who work less. I argue that these results are inconsistent with single mothers using Head Start primarily as free child care, instead they suggest that the program affects mothers most strongly through the transfer of information: their eligibility for public assistance and the importance of close parenting for child development. That the negative impacts on work persist for 10 years implies that Head Start had very powerful impacts on mothers.To support my reduced form results, I estimate the size of the discontinuity in Head Start availability as measured by enrollment among children and dollars of funding. In my preferred estimates, I find a 15 percentage point increase in enrollment for non-white children, and an 8 percentage point increase for children of single mothers (and not-significant 3 percentage point increase for the full sample of age-eligible children). The funding data show noisy increases of roughly 100% in dollars per age-eligible child at the cutoff, which peak in 1970. I also calculate that the discontinuity in funding should allow for a larger increase in enrollment than what we observe. This is evidence that the counties that received grant-writing assistance spent more money per child and may have provided more or higher quality services.Theregression discontinuity designassumes that Head Start is the only thing that affects the outcomes of interest, which changes discontinuously at the cutoff. One may be concerned that other programs orlegislationused similar rules, or that for some other reason labor market opportunities differ at the cutoff. I deal with these concerns in several ways. First, I perform placebo tests on 1960 data, showing that outcomes for mothers and children were continuous before Head Start existed. Second, I confirm that no differences in labor market opportunities or other relevant county conditions existed in 1970 by using mothers of slightly older children (too old to be Head Start eligible) as a control group in a differences-in-discontinuities framework. As expected, this exercise shows no changes in employment among the control group and supports that the counties on either side of the cutoff are otherwise similar to each other in the absence of Head Start. Third, I confirm that fixeddemographiccharacteristics are smooth through the cutoff in all my data sources. This also provides evidence against endogenous migration in my long run results, which I further support using a 1980 Census question about county of residence five years previous.These results show that the Head Start program acted very differently on mothers than traditional school programs and formal child care programs do. This provides context for research into Head Start’s relationship to the social safety net. The effects on maternal behavior, family stability and household incomes are informative of a change in home environment for Head Start children, which may be a mechanism through which Head Start so strongly benefited their long run outcomes. The long run declines in employment imply that mothers were more likely to be at home with their children between the ages of 4 and 14. This differs from the vast majority of public preschool programs around the world, which generally result in either null or positive impacts on maternal employment.2It also differs from the modern Head Start program, which in recent work has also been found to increase employment for at least some mothers (Wikle and Wilson, 2019). Additionally, I bring new data to the study of Head Start and update an influential paper in the literature,Ludwig and Miller (2007), bolstering the identification strategy by correcting a calculation error in the categorization of treatment and control counties.The paper proceeds as follows: InSection 2I describe the institutional background, the findings of existing research and the intuition behind the identification strategy. InSection 3I describe the data sources used in estimation. InSection 4I detail the empirical estimation strategy.Sections 5.1–5.2present evidence of the existence and size of the discontinuity.Sections 5.3–5.4present the contemporaneous impacts on mothers, whileSection 5.5considers the long run effects.

"1. IntroductionThere has been a resurgence in right-wing and populist politics across the world. In continental Europe, this includes the rise or resurgence of a range of political parties with disparate and multi-faceted political platforms, but where a common feature is a focus on immigration. While the recent refugee ‘crisis’ clearly brought this into sharper focus, much of the political traction that these parties have gained also relates to ongoing economic migration and the perception that this generates negative outcomes for the recipient population. This is reflected in the development of a now sizeable literature that seeks to estimate the effect of immigration flows on voting patterns and the political views of the native population (see, for instance,Otto and Steinhardt, 2014;Baroneet al.,2016;Sekeris and Vasilakis, 2016;Dustmannet al., 2019;Hangartneret al, 2019) and on the effect of political preferences on immigration and immigration policy (Bracco et al., 2018;Gamalerio, 2018). There are also a number of papers providing evidence that native-born populations tend to blame immigrants or other minority groups for economic and social problems (see for instanceIsaksen, 2019;Haaland and Roth, 2020,Campante et al. 2020).1While it is worth emphasizing that these parties differ markedly in overall platforms, they have converged towards an anti-immigration and anti-immigrant position. This is the case for theAfDin Germany, the DanishPeople's Partyin Denmark, Progress Party in Norway, and Lega Nord in Italy (for an analysis on the evolution of Lega Nord policy platforms, seeAlbertazzi et al., 2018). This type of rhetoric was also a feature of theBrexitreferendum of 2015 in the UK and the Trump presidential campaign. In the UK case, a substantial spike in reported hate crime occurred after the referendum (Meleady et al., 2017) and recent research demonstrates the role of social media as a conduit between political rhetoric and hate crime in both the US and Germany (Müller and Schwarz, 2018andMüller and Schwarz, 2021). RecentlyRomarri (2020)shows that hate crime occurrence is significantly higher in Italian municipalities where an extreme-right mayor is in power. Together this evidence leads to a broader concern that the language and actions of anti-immigration politicians lead to both an increase in hostility towards immigrants and non-natives, but also a more general break down incivicbehaviour and the targeting of minority groups. An aspect of this is recent evidence of an increase in racially motivated bullying of children in the UK and US (Schilter, 2018;Huang and Cornell, 2019). There is also experimental evidence that members of minorities are much more likely to be targeted and punished for wrongdoings not perpetrated by them or by their group members (Bauer et al., 2020).This paper provides evidence on whether the political climate affects school bullying, focusing on immigrants. A number of potential confounding factors make identification difficult. For example, a more (or less) welcoming political climate towards immigrants may be related to other factors that may also affect the degree of violence observed in schools. Intolerance towards immigrants could be greater in places with more socioeconomically disadvantaged inhabitants and this disadvantage may also be linked to bullying causing bias in OLS regressions. At the same time, there may be an underlying relationship between the share of immigrants in a given geographical area and the climate toward immigrants. As above, this has been the focus of much attention in the economic literature which broadly demonstrates higher vote shares for conservative parties in areas with greater immigrant inflows (Barone et al., 2016). Again, this makes simple regressions of political climate and bullying likely biased, and it is uncleara prioriin what direction this bias goes.We use the occurrence of political elections as a source of exogenous variation in the political climate and compare how elections affect the bullying behaviours towards immigrants (relative to natives) in municipalities in which an anti-immigration party (Lega Nord) is an active political actor to how they affect the bullying behaviours in municipalities where this type of party is not active.Our main result is that active campaigning by Lega Nord leads to marked increases in school bullying. These effects are large and concentrated entirely among immigrant children. Lega Nord campaigning leads to an approximate 10% increase in the likelihood of immigrant children being bullied in school during the electoral campaign period. Additionally, we show that being a victim of bullying is associated with markedly lower test score performance. Our results are robust to alternative measures of bullying behaviour and to alternative methods of identifying Lega Nord presence in the municipality. Together, these results suggest that anti-immigration politics has real effects on the wellbeing of individuals, including those potentially most vulnerable.It is important to focus on school bullying for a range of related reasons. The small existing economic and psychological literature on the impact of bullying on child outcomes demonstrates large and long-lasting effects. For instance,Brown and Taylor (2008)use British Cohort Data and show that experiencing bullying at the ages of 7 or 11 has sizeable and long-lasting effects on later educational attainment and lifetime earnings.Erikksen et al. (2014)use Danish register data and demonstrate large effects of bullying on educational attainment, and that these effects increase with the severity of bullying. Similarly,Gorman et al., 2021, using data from three cohorts of adolescents attending high school in UK, demonstrate that bullyingvictimisationhas negative consequences on academic outcomes, mental health, unemployment and income.School bullying is also highly prevalent. In a study by the World Health Organization 38% of children (11-years-olds) reported having been bullied at least once in the last two months (Craig et al., 2009). In the US between 2005 and 2013 about one third of the students aged between 12 and 18 suffered from some form of bullying at school (School Crime Supplement of the National Crime Victimisation Survey).Ammermueller (2012)use data from TIMSS 2003 and show that between 24% and 47% of all students in grade four had been hit or hurt by other students during the last month. In Italy, about 50% of adolescents aged between 11 and 17 reported having been victim of some form of violent or non-violent bullying behaviour in 2014; 20% reported being victim at least once a month, and 10% every week (ISTAT, 2019). Finally, bullying cuts against a key aim of public-school provision: the development of civic attitudes andsocial integration(Dee, 2004). This latter issue can be viewed as particular critical in the case of immigrant or ethnic minority children.Despite the prevalence of bullying and its high associated costs, little is known in practice about its determinants. The existing research demonstrates a range of robust associations with respect to immigrants and ethnic minorities. For example, holding socio-economic background constant, immigrant students (or those with parents born abroad) are more likely to be victims of bullying than native students. More generally, exposure to various forms of school bullying victimisation is higher for racial and ethnic minority youths. For instance, Black/African-American and Latino-American youth are more likely to be victimized at school than White American youth (Graham et al., 2009;Hanish and Guerra, 2000a;Hanish and Guerra, 2000b;Peguero, 2012;DeVoe et al., 2005). There are a number of potential reasons why immigrant students are more exposed to school bullying. These students are more likely to attend schools in poorer neighbourhoods with higher underlying levels of disorder and violence (Gottfredson 2001;Kozol 1991,2005;Welsh et al., 1999). More generally, being an immigrant may also correlate to other unobservable characteristics that may increase the chance of being bullied. Beyond these associations, there is a lack of evidence on the determinants of bullying and victimisation, and a lack of credible causal evidence on the role of wider societal factors. This paper aims to fill this gap.Our approach is to focus on changes in local political climate that occur due to campaigning periods of local elections and the presence of the anti-immigration partyLega Nordin Italy. We exploit two factors. The first relates to the timing of elections. In each municipality, a mayor is elected together with the city council for a 5-year term (4 years until 2000). All municipalities initially held elections in two separate rounds in the Spring and Autumn of 1946, but the electoral schedule of a given municipality has changed if at any time an early election was called for whichever reason. In these cases, elections are held before the natural schedule (i.e. out of this original 4 or 5 year cycle) and, as a consequence, all subsequent elections in that municipality will be held at different times with respect to other municipalities that remain on the standard cycle.2In practice, this leads to a staggered electoral schedule, with a considerable number of municipalities having elections in each year, and where critically this staggering reflects historical events unrelated to the current political climate in the municipality.The second factor is the timing of our data. As discussed further below, we observe school bullying behaviour that occurs during the main campaigning period of these elections (but before the elections themselves). Hence, we can focus specifically on campaign periods without any additional effects from the election results themselves. In this way, we aim to provide the first causal estimates of the effect of anti-immigration campaigning on violence and bullying aimed at children. The political salience of immigration has been confirmed byBellucci et al. (2020). Analysing the incidence of immigration-related tweets at the local level in Italy between 2010 and 2018, they observe that the likelihood for a Twitter user to mention immigration-related words is higher when elections are happening locally, while the correlation with actual landings of migrants on Italian shores is substantially weaker. We acknowledge that Twitter users are a non-random subsample of the population, but still believe that this is suggestive evidence that electoral campaigns stir the public debate and make some issues (such as immigration) more salient above and beyond their actual relevance at the local level. Anecdotally, it is not difficult to find inflammatory declarations of Lega Nord politicians, in which immigrants are labelled as a threat to security and wellbeing.3As electoral campaigning with an anti-immigrant focus is specific to those political parties, such as Lega Nord, that have taken anti-immigration and anti-immigrant positions, we distinguish between municipalities in which Lega Nord has substantial support (and runs for elections) and municipalities where this is not the case. As these two groups of municipalities also differ in terms of a number of economic and social characteristics that might also affect our outcome of interest, we estimate our model including municipalfixed effectsand then consider the change in school bullying experienced by children within the same municipality which has been induced by the quasi-random occurrence of elections.The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe our data; in Section 3 we motivate our research; Section 4 presents the methodology and in Section 5 we report and discuss the results of our estimates, carry out a number of robustness checks and run a heterogeneity analysis.

"1. IntroductionLabor mobilityis the outcome of the decisions of workers to change jobs and the decisions of firms to adjust their workforce. Labor market institutions affect this process by influencing agents’ behavior, as they alter the costs and benefits of such decisions. An extensive literature points to employment protectionlegislationas one of the most relevant institutions hindering labor reallocation (Bentolila, Bertola, 1990,Blanchard, Portugal, 2001,Lazear, 1990,Postel-Vinay, Turon, 2014,Pries, Rogerson, 2005). By directly increasing adjustment costs, employment protection leads firms to inefficiently continue labor relationships (Garibaldi, Pacelli, 2008,Kugler, Pica, 2008,Marinescu, 2009). Hiring decisions are also affected if employers anticipate future costs associated with workforce adjustments (Cahuc, Malherbet, Prat, 2019,Kugler, Pica, 2008).In practice, one of the key components of employment protection legislation raising firms’ adjustment costs are mandated severance packages |lump-sum transfers from the firm to the worker upon dismissal (OECD, 2013b). These transfers increase the opportunity cost of job quit, thereby making workers more reluctant to voluntarily leave their employers to avoid losing the benefits they are entitled to (Burdett, 1978,Light, Omori, 2004,Mitchell, 1982,Mortensen, 1977). This suggests an additional channel through which employment protection may alter labor reallocation, i.e., workers’ mobility out of the firm. Yet, the effect ofseverance paygenerosity on workers’ decisions compounds labor supply and demand forces, so that its magnitude is an empirical question that has not been widely studied in the literature. In this paper, I exploit a majorlabor market reformin Spain to investigate the link between employment protection legislation and workers’ voluntary mobility.The Spanish labor market reform was enacted in February 2012 and substantially changed severance pay entitlements for permanent contracts. On the one hand, it reduced severance payments for the so-called “unfair” dismissals, which were the most common type of dismissal. On the other hand, it facilitated low-cost dismissals due to economic reasons, also know as “fair” dismissals. An important feature of the legislative change is that it affected all permanent contracts from the date of the reform. This implies that workers hired around the date of the reform have almost identical severance packages. Moreover, all permanent workers are equally affected by the reform, making it difficult to separate the impact of the policy change from other factors. These two issues rule out the possibility of standard before-and-after comparisons of job quit probabilities.Mythought experiment, rationalized by a job search model with endogenous separations and severance pay, is to follow workers over time up to job quit and exploit the differences in severance pay generated by the reform in a dynamic framework. Consider two identical workers who have the same tenure, but who are observed in different years because they were hired on different dates. Hence, one of them is affected by the reform and the other is not (yet). Consequently, they will have different severance pay entitlements. The dynamic approach allows to identify the effect of severance pay on voluntary mobility by comparing job quit probabilities of individuals who are at the same stage in their job, but who are affected differently by the reform.To isolate the effect of the reform from confounding factors, my strategy exploits employees of companies that shut down or implemented a mass layoff during the sample period as the treatment group. The goal is to rely on these large employment contractions to identify firm-specific conditions that may affect workers’ expectations of future displacement, i.e., a layoff shock. Then, I look at labor mobility during the year prior to the employment contraction, when layoff expectations are likely to be distorted due to the worsening of the firm’s economic situation, but individuals are unlikely to be able to predict when and under what circumstances they will be laid-off. For this group of workers, severance pay represents the main mobility cost in the form offoregone income. Thus, one could expect higher job quit probabilities for these workers compared to those who do not experience such an increase in layoff probabilities, since the reform directly reduced the expected value of being laid-off for the first group of individuals.Using Spanish Social Security data, I implement my empirical strategy by estimating a discrete time duration model for the probability of job quit. The 2012 Spanish labor market reform together with the layoff shock are introduced as time-varying variables that affect the probability of job quit from the exact moment they occur. In this setting, identification is based on comparing quit hazard rates among individuals who are at the same point in time in their jobs, but who are affected differently by the policy change and the layoff shock.The empirical analysis points to a behavioral response of workers to severance pay generosity. In fact, the job quit hazard rate for workers who might expect to be displaced in the near future increased by roughly 17.5 percent after the policy change compared to workers not affected by the increase in layoff probabilities. This shift is driven by faster job-to-job transitions, suggesting an increase in job search effort. Moreover, the change in voluntary mobility is larger for workers who were more exposed to the reform, implying that mobility costs are an important source hindering workers’ voluntary mobility. Under my identification strategy, the reduced form parameter quantifies the effect of severance pay generosity on workers’ voluntary mobility that arises from both labor supply and demand forces. The findings are consistent with alabor market modelwith search frictions and separations that are either employee-initiated (quits) or employer-initiated (layoffs). In this class of models, severance pay distorts workers’ voluntary mobility decisions by directly affecting the expected utility of being laid-off: the value of unemployment. In addition, by decreasing the expected value of posting a vacancy, lower firing costs may further ease workers’ voluntary mobility through its impact onlabor demand.This paper adds to different strands of the literature. The study contributes to the empirical literature on employment protection legislation and labor mobility by shifting the focus of the analysis from the impact on firms’ decisions to the effect on workers’ behavior. Closely related to this paper areGielen and Tatsiramos (2012)andKettemann et al. (2017).Gielen and Tatsiramos (2012)study the effect of employment protection on quit rates in a cross-country analysis for the period 1992–2001. Their evidence indicates that job quality is an important determinant of quits, but the strictness of the employment protection affects this relation: lower employment protection levels translate into higher quit rates. The current analysis complements this study by exploiting within-country variation in the stringency of employment protection to provide a causal estimate of the effect of severance pay on workers’ voluntary mobility.Kettemann et al. (2017)build upon aregression discontinuity designto analyze a prominent reform in Austria that took place in 2003. The reform abolished the severance pay system and introduced anoccupational pension scheme. In the old system, only laid-off workers were entitled to severance pay. In the new occupational pension system, workers accumulate rights in an individual account that is transferred from one company to another upon separation, regardless of whether the worker was fired or left voluntarily. Under this new system, workers are 60 percent more likely to make a job-to-job transition. Contrary toKettemann et al. (2017), I exploit a labor market reform that creates exogenous variation across job spells to provide direct evidence on the role of the stringency of employment protection on workers’ quit behavior. In addition, the dynamic nature of my empirical strategy allows me to control not only for business cycle effects and workforce composition changes, but also time variation within the employment relationship that is disregarded in static approaches. Namely, it takes into account idiosyncratic changes in the nature of the relationship between employer and employee that may arise as key determinants of the decisions of firms and workers to dissolve the match (Jovanovic, 1979). The dynamic approach also permits me to consider only job spells that started before the reform moment. This is key in the current setting, as the matching process between firms and workers may change as a consequence of the reform and, hence, affect the future development of new labor relationships beyond severance pay entitlements.This paper also contributes to understanding the effect of job loss insurance schemes on worker mobility. Empirical research on this issue has mostly focused on the role of unemployment insurance on job turnover (Albanese, Ghirelli, Picchio, 2020,Light, Omori, 2004,Martins, 2021,Rebollo-Sanz, 2012). These studies show that eligibility and generosity of unemployment benefits distorts the utility associated with future unemployment, thereby deterring job quits and increasing layoff rates once the eligibility condition is met. In this paper, I show that the stringency of the employment protection in the form of severance pay levels also has an impact on job quits similar to that of unemployment benefits. This revealed relationship further points to the relevance of jointly designing employment protection legislation and the unemployment insurance system, as they insure the same type of risk (Blanchard, Tirole, 2008,Parsons, 2014).Finally, an extensive literature looking at the consequences of job loss relies on mass layoffs and plant closings to show that (exogenously) displaced workers incur in large and long-lasting losses related to lower re-employment probabilities and future earnings (Davis, von Wachter, 2011,Jacobson, LaLonde, Sullivan, 1993,Lachowska, Mas, Woodbury, 2020). By using large employment contractions in the empirical strategy, this paper adds to the literature on job displacement by showing that the institutional setting affects the composition of workers who are ultimately displaced. In particular, my results indicate that lower severance payments make workers more likely to quit before the upcoming employer event occurs, thus affecting the pool of workers within the displacement event (Lengermann, Vilhuber, et al., 2002,Schwerdt, 2011).The rest of the paper is organized as follows:Section 2outlines the institutional setting.Section 3describes the theoretical framework and the identification strategy.Section 4provides a description of the data, whereasSection 5discusses the implementation of the empirical strategy and the results.Section 6concludes.",Jose,None,None
"1. IntroductionDeparting from the standard assumption of fixedlabor force participation, a growing empirical literature analyzes the cyclicality of the activity rate and its implications for labor market dynamics:Elsby et al. (2015)for example find that the participation margin accounts for one third of the cyclical fluctuation of the unemployment rate in the USA.1Moreover, it is standard inmacroeconomicsto use Phillips curve (PC) models to interpret price dynamics in relation to labor market slack, usually captured by the unemployment rate or some transformation of it. However if the participation margin provides additional information on labor market conditions, neglecting it may lead to an incorrect assessment of the actual state of the economy andinflationdrivers.During the Covid crisis, advanced economies experienced the largest drops in labor force participation on records.2During the spring of 2020, participation rates dropped by about 2.5 percentage points in the USA and the euro area (Fig. 1). As a result, the unemployment rate declined or rose only modestly compared to what would have happened absent any change in labor force participation. For example, without the drop in the activity rate, the increase in the unemployment rate at the peak would have been 3 percentage points higher in the USA and in the euro area; in the latter, the drop in labor supply fully offset the decrease in employment in the first months of the pandemic, leaving the unemployment rate constant. Obviously, models assessing labor market slack only based on unemployment dynamics would have thus failed to adequately capture the full extent of the deterioration of cyclical conditions.Download :Download high-res image (933KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. Unemployment and participation rates during the Covid crisis.Source:Eurostat, National statistical offices, FRED economic data.Note:Monthly rates from 2019m12 to 2020m12. For France and the euro area monthly data are obtained by interpolating quarterly data. Counterfactual unemployment is computed as if participation remained fixed at the 2019m12 level, and all changes in employment are reflected into changes in unemployment.Starting from this fact, in this paper we provide an assessment of labor market slack in Italy based on both the unemployment and the participation margin. To do so, we employ the model presented inD’Amuri et al. (2021)that in turn generalizesCrump et al. (2019)by explicitly taking into account movements into and out of the labor force. The participation margin can provide useful information on total labor market slack: a participation rate that is below its natural level is an indication that the economy is running below potential, for instance because some inactive workers may have temporarily exited from the labor market waiting for better employment opportunities. A Phillips curve model featuring both an unemployment and a participation gap provides a measure of total labor market slack that properly takes into account also temporary movements into and out of activity, a feature that makes such model particularly attractive during the pandemic.Estimates are obtained in two steps. First, using the flow-based model of unemployment dynamics proposed byShimer (2012)along with an unobserved component model, we retrieve thestructuralparticipation and unemployment rates, obtained by evaluating at the steady state the trend components of labor market flows between employment, unemployment and inactivity for sixdemographiccells defined by gender and age. Such rates are only determined by structural factors (demography and changes in the labor market environment: preferences, institutions, matching technology). Second, we use such structural rates as anchors in the estimation of thenatural(i.e. coherent with stable inflation) unemployment and participation rates through a forward-looking Phillips Curve.The analysis of the flows reveals that transitions into inactivity from both unemployment and employment raised substantially during the Covid crisis. While the former increased for all demographic groups, the latter increased in particular for mature (55–64) workers, interrupting a long-term declining trend that was fostered by reforms restricting public pension eligibility (D’Amuri et al., 2021). After distinguishing the structural component of these changes in labor market flows and comparing the pre-Covid (2019) projections for structural unemployment and participation rates with their actual 2020 evolution, overall we find no sizable impact of the Covid recession on structural unemployment, and a slight decrease in structural participation (0.24 percentage points in 2020q3-4). Such a decrease is present in all demographic groups but it is larger for mature (55–64) workers; the aggregate effect, indeed, is mostly determined by the behaviour of the elderly. Additional evidence suggests that the drop in participation of older workers is mostly driven by an increase in retirement probability, made possible by a three-year temporary reduction in pension eligibility requirements (so called “quota 100”) that entered into force in 2019. Indeed we find that retirement flows: i) started increasing already in 2019 and did not further accelerate afterwards; ii) increased the most in sectors such as public administration, whose workers – characterized by more stable careers – benefited more from the reform. We conclude that the majority of these retirements would have occurred irrespective of the pandemic.We then ask whether the cyclical movements of the participation margin provide relevant information for overalleconomic conditions, thus contributing to shape price dynamics. To address this issue we estimate a Phillips curve model in which inflation depends not only on the unemployment gap – the standard measure employed in the literature – but also on a participation gap. Our estimates confirm the sizable role of the participation gap to overall slack in the five years preceding the health crisis (D’Amuri et al., 2021). Moreover, we find that such contribution became more sizable in the first two quarters of 2020, while the unemployment gap turned negative due to the fall in labor supply, bringing headline unemployment figures below their natural level. Our augmented PC model implies that in 2020 total slack subtracted 0.4 percentage points to price and wage dynamics; according to an otherwise identical model not including the participation margin, such effect would have been almost nihil. The augmented model outperforms the standard one also from anex-anteperspective: when computing inflation forecasts conditional on our measures of labor market slack, we confirm the importance of the participation gap, that widened in 2020 thus adding downward pressures on inflation.To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to gauge the impact of the Covid crisis onnaturalunemployment and participation rates, contributing to the recent literature on labor market dynamics during the pandemic (Balgova, Trenkle, Zimpelmann, Pestel, 2021,Coibion, Gorodnichenko, Weber, 2020,Forsythe, Kahn, Lange, Wiczer, 2020,Hensvik, Barbanchon, Rathelot, 2021,Şahin, Tasci, Yan, 2021). Our approach, described more in detail inD’Amuri et al. (2021), builds on the large literature on the flow-based analysis of labor market dynamics (Choi, Janiak, Villena-Roldán, 2015,Crump, Eusepi, Giannoni, Sahin, 2019,Elsby, Hobijn, Karahan, Koşar, Şahin, 2019,Fujita, Ramey, 2009,Gomes, 2012,Petrongolo, Pissarides, 2008,Shimer, 2012, among others). More in general, our results are relevant for the literature proposing alternative labor market slack measures (Abraham, Haltiwanger, Rendell, 2020,Bell, Blanchflower, 2013,Gordon, 2013) or focusing on the impact of labor supply fluctuations on cyclical dynamics (Elsby, Hobijn, Şahin, 2015,Garibaldi, Wasmer, 2005,King,Krusell, Mukoyama, Rogerson, Sahin, 2020,Krusell, Mukoyama, Rogerson, Şahin, 2017,Kudlyak, Schwartzman, 2012,Lalé,Pries, Rogerson, 2009,Strand, Dernburg, 1964). Moreover, our evidence that participation is cyclical is an important result also for other models in the literature, like for instance search and matching models, which usually assume that participation is fixed (few exceptions areCairó et al., 2022,Krusell, Mukoyama, Rogerson, Şahin, 2017). In particular, our findings suggest that measuring labour market tightness only based on unemployment and assuming that labour supply is exogenous would bias the estimation of the matching function and of matching efficiency (as also pointed out byBarnichon, Figura, 2015,Hall, Schulhofer-Wohl, 2018), and that this bias varies along the cycle, therefore changing the interpretation of movements in the Beveridge curve, for instance. Finally, we contribute to the extensive literature on Phillips curve estimation (seeBall, Mazumder, 2019,Coibion, Gorodnichenko, 2015,Del Negro, Lenza, Primiceri, Tambalotti, 2020,Stock, Watson, 2020for recent discussions), showing that the participation margin provides relevant and autonomous information on economic slack and contributes to explaining inflation dynamics.The rest of the paper is organized as follows.Section 2defines the concepts ofstructuralandnaturalparticipation and unemployment rates.Sections 3and4respectively present and discuss estimates of the structural and natural rates.Section 5concludes.",Francesco,Marta,Elisa

"1. IntroductionEach organization has a mission: a motive for its existence. Organizations in the private sector naturally have a profit motive, but they often have broader objectives that play a key role in their long-term strategy, such as being innovative or being socially responsible.1For example, Tesla prominently advertises its mission “to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy”, and Philips advertises its mission “to make a healthier, more sustainable world”. An organization's mission has strong implications for those who are employed in the organization as it affects what they work on, how their work impacts on society, and the criteria by which their performance is judged. Employees and employers therefore have a shared interest in creating a match between employees’ preferences and values and the organization's mission.2Recently, economists and organizational psychologists have started to assess whether corporate social responsibility affects worker behavior. For instance,Burbano (2021)andCassar (2019)show that workers provide extra effort when their employer donates to charities, and that the effort response to employer charitable giving is strongest among prosocial individuals.In light of this evidence, we conjecture that prosocial workers not only respond to corporate social responsibility (CSR) of their employer in terms of effort provision and attachment, but sort into such firms. Specifically, we hypothesize that firms with a mission on innovation and sustainability attract applicants with prosocial attitudes as altruistic individuals are expected to care about positive welfare effects that are induced by innovation and about the sustainability and future prosperity of society. Competitive individuals, on the other hand, may feel more at ease in companies that merely focus on making profit, as this focus will likely be reflected in a drive to outperform competitors that shapes a competitive corporate culture with incentive systems and career policies based on clearly defined performance metrics (e.g. sales, profits). Such sorting effects induced by a company's mission are particularly important for organizations in the high-tech sector who compete strongly for graduates in science and engineering. We therefore investigate the role of company's mission for recruiting prospective employees in the high-tech sector.We conduct a hypothetical discrete choice experiment among master students in science and engineering at the two largest technical universities of the Netherlands (N= 1498). We investigate whether companies with a focus on innovation or on corporate social responsibility and sustainability are considered more attractive employers, and whether the mission of the company affects the composition of the workforce with respect to prosocial attitudes, competitiveness and university grade point average. We design a discrete choice experiment in which respondents choose five times among three hypothetical jobs that differ in job design (i.e.autonomyat work, teamwork, and workload), contractible attributes (i.e. wage, performance pay, and job security), and, importantly, mission of the company. We sketch jobs in companies that focus exclusively on maximizing profit, or that in addition to profit focus on innovation or on CSR and sustainability. Moreover, we include a non-profit organization to investigate how applicants value working in a commercial company versus working in an organization without profit motive. Respondents trade off these job attributes by ranking the three jobs of each choice set. In addition, we collect information on their background characteristics, personality, and economic preferences.Our findings can be summarized as follows. First, mission matters. Keeping all other job aspects constant, potential job applicants prefer to work in commercial organizations that aim to be innovative, as well as in organizations that show corporate social responsibility. At the same time, they do not express a clear preference for working in non-profit organizations over organizations that view making profit as their sole purpose. Commercial organizations with social objectives therefore have a competitive advantage in the labor market. Workers are on average willing to forgo 170 euros in terms of net monthlysalaryto work in a company that focuses on innovation, and 220 euros to work in a company that focuses on CSR and sustainability. The magnitude of this effect is large but in line with findings in other studies (Kesternich et al., 2020;Burbano, 2016;Montgomery and Ramus, 2011, andMaestas et al., 2018). Second, a company's mission potentially affects the composition of the pool of applicants. Non-profit organizations and commercial organizations with social objectives attract more women and applicants who tend to be less competitive and more prosocial than organizations that focus exclusively on profit. We find no evidence that this comes at the cost of attracting less talented individuals, as measured by respondents’ grade point average or self-efficacy.The attractiveness of a job also depends on other attributes than the focus of the company. Potential job applicants also highly value autonomy and work in multidisciplinary teams. This is consistent with the idea that workers care about perceived job meaning: according toCassar and Meier (2018), perceptions of job meaning depend on the organization's mission, autonomy in decision making, and feelings of competence and relatedness. As predicted by standardeconomic theory, we find that job applicants also care about wages, job security, and workload. Performance pay is valued neither negatively nor positively. We also find some interesting heterogeneity in preferences for job attributes. High job autonomy is specifically valued by relatively competitive individuals and women. A generous salary makes the job more attractive, but especially so for competitive and selfish individuals. Finally, as we might expect, teamwork is particularly valued by individuals who have high trust in others, and job security is particularly valued by risk averse individuals.The main contribution of this paper is that we investigate workers’ preferences for organizations’ mission and the heterogeneity of these preferences by traits such as prosociality. Closely related studies on the importance of organizations’ mission for the attractiveness of job offers areMontgomery and Ramus (2011)andMaestas et al. (2018), who conduct hypothetical choice experiments to study job preferences.Montgomery and Ramus (2011)conduct their study among MBA students and find that they care about organizations’ ethical reputation and environmental sustainability.Maestas et al. (2018)target a sample representative for the US population. Their choice-experiment includes job attributes such as teamwork, autonomy, work pressure and meaningful work. Their findings correspond to ours, except that they find a negative valuation of teamwork and do not find significantgender differencesin the valuation of meaningful work. Our study differs from both above mentioned studies by examining preference heterogeneity bypersonality traitsand economic preferences.Another contribution is that we focus on students in science and engineering who are about to enter the labor market. These students potentially have a high impact on technological innovation and economic growth in their later careers (Murphy et al., 1991). Theirsocietal impactwill, however, also depend on the mission of the organizations they end up working for. This makes studying their job preferences highly relevant. Moreover, given the social relevance of high-tech products, companies in high-tech sectors have ample opportunities to communicate their relevance for society to potential job applicants.The paper proceeds as follows. The next section describes the related literature.Section 3describes the discrete choice experiment and its theoretical background, the measurement of personality characteristics and social and economic preferences, and the main characteristics of the sample. InSections 4and5, we discuss the estimation method and results, respectively.Section 6concludes.",Arjan,Ingrid,Andries
"1. IntroductionStarting withBadgett (1995), a sizable literature examines differences in labor-market outcomes by sexual orientation. Until recently, the results from this literature have been quite consistent: lesbians earn more than heterosexual women, and gay men earn less than heterosexual men, all else equal (Klawitter, 2015;Valfort (2017); and others).1Yet society has changed dramatically since the 1990s. Same-sex marriage is legal in the United States and 29 other countries (Human Rights Campaign, 2021).2Public opinion polls show more tolerant attitudes toward same-sex marriage and sexual orientation more generally. For example,Hansen et al. (2020b) document an increase in tolerance from 38% to 56% between 2003 and 2015 using General Social Survey data. Leo Varadkar, the Taoiseach, or prime minister, of Ireland from 2017 to 2020, is openly gay, as was one of the 2020 candidates for the President of the U.S. Given this increase in acceptance of same-sex couples, along with the lack of profitability in general of discriminatory practices, convergence in economics by sexual orientation seems likely if not inevitable.Given the societal changes, including the increasing market pressures and legal protections against discrimination, is the gap in wages and earnings by sexual orientation diminishing?Klawitter's (2015)meta-analysis finds that the gap is smaller in recent studies compared to earlier studies.Badgett et al. (2021)find lower hourly wages for gay men in AmericanCommunitySurvey (ACS) data, with no evidence of any convergence in wages. In contrast,Carpenter and Eppink (2017)find an earnings premium for gay men in the 2013 to 2015 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), and they find an earnings premium for lesbians during the same time period. Using data in the NationalHealth and NutritionExamination Survey from 1988 to 2007 on men who live alone,Clarke and Sevak (2013)find a shrinking gap in earnings for gay men relative to heterosexual men, although the difference is not always statistically significant. Similarly, the earnings disadvantage for gay men is diminishing in Canada (Dilmaghani 2017;Mueller 2014). There is no evidence of a gay earnings disadvantage in the UK in recent work (Aksoy et al., 2018).For women,Badgett et al. (2021)find a declining hourly wage premium for lesbians in the ACS for 2000 to 2018, andCushing-Daniels and Yeung (2009)find a declining lesbian earnings premium in the General Social Survey between 1988 and 2006, which is consistent with the UK evidence inAksoy et al. (2018)of no earnings differences between lesbians and heterosexual women.Carpenter and Eppink (2017)document an earnings premium for lesbians in the 2013 to 2015 NHIS.We contribute to this literature by taking a deep dive into earnings and employment by sexual orientation as inferred from relationship status (described below). First, we calculate the wage and earnings gap over a 20-year time period from 2000 to 2019, complementing recent research looking at 1988 to 2007 (Clarke and Sevak, 2013) and 2013 to 2015 (Carpenter and Eppink, 2017). Using the U.S. ACS, we have a large sample of men and women in same-sex couples, with 2400 or more full-time workers of each sexual orientation each year starting in 2005. The ACS is not without its limitations, as discussed below. The most notable is the restriction of the sample to cohabiting individuals. Consequently, like previous work looking at sexual orientation and labor-market outcomes, the analysis is descriptive and probably not causal given issues such as selection into cohabitation, employment, full-time work, and “coming out.”Second, we create four measures of earnings, including annual wages / salaries; earnings, defined as wages / salaries plus self-employment income; annual income, defined as earnings plus unearned income such as dividends; and hourly wages. By analyzing different measures of labor-market outcomes, we study the sensitivity of the results to variations in the measure of labor-market outcomes. Here, we complement the analysis of hourly wages for ACS data from 2000 to 2018 inBadgett et al. (2021).Third, we study the sensitivity of the results to various age ranges. We expect labor-market behaviors to be correlated with age, so we control for different times in a person's earnings’ life.We find no evidence of convergence for men and mixed evidence for women since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). For women, the raw gaps in all four measures of earnings decline dramatically between 2000 and 2019, whereas the regression-adjusted gaps have much slower convergence. By 2019, for full-time workers, men in same-sex couples havelower wagesof approximately 10% compared to married men in different-sex couples, whereas women in same-sex couples have higher wages of approximately eight percent compared to married women in different-sex couples. The gap is similar for earnings and income, but it is somewhat lower for hourly wages compared to annual wages. The gap is robust to several factors such as age ranges, sample weights, and variation in control variables.",Christopher,Lisa,None
"1. IntroductionThe shift to working from home has been one of the most rapid and widespread changes developed economies have seen in recent times. Catalyzed by the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, this shift has exposed previously overlooked differences across workers. Most notably, differences in workers’ ability to work from home have become extremely salient. With lockdown and social distancing measures in place,teleworkhas often been the only way for non-essential workers to carry out their work (Adams-Prassl, Boneva, Golin, Rauh, 2020,Bick, Blandin, 2020).Given the changing landscapes of work, living and leisure, and that economic hardship of the pandemic will be related to the extent to which workers can perform their jobs from home, it is necessary to know whether workers’ ability to work from home varies systematically acrossandwithin occupations andindustries, and whether it differs across workers by different background characteristics such as gender, education, or type of contract. Understanding how the ability to work from home is distributed across the population and jobs can help inform the design of short-time work schemes, policies aimed at re-opening the economy after the pandemic, family policies aimed promoting the ability of working parents to reconcile work and family life, and optimize commuting networks and urban planning.We fill this gap in the literature by providing the first comprehensive analysis of heterogeneity in the ability to work from home within occupations and industries, and across workers with different characteristics. For the purpose of this study, we use three waves of data collected in March, April, and May 2020 as part of the COVIDInequalityProject in two large economies, the United States and the United Kingdom (N=24,924). To capture individual ability to work from home, we ask survey respondents to state what share of job tasks they could theoretically do from home. Responses are recorded on a continuous 0–100% scale, thus allowing us to capture individual differences in the realities workers face.1Several results emerge from our study. First, we document a high degree of heterogeneity in workers’ ability to work from home. While on average respondents in the US and UK report being able to do 42% and 39% of their work tasks from home respectively, a non-negligible share of workers reports values of 0 or 100%. At the same time, the vast majority of workers report values that lie strictly between 0 and 100%, highlighting the importance of using a continuous metric.Second, we document large differences in workers’ ability to work from home not just across but alsowithinoccupations and industries. We find that occupation and industryfixed effectscan only account for about one quarter of the variation in the share of tasks workers report being able to do from home. Alternative measures that assume that the ability to work from home is constant within occupations or industries mask a considerable degree of heterogeneity across workers; they cannot capture the complex work realities people face. InAdams-Prassl et al. (2020b), we show that the ability to work from home significantly predicts job loss due to the pandemicover and abovewhat can be predicted by occupation and industry fixed effects. To fully understand the economic consequences of the pandemic and how policies can help buffer the economic shocks, it is crucial to take differences across workers within occupations and industries into account.One potential concern is that the limited explanatory power of the occupation and industry fixed effects could be explained by measurement error in our working-from-home measure. While we cannot rule out that some measurement error exists, we provide evidence from six independent surveys conducted in two countries at three different points in time to show that the variation in our metric is reliably systematic. For instance, we examine the mean, median,standard deviation, coefficient of variation and share of respondents reporting being able to do 0 or 100% of their tasks from home across occupations, industries or occupation-industry pairs, and find very high correlations in these statistics across the different countries and independent survey waves.We further examine the distributions of our working-from-home measure within occupations and industries in more detail. Some striking patterns emerge. For some occupations, for instance ‘Architecture and Engineering,’ many respondents report being able to do an intermediate share of tasks from home and the distribution can be well approximated by a normal distribution. However, for other occupations, for instance “Office and Administrative Support”, the distribution is bi-polar, with many workers within that occupation being able to do either very few or almost all tasks from home. These patterns provide important insights for the design oflabor market policiesaimed at buffering economic shocks of a pandemic. Furloughing schemes, for example, typically allow workers to either keep working at 100% or to stop working altogether. Such policies may not provide enough flexibility for workers in occupations or industries in which most workers can do an intermediate share of their job tasks from home. InAdams-Prassl et al. (2020a), we provide evidence that workers in the UK who can do work tasks from home are more likely to work while furloughed, even when forbidden by the scheme. Short-time work schemes, on the other hand, might be more suitable as they allow employers to reduce workers’ hours more flexibly.We document large differences in the ability to work from home across workers with different characteristics. Male workers, workers with a university degree, and workers with permanent contracts report that they can do a significantly higher share of their job tasks from home. Remarkably, these gaps persist even once we control for occupation and industry fixed effects.Finally, we also consider time trends in the ability to work from home in more detail. We find that the share of tasks that can be done from home increased between March and May. It appears that this increase is mainly driven by occupations in which many workers were already capable of working from home more. Still, it remains an open question whether this increase in the share of doable tasks is fueled by firm-based technology investments, as documented byBarrero et al. (2020), or learning-by-doing of employees is an interesting open question.The data generated as part of this project can be used as inputs formacroeconomicmodels that incorporate the possibility of working from home. Depending on the substitutability or complementarity of inputs in production functions, our measures can have implications for models based on a sectoral approach (e.g.Baqaee, Farhi, 2020,Bodenstein, Corsetti, Guerrieri, 2020,Brinca, Duarte, Faria-e Castro, 2020) or on an approach based on industries combined with occupations (e.g.Alon, Doepke, Olmstead-Rumsey, Tertilt, 2020,Aum, Lee, Shin, 2020,Kaplan, Moll, Violante, 2020,Papanikolaou, Schmidt, 2020,del Rio-Chanona, Mealy, Pichler, Lafond, Farmer, 2020). The measures we construct can also be used for the identification of bottlenecks in production networks, as inCarvalho et al. (2020), if output differs when half of suppliers can produce all, and half cannot produce any goods, compared to the case where all suppliers can produce half of their goods.2Finally, because our sample does not cover all industry-occupation pairs, we use a machine-learning algorithm, i.e. a random forest, to train a model that predicts the mean share of tasks that can be done from home using tasks specified by the O*NET data. This allows us to expand our dataset to include almost 1000 disaggregated occupations and almost 80,000 occupation-industry pairs.3We build on and contribute to several strands of the literature. First, we contribute to the literature which assesses the feasibility of working from home for workers in different occupations using occupation-level data (see, e.g.,Baker, 2020,Boeri, Caiumi, Paccagnella, 2020,Dingel, Neiman, 2020,Gottlieb, Grobovšek, Poschke, 2020,Lekfuangfu, Piyapromdee, Porapakkarm, Wasi, 2020,Mongey, Pilossoph, Weinberg, 2020,del Rio-Chanona, Mealy, Pichler, Lafond, Farmer, 2020). The occupation-level indices used in these studies are primarily constructed based on O*NET data and manual classification, and line up closely with the mean shares we measure across occupations. We contribute to this work by measuring the ability to work from home at the individual level and investigating how the ability to work from home varies across and within occupations and industries, as well as across workers with different characteristics. Importantly, we also find that the mean share of tasks that can be done from home within an occupation varies systematically across industries, and the patterns are very similar across both countries. Moreover, we find that individual characteristics relate systematically to the share of tasks that can be done from home even within occupations and industries. Second, our paper relates to the literature documenting the prevalence of alternative work arrangements including telework before and during the pandemic as well as individual preferences for alternative work arrangements (e.g.Barrot, Grassi, Sauvagnat, 2021,Bick, Blandin, Mertens, 2020,Brynjolfsson, Horton, Ozimek, Rock, Sharma, Ye, 2020,Hensvik, Le Barbanchon, Rathelot, 2020,Mas, Pallais, 2017,Mas, Pallais, 2020,Oettinger, 2011). We contribute to this strand of literature by documenting the fraction of tasks workers report theycoulddo from home, i.e. what would be technologically feasible. Whether workers who could work from home do so will depend on a range of different factors such as worker preferences, the cost to firms of offering different work arrangements, and government policies. Finally, our paper also relates to previous work studying the impact of working from home on productivity (e.g.Angelici, Profeta, 2020,Bloom, Liang, Roberts, Ying, 2015).",Abi,Teodora,Marta
"1. IntroductionThe world economy continues to become more integrated as countries increase their exposure tointernational trade. Brazil is one of many countries to experience a drastic trade liberalization episode as a means to create sustainable economic growth. The country liberalized theirtrade policiesin the early 1990’s and experienced an increase in trade values as a direct result. However, Brazil’s trade values began to increase at an even higher rate in the early 2000’s, which corresponds to China’s accession to theWorld Trade Organization(WTO) in 2001. Brazil’s reliance on trade with China has consistently increased since. In 2000, Brazil’s imports from China and exports to China accounted for approximately 2.2% and 2.0% of Brazil’s total imports and exports, respectively. By 2010, nearly 14.9% of Brazil’s total exports and 13.5% of its total imports were to or from China.1Brazil also experienced rapid economic growth throughout the decade, including substantial gains in employment and wages. Labor market gains were widespread, impacting both males and females, but females often experienced larger gains (Silva et al., 2015). Previous research indicates that Brazil’s trade liberalization, an import-driven trade change, impacted males more than females (Gaddis and Pieters’, 2017), and that trade can improve women’s role in the labor market (World Bank and World Trade Organization, 2020). It is a natural extension of the existing literature to study whether the China trade shock also had differential labor market effects by gender.In this paper, I analyze the impact of the China trade shock on gender-specific local labor market outcomes in Brazil to determine whether increased trade with China played a role in Brazil’s expanding labor market, and gendered effects, during the 2000’s. The analysis combines Census data for Brazil with CEPII BACI trade data for the years 2000–2010. I use (Costa, Garred, Pessoa, 2016)instrumental variableapproach, which builds uponAutor et al. (2013)’s original strategy by controlling for worldwide trends, to isolate the impact of both increased imports from China and increased exports to China on male and female local labor market outcomes in Brazil. Brazil experienced a surge in exports to China slightly larger than the surge in imports from China.2Thus, analyzing the effects of both trade flows with China for the case of Brazil is necessary to fully capture labor market responses to increased trade with China. I analyze gendered local labor market outcomes in various sectors of the economy, focusing on the traded, nontraded, formal, and informal sectors. This is in line withGaddis and Pieters’, 2017, who emphasize the importance of looking beyond the manufacturing and/or traded sectors to determine the full picture of the impacts of trade, particularly when considering differential effects by gender.This paper contributes to several branches of the trade and labor literature. First, it contributes to the literature on the rise of China by examining the impact of both imports from and exports to China on local labor market outcomes in a fellow emerging country. This area of research was pioneered byAutor et al. (2013), who introduced a unique instrumental variable strategy to isolate the effects of trade with China. I build upon early studies in this area by analyzing labor outcomes across all sectors of the economy, broken down by gender, rather than focusing on outcomes for all workers in the manufacturing or traded sector. This is particularly important when focusing on gender in Brazil as evidenced by the relatively low share of female employment in the traded sector. Second, this paper contributes to the smaller area of research on the labor market effects of trade in Brazil specifically. Several studies analyze Brazil’s trade liberalization and subsequent labor market dynamics,3but (Costa, Garred, Pessoa, 2016) were the first to study the China trade shock in the context of Brazil. The authors tweakedAutor et al. (2013)’s instrumental variable strategy to account for the worldwide commodity price boom during the 2000’s and studied the effects of the supply and demand side of the China trade shock on local labor market outcomes. I directly build upon (Costa, Garred, Pessoa, 2016) study by disaggregating labor market effects by gender and broad sectors that capture the full Brazilian economy. This is necessary to study labor market outcomes by gender since men and women often segregate into different sectors of the economy. I also explore potential mechanisms behind the observed differences by gender, including occupation segregation, to better understand how different groups of workers are impacted by trade shocks.Thus, this paper also contributes to the literature on the distributional effects of trade. There are a few papers specific to Brazil that are particularly relevant. First,Gaddis and Pieters’, 2017found that men experienced larger impacts than women in response to Brazil’s trade liberalization, noting that trade likely has gendered effects since firms often view men and women as imperfect substitutes in the labor market. I extend the basic idea behind Gaddis and Pieters to the more recent China trade shock, focusing on both import- and export-induced labor market dynamics by gender to determine whether the China trade shock contributed to Brazil’s rapid economic growth during the 2000’s, which was larger for females on average. Second, there are two recent papers specific to the China trade shock in Brazil.Benguria and Ederington (2017)study the distributional effects in response to imports from China with a focus on the gender wage gap. Similarly,Paz and Ssozi (2021)study the impact of Chinese imports on the share of female employment and the male-female wage gap, exclusive to themanufacturing sector. The authors find that Chinese import penetration is associated with: (1) reductions in the gender wage gap, which stem from an increase in the share of females in high-paying occupations (Benguria and Ederington, 2017), and (2) increases in the share of female employment and declines in the male-female wage gap in the manufacturing sector (Paz and Ssozi, 2021).I build upon this prior work by analyzing the relationship between both imports from and exports to China in the formal, informal, traded, and nontraded sectors. This approach allows me to capture the full picture of the gendered impacts of the China trade shock in Brazil rather than the dynamics within a single sector, which are often not representative of both men and women in the labor market. I also use the more recent instrumental variable strategy of (Costa, Garred, Pessoa, 2016) to control for worldwide trends over the time period, such as the commodity price boom. Further, I build upon prior work by analyzing the direct relationship between both trade flows with China and a formal index of occupation segregation and its two components. Changes in occupation segregation can stem from two different dynamics: changes in the relative size of occupations (occupation composition), and/or changes in the gender dynamics in occupations from females entering male dominated occupations, or visa versa (gender composition).4It is necessary to study both an index of occupation segregation, and its two components, to fully understand the dynamics between trade and occupation segregation. This is an understudied, but important area of research on the gendered impacts of trade, as occupation segregation is a leading contributor to persistent gender gaps (Anker, 1997,Blau and Hendricks, 1979).Brazil provides an interesting context to study the gender-specific impacts of the China trade shock for several reasons. Brazil experienced substantial labor market growth during the decade, particularly for women while also increasing their reliance on trade with China. Previous research indicates that trade can induce productivity and employment increases (Harrison, Hanson, 1999,Muendler, 2004), lead firms to employ more women in developing countries, and decrease labor market disparities between men and women (World Bank and World Trade Organization, 2020b). Historically, Brazil has a large informal sector and high levels of labor marketinequality. This means it is possible that Brazil’s increased trade with China contributed to economic growth during the time, and led to differential labor market effects across genders. Brazil’s trade pattern with China is also consistent with trade patterns for several other emerging and developing countries (Costa, Garred, Pessoa, 2016); therefore, findings on China’s impact on gendered local labor market outcomes in Brazil could also apply to other developing and emerging countries with similar trade relationships with China. As the world continues to globalize and countries become increasingly interconnected through international trade, it is important for policy makers, scholars, and the general public to understand more about the winners and losers from trade, particularly for various subgroups of the population.There are several potential reasons to expect increased trade to have gender-specific effects. International trade increases the level of competition domestic firms face, which theoretically reduces firms’ ability to discriminate in hiring practices (Black and Brainerd, 2004). Second, trade can also induce technical change. If technical change is skill-biased, then some research indicates that skill-biased technical change can have gender implications. As firms upgrade their technology, the substitutability of female and male workers can increase (Juhn et al., 2014).5The third reason for gender-specific effects of trade relates tolabor market segregationand reallocation. Males and females often segregate into certain occupations orindustrieswithin an economy. For Brazil, females are most represented in the non-traded and informal sectors, which suggests that the impacts of trade could likely be stronger for males in the traded sector or the formal sector (Gaddis and Pieters’, 2017). Last, traditional trade theory predicts that globalization induces structural change in production, which leads to a reallocation of productive factors, including labor. If male and female workers are not perfect substitutes, then this reallocation can have gender implications (Do, Levchenko, Raddatz, 2016,Gaddis and Pieters’, 2017).The results indicate that the China trade shock did have gendered local labor market effects in Brazil and support two mechanisms: the pro-competitive effects of trade reducing labor market discimination and labor market segregation and reallocation. Microregions more exposed to imports from China experience negative wage impacts, or slower wage growth, while microregions more exposed to exports generally experience positive wage impacts, or faster wage growth. The import-induced wage declines are particularly pronounced in the formal and traded sectors and wage losses in these sectors are significantly larger for males than females. Increased exposure to Chinese imports also reduces wages in the nontraded sector, but the losses are significantly larger for women. In contrast, export-induced wage increases are larger for women than men in the nontraded and formal sectors. Overall, trade with China has stronger wage impacts on the workers most connected to trade, and wage effects are typically larger for the gender most represented in each sector. This supports the idea of labor segregation presented inGaddis and Pieters’, 2017, who found Brazil’s trade liberalization had stronger impacts for men in the traded sector. The results also confirmBenguria and Ederington (2017)’s finding that import-induced wage declines in the formal sector are larger for men than women, but the results further highlight the impacts of both channels of trade with China on gender-specific wages beyond the formal sector.Import-induced wage declines are coupled with substantial employment growth for both men and women in the formal sector, but the employment gains are significantly larger for women. This result supports (Costa, Garred, Pessoa, 2016) finding that trade with China is associated with increased formalization of the Brazilian labor market; they also further reveal that women benefit from increased formalization significantly more than men and illustrate the differential impacts for men’s and women’s employment across sectors that are representative of the full Brazilian economy. The simultaneous increase in employment and decline in wages associated with imports from China are consistent with an increase in labor supply, particularly since formal employment gains are only coupled with small employment losses for men in the nontraded sector. Additional analyses reveal that imports are associated with a significant increase in the employment to population ratio for women, and lower unemployment rates for men and women. Increased trade with China leads women to reallocate from non/unemployment to employment in the formal sector and men to reallocate from the nontraded sector and unemployment to the formal sector.As labor reallocates, this translates to a pareto optimal increase in the share of female employment in the formal sector. To the extent that women were initially held back or discouraged from certain employment, this change may reflect improvement inlabor market discriminationin response to trade with China. Formal employment has known benefits and securities guaranteed to workers, so these gains are also economically significant. Further, import exposure also decreases occupation segregation in the formal and traded sectors, which signals improvement in the percentage of women that must change occupations for the distribution of males and females within occupations to equal one another. This is a particularly important finding in the formal sector as the change in occupation segregation stems from improvements in gender composition, while changes in occupation composition actually work against this finding and increase the level of occupation segregation. This complementsBenguria and Ederington (2017)’s finding on the association between imports from China and reductions in the gender wage gap via increases in the share of females in high-paying occupations. The results also further highlight the competing dynamics of changes in the relative size of occupations and changes in the gender composition of occupations in response to trade across sectors representative of the full economy. The occupation segregation findings lend additional support to both mechanisms. Trade with China clearly impacts labor segregation and reallocation and is associated with reductions in labor market barriers and discrimination in Brazil. The reductions in labor market discrimination are limited to employment and occupation segregation, and do not translate to improvements in the average wage ratio. There is little evidence that trade with China impacts workers differently byeducation level, a proxy for skill, which doesn’t support the skill-biased technical change mechanism. Overall, this paper highlights how trade shocks differentially affect men and women in the labor market, which is important for researchers to consider in the future, particularly when determining the winners and losers from trade.This paper proceeds as follows.Section 2presents an overview of the related literature.Section 3summarizes Brazil’s trade history and trade relationship with China.Section 4details the methodology andSection 5describes the data.Section 6summarizes the results, robustness, and potential mechanisms.Section 7offers concluding remarks.",Laura,None,None
"1. IntroductionAre resource booms a blessing or a curse for a country? A priori, we would expect thatnatural resourcesshould boost economic development; however, since the work ofSachs, Warner, 1999,Sachs, Warner, 2001, there is ample evidence to suggest that resource-rich countries underperform in several dimensions.2One concern in this area is the possibility that resource booms reduce human capital accumulation. These booms are shocks that affect labor-market conditions, making low-skilled occupations more attractive and increasing the opportunity cost of education. Thus, some individuals find it optimal to drop out of high school/college and enter the workforce.3It is not clear whether these decisions to leave school are temporary or permanent. If individuals anticipate that the resource boom is temporary, they may plan to return to school at a later date. However, as time passes, life events may impose further costs on returning to school, and the time horizon for realizing the return to education decreases. Also, if agents expect that the natural resource boom will be a permanent shock, then the likelihood of returning to school decreases. These factors make it less likely for individuals to resume their education; hence, the decrease of human capital could be permanent, affecting both individuals’ living conditions and a country’s growth potential.This paper uses proprietary individual-level data from afinancial servicescompany in Ecuador to document the long-term effects of the 1970s oil boom on educational attainment levels. I estimate the reduced form effects of exposure to this shock on college completion rates as measured 40 years after the boom. I use an intensity difference-in-differences design that compares changes in college completion rates across cohorts who turned 18 before and after 1973 (the year of the boom) to changes in college completion across different regions.4In 1972, Ecuador started oil production, and in 1974 the price of oil skyrocketed due to the Arab embargo. In Ecuador, as in many countries, the state owns all mineral rights, so the government received a massive influx of funds that it directed toward highway spending, infrastructure, and subsidies (Acosta, 2006,World Bank, 1979). These expenditures lowered the cost of starting new commerce and construction businesses, which increased the productivity of low-skilled jobs by 93 percent (World Bank, 1979a). Low-skilled workers’ real earnings increased by 18 percent following the boom, while high-skilled real earnings decreased by 8.8 percent (Palma, 1986). Consequently, employment rates in non-agricultural low-skilled jobs increased by 14.1 percentage points, compared with only 7.5 percentage points in high-skilled jobs. These shifts suggest that the opportunity cost of college increased, making college less appealing.Ecuador’s geographic features created three sources of regional variation in terms of the effect of exposure to the oil boom. First, the oil industry is located in the Amazon jungle, an isolated region in the 1970s. For this region, the oil industry’s presence could have plausibly increased or decreased the costs of college attendance after the oil boom, thus making the effect on college completion rates uncertain. On the one hand, the new low-skill jobs created by the oil industry are concentrated in this region, increasing the opportunity cost of college. On the other hand, the oil boom led to improved connectivity with the rest of the country andspilloversfrom the oil industry. These factors plausibly increased the returns of education.Second, while the oil boom was a national-level shock, the cities of Quito and Guayaquil benefited the most from the infrastructure boost driven by the boom, implying a more considerable increase in education’s opportunity cost.The third source of regional variation relies on the fact that during the 1970s, there were only universities in five cities, and college supply was concentrated in Quito and Guayaquil.5This situation, together with drastic altitude differences across the country that increase transportation costs, implies that people born in regions without universities faced higher costs of college attendance than people born in cities with universities. Theoretically, lower costs allow more students with lower ability levels and income to attend college. Hence, the marginal student from regions with low costs who attend college would be expected to have lower ability and income levels than the marginal student from regions with high costs. This difference makes regions with low costs more sensitive to shocks that increase low-skilled workers’ earnings. As the cities with universities also benefited the most from the infrastructure boost triggered by the boom, the total effect of exposure to the oil boom should be more noticeable in these cities than in the rest of the country.The intensity difference-in-differences design compares cohorts who had already decided whether to go to college by 1973 with cohorts who were still in high school and thinking about whether to attend college across regions. This design obtains the change in college completion rates in regions with universities and the Amazon region against that in regions without universities, which should be the least affected by the boom.6The results show that exposure to the resource boom decreased education completion rates. College completion decreased the most in the cities where the majority of universities were concentrated. Exposure to the boom decreased college completion by 2.9 percentage points, which represents 12.2 percent of the college completion rate for those who turned 18 just before the oil boom. Robustness tests show that, if there were any confounding shock, it would attenuate the estimates.The long-term reduction of college completion rates is consistent with a model of rational individuals who stopped their educational attainment because the increase in low-skilled workers’ earnings was large enough to compensate for the loss of human capital accumulation. Unfortunately, there is no data on earnings to test this channel directly, but I provide three pieces of evidence consistent with this dynamic. First, if the oil boom increased the returns of education in a region, then completed educational attainment should have increased there. As mentioned above, the boom had a positive effect on connectivity and local income in the Amazon region, plausibly increasing the returns of education there, and countering the effect of the availability of low-skilled jobs in the oil industry documented byChuan (2020). Exposure to the oil boom increased college completion in the Amazon region by 4.5 percentage points (58.5 percent of the baseline).Second, the structure of the labor market shifted toward low-skilled occupations, and this shift lasted over the long term. This shift is consistent with the dynamics documented byGollin et al. (2016), who find that natural resource shocks drive higher employment in non-tradable services such as commerce. I find that, in the cities with full universities, exposure to the oil boom before turning 18 increased the likelihood of working informally in 2012 by 0.8 percentage points (1.9 percent of the baseline), while it decreased this probability by 1.7 percentage points (3 percent of the baseline) in the Amazon region.Third, I find that exposure to the oil boom before turning 18 did not affect two relevant measures ofwealth: homeownership (in 2010) and vehicle ownership (in 2013). The point estimates for homeownership in the cities with universities are smaller than 0.6 percentage points (1 percent of the baseline), and the confidence interval rules out effects larger than two percentage points. In addition, I find that exposure to the oil boom before turning 18 decreased vehicle ownership in these cities by 0.5 percentage points (2.8 percent of the baseline).This study’s findings contribute to our understanding of the effects of resource booms on outcomes related to growth and living conditions. One branch of this research area documents the effects of resource shocks on educational attainment, finding that exposure to resource booms decreases highschool enrolmentin resource-rich areas in the short term (Black, McKinnish, Sanders, 2005,Cascio, Narayan, 2020) but have mixed results on self-reported completed educational attainment (Chuan, 2020,Emery, Ferrer, Green, 2012,Kumar, 2017). Other studies consider the effects of natural resource shocks on: (i) non-resource economic activity (Allcott, Keniston, 2017,Black, McKinnish, Sanders, 2005,Marchand, 2012,Michaels, 2011); (ii) participation in disability programs (Black et al., 2002); (iii) family income and childrens education (Løken, 2010,Løken, Mogstad, Wiswall, 2012); (iv) income levels and health spending (Acemoglu et al., 2013); (v) public expenditure,corruption, and crime (Caselli, Michaels, 2013,Street); and (vi)intergenerational mobility(Bütikofer et al., 2020).My study contributes to this literature in three ways. First, this paper addresses data limitations that usually prevent studying long-term effects in developed and developing countries. By using administrative measures of educational attainment collected in the proprietary data, this paper controls for recall bias, social desirability bias, and other issues that affect self-reported measures of completed education. Such biases can limit our ability to detect negative effects. By addressing these issues, this paper documents that exposure to a resource boom can permanently reduce completed education, which is a new result in the literature.Second, this paper’s results suggest that the effect of resource booms on human capital accumulation can be different between developed and developing countries. Emery at al.’s(2012)results refer to a context where 40 percent of the affected population has postsecondary education. In Ecuador, only 13 percent of the cohorts who turned 18 around 1973 have some postsecondary education. These differences translate into different labor markets, which can lead to different responses to resource booms. The Ecuadorian context shows that resource booms can have adverse effects on human capital in settings where educational attainment is low, and labor markets are oriented towards low-skilled occupations.Third, the Amazon region’s case suggests that policy has a role in the propagation of natural resource shocks and that increasing the returns of education can counter the negative effect on educational attainment. Policymakers can encourage this policy effect by investing part of thewindfallfrom the boom in policies that increase high-skill productivity to reduce the opportunity costs of attending college. A caveat is that these booms are large enough to drive progress in many sectors and policies in a country. Particularly in developing countries, these policies would not have existed in the absence of a boom because they depend on the windfall received by the government. Thus, the identified effect corresponds to the reduced-form effect of exposure to the boom, and the estimation strategy considers the different channels through which the boom affected the country.Finally, in assessing the long-term effects of resource booms on educational attainment and wealth, this study joins a broader literature examining the impacts of changes in short-term opportunity costs on educational attainment levels and labor markets. Previous studies have analyzed, for example, the effects of housing booms (Charles et al., 2015), manufacturingexport processing zones(Atkin, 2016), large infrastructure projects (Carrington, 1996), technological changes (Bartik, Currie, Greenstone, Knittel, 2017,Fetzer, 2014,Feyrer, Mansur, Sacerdote, 2017), and manufacturing booms, busts, and recessions (Goldin, Katz, 2007,Kahn, 2010,Oreopoulos, Von Wachter, Heisz, 2012). This paper complements this literature by documenting that exposure to a short-term resource boom can lead to a reduction of human capital in the long run by decreasing the incentives to return to school.",Roberto,None,None
"1. IntroductionA sizable portion of government spending goes towelfare programsdesigned to help low-income individuals and families make ends meet. In 2016, expenditures on government safety net programs accounted for about $880 billion, or 19%, of the U.S. federal budget (Falk et al., 2018). The level of government spending on safety net programs has long been a contentious issue. While aid to low-income households can help them cover necessary expenses, it may reduce incentives for beneficiaries to find or keep work. This issue has received greater public and political attention in recent years due to the notion that the slow recovery of the economy following theGreat Recessionis in part a result of the expansion in safety net programs (Mulligan, 2012).To address workdisincentives, many safety net programs include work-related policies such as work requirements and time limits. For example, eligibility for benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is tied, for a subset of recipients, to participation in work or activities, such as job training or community service for a certain number of hours (Falk et al., 2016). However, broad consensus does not exist on whether SNAP work requirements achieve their intended goal of improving the work level of low-income individuals and families. This paper contributes to this debate by assessing the impact of SNAP work requirements on the labor supply of able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWD).1To study the effect of SNAP work requirements on the labor supply, I leverage two unique features of SNAP work requirements. First, states can exempt individuals living in areas with high unemployment rates from meeting work requirements, creating variation in the work exemption across areas over time. Second, the work requirement applies only to adults below 50 years of age. Because exemption from the SNAP work requirement is heavily linked to theeconomic conditionsin a given area, a comparison of outcomes between exempt areas and non-exempt areas is likely to produce a biased estimate of the effect of SNAP work requirements. However, the additional within-area variation stemming from the age threshold allows one to disentangle the confounding influence of local economic conditions from the impact of SNAP work requirements. If local labor market conditions affect non-disabled adults without dependents aged just below 50 similarly to those just above 50, then one can identify the effect of work requirements by comparing the time-series changes in labor supply for these two age groups in areas before and after the exemption.Using a triple-difference approach that compares the differences in labor supply of ABAWDs aged below 50 and those above in areas before and after the exemption coupled with data from the AmericanCommunitySurvey (ACS) from 2005 to 2017, I estimate the local averagetreatment effectof work requirements for ABAWDs around the age of 50.I find that SNAP work exemptions do not decrease employment among older prime-age ABAWDs. A reduction in employment of more than 1.4 percentage points among older prime-age ABAWDs who are potentially affected by the exemptions can be rejected with a 95% confidence interval. However, I find evidence that the work exemption leads to a reduction in hours of work by older prime-age workers.Further analysis reveals two reasons the work exemption has little effect on the extensive margin of labor supply. First, many new SNAP participants who enrolled due to the exemption are the long-term non-employed who have no labor supply to reduce. Second, the generous income deductions in benefit calculation reduce the effective benefit reduction rate close to zero at very low income ($0–600), decreasing the potential disincentive effect of the work exemption on labor supply along the extensive margin while increasing the intensive margin labor supply response to the work exemption. Together, the results suggest that imposing work requirements may not achieve the intended goal of promoting employment; instead, it may increase the risk of disadvantaged individuals failing to receive the assistance they need.These findings have implications for the design of transfer programs.Saez (2002)showed that the optimal design of transfer programs depends on the margin of behavioral responses. In particular, providing transfers for low-income workers rather than the non-worker can be optimal if the labor supply responses are concentrated along the extensive margin, whereas providing the highest benefits to non-workers with a positive benefit reduction rate can be optimal if the intensive margin labor supply is more responsive than the extensive margin labor supply. Therefore, the results in this study suggest that the optimal transfer structure for older prime-age ABAWDs closely resembles that of SNAP without the work requirement.This paper builds upon literature on thelabor supply effectof work policies in welfare programs. Much of the literature come from evaluations of state welfare reform experiments conducted in the 1980s and 1990s. (Friedlander and Burtless, 1995;Bloom and Michalopoulos, 2001;Blank, 2002;Grogger and Karoly, 2005). These experiments randomly assigned a sample of welfare applicants or recipients to either a treatment group, which was required to participate in welfare-to-work programs to continue receiving the benefits, or a control group, which was not. Overall, the evidence shows a significant increase in employment and a modest increase in income among low-income adults with children. This paper contributes to the literature by studying recent SNAP policy changes that cover the entire United States. Moreover, I measure both the extensive and intensive margin responses to SNAP work requirements that affect households without children, which are the main target population of the current debate concerning work requirements.2Recently, researchers examined the labor supply effect of the SNAP work requirement using the ACS data (Stacy et al., 2018;Harris, 2021). The researchers used the age threshold of the work requirement as well as geographical variation in the work exemption across areas, with the work exemption status of an area determined using the waiver data alone. However, each year states can exempt up to 15% of their anticipated ABAWD caseload that is not covered by a waiver, and unused exemptions are carried over into the next year. I combine the waiver data with the 15% exemption data that I collected by contacting each state's SNAP agency and searching online to complete the work exemption data. This allows me to determine more accurately whether an ABAWD lives in an area that is exempt from the work requirement. I provide evidence that using the incomplete work exemption data based on the waiver data alone leads to a substantial underestimation of the effect of work requirements on SNAP receipt and an overestimation of the effect on employment (see Panel B of Appendix Table 2).Cuffey et al. (2021)is the other exception that used the variation in 15% exemption across areas to study the effect of SNAP work requirements. However, their analysis relied on the Current Population Survey (CPS) data which has a substantially smaller sample size (100,000 addresses) than that in the ACS data (3 million addresses), and most counties, except for very large counties, are not identified in the CPS due to confidentiality issues. Using the ACS data that contains fine geographic detail allows me to generate more precise and representative estimates of the effect of SNAP work requirements.More importantly,Cuffey et al. (2021)focused only on high school dropouts and years 2005–2009 and found a positive effect of SNAP work requirements on employment, which is inconstant with main findings from this study and other contemporaneous studies. I demonstrate that this discrepancy is explained by differences in the sample definition. When restricting my analysis to the sample of high school dropouts and years 2005–2009, I find that the work exemption has a statistically significant negative effect on employment, consistent with the results fromCuffey et al. (2021). However, when including years 2005–2017 or all education groups in the sample, the effect on employment becomes statistically insignificant (see Appendix Table 14).It is important to note that SNAP participation is substantially underreported in the ACS data (Meyer et al., 2018). Moreover, the public use ACS data does not contain detailed information on the interview date and the birthdate for the respondents, preventing me from identifying the exact period during which the ACS respondent is exempt from work requirements. As a result, my estimates on the effect of work requirements may be attenuated due to mismeasurement of both SNAP receipt and the work exemption status of ABAWDs.Ribar et al. (2010),Gray et al. (2021), andMueser et al. (2019)circumvented thesesmeasurement issueby using administrative SNAP and UI data from South Carolina, Virginia, and three states (Georgia, Missouri, and South Carolina), respectively. All three studies found evidence that work requirements substantially increase exits from SNAP among SNAP participants, though the magnitudes of the effect vary across studies. In addition,Gray et al. (2021)found a small and statistically insignificant effect on employment. While their data address measurement issues in the survey data, their estimates are based on a single or a few states. Thus, their findings may not be generalizable to other states. Moreover, their analysis sample is restricted to ABAWDs who enrolled in SNAP before changes in work requirements, which is potentially subject to selection bias.In contrast, my analysis relies on data from all US states and the sample includes all ABAWDs who are potentially affected by the policy regardless of SNAP enrollment status. Moreover, when compared to the administrative UI data, the ACS data contains more comprehensive information about individuals’ labor market activities, which allows me to examine various margins of labors supply responses to the work exemption. I further review contemporaneous papers that examined the labor supply effects of work requirements inSection 7.7.This paper further contributes to literature that quantifies the role of SNAP policies in changes in SNAP caseloads (Ziliak et al., 2003;Mulligan, 2012;Ziliak, 2015;Ganong and Liebman, 2018). In particular,Ganong and Liebman (2018)estimated that the suspension of the SNAP work requirement accounted for about 67% of the increase in ABAWDs’ SNAP enrollment from 2007 to 2011.3These estimates are based on a back-of-the-envelope calculation assuming that, in the absence of the ABAWD exemption, ABAWDs would have experienced the same SNAP enrollment growth as non-ABAWDs. Using a quasi-experimental approach, I estimate that the growth in SNAP enrollment for ABAWDs from 2007 to 2011 that is attributable to the work exemption is only about 6%, suggesting that the growth in SNAP enrollment during the recession was driven primarily by economic conditions and policy factors other than the work exemption. This result is consistent with the main finding fromGanong and Liebman (2018)that the overall growth in SNAP caseloads during the Great Recession is mainly driven by the increase in unemployment rather than changes in SNAP policies, though my estimate may be attenuated due to the measurement issues mentioned above.Finally, this study relates to previous work that examined the causes of recent declines in employment for low-skilled workers.4One group of researchers argued that structural factors such as a decline inmanufacturing industries, or an improvement in leisure technology account for the reduced employment rate among low-skilled workers (Charles et al., 2016;Aguiar et al., 2018). Another group of researchers claimed that the cause of reduced employment is associated with cyclical factors, such as the housing market crash or expansions in unemployment insurance programs during the recession (Mulligan, 2012;Mian and Sufi, 2014;Hagedorn et al., 2015;Johnston and Mas, 2018). My results suggest that the expansion of SNAP benefits during the recession contributed little to the decline in employment among low-skilled prime-age workers.",Jeehoon,None,None
"1. IntroductionInmodern societies, the general belief that, by working and studying hard, everyone has a fair chance at climbing the social ladder has been central to maintaining social cohesion and political stability. However, in an era of relatively highinequalityofwealthand incomes compared to the post-war decades in most developed countries (Piketty and Zucman, 2014), an increase in the number of citizens who fear that their children could be worse off in the future (fear ofdownwardmobility or fear of a lack ofupwardmobility) might explain rising political polarization. For these reasons, the reduction in social mobility1is becoming an increasingly important issue when it comes to understanding recent trends of inequality within society. As education tends to be the main vehicle forupwardmobility, it is of key policy interest to analyze educational systems in terms of equality and to detect drivers ofInequality of Opportunityin particular (asChetty et al., 2020for US colleges). Yet in times of public spending constraints, accelerating growth of knowledge and higher economic competition, political attention has shifted onto making a country’s educational system more efficient (Machin, 2014). In fact, reforms have started to focus on compressing educational processes, i.e. on increasing learning intensity.This paper contributes to the issue of how the trend in intensification of education may explain decreased social mobility by analyzing the question of how increasing learning intensity affects Inequality of Educational Opportunity (IEOp). Thus, I shift focus onto the distributional concerns and the potential unintended consequences for social mobility that arise from compressing educational processes. If, for instance, higher intensity made it harder to learn the curriculum through schooling alone, educational opportunities could become more dependent on a student’s parental support resources. In this context, I adopt the concept as illustrated byRoemer (1998), stating that society has achievedEquality of Opportunityif what individuals achieve regarding a desirable objective is determined by theirefforts(factors over which an individual has control), instead of bycircumstancesthat are beyond individual control (e.g. sex). Thus, IEOp2is defined as inequality in the distribution of educational outcomes that can only be attributed tocircumstancesthrough either their direct or indirect (via changingefforts) impact on outcomes. It is a relative measure of educational mobility.This paper is among the first to provide an analysis of IEOp in a quasi-experimental setting that goes beyond its pure measurement. AsRamos and Van de gaer (2016)point out, the understanding of how institutions influence IEOp is still limited. Therefore, my contribution to this issue consists in providing evidence on the role of learning intensity as a relevant policy dimension that causally affects IEOp. From a social welfare perspective, it is interesting to reveal the effects of increasing learning intensity on both academic achievement and IEOp. Pareto-improvements might be realized if intense curricula proved to be an instrument to overcome the trade-off between educational spending and schooling outcomes.To identify the causal effect of learning intensity on IEOp, I analyze an educational reform in Germany. During the last decade, Germany’s federal states shortened secondary school for the academic track (Gymnasium) from nine to eight years at staggered time points between 2001 and 2008. This so called Gymnasium-8 reform (G-8 reform) reduced school duration by one year but kept the curriculum unchanged for the affected (treated) student cohorts. Due to the implementation of the reform, there were two cohorts who would finish school together while one cohort entered one year earlier than the other, leading to differences in years of schooling (9 vs. 8 years). As both cohorts had to take the same final exams in the same year, treated students had less time to learn the same material, thus experiencing higher learning intensity. This staggered introduction of the reform across federal states generates quasi-experimental variation that allows the application of a Difference-in-Difference estimation approach (DiD) to derive the causal effect of the increase in learning intensity on IEOp, comparing the respective treatment and control groups over time.For measuring IEOp, I useProgram for International Student Assessment(PISA) data to construct a representative sample of students in the ninth grade. The data include standardized test scores in reading, mathematics, and science which are comparable across time and federal states unlike grading schemes that vary with year and state (for details on the data, seeAppendix A.4.1). Moreover, these data contain a rich set of family background variables which allow me to define relevantcircumstances. I also apply a new machine learning approach to cross-validate my theory-driven choice of variables. Ultimately, IEOp reflects the coefficient of determination when regressing test scores on thesecircumstancesvariables.The analysis yields three main findings. First, the estimated size of IEOp shows that20−35% of the variance in cognitive test scores can only be predicted bycircumstances. Second, the reform-induced increase in learning intensity led to a significant rise in IEOp, by at least 10 percentage points of the explained test score variance for affected (treated) students. Given the initial size of IEOp and the fact that this paper’s IEOp measures are lower bound estimates, this corresponds to relative increases in IEOp of at least 25%. Third, the results provide some evidence for the existence of subject-dependent curricular flexibilities. In fact, less flexible skills in mathematics and science are more responsive to changes in curricular intensity. Conversely, reading competency is trained predominantly through its usage in everyday life and thus less dependent on schooling. Finally, the results can be rationalized by differential compensation possibilities for higher learning intensity depending on parental resources, specifically the capacity tofinanceprivate tuition or to provide academic support themselves. This shows that there are important distributional concerns in providing equal opportunities (cf.Andreoli et al. (2018)) that must be taken into account when designing reforms altering the intensity of educational processes.This paper offers several contributions to the existing literature. First, I contribute to the strand of research on measuring Inequality of Opportunity (IOp) with respect to educational outcomes by adding empirical evidence on how Inequality of Educational Opportunity (IEOp) has changed over time in a developed country. So far, papers dealing with IOp have focused onmeasurement issues, using income as the main outcome variable (e.g.Almås et al. (2011)). Concerning IOp in educational outcomes, most studies focus on measuring IEOp for developing countries (e.g.Gamboa and Waltenberg (2012)). The few papers on developed countries mostly follow a cross-country comparison approach using PISA data to achieve comparability of educational achievement measures over time and across countries (e.g.Ferreira and Gignoux (2013)). Instead, my study estimates IEOp for Germany exploiting quasi-experimental within-country variation (asCantoni et al., 2017for China). Such settings allow going beyond measuring IEOp to actually estimate the causal effects of specific policies on IEOp. For instance, some studies analyze IEOp in the context of reforms that changed tertiaryeducation systems(e.g.Brunori et al., 2012on Italy). They find that both expanding higher education through opening more sites as well as reducing the length of getting a first-level degree to have a positive effect on Equality of Educational Opportunity (EEOp). However, only a few studies investigate the impact of school reforms on IEOp (e.g.Edmark et al., 2014for Sweden). In this paper, I add evidence on how IEOp changed over time in Germany and focus on estimating the causal effect of increasing learning intensity on IEOp for the academic track in the secondary school system.Second, this work contributes to a strand of the literature analyzingeducational policyreforms to identify the underlying role of differentinput factorsin the human capital accumulation process. Even though the G-8 reform shows that changing school intensity is an important consideration in educational policy-making, research on such reforms is still limited. To begin with, empirical work has analyzed the effects of variations in pure schooling quantity without considering learning intensity. In that context, most studies focus on reforms that increase educational participation, such as policies raising compulsory minimum duration of schooling. They usually find the returns of additional schooling on earnings to be positive (e.g.Aakvik et al. (2010);Angrist and Krueger (1991);Eble and Hu (2019);Grenet (2013)). Furthermore, the impact of differences in instructional time onacademic performancehas been investigated. Relying on either cross-national or within-country variation in instructional time, most studies find a positive impact of additional time on standardized test scores (e.g.Aksoy and Link (2000),Marcotte (2007),Lavy (2015)). However, only a few studies have analyzed the impact of variations in instructional time when curricular content can be assumed to remain constant. In this context, reforms that shortened the duration of schooling while keeping curricular content unchanged allow for evaluating the impact of increasing learning intensity. For instance, analyzing a similar school reform in parts of Canada,Krashinsky (2014)finds only small long-term effects on wages. This suggests that increased learning intensity might not affect earnings permanently.3The results are in line withPischke (2007), who exploits a German reform in the 1960s that changed the start of the school year to autumn by implementing two short school years. The reform led to a significant increase in the number of students repeating a grade, but only small effects on earnings persisted.Despite the resulting public controversy that has even led some federal states to reverse the reform, only a few studies have evaluated the G-8 reform and its effects on educational outcomes4. Additionally, the findings of those studies vary depending on the chosen educational outcome measure. For instance,Huebener and Marcus (2017)find that the reform had, on average, a significantly negative effect on the grade point average (GPA) of students. In contrast, the reform tends to have a positive effect on cognitive test scores as measured by PISA data (see, e.g.Huebener et al. (2017)). Furthermore, the results ofMarcus and Zambre, 2019indicate that the reform led to falling enrolment rates at university. Moving away from the explicit effect on direct educational outcome variables, the analysis in my paper shifts focus in the evaluation of the G-8 reform onto distributional concerns. In other words, I evaluate whether the reform isinclusive, i.e. it decreases IEOp while maintaining at least test score results, orselective, i.e. it increases IEOp (Checchi, van de Werfhorst, 2018). In particular, my findings are relevant for policy suggestions on designing curricula that take the effect of learning intensity on both cognitiveskill formationand IEOp into account. Implementing a whole-day school system, for instance, might limit the necessity for parents to help students deal with compressed schooling curricula.Thirdly, my paper relates to the emerging literature on finding drivers of inequality in educational outcomes which are key determinants of recent trends in decreased social mobility (e.g.Boneva and Rauh (2018);Chetty et al., 2020;Philippis and Rossi (2019);Rothstein (2019)). I contribute to this strand of research by providing evidence that the previously neglected factor of learning intensity might be a relevant policy channel for both the effectiveness of (non-)cognitive skill formation and the importance ofcircumstancesfor educational outcomes. While my analysis mainly focuses on exploiting a school reform to derive causal estimates on how intensified instruction affects IEOp, the interpretation of these results in terms of potential mechanisms complements explanations delivered by this most recent strand of literature. Although a complete model of learning intensity, IEOp, and its connection to social mobility is beyond the scope of this study, I provide evidence on which future research tackling this big picture question can base itself. This also supports the integration of learning intensity as a key factor into the human capital literature.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.Section 2illustrates the institutional background and the G-8 reform on which the identification strategy relies.Section 3explains how IEOp is measured given the data in this study. InSection 4, the empirical strategy is illustrated.Section 5provides the results with robustness checks and a discussion on their implications.Section 6concludes.",Sebastian,None,None
"1. IntroductionThis paper assesses the impact on firms of minimum wage policies in Portugal, since the end of the Financial Assistance Programme in 2014. The goal of those measures was to reducepovertyandincome inequality. The strong increase in the share of workers earning the minimum wage — from 13.2% in 2014 to 25.7% in 2017 — raised concerns about the impact of its increase on firms activity and financial condition. Business associations — especially in the traditional sectors, such as apparel and textiles — were vocal about the potential negative consequences of these increases, given that Portugal had been through a severe debt andbankingcrisis, that left many firms financially vulnerable and constrained in their ability to adjust to the increase in wage costs. After the initial controversy, the discussion on this topic faded away because it occurred in the context of a strong rise in employment and a sharp reduction in unemployment, as the economy rebounded from the crisis. To the best of our knowledge, there is no evaluation of the impact of those minimum wage increases. The first contribution of this paper is to present an evaluation of the impact of those policies on firms’ employment, profitability and exit. Our estimates support business associations concerns, suggesting that minimum wage increases reduced employment growth and profits, and accelerated the exit of financially distressed firms. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis on the financial situation of firms — which led to credit deferrals that amounted to over 20% of total bank credit (European Banking Authority, 2020) — has revived interest in this issue, given that the minimum wage in Portugal has continued to increase in spite of the recession.The costs of social policies implemented through minimum wage increases are, at least partially, borne by firms. The share borne by a specific firm depends on several factors. First, the impact on firms’ total costs depends on the share of workers affected by the new minimum wage. Second, it will depend on the firms’ ability to absorb the wage cost shock by adjusting its profit margin and/or to pass the cost increase to consumers. Finally, the impact of minimum wage policies will depend on firms’ flexibility to change their capital-to-labor ratio. If firms are unable to fully offset the impact of the minimum wage increase, their financial condition will worsen. In more extreme cases, namely when firms are financially distressed, the minimum wage increase may lead to the death of the firm. The second contribution of this paper is to propose a new, more complete measure, of the potential relative cost increase (PRCI) for firms of minimum wage policies, making use of a very rich firm-level database. In our data, the value of PRCI is higher for the group of financially distressed firms than for the rest of the economy, suggesting that those firms are more vulnerable to minimum wage increases.While the main dispute in the literature has concerned the impact of minimum wage increases on employment (e.g., contrast the views expressed inDube (2019), andNeumark and Shirley (2021), a very recent strand of the literature has been focusing on the impact of minimum wage increases on the financial condition of firms. Examples includeDraca et al. (2011), for the introduction of a minimum wage in the United Kingdom in 1999;Harasztosi and Lindner (2019)for a large increase in the Hungarian minimum wage in 1997–2004;Chava et al. (2019)for 14 states of the USA, with a focus on the credit score of small firms; andDrucker et al. (2021)for Israel in 2003–2010.Bell and Machin (2018)conclude that low-wage UK firms had significant falls in their stock market value following the announcement of a big change in the minimum wage. All these papers present evidence of a negative impact of minimum wage increases on firms’ profitability.Framed by this line of research, the third contribution of this paper is to show that minimum wage increases are particularly detrimental to financially distressed firms. The relation between firms financial conditions and minimum wage increases is especially relevant in the Portuguese economy because a significant share of the firms are highly indebted, and have very low profitability and liquidity. Therefore, in oureconometric analysiswe allow for the possibility that the minimum wage increase has a more acute effect on financially distressed firms. Our results warrant this hypothesis. According to the estimates reported in this paper, minimum wage increases lead to lower profits and lower employment growth, with magnified effects for financially distressed firms. These results suggest that policy makers should take into account the financial condition of firms when deciding minimum wage increases.The empirical literature on the impact of minimum wage increases on firm exit is also relatively recent.Draca et al. (2011)presents industry-level evidence of the impact of the introduction of a minimum wage in the UK and concludes that the probability of exit increased 1.5 percentage points.Mayneris et al. (2018)detects evidence of a ‘cleansing’ effect of the large increases in the minimum wage in 2004 in China, i.e., less productive firms were more likely to be exposed to the minimum wage increase and were also more likely to exit.Chava et al. (2019)relate increases in the minimum wage to lower credit scores and consequent higher exit rates of small businesses in the USA.Aaronson et al. (2018)andLuca and Luca (2019)focus on restaurants; both conclude that minimum wage rises increase the probability of exit.Adding to this discussion, the fourth contribution of this paper is to show that minimum wage increases acted as a potential accelerator of the exit of financially distressed firms, also known as zombie firms. This conclusion indicates that minimum wage policies may have compensated for some inefficiency of the insolvency framework. Therefore, our results suggest that minimum wage increases produce a cleansing effect, which may foster a more efficient resource allocation and productivity growth. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, the issue of zombie firms has re-emerged, given the severity of the crisis and the Governments’ intervention to support firms (European Central Bank, 2021). The ECB’s 2021 Financial Stability Review highlights the risks of inefficient insolvency frameworks, which might contribute to the prevalence of zombie firms and, thus, hamper productivity growth. In this context, the evaluation of the impact of minimum wage increases on firm exit, namely of zombie firms, becomes even more relevant.The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.Section 2describes the main facts concerning the evolution and incidence of minimum wage and financially distressed firms in the Portuguese economy.Section 3presents the dataset, empirical strategy and results.Section 4concludes.",F.,P.,J.
"1. IntroductionStarting with the seminal contribution ofChoi and Varian (2012), Google search data proved useful to proxy a variety of economic indicators.Götz and Knetsch (2019)use Google data to forecast German GDP;Vosen and Schmidt (2011)andVosen and Schmidt (2012)focus on forecasting consumption in, respectively, US and Germany. Focusing on financial markets,Da et al. (2015)use Google search data to build an investment sentiment index to predict different US aggregate market indices, whileHamid and Heiden (2015)create a proxy for investors attention to predict stock market volatility. (Koop and Onorante, 2019) show how Google search data can be used to improve nowcast of differentmacroeconomicvariables in the context of dynamic model selection. Finally, focusing on unemployment,D’Amuri and Marcucci (2017)assess the performance of Google search data related to job-search in forecasting US monthly unemployment rate.1Google searches are particularly attractive in those contexts in which data about the phenomenon of interest are either not available or available at a low time-frequency. Further, compared to surveys, Google searches are less sensitive to the small-sample bias (Baker and Fradkin, 2017). This two features made web searches an ideal source of data for researcher during the covid-19 pandemic. For example, scholars have used Google searches to predict the number of unemployment insurance (UI) claims in the US (Aaronson, Brave, Butters, Sacks, Seo, 2020,Borup, Rapach, Schütte, et al.,Goldsmith-Pinkham, Sojourner, 2020,Larson, Sinclair, 2021). Other applications (e.g.,Brodeur, Clark, Flèche, Powdthavee, et al., 2020,Fetzer, Hensel, Hermle, Roth, 2020) used Google Trends data to investigate the impact of lock-downs on well-being or economic anxiety.Brunori and Resce (2020)showed instead how web queries related to symptoms can be used to monitor the diffusion of the virus.The use of online searches crucially hinges on their association with the underlying phenomenon of interest. This, in turn, translates into the researchers’ ability to identify the most relevant set of queries in a given language and institutional context. This task is particularly challenging in a cross-country setting, where finding an ad-hoc list of keywords is either costly (in terms of time) or not feasible (due to language barriers).In this paper, we propose a data-driven procedure to retrieve, validate and identify a set of Google Trends queries which are linked to an underlying economic phenomenon of interest. This set of queries can then be combined to construct an indicator which, in turn, can be used for causal inference. We apply this procedure to estimate the impact of containment measures on unemployment-related web searches during the first wave of the covid-19 pandemic in the EU27.Fig. 1shows the EU official statistics for the unemployment rate vis-á-vis trends in expectations about future (i.e., one year ahead) unemployment levels in the EU27 before and during the first wave of the covid-19 pandemic. EU official statistics for the unemployment rate (and its expectations) are usually released with a two to three months delay and their frequency is, at best, monthly. This can be particularly challenging when facing a sudden labour market shock such as the one induced by the pandemic. Moreover, these figures – especially those on the unemployment rate – might provide a partial picture of labour markets. Several countries have implemented temporary lay-off schemes or laws suspending the right of permanently lay-off workers. Finally, official statistics for the unemployment rate are backward rather than forward-looking, a characteristic particularly relevant in a crisis such as that brought about by the covid-19 pandemic.Download :Download high-res image (168KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. Unemployment: rate and expectations.Note:the left y-axis represents the EU27 seasonally adjusted monthly unemployment rate (ei_lmhr_m, Eurostat); the right y-axis represents the EU27 seasonally adjusted monthly indicator of unemployment expectations (ei_bsco_m, Eurostat). The unemployment expectations indicator is from theBusiness and consumer surveysby DG ECFIN, European Commission. The indicator is created on a monthly basis upon the replies given to the question:How do you expect the number of people unemployed in this country will change over the next 12 months?. The resulting indicator is a weighted balance of positive and negative answers. Seehttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/bcs_user_guide.pdf.We present a simple conceptual framework linking unemployment-related web searches to current unemployment levels and expectations. Based on this framework, we argue that unemployed-related web search behaviour could be a good real-time predictor of current and future labour market conditions. We face the challenge of identifying the correct set of keywords for each EU country. Google Trends topics, which are aggregations of different queries belonging to the same semantic concept, being language-independent, are the ideal candidates for this purpose. However, the algorithm generating topics is Google’s proprietary information, thus a black-box to researchers. In this paper, we propose to use the topicunemploymentto collect, for each country, the entire set of language-specific associated queries in a given time-span (1st level queries) and all the top queries linked to the latter (2nd level queries). Then, as aforementioned, we develop an ad-hoc two-step procedure to construct a search-based unemployment indicator – seeFig. 2.Download :Download high-res image (117KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 2. From Google topics to search-based indicators: a two-step procedure.Note:two-step procedure flowchart. Details about data retrieval are outlined inSection 2. The nowcast and variable selection methods (first step) as well as the construction of the indicator (second step) are discussed inSection 3.In the first step, we nowcast, separately for each country, the monthly unemployment rate using the Search Volume Index (SVI hereafter, seeSection 2) of the collected queries. We show that nowcasting using the topic alone does not provide a statistically significant improvement over what a simpleARMA modelwould predict for the vast majority of countries considered (Section 3). Instead, once we add all the queries linked to the topic and introduce variable selection algorithms, the predictive accuracy increases significantly in virtually all countries.In the second step, we select the country-specific queries that best predict unemployment rates and aggregate them to create a daily indicator of unemployment-related searches. The indicator is built, separately for each country, as the linear projection of the daily SVI of the topic on the daily SVIs of the set of best predictors.Finally, we use the search-based indicator as the dependent variable in a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analysis. Following the lock-down measures imposed by some EU governments to limit the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, unemployment-related searches rose significantly compared to their pre-pandemic average. The higher level of searches persists throughout the lock-down period. This is not the case if using the topic “unemployment” as dependent variable. Comparing our results with those obtained using official statistics, we argue that the constructed daily indicator of unemployment-related searches better mirrors the underlying labour market dynamics.Importantly, the data-driven procedure outlined in this paper is not only relevant in the context of the covid-19 pandemic and unemployment. It could be easily adapted to study a variety of events, policies and economic indicators.The remainder of this paper is structured as follows:Section 2briefly introduces Google search data.Section 3describes our two-step procedure.Section 4shows the results of the DiD using the indicator of unemployment-related searches.Section 5concludes.",Giulio,Marco,Andrea
"1. IntroductionIn search of a job, a worker may receive more than one offer, and comparable workers may receive different numbers of offers. In a seminal work,Burdett and Judd (1983)demonstrate that the presence of multiple offers could lead to wage dispersion “in environments with identical and rational agents on both sides of the market”.1Despite the importance of multiple offers for understanding the contribution of search frictions to wage dispersion, there is little evidence on either the prevalence or the impact of multiple offers at the labor market level, probably because labor market surveys rarely ask whether a worker has ever had multiple offers simultaneously.This paper attempts to fill this gap by utilizing a unique question in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). The question asks directly whether a worker chose his/her present work over another job opportunity available at the time the worker first started the present work. Focusing on new hires from non-employment, this paper documents that (1) over 30% of them had multiple offers simultaneously just before starting the present job, (2) an one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate is associated with a 6.6 percentage point decrease in the probability of multiple offers, and (3) relative to workers with one offer, comparable workers with multiple offers enjoy a persistent wage premium of over 10% for about nine years. Together, the evidence suggests that multiple offers are prevalent and pro-cyclical, and their effects are significant and persistent.The findings make several contributions to our understanding of the labor market. First, because the size of the multiple-offer wage premium is directly related to the dispersion of the wage offer distribution, its estimate is informative of the contribution of search frictions to wageinequality. Incorporating multiple offers into a simple search model, I show that the estimated multiple-offer wage premium implies thestandard deviationof log wage offers is about 15.8%, smaller than most of the estimates in the literature.2This suggests the challenge faced by search models in simultaneously accounting for the observed rates oflabor market transitionsand the dispersion of wage offers is not as big as previously thought.3Moreover, the model implies search frictions explain less than 27.2% of overall wage inequality. This upper bound is consistent with and complements other estimates in the literature, e.g.,Gottfries and Teulings (2021),Vejlin and Veramendi (2021)andTaber and Vejlin (2020).Second, the persistence of the multiple-offer wage premium is indicative of how search frictions could have a lasting impact through interactions with other wage determinants. Using the simple search model with multiple offers, I show that the multiple-offer wage premium would decline rapidly and vanish in about four years in the absence of other labor market frictions. The fact that it remains significant for about nine years suggests there are other forces at play. I provide suggestive evidence that multiple offers have a significant and persistent effect on a worker’s occupation. The evidence is consistent with previous findings that human capital is occupation-specific such that a temporary shock that leads to a worse occupation can give rise to persistent wage scars by delaying the speed of learning about one’s comparative advantage and the accumulation of occupation-specific human capital, e.g.,Kambourov and Manovskii (2009)andWee (2016).Third, the cyclicality of multiple offers contributes to our understanding of the sullying effect of recessions. If non-employed workers are less likely to receive multiple offers in recessions, they would be more likely to find employment in low-wage jobs. This provides a new explanation for the cyclical upgrading of labor where more workers are employed in high-wage jobs in booms than recessions.4Different from existing explanations that involve either worker heterogeneity, e.g.,McLaughlin and Bils (2001)andHuckfeldt (2022), or on-the-job search, e.g.,Barlevy (2002),Krause and Lubik (2006)andMoscarini and Postel-Vinay (2013), this new channel requires neither. Moreover, given the significant and persistent multiple-offer wage premium, the cyclicality of multiple offers provides a novel explanation for the scarring effect of entering the labor market in a recession documented in a growing literature.5Finally, the findings provide empirical justifications for models of multiple offers likeAlbrecht et al. (2006),Galenianos and Kircher (2009),Kircher (2009)andWolthoff (2014). Motivated by the evidence in this paper, I endogenize multiple offers in a standard search and matching model inGuo (2021a). The model predicts that a decrease in aggregate productivity reduces the fraction of unemployed workers with multiple offers and, in turn, the probability that a low-wage offer is rejected. In response, firms post relatively more low-wage vacancies when productivity is low. This leads to a counterclockwise rotation of both the wage offer distribution and the wage distribution of new hires from unemployment, because wages at the upper end of the two distributions are reduced (shifted to the left) by more than wages at the lower end.Three recent labor market surveys ask the number of offers received by a worker during a specific period of time: the last 7 days in the survey byKrueger and Mueller (2011), the last 4 weeks in the survey byFaberman et al. (2021), and the last 4 months in the survey byConlon et al. (2018). Not surprisingly, workers do report receiving multiple offers during the specified period of time. For example, using data from the survey byKrueger and Mueller (2011),Hall and Mueller (2018)report that, among the unemployed who reported receiving at least one job offer in the last 7 days, “86.3% reported that they received one offer in the last 7 days, 8.6% reported receiving two offers in the last 7 days, 2.4% received three offers, and the remaining 2.7% received between four and 10 offers in the last 7 days”. So the fraction with multiple offers in the last 7 days among those with at least one offer is 13.7%. The survey was conducted between September 2009 and April 2010 when the unemployment rate was nearly 10%. Given the negative correlation between the unemployment rate and the fraction with multiple offers documented in this paper, the fraction of unemployed workers with multiple offers in the last 7 days among those with at least one offer could be much higher than 13.7% during normal times.Faberman et al. (2021)find the fraction of unemployed workers who received 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 or more offers in the last 4 weeks are 22.8%, 8.3%, 0.9%, 2.0% and 0.2%, respectively.6So the fraction with multiple offers among those with at least one offer is 33.3% (8.3+0.9+2+0.222.8+8.3+0.9+2+0.2), which is remarkably close to the estimate in this paper. Using the survey byConlon et al. (2018),Guo (2021b)finds that, among workers who reported receiving at least one offer in the last 4 months, “55% reported one offer, 25% reported two offers, 10% reported three offers, and the rest 10% reported four or more offers”.Different from the surveys byKrueger and Mueller (2011)andFaberman et al. (2021), which only ask about the wage of the best offer even if a worker reported receiving multiple offers, the survey byConlon et al. (2018)asks respondents to report the wages of the (up to) 3 best offers.Guo (2021b)shows how we could use the multiple wages reported by the same worker to identify the wage offer distribution nonparametrically. Empirically,Guo (2021b)finds a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 13.7% is consistent with the data on log wage offers, and this implies a multiple-offer wage premium of about 10%, which is extremely close to the estimates in this paper. Other than this, I am not aware of any estimate of the multiple-offer wage premium in the literature.One weakness of all three surveys is that they do not ask about the exact time each offer was received and accepted/rejected. Without this information, we do not know whether a worker has ever had multiple offers simultaneously. This issue is presumably more severe for the survey byConlon et al. (2018)than it is for the survey byKrueger and Mueller (2011), because a worker who reported receiving two or more offers in the last 4 months is less likely to have ever had multiple offers simultaneously than a worker who reported receiving two or more offers in the last 7 days.7Moreover, since the three surveys are either cross-sectional or very short panels (less than a year), they cannot be used to study the persistent effect of multiple offers, which is the main focus of this paper.The rest of this paper proceeds as follows.Section 2introduces the data and reports the prevalence and cyclicality of multiple offers.Section 3estimates the effects of multiple offers on individual wages and occupations over time.Section 4discusses the implications on wage inequality and the lasting impact of recessions.

"1. IntroductionA well-established finding in population research is that more educated individuals have a higher propensity to migrate within a country (Greenwood, 1997, ch. 12). However, this positive correlation may not be pointing to a causal relationship due to unobservable individual characteristics that shape both education and migration decisions (Sjaastad, 1962). Only a few studies exist in the literature that identifies education's causal effect on migration propensity. In addition to providing evidence on the causal effect of education on the migration propensity of young men and women in Turkey, we extend this sparse literature by examining the effect of education on the timing of migration and distinguishing across differentreasons for migrationamong young women in Turkey. For this purpose, we combine a strong source of exogenous variation in schooling with rich data on migration outcomes after age 15, including both interregional and intraregional movements.We use the 1997 compulsory schooling reform in Turkey as the source of exogenous variation in schooling. This reform increased compulsory schooling from 5 to 8 years and impacted heavily schooling outcomes, increasing the percentage of individuals with a middle school or higher degree by around 17 points among men and 21 points among women. The data concerned with the migration propensity of young men and women after age 15 come from the yearly Turkish HouseholdLabor Force Surveysfrom 2009 to 2017. To analyze the timing and type of migration among women, we draw data from Turkey's 2013Demographicand Health Survey. The key distinguishing feature of the latter dataset is that it includes the complete migration history of women—including the reason for migration in each move (education, employment, marriage, tied-mover either with parents or with the spouse). This analysis focuses on young women, for whom the migration incidence is higher than for other individuals. We estimate the effect of education on migration for various reasons at each age from 15 to mid-20 s.The context of our study differs from the few existing studies on this topic—all of which focus on developed countries, except for a concurrent paper (Sakai and Masuda, 2020).1The level, timing, and reason for internal migration may differ between developed and developing countries for several reasons. First, the composition of production and employment, which affect the incentives for migration, is different in developing countries. For example, more people live in rural areas and work in agriculture, and self-employment vis-à-vis wage employment is more common in urban areas. In addition, structural transformations such as a sectoral shift from agriculture toindustryand services occurring in developing countries induce migration patterns that differ from those in developed countries. Second, significant differences exist in demographic characteristics that interact with mobility, such as marriage rates, assortative mating patterns, age at marriage, and fertility patterns (Anukriti and Dasgupta, 2018). However, no evidence exists so far about the causal effect of education on internal migration in developing country contexts, and our paper provides the first evidence on this issue.Hicks (1932)proposed that differences in net economic advantages, mainly differences in wages, across geographic regions are the leading causes of migration (see alsoSjaastad, 1962). This hypothesis interprets migration as a form ofhuman capital investmentand forms the basis of most analyses of migration. In this framework, education may change migration prospects by altering the return portfolio across locations or affecting moving costs. The current literature studying the effect of education on migration interprets its findings under the above hypothesis that internal migration arises due to geographic differences in labor market opportunities. Individuals, however, may migrate for various reasons, including a change in marital status, attending or leaving college, climate, and health reasons. For example, migration for reasons other than employment is high in Turkey (68.3%),2which suggests that interpreting the impact of education on migration only through the lens of employment can be misleading.Our focus on women's migration patterns is critical because the motivations for migration could differ significantly by gender. Women, particularly in developing countries, are often considered tied movers either with their family or spouse—as dependents rather than migrants in their own right. In addition, there are often informal barriers against women's mobility foremployment and educationin developing countries due to conservative social norms. For instance, migration for marriage accounts for more than 90% of all migration by women in India (NSSO, 2005).3On the other hand, several studies report increasing migration rates of women in developing countries for employment purposes.4In these settings, migration can be a crucial channel in women'sempowerment, as they can reach better educational and employment opportunities via migration and overcome established social norms.5Such empowerment of women would further contribute to economic development and better society-wide outcomes (Duflo, 2012).6Indeed, even without economic development, improvement in women's employment and educational outcomes via migration, and the resulting reduction in gender gaps in these outcomes, is a desirable goal by itself.The effect of increased education on migration propensity may differ across moves motivated by different reasons, increasing some prospects while decreasing others. While an education-induced increase in the earnings potential of females may reduce migration among females as tied-movers, it may increase migration of women for other purposes, such as employment and humancapital acquisition. For instance, compared to a high school dropout, a female high school graduate may be more likely to relocate in order to attend university in another region and less likely to marry at earlier ages and relocate for family-related reasons. Due to such potential differences, studying the causal effect of education on different migration types can provide new insights into the role of education in mobility decisions.The compulsory schooling (CS) reform that we exploit for identification is particularly attractive from a methodological perspective for several reasons. First, as we discuss below, the primary motivation for the reform was political, and the timing was independent of themacroeconomiccontext that may affect migration incentives. Second, this reform binds a cross-section of the population, unlike the studies in developed country settings where the affected population comes from the lower end of the ability distribution. Around 47% of the school-aged children in Turkey did not continue school beyond grade 5 in the 1996–97 school year, the year before the CS law changed. Hence, the reform affected a substantial fraction of the population in our context, and the resulting local average treatment estimate (LATE) is closer to the averagetreatment effect(ATE) than those in previous studies.7Third, the extension in schooling was high, increasing CS by three years. The fact that the policy bound a significant fraction of the school-age population, which, in turn, increased schooling by three years, provides a very strong first stage in our estimation. Finally, reforms of this type have been carried out in European and North American contexts, including those affecting similar grade levels, and many lower-income countries where compulsory schooling is around five years may still carry out such reforms.8In the estimation, we use aregression discontinuity design(RDD) with the TDHS, but an instrumental-variables approach based on the differences in policy exposure across birth cohorts with the THLFS—due to the differences in the structure of the two datasets. Our results using THLFS data show a strong effect of education on ever-migrating from age 15 to mid-20 s for men but not for women. Obtaining at least a middle school degree increases the probability of migration by about 50% for men aged 23–30. This level analysis, however, masks the timing effects for women. TDHS data analysis reveals that women become more likely to migrate earlier and for different purposes. In particular, while education does not change the propensity to migrate by age 24, it changes the age when migration occurs. The incidence of migration for education purposes increases remarkably until the early 20 s. There is some suggestive evidence that migration for employment purposes also rises. At the same time, women become less likely to migrate as tied-movers (with parents or spouses).These results indicate that an increase in educational attainment changes the timing of migration and the distribution of migration reasons among women. Hence, education empowers women by increasing their earning potential and enhancing their migration for further human capital acquisition and employment. As a result, women become less likely to move as secondary migrants and start accumulating migration capital earlier in their life cycle.In the next section, we discuss the relevant literature, followed by a discussion of the conceptual framework inSection 3.Section 4describes theeducation systemand the CS reform in Turkey.Section 5discusses the data used in the analysis, andSection 6presents the identification method and estimation.

"1. IntroductionOver the last two decades, mostOECDcountries have introduced policies that make childcare cheaper or more readily available, with the aim of increasing parental labour supply and/or promoting child development. Despite these efforts, the cost of childcare is still a big concern for many parents, potentially hindering their labour market attachment. In recent years, these concerns have led several countries to expand the generosity of their childcare subsidies, e.g. by extending childcare subsidies to younger children or by increasing the number of hours of subsidised care available.1But, in other countries, how much childcare should be subsidised remains an important policy question. In the US, for example, this issue was highly debated in the 2020 presidential election, with several Democratic candidates proposing major plans to expand child care subsidies for families with young children.The existing empirical literature offers a wide range of estimates of the impact of part-time and full-time childcare subsidies on maternal labour supply (seeCascio et al. (2015)andCattan (2016)for reviews). However, with the exception of a few studies we discuss later on, most focus on estimating the impact of offering either subsidised part-time childcare or subsidised full-time childcare compared with offering nothing. As such, this literature is limited in its ability to inform the likely impact of extending the offer of free or subsidised childcare to cover more hours of the day. To do so would require comparisons to be made across countries or time periods with very different contexts. Moreover, parents affected by extensions of childcare subsidies likely differ from those affected by their introduction, and subsidies are likely to have non-linear effects on parental employment, for example because of inflexible job contracts. Further, amongst parents who are already in work, extending the subsidy would have a priori ambiguous effects on the number of hours worked, as its impact would depend on the relative strengths of the income and substitution effects when trading-off between work and leisure. Thus, even in contexts where the introduction of childcare subsidies did encourage some parents to work or work longer hours, it is not clear that extending them further would yield any further increase in labour supply.The main contribution of this paper is to shed light on this issue by evaluating the impact on mothers’ and fathers’ labour supply of initially offering pre-school children in England free, half-day childcare and then increasing this offer to the whole of the school day when they start formal schooling. We make this comparison based on results obtained using the same datasets and within the same institutional setting and time-period. The paper is amongst the first to consider the effects of such an expansion for pre-school aged children, a margin of particular relevance to policy-makers interested in increasinglabour force participationof mothers with young children. A distinct feature of our analytical approach is that we consider how parents’ labour supply responses to the provision of free childcare evolve with the duration of the subsidy and the extent to which anticipation effects might be responsible for the patterns we see.Eligibility for free childcare – including in England – usually depends on the child’s age. As such, the main identification challenge is to separately identify the effect of eligibility for free childcare from the independent effect of child’s age on parental labour supply. To overcome this challenge, we exploit birth date-based rules governing children’s entitlement to free part-time and full-time childcare. Specifically, in England, children are eligible for a free part-time childcare place at the start of the school term after they turn three (in either September, January or April), and most children are eligible to start full-time school in the September after they turn four (we refer to full-time school as full-time childcare for the rest of the paper). These rules mean that children gain entitlement to free care at different ages and remain entitled for differing amounts of time, thus generating plausibly exogenous variation in eligibility for free childcare and duration of entitlement conditional on age.We exploit these rules to implement two empirical strategies. First, we follow a number of other papers in this literature in adopting a Regression Discontinuity (RD) design (e.g.Berlinski, Galiani, McEwan, 2011,Fitzpatrick, 2010,Goux, Maurin, 2010). In our case, the impact of eligibility for free part-time or full-time childcare is identified by comparing the outcomes of parents whose children become eligible for a particular type of free care at a given point in time with those of parents whose children become eligible a term (in the case of part-time care) or a year (in the case of full-time care) later, simply because they are born a few days later. FollowingGelbach (2002)andFitzpatrick (2010), we implement this approach using Census data – specifically data from the 2011 UK Census. Like these US studies, because the UK Census date falls in late March, this enables us to estimate the impact of free full-time childcare relative to free part-time childcare on parental labour supply some seven months after children first become entitled to free full-time care. Because children become entitled to free part-time childcare each term (roughly every four months) rather than each year, however, the same data enables us to investigate whether the impact of entitlement to free part-time childcare varies by duration of exposure, as we are able to compare the parents of children who have been entitled to free part-time childcare for zero vs. one, one vs. two, two vs. three, and three vs. four terms at the time of the Census.By comparing the outcomes of individuals whose children are born very close to the cut-off dates, and hence unlikely to differ in unobserved ways, the RD approach provides a clean way to identify the causal impact of entitlement to free childcare. However, as outlined above, it only enables us to assess how the effects of entitlement vary with duration of exposure to free part-time care, not free full-time care. Moreover, a potential limitation of our – and indeed all – RD approaches in this literature is that the estimates are specific to parents of children born at particular times of the year and may therefore not reflect average effects. This could be the case if, as emphasised byBuckles and Hungerman (2013)andClarke et al. (2019), mothers trying to conceive at different times of the year differ in observed and unobserved ways, such as family background or preferences regarding family and work.To address these concerns, we supplement the RD analysis with a second panel data approach. We implement it using the UKLabour Force Survey(LFS), which collects labour supply information on a nationally representative sample of households every quarter, for up to 5 quarters.2These frequently repeated observations enable us to identify thetreatment effectsfor children born in all months of the year from within-parent changes in labour supply as their children’s entitlement to free childcare changes over time. This allows us to consider heterogeneity in the impact of entitlement to free full-time as well as free part-time childcare by duration of exposure and to estimate average effects across children born in all months of the year. The LFS sample size is too small to identify separate effects at all relevant RD cut-offs, so we broaden the windows around the birth date-based discontinuities in entitlement used in the RD strategy above to include children born throughout the year. As the parents of these children are more likely to differ from each other than parents of children born just before and just after particular cut-offs, we include parent-levelfixed effectsto control for time-invariant differences between them. To our knowledge, such an approach has not been used in the context of evaluating the impact of childcare policies on parental labour supply, althoughBlack et al. (2011)combine birthday-based rules governing entitlement to start school and family fixed effects to estimate the impact of school starting age on children’s IQ in Norway.Our main findings can be summarised in four points. First, offering free childcare never affects the labour market outcomes of fathers and only affects the labour market outcomes of mothers who have no younger child. Second, the provision of free part-time childcare has at most a small effect on the labour force participation of those mothers. Third, offering free childcare to cover a full school day instead of a half day significantly increases their labour force participation and employment. Our estimates suggest that mothers are at least 3 percentage points (ppts) more likely to be in the labour force and 1 ppt more likely to be in paid work in the first term after their youngest child is offered free full-time childcare instead of free part-time childcare. Fourth, mothers’ labour supply response to childcare subsidies varies by duration of exposure – the labour force participation impact of free full-time childcare is almost twice as large by the end of the first year of full-time entitlement as it is in the first term. The employment impact is more than three times as large, corroborating the hypothesis that it takes time for mothers to enter the labour force and find a paid job.To better understand these results, we investigate how eligibility for free part-time and full-time childcare affects the take-up of formal and informal childcare by drawing on another dataset, the Family Resources Survey, with rich childcare information. We find that the entitlement to free part-time childcare increases the use of formal, subsidisable care. However, it crowds out the use of informal childcare, so that there is little change in the total amount of time that children spend in any form of childcare. In contrast, the rise in the use of subsidisable childcare following entitlement to free full-time childcare does not entirely crowd out the use of other forms of childcare. These results are fully consistent with the small labour supply response to part-time eligibility and the stronger response to full-time eligibility we estimate in both datasets.Our paper makes several contributions to the literature on the impact of childcare policies on parental labour supply. First, it offers evidence of the impact on both mothers’ and fathers’ labour supply of increasing the provision of free childcare from half-day to full-day care amongst children under five. This contrasts with the vast majority of existing studies on this topic, which focus on mothers only3and either study the impact of offering subsidised or free childcare compared to offering nothing or else consider the impact of extending childcare subsidies for older children. Some of the very few that do consider the impact of lengthening the number of hours of care provided include (Berthelon et al., 2015) andShure (2019)who evaluate the impact of policies to increase the length of the primary school day in Chile from about 5.5 to 7.5 h and in Germany from about 5 to 7 h, respectively. Both papers find positive effects of the reform on mothers’ labour force participation. However, the results are not directly comparable with our setting as the children affected by the reforms are older (6–13 and 6–10 respectively, compared to age 4–5 in this paper) and the extension offered is lower at around 2 h per day, compared to around 3.5 h in this paper. Similarly, our findings do not necessarily predict labour supply responses of eligibility at earlier ages.4More similar to our setting is that studied byDhuey et al., 2019andDhuey et al. (2020)who exploit reforms that lengthened the kindergarten school day (affecting children aged 4–5) in Ontario’s public-funded schools in the late 1990s in French-speaking schools, and then from 2010 in English-speaking schools from about 2.5 to about 6.6 h per day.Dhuey et al. (2020)find the late 1990s change led to a large rise in employment amongst French-speaking single mothers, and (Dhuey et al., 2019) found that the more recent reform had no impact at the extensive margin, but did increase weekly average hours worked by just under 2.5The second contribution of our paper is to investigate how the impact of childcare subsidies varies by duration of exposure. In doing so, we add to a small set of papers interested in how mothers’ labour market behaviour following receipt of a childcare subsidy evolves over time (Lefebvre, Merrigan, Verstraete, 2009,Nollenberger, Rodriguez-Planas, 2015) and we show that this matters for our understanding of the effect of these policies. This is important because most existing studies have estimated the impact of childcare subsidies on maternal labour market outcomes at a single point in time following the child’s eligibility (typical amongst regression discontinuity approaches, such as Goux and Maurin (2012) andFitzpatrick (2010)) or its average impact across several months or years of eligibility (more common amongst studies that exploit staggered expansion of childcare provision, such asHavnes and Mogstad (2011)andBerlinski and Galiani (2007)).Finally, we develop a panel data-based identification strategy to complement the more traditional RD approach commonly used to identify the impact of free childcare on parental labour supply using birthdate-based eligibility rules. Its main advantage compared to the RD approach is that it allows us to recover average impacts of free part-time and full-time childcare in every school term following the receipt of the subsidy across children born in every month of the year, albeit at the cost of an arguably stronger identifying assumption, namely that the outcomes of parents of children born across the year – as opposed to just at the discontinuity – do not differ in time-varying ways for which we cannot control. The fact that our results are broadly consistent across the two approaches makes our findings particularly robust and provides confidence in the validity of the panel data-based approach.Moreover, by implementing the panel data-based approach using the LFS – which includes a rich set of covariates and covers all years between the late 1990s and early 2010s – we are also able to conduct heterogeneity analysis and robustness checks in ways the Census data would not allow us to do. Among others, we test for the possibility that parents makelabour supply decisionsin anticipation of receipt of the subsidy, which could under- or over-estimate the true impacts of being entitled to some free childcare compared to being entitled to nothing, depending on how parents respond.6While this potential issue is common to all designs based on known cut-off rules in the related literature, its implications have been under-explored to date.7We present empirical evidence suggesting that, in our case, anticipation effects of at least one year before eligibility are not a concern for the interpretation of our results.The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.Section 2provides background on childcare policy in England.Section 3reflects on the policy effects we might expect to find andSection 4the describes our empirical strategies and data.Section 5presents our RD results, whileSection 6presents our panel data results.Section 7discusses our results in relation to the literature and presents additional analysis of the effect of the policies considered on childcare use.Section 8concludes.",Mike,Sarah,Claire
"1. IntroductionAmong full-time workers in the United States, women earn 19% less than men on average (Blau and Kahn, 2016). While this wage gap has closed since the 1960s, it has changed less than would be expected based on women's relative gains in education and experience. This persistent wage gap can be accounted for primarily by the fact that women work in lower-paying occupations andindustriesthan do men, with occupation andindustry accounting for 51% of the wage gap in 2010 (Blau and Kahn, 2016). As a result, understanding why female-dominated occupations pay less than do male-dominated occupations is crucial to understanding why women earn less than men. This paper presents evidence that the presence of women in an occupation results in declines in average wages for both men and women in that occupation. This finding suggests that differences in pay between male and female dominated occupations may reflect ways in which the gender of workers changes the nature and compensation of work.This finding complicates prior literature on gender and occupation, which has focused on two broad explanations for the negative relationship between women's representation and pay in occupations. Differences in the occupations of men and women may reflect differences in their constraints, preferences and abilities. In this case, women's greater household responsibilities would lead women to choose less demanding, lower productivity, and lower paying jobs relative to men with equal levels of human capital (Becker, 1985).1Alternately, discrimination may push women to work in lower-paying occupations than similar men, because women may face greater barriers in high-paying male-dominated occupations than they do in similarly skillful but lower-paying female-dominated occupations. These barriers can take many forms, such as lower likelihood ofpromotion(Thomas, 2019;Maume, 1999), reduced access to mentorship and networking (Chen et al., 2015), or higher rates of discrimination and sexual harassment (Parker, 2018).Both of these explanations examine why otherwise similar men and women may choose differently among the bundles of wages and amenities offered by different occupations. However, if the presence of women in an occupation causes a decline in that occupation's wages, even arbitrary and idiosyncratic differences in the way that men and women choose occupations will lower average female wages relative to male wages. In turn, failure to recognize this could lead policymakers to overestimate the benefits of changing the occupation decisions of women.A largesociologyliterature has examined the relationship between the gender composition of occupations and their wages, typically finding negative correlations between changes in average male and female wage and changes in the female share of an occupation's workforce.2However, this work can only be considered causal under the very strong assumption that changes in men and women's occupation choices are exogenous to the earnings trajectories of occupations. This assumption is unlikely to hold: while men continue to work in higher wage occupations than women on average, female representation in higher wage occupations has increased over the last half-century (Blau and Kahn, 2016). Because wageinequalityhas increased over this time period, occupations with increasing female shares of the workforce are likely to have higher-than average wage growth, resulting in upward bias.I present evidence on the effect of changes in the gender composition of an occupation on wages that more plausibly handles these selection problems. I estimate a panel regression of the log average male and female wage of older workers in an occupation on the fraction of female workers among younger workers in that occupation.3Because changes in the gender composition of an occupation may be driven by factors that influence current and future wages, I construct a shift-share instrument for gender composition identified from the dramatic increase in relative femalelabor force participationand educational attainment from 1960 to 2010, measured using the US decennial census. Over this time, the female share of educated workers under the age of 35 increased rapidly, particularly for advanced degree holders. These change are unlikely to be attributable to changes in the wages of particular occupations—prior work has attributed increases in women's work and education to increased access to contraceptives (Bailey et al., 2012), changing cultural attitudes towards female labor force participation, and changes in the administration of high schools and universities (Goldin et al., 2006).This increase in women's work and education increased the availability of women in all occupations that primarily hired workers with college and advanced degrees. However, because similarly educated men and women tend to work in different occupations, some occupations were more exposed to this change than others. Occupations that are chosen at similar rates by educated men and women, such as psychology, had larger induced changes in the female fraction of workers than did occupations that are disproportionately chosen by either men or women, such as physics or nursing. Occupations chosen equally by men and women had the largest induced change in gender composition because female-dominated occupations had little scope to increase their fraction female, while few of the newly-educated female workers sorted into male-dominated occupations.4I use this difference across occupations in exposure to the increased availability of educated female workers to construct a shift-share instrument for the gender composition of each occupation (Bartik, 1991). This instrument estimates the fraction of available workers in each occupation who would be female if the proportion of workers with eacheducation level, as well as the likelihood that a male or female worker of each education level worked in the occupation, remained fixed to their 1980 levels,5while the gender composition of each education level varied over time. Because it is not identified off of changes in the occupational preferences of men and women, this instrument is not exposed to the endogenous relationship between changes in occupational preferences and changes in wages.I find strong evidence that increased female representation among young workers in an occupation leads to lower average wages for older men and women, both in the immediate term and in the longer term. I estimate that a 10 percentage-point increase in the female share of an occupation's workforce leads to an 7% decline in average female wage, and a 7.7% decline in average male wage, measured contemporaneously. Over the following ten years, the effect grows to a 9.4% decline in average wage for males and a 13.7% decline in average wage for females. Over the following 20 years, the effect on wage falls to a 4.4% decline in average male wage and a 7.1% decline in average female wage. These results are large compared to the cross-sectional relationship between gender composition and pay. In 2010, when controlling for age and education, a 10 percentage point higher female share was associated with 4.6% lower average wages for men and a 4.1% lower average wages for women (Appendix Table A.1).While this approach faces far fewer threats to identification than does prior work, it leaves open two potential sources of endogeneity, which I account for. First, the increase in women's work and education that led to changes in occupations’ gender composition also affected labor supply. As a result, I must disentangle thelabor supply effectof women's work and education decisions from the gender composition effect of those decisions. I do this by constructing a control for “induced labor supply”—that is, for changes in labor supply that would have resulted from changes in men and women's work and education decisions, were men and women's occupation choices unchanged. This control accounts for the fact that the rise in women's education and labor force participation increases labor supply in occupations that predominantly employ highly educated women.6Because the occupations with the greatest predicted changes in gender composition are gender-balanced, while the occupations with the greatest predicted change in labor supply are female-dominated, this labor supply control is not collinear with the gender composition instrument.Second, while the use of this instrument addresses many of the confounding relationships between changes in an occupation's gender composition and changes in wages, shift-share instruments may be confounded by occupation characteristics that are correlated with the base-year occupation decisions of men and women. Of particular concern is the possibility that an occupation's gender composition in 1980 is related to the occupation's skill requirements. In this case, changes in the returns to skills over the last half-century could affect the wages of occupations with large predicted changes in gender composition differently than they affect the wages of occupations with small predicted changes. Work byAutor et al. (2003)and (Deming, 2017) have identified several key dimensions of skill that have seen changing returns over this period, with the returns tosocial skills, math/analytical skills and service increasing and the returns to routine tasks decreasing. While these skills are weakly related to the gender composition of occupations, with social skill requirements highest and math/analytical skills lowest in female-dominated occupations, there is substantial variation in the skill requirements of occupations with similar gender ratios. The negative effect of increased percent female on wage is robust to the inclusion of time-varying skill effects, indicating that changing returns to skills identified as important in previous literature do not explain the estimated relationship.I make several contributions to the literature. First, I contribute to a related literature on the effect of working in a female-dominated occupation on the wage of an individual worker, pioneered by (Macpherson and Hirsch, 1995) and updated byAddison et al. (2018).7Macpherson and Hirsch measure the effect of the gender composition of a worker's occupation on wages for workers who changed occupations in the CPS. While this analysis finds evidence that workers received lower pay in occupations with a higher share of female workers, the difference is mostly explained by measuredjob characteristics, including training requirements and occupational hazards. This work provides compelling evidence that workers on the margin between male-dominated and female-dominated occupations do not require a compensating differential for working in the male-dominated occupation. However, this research design cannot speak to the question of whether the process by which wages are determined differs between male and female dominated occupations.Next, I contribute to a growing literature examining the effect of changes in gender composition on the characteristics of occupations. Previous research has hypothesized that the entry of women into an occupation causes declines in that occupation's prestige (Goldin, 2014a), asd a shift in compensation structure toward lower wages and higher nonwage amenities (Lee and Thomson, 2019). These hypotheses are supported by the exit of men from occupations that pass a threshold percentage female (Pan, 2010). In addition,Goldin and Katz (2011a,2012) find that the gender composition of an occupation coevolves with returns to long hours and rates of independent firm ownership, and they speculate that some of that coevolution may be due to the effect of a growing female workforce on the organization of occupations. The large, negativeeffect of gendercomposition on wage found in this paper suggests that these hypothesized effects of gender composition on occupations may be large and have significant wage consequences.",Jorgen,None,None
"1. IntroductionStandardized tests are ubiquitous at nearly every level of education and often use multiple-choice testing formats. They determine admission to university (e.g., USA, Turkey, Finland), measure school effectiveness, and can shapeeducation policymaking (e.g.,PISA, TIMSS, PIRLS). In multiple-choice tests, students usually have to identify the correct answer, they have the option to skip a question, and wrong answers are punished. Thus, students have to make risky choices among the possible options if they decide to answer a particular question but do not know the answer with certainty. Given the prevalence and importance of standardized tests, it is essential to try to better understand students’ behavior in these contexts, i.e., how and whether students decide to answer questions in the face of uncertainty, and how they can be “nudged” to answer more test items. According to prospect theory, choices framed as loss will induce risk-seeking behavior and choices framed as gain will induce risk-avoiding behavior (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979). In a multiple-choice test, students’ decision problem can be framed as a loss by manipulating the endowment of points and is the focus of this paper.There is growing evidence that insights derived from the behavioral and social sciences, e.g., nudging and non-monetary (recognition) incentives, represent an appropriate and cost-effective alternative to financial incentives to motivate individuals (e.g.,Bradler, Dur, Neckermann, Non, 2016,Cassar, Meier, 2018,Kube, Maréchal, Puppea, 2012). Moreover, a growing number of public policy makers and institutions have installed specialized behavioral insights teams to incorporate insights from behavioral economics into the design of more effective policy solutions (Madrian, 2014).2Behaviorally informed interventions represent a cost-effective way to prevent students from investing poorly in their own education and dropping out of school too early. The use of behavioral interventions has risen sharply in the past few years and have produced positive effects on students’ educational achievements (seeDamgaard and Nielsen, 2018, for a review of the literature). E.g.,Bergman et al. (2020)andBergman (2021)send text messages to parents,Clark et al. (2020)andvan Lent and Souverijn (2020)examine goal setting,Himmler et al. (2019)test soft commitment devices, andDobrescu et al. (2021)use real-time relative performance feedback. With regard to loss framingFryer et al. (2012)andMcEvoy (2016)find positive effects on students’ achievements whereasApostolova-Mihaylova et al. (2015);Balart et al. (2020);Krawczyk (2011);Levitt et al. (2016)andMartinez (2014)find no effects of loss framing. Most of the existing evidence on behavioral insights in education is limited to adults or adolescents, while the sample of younger children is understudied. Our study differs in an important way from previous studies by examining the effectiveness of loss framing applied toelementary school level children. Studying behavioral interventions among younger students is relevant because enhancing students’ positive attitude towards schooling might be especially effective in earlier stages of the education production function, as they might have long-lasting effects on students’ academic careers due to complementarities ofskill formation(Cunha and Heckman, 2007).Furthermore, we study students’ behavior in a low-stakes environment. Stakes in international comparative tests like the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS), or the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) are also low for students but might be high for schools and based on their outcomes often shape educational policy making. AsGneezy et al. (2019)show, ranking countries based on low stakes assessments is problematic because test scores reflect differences in intrinsic motivation to perform well on the test itself, and not just differences in ability. Therefore, knowing whether grade framing motivates students in a low stakes test can be valuable for teachers, schools, and education policy makers.3In this paper, we test whether manipulating the grading scheme in a multiple-choice test affects students’ willingness to make risky choices.4The grading manipulation entails loss framing as the underlying behavioral prediction is that individuals are willing to take more risky decisions if a decision problem is presented as a loss rather than a gain. Moreover, framing points as losses represents a potential cost-effective and easy to implement way to change students’ test-taking behavior and has demonstrated—among adult samples—that the provision of effort is sensitive to incentives framing (Armantier, Boly, 2015,Hong, Hossain, List, 2015,Hossain, List, 2012). There is a growing literature that discusses why some behavioral insights are ineffective (Sunstein, 2017) and that warns about possible unintended consequences of behavioral policy interventions (Altmann, Grunewald, Radbruch, 2019,Caplin, Martin, 2016,Carlin, Gervais, Manso, 2013,de Haan, Linde, 2018). We contribute to this strand of the literature by analyzing whether unintended effects of loss framing exist for students at the high or low end of the ability distribution and for situations in which students face risky choices. We study loss framing in elementary schools as this group of children is not yet tracked by their ability, hence closer represents the general population (as compared to university student samples), and consists of students of the whole ability distribution.5The design of our experiment is motivated by the “reflection effect” and “shift of reference” as presented in prospect theory (seeKahneman and Tversky, 1979). In one treatment (“reflection effect”), students face a decision between two negative prospects rather than a decision between two positive prospects (seeKahneman and Tversky, 1979, pp. 268–269). In another treatment (“shift of reference”), students face a loss in their initial endowment before making their decision (seeKahneman and Tversky, 1979, p. 286). To study the impact of these treatments on students’ motivation, we analyze their performance in a mathematics test under three differently framed grading schemes: (1) loss framing of points (Loss Treatment), (2) gain framing with a negative endowment of points (Negative Endowment Treatment), and gain framing of points (Control Group). In the Control Group earning points was framed as a gain: Students received 4 points for a correct answer, 2 points for skipping an answer, and 0 points for an incorrect answer.6Hence, students could earn between 0 and 40 points. In the Negative Endowment Treatment, earning points was framed as in the Control Group—4 points for a correct answer, 2 points for skipping an answer, and 0 points for an incorrect answer—but students started the test with -20 points instead of 0 points and could earn between -20 and +20 points. Thus, these two treatments differ only with respect to students’ initial endowment. In the Loss Treatment, an incorrect answer and giving no answer was framed as a loss. Students started with the maximum score (+40 points) but lost 4 points for an incorrect answer, 2 points for a skipped question, and 0 points for a correct answer. In general, the empirical findings of this paper can contribute to the question according to what type-heterogeneity exists among very young students, i.e., do students behave according to Expected Utility Theory (EUT) or Prospect Theory (PT). InAppendix Awe discuss type-heterogeneity in detail by first deriving theoretical predictions for the Loss and Negative Endowment Treatment applying both models (EUT and PT). Thereafter we discuss whether our empirical findings are informative about types, i.e., whether students are EUT or PT types.The experiment was conducted in 20 elementary schools in Germany among 1,377 students of grades three and four (age 9 to 10). The experimental design allows to shed light on whether loss framing can be effective in a very low stakes environment as the test grade did not count towards the final course grade in math. Analyzing students’ behavior in a testing environment involving low stakes is relevant given their pervasiveness at all levels of education and the low stake nature of international comparative tests (e.g., TIMSS, PIRLS, PISA). In particular because student incentives for effort inputs (e.g., reading books) might be more effective than student incentives for performance outputs (Allington, McGill-Franzen, Camilli, Williams, Graff, Zeig, Zmach, Nowak, 2010,Fryer, 2011,Kim, 2007,Sadoff, 2014). As incentives for effort inputs are low stakes, the results of this study can be informative how to “frame” this kind of educational incentives.We find significanttreatment effectson students’ answering strategies, in particular their willingness to answer more questions. The Loss Treatment pushes students to make more active choices, that is, they answer significantly more questions instead of skipping them compared to students in the Control Group. At the same time, they do not decrease their probability of giving a correct answer conditional on answering the question which could be interpreted, together with an increase in the number of answered questions, as an increase in effort (it takes effort to answer more questions while maintaining the same probability of correctly answering).7With regard to the number of points in the test, students in both treatment groups do not significantly increase their score compared to students the Control Group at the conventional levels of significance. We find heterogeneous effects of grade framing if we differentiate students by their ability. While high-ability students significantly increase the number of total points in both treatments, low-ability students significantly perform worse under the Loss Treatment compared to low-ability students in the Control Group. Interestingly, we do not find a negative effect of the Negative Endowment Treatment for low-ability students. The heterogeneity analysis reveals that the positive treatment effects of the Loss and Negative Treatment are driven by students who are in the upper half of the ability distribution but who are not the highest performers of the class. This highlights that both treatments are effective in motivating a group of students that probably has the ability to do well, but requires the motivation to exert more effort. Our results show that there might be unintended consequences of behavioral interventions in education and that they might not be effective for students at the low end of the ability distribution—often the target population of education policy makers.The paper is structured as follows.

"1. IntroductionEmployers fill a vacancy by hiring from outside the firm or by promoting or re-assigning their own workers. A longstanding and still debated question in personnel economics concerns the reasons for the high share of job vacancies (hovering around 60%) that are filled internally (DeVaro, 2020). Why should a firm favor inside candidates over outside ones? A well developed theoretical literature has explored different motives (Waldman, 2013). Employers are expected to select internal candidates to increase work incentives or save on training costs as incumbent employees have accumulated firm-specific skills. However, empirical evidence on this question is scarce. This is because commonly used data sources for studying recruitment methods are not appropriate. For example, case studies of individual firms show how internal hiring is correlated with worker characteristics, but not with firm characteristics (Baker et al., 1994).1The contribution of this paper is to document, in a representative sample, the importance of search for internal candidates and examine whether patterns in data conform to competing theories.To measure employer search behavior, we exploit a survey on management practices conducted in 2019 in 28 countries of the European Union. The European Company Survey (ECS) is a unique cross-industry data set covering 21,000 establishments, which allows us to reveal the prevalence of and reasons behind certain Human Resources practices (HR). The survey covers hiring methods,work organization, incentive schemes and training. The outcome of interest is the response to the question:When recruiting, how often does management start by looking whether there are any suitable internal candidates?66% respondmost of the timeoralways. Only 9% declare never looking for internal candidates. In comparison, in their study of the Swedish labor market,Lazear and Oyer (2004)find that 42% to 88% of jobs are filled internally depending on occupations. Our evidence shows, across countries and industries, that searching for internal candidates is a common recruiting practice.We isolate HR practices and then establishment characteristics to explain the frequency of internal search using orderedprobit models. We report marginal effects for models that include sector and countryfixed effects. Accordingly, our results show how different HR practices and establishment characteristics predict the frequency of internal search, controlling for country-specific and sector-specific variations. We first investigate whether training policies complement internal hiring. We find that establishments that train their workers through on-the-job training, i.e., any form of direct instruction by more experienced colleagues, search more for internal candidates when hiring. There is no such association with other types of training, such as training sessions during paid working time. To better understand the role of training policies, we investigate what drives the decision to train employees. Developing firm-specific and job-specific skills are positively associated with internal search. In contrast, improving employee motivation through training is not associated with internal search. Our results suggest that search for internal candidates is associated with training policies that aim to develop firm-specific skills as predicted byhuman capital theory(Becker, 1964).Reassignments andpromotionswithin firms can also promote work incentives. Encouraging workers’ efforts through competition, as in a tournament, is one potential channel to promote incentives (Lazear and Rosen, 1981). The main theoretical argument is that opening vacant positions to external candidates reduces the chance of promotion for incumbent employees and, therefore, their incentives (Chan, 1996). Although this idea is difficult to test, such a mechanism is expected to be at play in workplaces where individual incentive schemes are particularly valuable. This is not the case in workplaces in which the need for collaboration between employees is prevalent. In contrast, ordered probit estimates show that employers are more likely to search internally in establishments where employees work in teams. However, the overall motivation of employees and different incentive practices are positively associated with internal search.2This finding is consistent with the view that incentive schemes and internal hiring are correlated, but competition between employees is possibly not the main answer to rationalize internal hiring.Finally, we investigate how employer search for internal candidates is associated with other establishment characteristics. Employers search less internally in the professionalservice sectorrelative to themanufacturing sector. Professional and technical services activities represent 7.4% of employment in 1995, and 13.1% in 2019. Differences in recruitment methods across sectors suggest that the transformation of European economies towards more services possibly explains the decline in internal hiring, as documented inMaurin and Signorelli (2019). We also find that reducing the level of competitiveness in the product market reduces the probability of searching internally.Contribution to the literature.Hiring methods have received a growing interest outside of personnel economics over the past few years since they offer new perspectives on important issues, such as unemployment, wageinequalityor government policies.3Most of the recent empirical work focus on “formal” recruitment policies: posting anadvertisementand soliciting job applicants. For example,Carrillo-Tudela et al. (2021)find that faster hiring goes along with higher search effort, lower hiring standards and more generous wages. In contrast, this paper contributes to the literature on “informal” recruiting methods (Kuhn, 2018). Existing empirical work describes the prevalence, the characteristics of workers, and wage changes associated with this recruitment method (Doeringer, 1986,Waldman, 2013). Reviewing the literature,DeVaro (2020)argues that there is a lack of empirical evidence on the reasons for internal hiring. Scarcity of evidence on this topic is caused by the fact that most empirical contributions use data of a single firm (Bidwell and Mollick, 2015) and, therefore, cannot relate firm heterogeneity to employer search behavior.4Bayo-Moriones and Ortín-Ángel (2006)is the closest study. However, their empirical setting is specific, limiting the external validity of the results.5The rich data that we leverage, containing more than 21,000 observations with various dimensions of HR practices and establishment characteristics, allow us to shed light on the determinants of internal hiring for the first time to our knowledge.The paper proceeds as follows.Section 2describes the survey data set and theeconometricmodel.Section 3presents the empirical results.Section 4concludes.",Antoine,None,None
"1. IntroductionThe economic literature on the consequences of the minimum wage is both vast and contentious. Researchers concentrate mainly on the possible disemployment effects of the minimum wage, frequently focusing on teens, the age group most subject to the minimum wage.1Much less attention has been paid to the policy’s impact on teen educational investments, despite the growing literature finding substantial effects oflabor demandshocks on educational attainment (Atkin, 2016,Cascio and Narayan, 2015,Charles, Hurst, Notowidigdo, 2018)5 and the primary importance generally accorded to teen educational attainment over teen employment by policymakers. I contribute to this literature by using multiple data sources and sources of variation in concert to establish the causal effect of minimum wage changes on the educational choices of high-risk teens.While the effect of the minimum wage on educational investment is indirect, it is an intuitive byproduct of a simple model ofhuman capital investmentwhere teens decide whether to drop out of high school by weighing their opportunity cost and psychic cost of schooling against the expected future return to earning a high school diploma. To the extent that changes in the minimum wage alter the teen labor market (Neumark and Wascher, 2008), these changes will also alter the opportunity cost of schooling and therefore their dropout decision. Furthermore, to the extent that returns to a high school diploma increase more steeply with ability for higher socio-economic status (SES) teens (e.g. due to better school quality, job networks, or likelihood of proceeding to higher education) or the distribution of ability differs by socio-economic status (e.g. due to differences in parental investments or accumulated past exposure to school quality), then we would expect the impacts of a minimum wage change on high school dropout decisions to differ dramatically by SES.2I investigate the impact of changes in the minimum wage on high school dropout decisions using two distinct sources of variation and three individual-level datasets. I use two decades of the Current Population Survey (CPS), one decade of the AmericanCommunitySurvey (ACS), and the 1996, 2001, 2004, and 2008 4-year panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). To identify the effect of a minimum wage change, I leverage both variation in minimum wage rates within states over time and variation in minimum wage rates between neighboring localities on either side of a stateborderat a given point in time. Each of these sources of data and variation have their own advantages and disadvantages in measuring the educational effect of minimum wage changes. I use them in concert to address a variety of internal validity threats that would not be possible to address with only one source of data and variation.Consistently across data sources, sources of variation, and empirical specifications, I find that an increase in the minimum wage lowers the likelihood that low-SES teens will drop out of high school but has no effect on the likelihood of drop out for other teens. The effect on low-SES teens, who have a higherex antedropout rate, is substantial. I find that a ten percent increase in the minimum wage, equivalent to an increase of 73 cents per hour at the current federal minimum, lowers the likelihood of dropping out by 0.5 to 1.0 percentage points, or between four and ten percent of the average dropout rate for the low-SES group.Taken together, my results suggest that the focus of prior research on the teen employment effects of the minimum wage may have missed part of the larger picture of this policy’s impact on teens. While increasing the minimum wage may reduce contemporaneous teen employment outcomes, it may also increase the future productivity and labor market prospects for teens from low-SES families, making the long-run effects on this group far less clear.",Alexander,None,None
"1. IntroductionThe last two centuries have witnessed an enormous amount of technological innovation, and this is widely viewed as the primary source of long-run economic growth and improvements in well-being. At the same time, at least since Ricardo, economists have recognized that innovation can also be disruptive. AsAcemoglu (2002)vividly states, “in nineteenth-century Britain, skilled artisans destroyed weaving, spinning, and threshing machines during the Luddite and Captain Swing riots, in the belief that the new machines would make their skills redundant. They were right: the artisan shop was replaced by the factory and later by interchangeable parts and the assembly line.” New technologies disrupt the labor market when they raise the returns to some skills while making others less valuable or obsolete.We develop a theory, inspired byMacDonald and Weisbach (2004), of this phenomenon, which we call skill-altering technical change. Our theory emphasizes that workers endogenously invest in a portfolio of skills over their life cycle. We show that new technologies that change the relative values of skills can hurt older workers, who have spent a lifetime investing in the old, ideal skill mix, and better workers, who, by definition, possess more of the skills that were previously more valuable. We find that, depending on the elasticity of demand for workers’ output, the effect of a new technology can either increase or decrease exit rates and cross-sectionalinequality. Moreover, the specter of future, skill-altering change makes currenthuman capital investmentrisky, especially investment in specialized skills.To test our model’s predictions empirically and quantify the effects of skill-altering technical change, we exploit the introduction of composite racquets in men’s professional tennis during the late 1970s and early 1980s. These new racquets drastically changed the way the game was played, increasing the importance of hitting with spin and power relative to control. There are four reasons this episode in men’s professional tennis is a useful setting to study the effects of skill-altering technological change on workers. First, we have detailed panel data on multiple cohorts of individual workers (players), allowing us to track the impacts of skill-altering change over multiple generations of workers. Such data is difficult to obtain in most settings. Second, the new technology arrived suddenly and unexpectedly and was adopted universally within a few years. This is valuable because the timing of the innovation is obvious, the speed of the transition reduces the concern that other economic shocks are driving the results, and this particular innovation was specific to tennis, thereby minimizing concerns aboutgeneral equilibriumeffects. Third, tennis careers are short—six years on average and rarely more than fifteen years—which allows us to follow multiple cohorts of players over their entire careers. Another advantage of short careers is that it further reduces the concern that other economic shocks are driving the results. Fourth, since we can observe the performance of a player without worrying about the effects of teammates, professional tennis offers unusually clean measures of worker productivity.We find that the introduction of the new composite racquets substantially disrupted the tour, with repercussions lasting for between two and four generations. It temporarily reduced the rank correlation in player quality over time, helped younger players at the expense of older ones, reduced the average age of tennis players, and increased exit rates of older players relative to younger ones. We find that inter-generational inequality rose, though we find mixed evidence for the new racquets’ effects on cross-sectional inequality. We also consider competing explanations, but we conclude that they cannot explain many of the other patterns we find. Moreover, when we compare the ages of tennis players with other Olympic athletes, we do not find a similar drop in the ages of Olympic athletes during the same time period.While tennis provides an ideal setting for documenting skill-altering technical change, the phenomenon extends far beyond tennis. Consider the case of farmers during the mid-twentieth century. It is difficult to overstate the effect of the rise of tractors on the nature of farming. While tractors made all farmers more productive, they also had subtler effects on optimal farming practices. With a tractor, the traditional approach to farming, which relied on work animals, gave way to new farming techniques that relied on machines. Thus, farmers who had spent a lifetime investing in animal husbandry skills saw the value of their skills eroded by the arrival of tractors. As another example, consider the development of computer-aided drafting in architecture during the 1980s, discussed inMacDonald and Weisbach (2004). This new software devalued drafting and engineering skills relative to artistic skills when designing new buildings. Older architects found the transition difficult, with theNew York Timesreporting that “as young architects plunge into the high-tech tide, older colleagues wade in gingerly.”1In both examples, the new technology altered the relative value of different skills in an occupation. Consistent with skill-altering technical change,Fig. 1shows that the average age in those occupations fell temporarily relative to the general population just after the new technology arrived.Download :Download high-res image (499KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. The rise of tractors and the arrival of architectural software.Source:United States Current Population Survey (Flood et al., 2017), United States Census, and AmericanCommunitySurvey (Ruggles et al., 2018)Notes:Data on farmers come from the Census through 2000 and the five-year ACS (2008–2012) for 2010. Data on architects come from the March CPS prior to 1976, and from the basic monthly CPS thereafter. Samples restricted to ages 18–64. Tractors per farm rose from only 1 in 26 in 1920 to nearly 1 to 1 in 1955 (seeTable 2ofBinswanger (1986)). We date the arrival of architectural software to 1976. The first computer-aided drafting programs were developed in the early 1960s, but were not used widely until much later. As late as 1977, firms could claim to be among the first in their state to be using computer-aided design (Zahler, Miriam. “Architects turn to computers for drafting and design work.”Crain’s Detroit Business. 13 October 1986).Table 1.

A large literature has explored the evidence and consequences of skill-biased technical change (SBTC), whichAutor et al., 2008define as “any introduction of a new technology...that increases the demand for more-skilled labor relative to less-skilled labor at fixed relative wages.” In contrast, the phenomenon we identify—skill-altering technical change—is the introduction of a technology that raises the demand for, or productivity of, one skill relative to another at fixed implicit (skill-specific) wages. Whereas models of SBTC make predictions about wage differences between, for example, college and non-college educated workers, our model of skill-altering change primarily makes predictions about wage differences between more- and less-experienced workers. Furthermore, because skill-altering technical change focuses on differential effects of technical change over the life cycle, it allows us to address intergenerational inequality and exit decisions. This allows us to address a puzzleCard and DiNardo, 2002identify; “SBTC also fails to explain...the age gradient in the return to education” which we explain as resulting from a change in which skills are valued rather than a change in the general value of skill. Moreover, while the prospect of future SBTC raises returns to human capital investment, the prospect of future skill-altering change discourages human capital investment. Thus, while skill-biased and skill-altering change are not mutually exclusive phenomenon, they are conceptually distinct and offer distinct empirical predictions.We build most closely on four papers that measure how the introduction of technology affects workers.Akerman et al. (2015)use the exogenous roll-out of broadband internet in Norway,Gaggl and Wright, 2017use variation induced by an unexpected U.K. tax credit for small firms which invested in information and communication technology,Hanssen (2020)uses the transition to sound motion pictures, andHorton and Tambe (2020)use the transition away from Flash. We also build onGannaway et al., 2014, who investigate the effects of a new technology in professional sports—the three-point line in NBA basketball. We build on these papers by introducing a model of skill-altering technological change and using panel data to trace its effects on workers over time, and examining how the effects differ based on worker experience.The structure of the paper is as follows. We explain the nature of the technological shock in men’s tennis inSection 2, and introduce our model inSection 3. InSection 4we use this model to understand how players are affected by the introduction of a skill-altering technology. We introduce our data inSection 5and describe how we estimate player quality using this data inSection 6.

"1. IntroductionAround 1.4 million Americans identify as transgender1(Flores et al., 2016), and it is well documented that these individuals face prolific transphobia and bias in the labour market, resulting in harassment, exclusion, andpoverty(Kollen, 2016;Leppel, 2016,2019;Carpenter, 2020). However, economic research relating to trans-experience is limited, mainly due to a dearth of data on trans identities. Of the limited research that has been completed, economists have generally documented that trans people are less likely to be employed than cisgender people (Leppel, 2016,2019;Carpenter et al., 2020) and face discrimination in the labour market (Van Borm and Baert, 2018;Van Borm et al., 2020;Granberg et al., 2020).Trans people face serious exclusions when their identification documents do not reflect their gender identity (Drydakis, 2017a;Centre for American Progress, 2015). The process of obtaining identification documents that reflect gender identity differs significantly across US states (Centre for American Progress, 2015). In many states trans people are only allowed to amend their identification if they have undergone surgical treatment, which involves changing the genitalia of an individual to reflect their gender identity. But, for many trans people sex reassignment surgery may not be affordable, or even desired (Drydakis, 2017a). Not only has descriptive evidence highlighted the impact of incongruent documents on the discrimination faced by transgender people in the workplace (James et al., 2016), but the labour market consequences of incongruent documents have a theoretical underpinning.Incongruent documents signal to potential employers that an individual is transgender, and as such, this increases the possibility of discriminatory employers discriminating against individuals with incongruent documents. In addition, gender markers on identification documents offer a signal of gender to employers and these may impact the likelihood of discrimination along the lines of binary gender, where previous research has documented a preference for men in the labour market (Guryan and Charles, 2013;Azmat and Petrongolo, 2014). Obtaining congruent documentation is also positively associated with health andwellbeing(Meyer, 2003;Sheim et al., 2020), which is positively associated with labour force outcomes (see inter alia;Ettner et al., 1997;Ojeda et al., 2010;Banerjee et al., 2017;Gondek, 2018;Isham et al., 2020).The effect of surgical restrictions to change the gender marker on identification documents on the labour market outcomes of trans people are yet to be explored. These may have serious implications considering that the removal of these restrictions increases access to congruent documentation, especially for those transgender individuals that may choose to not undergo surgical treatment or cannot afford to do so. Indeed, recent descriptive work by the Williams Institute demonstrates that fewer barriers to changing identity documents are associated with increased likelihood of having congruent documents amongst transgender people (Herman and O'Niell, 2021).Studying the labour market outcomes of trans people is important for several reasons. Firstly, studying the labour market outcomes of trans populations is important considering its policy relevance. In the US, translegislationvaries across states, and as such empirical analysis can evaluate what policies have the best traction in improving the labour market outcomes of trans people, as well as informing economists and policy makers of what works for LGBT+ workers. More broadly, empirical analysis of trans populations offers new insights into the broadereffects of genderin the labour market, enabling an analysis of the differential effects of presentation, identity, and sex.In the current work variation in the timing of the removal of surgical restrictions to change legal gender on identification documents is exploited in a triple difference framework to explore the effect of the removal of these restrictions on the employment of transgender people, for the first time. This is the first paper to consider the implications of requiring people to undergo surgical procedures (by law) to be able to change their documentation to reflect their identity. The analysis presented in the current work is important for policy makers as it highlights the negative impact that surgical restrictions to change legal gender have on the labour market outcomes of trans people. More broadly, results presented in this study are one of the first to document the economic effects of the expansion of transgender rights which is particularly important given the rise in transgender restrictive policies (such as transgender exclusions in sport and bathroom bills) in recent years.The remainder of this article is structured as follows. InSection 2a background to the current work and discussion of the related literature is provided, while the data used in the current work and the empirical approach are presented inSection 3.

"1. IntroductionPrivate firms provide andfinanceapprenticeshipplaces in large numbers on a voluntary basis in many countries, without or with little financial support from the state. Although there are economic explanations for this behavior, existing differences in the provision of apprenticeships across and within states call for additional, complementary explanations. In this paper, we study the case of Switzerland and argue that culturally determined regional norms are important for Swiss firms’ propensity to trainapprentices.Swiss firms operate in different regional cultures and are confronted with different norms. Apprenticeships are clearly most prevalent in the German language region. They are still important in the French and Italian language regions, but to a substantially lesser extent. This feature of the Swiss apprenticeship system is hard to explain using conventional explanations, because the institution of apprenticeship training is regulated on federal level and economic shocks do not stop at languageborders. Instead, we argue that the population in the German language region in Switzerland has a relatively stronger preference for the private – as opposed to public – provision of goods than the population in the French language region. Accordingly, people in the German language region have more pronounced expectations of firms to provide training places for their youth. Firms react to these expectations by training more apprentices, either because they conform to the local population’s expectations for profit motives, or because firm owners and employees agree with the underlying values.Kuhn et al. (2019)show that Swiss firms are more prone to train apprentices if they are situated in municipalities whose population opposed new laws which would have accorded more responsibility to the state in providing apprenticeships. A major concern in all empirical analyses on the effects of values and norms on economic agents is reverse causality. It is a priori not clear whether norms influence firm behavior or whether firm behavior influences the values and expectations of the local population. However, controlled trials are infeasible because norms cannot be randomized. Therefore, we profit from the fact that reverse causality is less of a concern when analyzing the effect of stable, slowly changing norms that are deeply rooted inculture.Becker (1996)highlights that culture is mostly inherited and individuals do not have much control over their culture. In a similar vein,Guiso et al. (2006)recommend using cultural determinants that hardly change over individuals’ lifetimes, e.g. ethnicity, asinstrumental variablesfor their beliefs and preferences. We will follow this approach by using the dominant language spoken in the municipalities at the French-German language border as a cultural determinant of the local population’s norms towards the public or private provision of goods, which in turn affects firms’ provision of training. This approach and the firm population data we use are novel and completely distinct from those inKuhn et al. (2019), who use data from a cost-benefit survey and analyze norms and training in all of Switzerland. Despite different methods and data, both papers conclude that local norms affect firm training.Identifying the effects of norms by comparing two culturally diverse regions within Switzerland may be problematic because cantons1shape institutions in many policy areas. Therefore, we will focus on a language border that separates two cultural areas, but cuts through bilingual cantons in most cases. This circumstance allows us to compare the training behavior of firms that operate largely within the same political, institutional, andeconomic framework, but are embedded in different cultures. In a first step, we will show that norms towards the private or public provision of goods vary strongly between language regions. German language voters regularly oppose state interventions and value the private provision of goods, whereas French language voters tend to favor state engagement in the provision of the same goods. In a second step, we will show that firms’ training provision differs at the language border as well. Our estimates imply a relative difference in the proportion of training firms of about 13%. This finding remains largely unaffected when controlling for cantonfixed effects, firm and location characteristics, and the demand for apprenticeship training; moreover, it is robust throughout various specifications and subsample estimations.Our contribution to the literature is twofold. Firstly, we contribute to the literature on firm-based training by investigating a novel mechanism favoring the provision of training. The dominating explanations why firms offer training are based on direct financial returns, which accrue from trainees’ productive work combined withlow pay(Becker, 1962,Lindley, 1975), and from rents generated from retaining trained workers in monopsonistic labor markets (Acemoglu, Pischke, 1998,Acemoglu, Pischke, 1999,Stevens, 1994), among others. We propose a complementary mechanism based on local norms favoring private over state provision of goods, which puts pressure on firms to provide apprenticeships. Such a mechanism is also important for strengthening apprenticeship systems in other countries, a goal declared by the EU with its “Alliance for apprenticeships” and the US alike.2We argue that encompassing apprenticeship systems do not only rely on institutions that allow firms to train in a profitable way, but also on a favorable societal context that prompts firms to train and to collaborate in developing the whole system.Secondly, our paper contributes to the literature on the effects of culture and culturally embedded values and norms on agents’ behavior. There are a large number of empirical studies analyzing effects of norms on individuals, but studies which focus on the effects of regional culture and norms on firm behavior are still scant. In a recent study,Erhardt and Haenni (2018)analyze the influence of culture on becoming an entrepreneur. Moreover, large firms’ organization, that is their degree of decentralization, has been shown to vary with the level of trust in the region where the corporate headquarters are situated (Bloom et al., 2012). In a similar vein,Bassanini et al. (2017)show that French firms react to social pressure and try to avoid firing employees in the region where their headquarters are situated. Gender wage gaps may be larger within firms in regions where prevailing gender norms are less egalitarian (Janssen et al., 2016). Our paper provides evidence that regional culture and norms also affect firms’ training provision.The rest of the paper is organized as follows.Section 2provides some background information on the Swiss apprenticeship system and on the French- and German-speaking language-cultural regions.Section 3presents the main data sources and discusses the construction of the key variables, andSection 4sets out our empirical strategy.Section 5discusses our main results, including several robustness checks, as well as several pieces of complementary evidence.Section 6concludes.",Manuel,Andreas,Jürg
"1. IntroductionFrom smoking, teen pregnancy, and other risky behaviors, to grades and labor market outcomes, friends and acquaintances impact each other, for better or for worse. Much of the economics literature onpeer effects, however, has focused on how the pastacademic performanceof peers impacts an individual’s learning outcomes. The standard peer effects literature has used mostly administrative data sets from the United States and found a range of results from positive, non-linear effects (Vigdor and Nechyba, 2007) to positive effects at the class, but not grade level (Betts, Zau, 2004,Burke, Sass, 2013) to positive effects with heterogeneity (Hoxby, 2000) of past peer academic performance on later individual outcomes.2The results of non-linearity and heterogeneity in peer effects models indicate that how peers impact each other is a complex process, yet there has been almost no exploration of how peers impact each other in the classroom beyond their past academic performance.In this paper, I use longitudinal data from Flanders, Belgium to look at the relationship between non-cognitive peer effects and academic performance in mathematics and language.3This focus on non-cognitive peer effects fits withinSacerdote’s2011“broad definition of peer effects to encompass nearly any externality in which peers’ backgrounds, current behavior, or outcomes affect an outcome” and it is the first paper to explicitly look at how non-cognitive traits of peers impact individual learning outcomes in secondary school. This is important since secondary school is a key formative period in a young person’s life and the results produced in this paper can speak to a broad audience of educators. I build on the existing peer effects literature by explicitly using measures of non-cognitive peer and individual level traits in my analysis. I use teacher assessments of personality to construct measures of conscientiousness, agreeableness, and extroversion based on the “Big Five taxonomy,” first coined byGoldberg (1981). As noted byGolsteyn et al. (2021), this is the first paper to explicitly consider non-cognitive peer effects.In this paper, non-cognitive ability is closely related to personality and “soft skills,” whichHeckman and Kautz (2012)define as “personality traits, goals, motivations, and preferences that are valued in the labor market, in school, and in many other domains.” To provide further information on theBig Five, I reproduceTable 1fromAlmlund et al. (2011)asTable 1. AsAlmlund et al. (2011)point out, this is a widely used and accepted taxonomy of personality.Table 1. The Big Five Domains.FactorDefinition of FactorI. Openness to Experience (Intellect)The tendency to be open to new aesthetic, cultural, or intellectual experiences.II. ConscientiousnessThe tendency to be organized, responsible, and hardworking.III. ExtraversionAn orientation of one’s interests and energies toward the outer world of people and things rather than the inner world of subjective experience; characterized by positive affect and sociability.IV. AgreeablenessThe tendency to act in a cooperative, unselfish manner.V. Neuroticism (Emotional Stability)Neuroticism is a chronic level of emotional instability and proneness to psychological distress. Emotional stability is predictability and consistency in emotional reactions, with absence of rapid mood changes.Source:American Psychological Association Dictionary (2007) inAlmlund et al. (2011).In order to conceptualize how these non-cognitive peer effects might impact learning outcomes, I draw on a range of psychological literature and the standard educational production function. AsAlmlund et al. (2011)discuss, attainment is a function of IQ, effort, and environment. We can think of non-cognitive peer effects entering the education production function through either effort (e.g. in terms of whether or not peers motivate each other to succeed) or environment (e.g. if peers’ behavior causes disruption to learning or if teachers are particularly motivated by engaged pupils).Golsteyn et al. (2017)helpfully note that when the environment is affected, the efficiency of learning is affected. In this context, peers’Big Five personality traitsmay impact the environment (learning efficiency) and individual effort, which I discuss further in the Empirical Strategy section.I use these non-cognitive measures to estimate three sets of models, beginning with the linear-in-means model (LIM), as well as several robustness checks. The assumption underlying the LIM is that having higher ability peers on average impacts individual level outcomes. Second, I estimate models that include a mean peer effect term and variance peer effect term in order to disentangle the effect of the tightness of the ability distribution from the mean on outcomes. There are differing schools of thought on how variance in ability can impact individual outcomes.Sacerdote (2011)highlights the “rainbow” and the “boutique” models. The rainbow model posits that high levels of variance, i.e. diversity, is beneficial, while the boutique model posits that a similar level of ability is beneficial because it allows teachers to teach at one level. Policies of tracking or streaming pupils based on ability are common in secondary school (Slavin, 1990) and reflect the boutique model. They work on the assumption that a class with a lower variance, i.e. more similar pupils, positively affects a pupil’s outcome. Including the variance terms allows me to test this.Third I estimate models of peer effects that focus on the impact of having pupils with very high or very low non-cognitive skills in a classroom. The “shining light” model hypothesizes that having very good pupils in the classroom serves as an example for the others and thereby pulls them all up (as they increase effort), while the “bad apple” model hypothesizes that having very poor performing or ill-behaved pupils disturbs learning in such a way to drag her peers down (decreasing efficiency) (Sacerdote, 2011). The bad apple model of peer effects has received considerable attention in the literature (e.g.Lazear, 2001). In order to test the validity of these two hypotheses, I estimate a model that includes the percent of pupils in each class in the bottom and top quintiles of the entire cohort’s ability distribution. This is important since there may be differential returns to very high or very low values of these traits.Golsteyn et al. (2021)is the only other paper to examine the importance of peer personality on individual learning outcomes. They exploit random allocation to university seminar groups at Maastricht University to examine how peers’ persistence, self-confidence, anxiety, and risk attitude impact test outcomes. Their findings show that being exposed to more persistent peers positively affects performance while being exposed to more risk taking peers negatively affects performance. My paper is different from Golsteyn et al. in several key ways. First, I use data from compulsory schooling, which is arguably more representative of how peer effects might work for a broad swath of the population. Secondary school is a key point in a young person’s life before transitioning into further education or the labor market, so understanding peer effects in this context is important. Second, I use schoolfixed effectsas the identification strategy. Most secondary schools do not use random allocation to classrooms. The evidence generated by this paper is therefore useful to a broad range of policymakers and educators who do not plan on randomly allocating students to classes. Third, I use Big Fivepersonality traits. These measures have been used in range of papers across disciplines, which allows for comparability of results. They are also easy to collect given recent advancements in 10 question versions, which only take one minute to administer (Rammstedt and John, 2007andHahn et al., 2012).Neidell and Waldfogel (2010)also look at non-cognitive peer effects in their paper examining the impact of peer group kindergarten attendance on first grade learning outcomes. Unlike this paper, they use measures of peer behavior as predictors of individual learning outcomes. Their findings show that high peer externalizing problems, behaviors associated with “defiance, impulsivity, disruptiveness, aggression, antisocial features, and overactivity” (Hinshaw, 1992), negatively affect learning outcomes. Apart from their paper, most other peer effects studies looking beyond the traditional channel of past academic performance have focused on gender (e.g.Hoxby, 2000andLavy and Schlosser, 2011).Hoxby (2000)shows that having a higher proportion of girls in a classroom positively impacts learning outcomes. The mechanism through which this works, however, has yet to be fully explained. One potential explanation is that girls and boys have on average different strengths and weaknesses in terms of non-cognitive skills.Bertrand and Pan (2013)review the medical and psychological evidence that points to this, e.g. the fact that boys are statistically more likely to be diagnosed withattention deficit hyperactivity disorder(ADHD).Aizer (2008)explicitly looks at ADHD and exploits exogeneity in access to treatment as a way to change peer behavior. She finds that improvements in peer behavior improve academic outcomes, which indicates that peer behavior is perhaps just as important as peer cognitive ability in determining outcomes, supporting the mechanism of environment affecting learning efficiency. This paper contributes to the peer effects literature by being the first to explicitly model how personality traits affect learning outcomes in secondary school over and above traditional academic peer effects in a context relevant to most young people.There is a related literature on the linkage between non-cognitive traits and learning and labor market outcomes. The growing evidence out of this literature shows that non-cognitive ability may matter just as much or even more than cognitive ability for labor market outcomes.Borghans et al. (2008)andAlmlund et al. (2011)provide extensive overviews of this literature.4Heckman and Rubinstein (2001)provide evidence on the importance of non-cognitive skills on “General Educational Development” (GED) test outcomes, a high school diploma equivalency exam, in the United States. They do not identify any one non-cognitive skill in their analysis, but find that GED recipients earn less, have lower hourly wages, and obtain a lower level of schooling than high school dropouts, which they attribute to lower non-cognitive skills. Not only are non-cognitive traits important for future outcomes, but they can be developed, which makes them of interest to policy makers.Heckman et al. (2013)show that non-cognitive traits are malleable in a long-term way using data from the Perry Preschool Project.The data used in this paper allows me to account for many of the pitfalls commonly associated with the peer effects literature. I account for the endogeneity of peers in part through a school fixed effects approach and in part through the construction of the data set. All of the pupils in this data set are starting secondary school at a new school with mostly new peers, which enables me to avoid many of the problems that arise from administrative data including the “reflection problem” (Manski, 1993). The reflection problem arises because peers influence each other over time, which means that in most cases, an individual will have helped to shape the peer effect term used in analysis. Because my peer effects are calculated using individual level measures collected from the end of primary school, most of the new peers in their secondary school will not have influenced each other over time. I show that most peers in math and language classes did not attend primary school together and that my results are robust to excluding those who did know many of the peers from primary school.The data set also includes a rich array of socio-economic status (SES) measures, personality measures, and an intelligent quotient (IQ) test, allowing me to control for much of the unobserved heterogeneity between pupils and account for most, if not all, of the selection into classrooms. I run a series of robustness checks around the issue of selection into classrooms. They show that individuals are not selected into classes on the basis of their non-cognitive traits. Importantly, while peer non-cognitive traits impact learning outcomes at the end of the school year, they do not impact tests taken at the very beginning of the school year.I find that having more conscientious peers in a classroom is positively related to individual math and language performance. I also find that having more extraverted peers in a classroom is negatively associated with individual math performance. I find no support for peer IQ or past subject performance positively impacting results in the standard linear-in-means framework. I also find limited support for alternative models of non-cognitive peer effects. These peer effects seem to work primarily through the class average. Overall, the findings in this paper show that peers influence each other’s learning outcomes in ways beyond the traditional channels of IQ and past subject performance.The rest of this paper is structured as follows. InSection 2, I discuss the data used and some key stylized facts. I then present the models estimated and the identification strategy inSection 3, which I follow with a discussion of the estimates obtained inSection 4.

"1. IntroductionAgainst a backdrop of risinginequality, the existence of racial labor market disparities is a key public concern. Economists have studied labor market disparities along several dimensions, focusing on trends in factors including differential worker productivity, the relative supply of workers, unionization, and skill-biased technical change.1Considerable attention has also been devoted to understanding the labor market effects of economic shocks, with a view toward worker inequality in several instances.2However, existing research has yet to determine whether and how any given shock-inequality connection is mediated by preexisting worker-firm matching, which in particular may vary across racial groups (e.g., white, Hispanic, and Black workers).The closest that researchers have come to doing so has been through the use of information about displaced workers from survey data.Fairlie and Kletzer (1998)andWrigley-Field and Seltzer (2020)use the Displaced Worker Survey – a supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS) – to document how Black and white workers were differentially affected by job displacements during the 1980s and from 1981 to 2017, respectively. However, displacement in these articles includes losses not only from establishment closures, as in our study, but also losses from the elimination of positions/shifts and losses from insufficient demand. These additional sources of displacement potentially conflate pre-downturn matching with post-downturn employer discretion over who to let go during periods of downsizing. Similarly,Davis and von Wachter (2011), which combines CPS data with information from the Business Employment Dynamics database and the Job Openings andLabor TurnoverSurvey to analyze the effect of job destruction on employment by gender and age from 1974 to 2008, defines destruction to include employment losses stemming from both closing and shrinking establishments. Other notable articles that estimate the effects of recessions and rising unemployment rates on employment by worker race includeBadgett (1994),Couch et al. (2018), andSchwandt and Von Wachter (2019), but none of these consider displacement arising from establishment or firm closures.3In this article, we explore how the pre-recession matching between workers and establishments affects inequality across workers by race, in terms of employment losses related to establishment deaths during theGreat Recession.4If workers are matched to establishments non-randomly by race, then the racial groups concentrated within establishments least able to survive the downturn will experience a disproportionate share of the employment decline.5Focusing exclusively onemployment changesfrom establishment deaths (as opposed to changes from non-closing establishments) is key for understanding the connection between worker inequality and pre-downturn matching, given that, by definition, death-based changes cannot be affected by post-downturn employer favoritism toward one racial group over another. We use the Great Recession, a downturn that was abrupt, deep, and widespread, to uncover evidence of such sorting across establishments by race. Under our approach, the degree to which workers of different races are differentially distributed according to unobservable establishmentresilienceis revealed by the change in racial employment inequality explained by establishment deaths.This concept of resilience is related to but distinct from establishment productivity. In the sizable literature on the “cleansing” of lower-productivity establishments during economic downturns,Foster et al. (2016)note that the cleansing (productivity reallocating) effect appears to have been weaker during the Great Recession relative to prior downturns.6To the extent that firm resilience is related to productivity, this result suggests that our estimates might understate the relative employment effects to be found in a more “typical” recession. However, it is worth noting thatLee and Mukoyama (2015)does not find large productivity differences between manufacturing plants exiting during downturns versus those exiting during normal times.In addition to establishment productivity, resilience during downturns might also be related to a number of other factors identified in the prior literature. One prominent such factor could be financial constraints, as high-productivity but financially vulnerable firms are forced to exit the market during economic recessions (seeHoltz-Eakin, Joulfaian, Rosen, 1994,Musso, Schiavo, 2008,Osotimehin, Pappadá, 2016). Similarly, research has generally found greater cyclical employment sensitivity for smaller and younger firms (e.g.,Crouzet, Mehrotra, 2020,Fort, Haltiwanger, Jarmin, Miranda, 2013), although these analyses tend not to focus on employment losses stemming specifically from establishment deaths. One exception isLee and Mukoyama (2015), which finds little difference in the size of manufacturing plants (in terms of employment) exiting at different points in the business cycle.Another potential correlate of resilience is the race of the business owner, as the Great Recession appears to have impacted Black-owned businesses more severely than white-owned businesses in terms of both employment and survival (Jarmin et al., 2014). To the extent that Black-led businesses have a higher share of Black employment, this channel could account for some of our aggregate findings. The subprime crisis hit Black households particularly hard (Gerardi, Willen, 2009,Rugh, Massey, 2010), suggesting highly localcredit channelsas a possible mechanism. Determining how much, if at all, these various factors contributed to resilience during the Great Recession is beyond the scope of our analysis.The key methodological contribution of this article is to recover the component of the change in employment inequality that is explained by establishment deaths. In our context, this change is defined as the difference across worker race (e.g., white vs. Black) in the aggregate percent change in employment over the Great Recession.7As direct and nationally comprehensive measures of worker-specific employment changes arising from establishment deaths are unavailable, we propose a method for statistically decomposing employment changes by worker race into four mutually exclusive and exhaustive components: those due to establishment deaths, births, contractions, and expansions. The approach exploits variation in each of these establishment-level causes while imposing restrictions so that the overall predicted employment changes by race and by cause match those observed in the data.8With the decomposition in hand, we adapt the well-established procedure from the literature for isolating across- and within-industry variation,9separating the overall employment change attributed to establishment deaths into across and within components. These terms intuitively depend on the race-specific employment changes and employment shares at the industry level; the across component is a function of the average employment changes across race groups and the differences in shares by race, while the within component is a function of the differences in employment changes by race and the average employment shares across race groups. While the extent to which establishment deaths can explain across-industry patterns is interesting, focusing on the within-industry changes is particularly informative. Doing so rules out the deaths effects from being driven by a correlation between industry-specific preferences and industry vulnerability to demand shocks.We apply our empirical framework to employment data from the Census Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI), broken down by worker race, geography (county), and industry (at the NAICS four-digit level). These publicly available data cover the vast majority of private sector employment for virtually all counties in the United States for the years surrounding the Great Recession. Our near-universal coverage is important – in order to identify the aggregate effect on worker inequality, it is necessary to trace out howeveryindustry andeverycounty is impacted by the Great Recession, rather than a subset. Our administrative data is in contrast to individual survey data (e.g., CPS), which does not contain a sufficient number of observations to conduct analyses at the four-digit industry by county level, and which may suffer from recall bias. We supplement the QWI with Statistics of U.S. Businesses (SUSB) data from the Census on the number of establishment deaths, births, contractions, and expansions by county and four-digit NAICS. We then link this establishment information to employment shifts by industry, county, and worker race.Applying our decomposition method reveals substantial changes in employment inequality by race over the Great Recession. In keeping with prior analyses, while all racial groups lost employment, Black workers were disproportionately affected by the downturn, with a decline that was about 25% larger than the loss for white workers and approximately five-sixths larger than Hispanic workers. Black workers fared even worse with respect to employment losses stemming from establishment deaths, losing at twice the rate of white and Hispanic workers.10The decomposition into across- and within-industry components reveals that the more pronounced employment losses for Black workers were driven entirely by within-industry declines, with white and Hispanic workers incurring greater losses as a result of their unfavorable preexisting distribution across industries. More importantly, the within-deaths estimates indicate that Black workers were disadvantaged within industry precisely because they were concentrated in less resilient establishments prior to the recession.Our work relates to a prior literature that examines the effects of individual establishment closures, arguing that these can be seen as natural experiments that allow researchers to evaluate the wage losses that result from job separations.11Our approach offers a complementary view, focusing on aggregate employment losses across all establishment deaths, rather than the subsequent effects of a single establishment death on its former workers. Our finding that minority workers are more likely to be employed at firms that are less resilient to negative shocks and more likely to close is not something one could discern using data from a single establishment.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: The next section describes the data used in our analysis.Section 3sets out our framework for exploring changes in inequality, detailing the procedure for determining the extent to which the gap in the employment growth rates by race can be attributed to each establishment-level cause (deaths, births, contractions, and expansions), as well as decomposing each gap into across- and within-industry components.Section 4provides several stylized facts about the Great Recession, lending context to our main empirical results, which we present inSection 5.Section 6then justifies our approach by formalizing the sources and direction of potential bias, undertaking a sensitivity analysis, assessing goodness-of-fit using an out-of-sample exercise, and showing that our results are robust to the use of alternative geographical and industry definitions.Section 7concludes.",Hugh,Eric,Viviana
"1. IntroductionThe study of labor market responses to changes in trade flows has long been a subject of study in Economics. The literature has placed particular emphasis on the impact of trade shocks on certain labor market variables, such as employment and wages, stressing the differential impact across sectors, occupations and skill groups (Heckscher–Ohlin, Ricardo–Viner). In this paper, we depart from this approach and join a newer line of research that has focused on the effects of trade on individuals living in geographic areas with different patterns of industrial specialization.1These papers typically find substantial differences in the spatial distribution of the costs and benefits of trade.We study the causal effect of trade shocks on Chilean local labor markets, exploiting spatial and time variations in trade exposure arising from initial differences inindustryspecialization across geographic locations and the evolution of shocks across industries. Besides considering typical outcomes such as employment, unemployment and wages, we focus on labor informality, a distinctive feature of labor markets in developing countries. We build upon recent research that finds that labor informality is a relevant margin of adjustment to trade shocks.2,3We also explore the impact of trade shocks on tertiary schooling, in line with the literature that finds that trade liberalization amplifies initial differences in regional factor endowments over the long-run through its effects onhuman capital formation.4Our main findings suggest that the costs and benefits of trade shocks depend on the local employment structure and vary considerably across sub-population groups. Locations with greater exposure to increasing import competition from China experienced a relative decline in manufacturing employment and wage losses for unskilled and young workers (mainly, in the service sector). Interestingly, labor informality plays a key role in the responses to trade shocks. In particular, we find that rising import competition implied a significant relative rise in labor informality, mainly among male, young and unskilled workers. On the benefits side, we find that locations specialized in the production and processing of primary products experienced a relative increase in employment, driven by the expansion of Chinese demand for Chilean exports. Employment growth mainly benefited young and male individuals. Interestingly, these areas also experienced a slower increase in tertiary education enrollment rates as compared to areas with less exposure.For identification we exploit two sources of variation: (i) Chinese supply and demand shocks vary over time and across industries; and (ii) Chilean local labor markets (LLMs) exhibit different (pre-shock) patterns of industry specialization. Notably, Chinese demand for Chilean exports was highly skewed towards the mining and manufacturing of basic precious and non-ferrous metals, mainly copper. For its part, Chinese supply shock in Chile was totally focused on manufacturing and, within this sector, was highly heterogeneous across industries.5China’s spectacular growth over the last several decades provides a unique opportunity to measure the causal effect of trade shocks on relevant outcomes. China’s growth was mostly driven by strong investments in infrastructure, increases intotal factor productivity, massive migration from rural to urban regions and an export-oriented strategy that placed China as one of the world’s leading manufacturing producers and the main global consumer of primary products.6The growth in imports and exports driven by China’s economic, political and institutional factors provides a potential exogenous shock to firms and workers from all over the world. The small size, considerabletrade opennessand flexible labor markets of the Chilean economy increase the suitability of this scenario to study the causal impact of trade-induced shocks on local labor market outcomes.Our identification strategy is very close to the shift-share approach proposed byBartik (1991).7We assume that LLMs are units with different exposures to a common set of industry shocks (driven by China’s trade expansion) with local exposure given by initial industrial composition. In the case under study, we construct the pattern of industry specialization using 1992 census data -a date prior to China’s significant expansion in global trade. This takes into account the fact that the shock may have affected Chilean industrial composition, as our estimates indeed suggest. On the supply side, we exploit the sharp increase in Chinese supply of manufactures as a competitive shock for Chilean locations specialized in manufacturing production. On the demand side, we take advantage of the strong expansion in Chinese demand for commodities as a demand shock for Chilean regions specialized in the production and processing of primary products. In order to consider the possible endogeneity of industry shocks, we use China’s global supply and demand shocks as instruments for Chinese import competition and demand for exports. The exogeneity of local employment industrial composition isa priorimore difficult to justify because it assumes that unobserved industry shocks do not affect regional outcomes through the same combination of exposure shares. We conduct several tests to justify this assumption and perform a robustness exercise applying theeconometricframework developed byBorusyak et al. (2020). Under this framework, identification follows from the quasi-random assignment of shocks while exposure shares are allowed to be endogenous. Finally, and importantly, our estimates deliver relative effects across locations but cannot account for the aggregate impact of the shocks, which depend onspilloversacross geographic units and othergeneral equilibriumeffects (e.g. changes in input and output prices, firms productivity, and aggregate demand multiplier effects).8The main dataset used throughout this paper is the Chilean national household survey (Encuesta de Caracterización Socioeconómica Nacional-CASEN) conducted by the Chile’s Ministry of Planning (MIDEPLAN) every two or three years.9We also use information from Chileandemographiccensuses (Censo Nacional de Población y de Vivienda) sourced from the Chile’s National Institute of Statistics (Instituto Nacional de Estadística-INE). To construct measures of Chinese import competition (CIC) and Chinese demand for exports (CDE) at the industry-level we draw on three additional datasets:Encuesta Nacional Industrial Anual-ENIA(INE), Sectoral GDP fromNational Accountselaborated by the Chilean Central Bank (Banco Central de Chile-BCC) and the BACI database (Centre d’Etudes Prospectives et d’Informations Internationales-CEPII).The baseline estimation equation regresses each outcome variable (employment, unemployment and labor informality rates, average wages, hours worked, sectoral employment shares) on the Chinese supply and demand shocks. Since we include LLM and yearfixed effectswe are exploiting within-LLM variation over time. Our preferred specification also controls for preexisting trends. Since CDE and CIC are endogenous because industry shocks affecting the labor market might be correlated with shocks to import demand and export supply, we instrument these variables with China’s average participation in manufacturing imports and in primary-manufacturing exports across all countries in the world except Chile.10The former instrument aims to capture China’s supply-driven shocks as measured by its global average market share within specificmanufacturing industriesover time, and the latter is aimed at capturing China’s demand-driven shocks as measured by its increasing participation in global demand for different products. The results of first-stage regressions show both instruments as having strong predictive power. The identifying assumptions behind this approach are: (i) China’s import and export growth are not driven by Chilean demand and supply industry shocks (which is justified by the fact that Chile is a small economy); (ii) unobserved industry shocks are uncorrelated with LLM outcomes through the same combination of exposure shares than shock measures (which we assess by means of region- and industry-level balance tests); and (iii) trade shocks do not affectlabor mobilityacross LLMs in the short-run. To verify the plausibility of the latter assumption, we study the causal impact of CIC and CDE on migration patterns.Our main finding is that rising import competition led to a deterioration of labor market conditions in the short-run, which mainly affected young and unskilled individuals. These groups experienced a relative decline in manufacturing employment and wages, and a relative increase in labor informality (unregistered jobs with no access to social security). This is consistent with unskilled (mostly young) workers displaced by import competition relocating to new jobs, often in theservice sectorand under conditions of labor informality. Meanwhile, unskilled and older workers that remained employed in manufacturing experienced wage losses and rising rates of informality. Informality allows firms to reducetaxand otherlabor costsat the risk of being caught and forced to pay a fine. Facing stronger competition from imports, some firms may take that risk. Firms may also replace permanent employees with part-time workers andapprentices, and subcontract some production activities with other plants in the informal sector. On the other hand, workers may be more likely to accept an informal labor arrangement in the context of a weaker labor market. Additionally, we find that increasing import competition is associated with a moderate relative increase in the employment rate of young people with some tertiary education which, we argue, might be partially explained by the “added worker effect” hypothesis: as a result of the worsening labor conditions for some members of the household (e.g. old-age workers), secondary workers (e.g. children studying at university or a tertiary institute) may enter the labor market in order to ameliorate negative shocks. In fact, we find that locations facing larger import shocks experienced a relative decline in the fraction of individuals enrolled in tertiary education.On the other hand, the main benefit from trade was a relative increase in employment in locations specialized in the production and processing of primary products, especially among young workers and males (both skilled and unskilled). Our estimates suggest that job opportunities for young individuals in the primary sector took the form of temporary contracts (presumably short-term or apprentices) instead of permanent wage jobs withsocial security contributions. In contrast, old-age workers experienced relative wage gains and reallocation from self-employment towards salaried jobs in the formal sector. Finally, locations favored by the demand shock experienced a lower relative rise in tertiary education enrollment, which may hinder local development through its effects on human capital formation. Overall, our findings reveal considerable heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of the costs and benefits of trade across sub-population groups.Our research contributes to a vast literature that examines the impact of Chinese import competition on domestic workers, firms, and markets. Most papers in this field emphasize the negative effects of Chinese imports on employment and wages, which generally focus on the most vulnerable firms, workers, and in particular occupations.11The deterioration of labor market conditions driven by import competition can lead to worse health outcomes, an increase in crime rates and lower provisions of public goods in affected locations.12On the benefits side, manufacturing productivity may rise in response to import competition through within-firm innovation and input reallocation towards more efficient plants (Bloom, Draca, Van Reenen, 2015,Utar, Torres Ruiz, 2013). Some workers might attempt to return to their education after losing their job to import competition (Utar, 2018) and young individuals may be more willing to finishsecondary education(Greenland and Lopresti, 2016). Generally, consumers gain from trade due to lower prices (Traiberman, 2019; Jaravel and Sager, 2019).Our paper is most closely related to recent works that study the impact of both supply and demand shocks on local labor markets.Dauth, Findeisen, Suedekum, 2014,Dauth, Findeisen, Suedekum, 2017document that regions in Germany specialized in export-oriented industries experienced employment gains that outweighed the employment losses of regions specialized in import-competing industries (but net effects were driven by the rise of Eastern Europe rather than China) and conclude that globalization fostered manufacturing employment in Germany.Egger et al. (2020)document that Turkish regions more exposed to increasing demand for exports from China experienced relative employment gains, while import-competing regions encountered very small effects on the labor market.Costa et al. (2016)suggest that Brazilian regions facing stronger import competition exhibited relative slower growth in manufacturing wages than less exposed areas, while regions specialized in commodities had the benefit of relative wage gains and shifts towards formal employment.We contribute to this literature by providing causal evidence on the heterogeneous effects of trade shocks across sub-population groups by exploiting spatial and time variations in trade exposure across local labor markets in a small and open developing economy. Our results confirm previous findings in the literature and add some novel contributions regarding the roles played by labor informality and labor supply among secondary household members in response to import competition. In particular, we find that the informal sector acts as a buffer against a negative shock on the local labor market, and that secondary workers may enter the labor market to help ameliorate the shock.The rest of the paper is organized as follows.Section 2comments on the recenteconomic historyand reforms of Chile and China and presents a brief theoretical discussion.

"1. IntroductionBeginning in early 2020, the Covid-19 pandemiccc has strongly affected working lives around the world. A large number of studies have tracked the crisis’ initial impact in the US and European countries on employment, hours worked, and income.1Along these dimensions, existinginequalitieswere generally exacerbated early in the crisis, although the degree varied widely across countries. The fact that inequalities went up is not surprising in light of the particularities of this pandemic-induced recession—e.g., social distancing behaviors, non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce the virus’ spread, or the huge increase in working from home. The first months of the pandemic were, however, also characterized by a substantial amount of uncertainty and bysupply chaindisruptions (e.g.Meier and Pinto, 2020). Neither is it well understood how employment, hours, and income developed throughout the first year of the pandemic; nor why variations across countries are so large.We add to this understanding by providing an in-depth analysis of individual labor market trajectories throughout 2020 in the Netherlands, a stereotypical Northwestern European country along many core dimensions.2The Dutch government imposed a lockdown from March to May 2020, which was followed by re-opening most parts of the social and economic life over the summer. A second wave of the pandemic led to another lockdown in autumn and winter. Business closures were accompanied by labor hoarding schemes for the employed and various subsidies for the self-employed. Government restrictions and changes in consumer behavior directly affected firm demand; labor supply may be affected by fear of infection or childcare needs.We make use of customized panel data collected for seven periods during the year 2020 in the LISS panel, a high-quality online survey based on a probability sample of the Dutch population. Doing so allows us to access awealthof background characteristics from prior years in addition to contemporaneous measures of labor market outcomes and potential drivers thereof.We document three stylized facts regarding the trends in employment, hours worked, and household income throughout the year 2020. First, the rates of unemployment and non-employment rose by 1.1 and 1.9 percentage points, respectively, between February and May. The unemployment rate slightly decreased thereafter while the rate of non-employment remained constant. Both of these patterns are consistent with administrative records, highlighting the quality of our data. The decrease in employment relationships is much smaller than in many other countries. For example, the US unemployment rate rose by 10 percentage points andlabor force participationfell by 4 percentage points between February and April (Bick and Blandin, 2020) and in Canada employment fell by about 15 percentage points (Lemieux et al., 2020).Second, working hours declined strongly among those who were working just before the pandemic started to affect labor markets. Considering the extensive and intensive margin jointly, hours had dropped by 15 percent on average by April. They stayed roughly at this level for the rest of 2020—aggregate changes were within the realm of seasonal fluctuations. This pattern is very different when breaking down the evolution of working hours by socioeconomic group, measured by education and personal income. Less educated or low-income individuals reduced working hours roughly twice as much as others. This socioeconomic gradient becomes smaller during the summer when infection rates were low and social-distancing restrictions were more relaxed. Again, these facts are consistent with administrative microdata covering the first half of 2020 (Meekes et al., 2020). The initial impact on aggregate working hours is only about half of whatLemieux et al. (2020)find for Canada, but the heterogeneity in the effect is comparable to their findings. During the second lockdown in December, the gradient becomes steeper again but stays below its spring levels. Throughout the year, the evolution of hours worked from home by socioeconomic group tracks the differential evolution of total hours worked.The third stylized fact is that the distribution of household income hardly changed throughout 2020. Relative to household income in the pre-pandemic months, the median of subsequent changes is zero. This is true across different socioeconomic groups, whether these are measured by education, personal income, or long-run household income. Across these groups, the first and third quartiles of changes in household income are very similar and of limited magnitude. These patterns stand in contrast to the experiences of countries like the UK, where household earnings around the median decreased by 15 percentage points between February and May and poorer households were affected much stronger (Crossley et al., 2021). Their earnings measure includes transfers made through the furloughing scheme; its dynamics should be similar for most parts of the income distribution to our comprehensive measure of income. Similarly, earnings decreased for almost 40 percent of the US population until April (Bick and Blandin, 2020) andvulnerable groupswere hit much more strongly (Fazzari and Needler, 2021). Losses were, however, more than compensated by direct transfers from the unemployment insurance system which had a (temporary) replacement rate above pre-pandemic earnings for the lowest income groups (Cortes, Forsythe, 2020,Ganong, Noel, Vavra, 2020). Other international comparisons are difficult to make due to different conventions of includingtransfer paymentsand different income measures or non-representative sampling. Overall, the picture that emerges is mixed, with some countries experiencing median income losses (e.g., Italy and Spain) and some countries having more stable household income dynamics (Germany, France, and Sweden, see, e.g.,Bounie, Camara, Fize, Galbraith, Landais, Lavest, Pazem, Savatier, 2020,Clark, Ambrosio, Lepinteur). Unlike our results, most countries surveyed in this literature experienced some form of heterogeneity in the income response, either by age or education (see, e.g.,Belot et al. (2020)for China, Japan, Korea, Italy, UK, US;Osterrieder et al. (2021)for Thailand, Malaysia, UK, Italy, Slovenia), but only some countries had regressive effects on the lowest income groups, such as France (Bounie et al., 2020) and Italy (Belot et al., 2020).We then leverage our panel data and the tailor-made questionnaires to examine the drivers of these observed trends. During the initial lockdown, essential worker status and the fraction of work that can be done from home explain most of the socioeconomic gradient in total hours worked.3The two characteristics interact strongly: telecommutability only plays a role for non-essential workers. In September—when infection rates were low and restrictions on social and economic life were few—these pandemic-specific mechanisms do not play a role and there hardly is a socioeconomic gradient in hours worked. Their importance is large again in December, but weaker than in early spring. These patterns suggest that the best way to ameliorate the socioeconomic gradient inherent in the pandemic’s impact on labor markets is to keep infection rates low.Finally, we relate changes in household incometo employment transitionsand hours changes using a set ofquantile regressions. The median change for employees who remain employed throughout the year is very close to zero throughout. The first quartile of changes is between−7 and−13 percent, whereas the third quartile is between 13 and 17 percent. There is no relation with hours worked. By contrast, the first quartile of the distribution of household income innovations is a loss of about one quarter for the self-employed, for those who become unemployed, and for those who drop out of the labor force. The median is clearly negative for the three groups as well. For those who become unemployed, losses at the third quartile are still 14 percent.Compared to other countries, separations to non-employment are very low in the Netherlands. The perfect insurance against changes in hours worked for employees that we just described is very rare. We thus run another set of quantile regressions of household income on employment transitions and whether employers’ took up the wage subsidy scheme (NOW), which required to continue paying the full wage. Across quartiles, employer take-up of policies is unrelated to household income, suggesting that the combination of firing restrictions and large-scale support policies helped insure employees very well against the fallout of the crisis. The self-employed were hit much harder; the first quartile of those who benefited from any program targeting the self-employed saw their households’ income drop by around 70%.The next section describes the setting for our analysis and the data we collected. InSection 3, we distill the stylized facts on the evolution of employment, hours of work, and household income throughout the first year of the pandemic. We examine the drivers of the dynamics in working hours and household income inSection 4before concluding in the last part.",Christian,Hans-Martin,Radost
"1. IntroductionSearch and matching models have become the dominant framework for modeling unemployment. The dynamics of labor market variables emitted from these models depends crucially on assumptions/behavior in the wage negotiation process (e.g.Shimer, 2005,Hall and Milgrom, 2008,Gertler and Trigari, 2009). Using field data to understand wage negotiation behavior is a difficult task as one typically does not have data on many of the relevant variables. Our study takes a canonical search and matching model ofDiamond (1982)to explore in the laboratory how subjects bargain and how wages respond to changes in the market. The model ofDiamond (1982)assumes exogenous matching rate, separation rate, and productivity of a successful match, thus, focusing primarily on wage negotiation in a stochastic matching market.Diamond (1982)on page 218 highlights this fact:“Thus there are no economic decisions to be made (except for the trivial one to produce when able). The model focuses on wage bargains in this setting.”This narrow scope lends itself well to a laboratory test and allows us to better understand wage bargaining behavior in these settings.In this paper, we design an experiment to replicate the theoretical setting ofDiamond (1982)and examine how negotiated wages respond to changes in unemployment insurance and the unemployment rate. Our results suggest that after changes in the unemployment insurance wages move in the predicted direction, but respond by about 40–50% less than predicted. Our results also suggest that wages are unresponsive to changes in unemployment. Further, we find that the rate of failed negotiations is higher in low unemployment settings, suggesting that workers are more willing to walk away from a match when unemployment is low – something that theory says should not occur. In addition to examining the core theoretical predictions of wage formation, we also explore of number of other questions related to the labor literature. In particular, we examine how wages respond to market changes in ongoing vs. new matches (e.g.Bils, 1985,Martins et al., 2012, andGertler et al., 2016). Our results indicate that wages in new matches are more responsive than those in ongoing matches, even though there are no contracts or concerns about workers effort present in the lab. This suggests that goodwill between match partners generates some degree of wage rigidity in our experiments. We also explore how the duration of being unmatched influences wages (see, e.g.,Blanchard and Diamond, 1994,Schmieder et al., 2016, andNekoei and Weber, 2017, among many others). Our results suggest that the duration of unemployment negatively influences wages even though there is no unemployment stigma or changes in worker productivity in the lab. This indicates that reservation wages of subjects in our experiments decline with unemployment duration.Our paper also relates to the large experimental literature on bargaining behavior. We will not dojusticeto this large literature here, but some prominent surveys includeRoth (1995)andCamerer (2011). In particular, our paper is closely related to the literature that examines the effect of bargaining positions on surplus division. Some recent experimental work on this includes (Fischer et al., 2007,Anbarci and Feltovich, 2013, andAnbarci and Feltovich, 2018). The literature finds that payoffs are under-responsive to bargaining position. Much of the set-up of our study is inspired by the results inAnbarci and Feltovich (2018). In particular, they find that surplus splits are more responsive to bargaining position (responsiveness of wages to unemployment insurance in our context) in an unstructuredbargaining gamerelative to a Nash demand game.1In addition, they find that failed negotiations are more common in the Nash demand game. In light of these results, we implement an unstructured bargaining game in our experiments to favor responsiveness in surplus splits. Unstructured bargaining also better represents the informal wage negotiation process common to labor markets. Our experiment differs fromAnbarci and Feltovich (2018)in that, whileAnbarci and Feltovich (2018)implements a one-period game in which all participants are matched every period (no unemployment), we implement a multi-period game in which a successful negotiation leads to a match continuing into the next period, while an unsuccessful negotiation could result in a number of subsequent unmatched periods (unemployment). This allow us to study the effect of the unemployment rate on negotiated wages. Also, the framing in our experiment differs fromAnbarci and Feltovich (2018). Our participants negotiate a wage for the worker while the remainder goes to the firm, a less symmetric framing than inAnbarci and Feltovich, 2018where participants negotiate over splitting the surplus.Holm and Runnemark (2014)report that less symmetric bargaining reduces the pull toward equal splits.There are a number of experiments which investigate wage setting behavior in real effort settings (see, e.g.,Fehr et al., 1993,Fehr and Falk, 1999, andBuchanan and Houser, 2020). They find that concerns about work effort can cause incomplete wage adjustments. Our experiment differs from these in that productivity is exogenously determined, as is assumed in most labor search models. There also a number of experiments that examine job search models (see, e.g.,Cox and Oaxaca, 1989andCox and Oaxaca, 1992). They find that experimental results are mostly in line with the theoretical predictions of search termination and reservation wage. Our experiments differs from these in that the wage distribution is not exogenously given to workers, but rather wages are negotiated between a worker and a firm. In addition, there is no search decision in our experiments and matches are formed with some exogenous probability.Finally, our experiment is complementary to the first chapter ofJoslin (2017)that tests predictions of equilibrium unemployment theory using a novel market entry experiment. He reports that, in line with theoretical predictions,increases in productivitylead to more firms entering the market, decreasing unemployment. He also reports that few firms enter when workers have strongbargaining power, increasing unemployment. There are several important differences betweenJoslin (2017)and our experiment. First, whileJoslin (2017)focuses on firms entry, the number of firms in our experiment is fixed. This allow us to introduce exogenous changes in unemployment holding other factors, like productivity, constant. Second, similarly to other bargaining experiments,Joslin (2017)implements a one-period game, while we implement a dynamic multi-period game. This allow us to study how the threat of being unemployed or vacant in subsequent periods affects negotiated wages, how wages respond in ongoing vs. new matches, and how duration of unemployment influences wages.Our paper followsmacroeconomicexperimental research literature (see a survey byDuffy (2016)). A typical paper in this literature begins from describing a theoretical micro-founded macroeconomic model and its comparative static predictions (Section 2 in our paper). Next, it introduces modifications necessary for implementation in the laboratory and checks if the comparative static prediction still hold in the modified model (ourSection 3). Finally, it conducts the experiment and compares results obtained in the laboratory to the predictions of the model (ourSections 4and 5).",Oleg,David,None
"1. IntroductionOver the last half century family formation and family structures have changed substantially: median age at first marriage or cohabitation has increased; more and more individuals are living alone; first births are postponed; and birth rates have fallen below the replacement rate in manyOECDcountries.2While several papers have provided evidence that these sweeping changes have technological, social and legal roots, with for example the introduction of the birth control pill, changes in abortion laws (e.g., seeGoldin and Katz, 2002andMyers, 2017), or increases in educational attainments (e.g., seeAaronson et al., 2014), there is also evidence that these changes in family structures and family formation are tightly linked to changes in the labor market. Most of this research has focused on the role of increases in womenlabor force participationand decreases in the pool of “marriageable men”.3Much less is known about the consequences of job insecurity for family formation, despite the fact that there has been a large increase in job insecurity in recent decades.4This paper aims at filling this gap by studying whether the type of employment, stable or temporary, affects the timing of cohabitation and fertility. To investigate the differential effects of stable and temporary jobs on family formation, I take advantage of a French survey with detailed information on the dynamics of employment and family formation to estimate a semi-parametric timing-of-events model (Abbring and van den Berg, 2003) exploiting conditional random variation in the timing of first stable and temporary jobs.A large body of research has investigated the links between education and family formation. In particular, several papers have highlighted that increases in compulsory education contributed to delaying first births, especially through decreases in teenage pregnancy (e.g., seeAaronson, Lange, Mazumder, 2014,Black, Devereux, Salvanes, 2008,Monstad, Propper, Salvanes, 2008,Oreopoulos, Salvanes, 2011). Increases in education also contributed to decreasing fertility (e.g., seeCygan-Rehm, Maeder, 2013,Lavy, Zablotsky, 2015,McCrary, Royer, 2011). Overall, increases in educational attainments during the second half of the 20thcentury, especially among women, have delayed family formation and fertility decisions (e.g., seeBrand, Davis, 2011,Rindfuss, Morgan, Offutt, 1996); and delayed family formation and fertility further enabled increases in women’s education (e.g., seeGoldin, 2006). After finishing their education most individuals do not find their first job instantaneously, and over the past decades it has become increasingly difficult for young adults to find a first stable job afterleaving school. In France for example, the unemployment rate has increased by about 30% between 1990 and 2014 for individuals who finished their initial schooling 1 to 4 years earlier. At the same time, for those who found a job, the share of temporary contracts also increased by about 30% (seeINSEE, 2020). Did this increasing duration between the end of schooling and entry into stable employment, due to increases in youth unemployment but also to increases in the share of temporary contracts, also played a role in explaining observed delays in family formation and fertility? This paper aims at shading light on this question by studying whetherentry into employmentimpacts family formation, and whether stable and temporary jobs have different implications for family formation.Theoretically, it is not obvious whether stronger employment protection favors family formation. Temporary contracts stop automatically without any cost after a prespecified period, whereas it is very costly to terminate open-ended contracts. As a consequence, for a given wage, permanent contracts reduce earnings uncertainty compared with temporary contracts. This may impact individuals’ probability of cohabitation and childbearing positively or negatively. On the negative side, as temporary jobs provide lower financial security, banks may be less willing to lend money to workers in temporary jobs compared with workers in permanent jobs. This may restrict temporary workers’ ability to access independent housing. More generally,Santos and Weiss (2016)have developed a theoretical framework where income volatility delays marriage by making consumption commitments (such as children) less desirable. From a risk-sharing perspective however, the relationship between weaker employment protection and family formation may be positive. If individuals decide to engage in cohabiting relationships to insure themselves against income shocks, then we should expect a positive relationship between employment instability and the propensity to start cohabiting.A long-standing strand of research has explored the empirical relationship between economic uncertainty and family formation.5Several papers have highlighted a strong and negative correlation between job insecurity and marriage or cohabitation on the one hand (e.g., seeEkert-Jaffé, Solaz, 2001,Ekert-Jaffé, Solaz, 2002,Kalmijn, 2011,Mira, Ahn, 2001,Rica, Iza, 2005), and between job insecurity and fertility decisions on the other hand (e.g., seeAdsera, 2004,Adsera, 2005,Adsera, 2011,Auer, Danzer, 2016,Pailhé, Solaz, 2012). However, causal evidence on these topics is scarce. Only two papers have provided causal evidence for the negative effect of job insecurity on women’s fertility decisions (Prifti and Vuri, 2013andLopes, 2018). To the best of my knowledge, there is no causal evidence regarding whether permanent and temporary employment have similar implications for the decision to start cohabiting. This paper aims at making progress in this direction. Using detailed information on the work andfamily historyof large representative samples of young French adults, I study whether being permanently employed has a stronger effect on the probability of entering a cohabiting relationship than being in temporary employment. In addition, I analyze whether the relationship between being permanently employed and the decision to start cohabiting may explain the negative effect of job insecurity on fertility decisions. Marriage no longer seems to be a prerequisite for childbirth.6However, most couples wait until they live together to have a first child. In 2015, e.g., about 90% of children from 0 to 2 years old in France were living with both parents.7Therefore, understanding whether and how employment status impacts cohabitation may be important for understanding the negative relationship between job insecurity and fertility decisions.This paper also contributes to the empirical literature on youth unemployment and family formation. This literature has focused mainly on the effect of employment relative to unemployment or inactivity on the decision to start a family and does not distinguish between permanent or temporary job positions.8In particular,Lillard and Waite (2000),Aassve et al. (2006), andNiedergesäss (2013)study the relationship between employment, cohabitation or marriage, and fertility using a methodological framework very similar to mine. These three papers use Lillard’s simultaneous hazard model (Lillard, 1993) and find a positive effect of employment on marriage or cohabitation for men, and a negative effect for women (the exception isAassve et al. (2006)who find a positive effect for both genders). In addition, they find no evidence of a positive or negative effect of marriage (or cohabitation) on employment for men, but they find a negative effect for women. Relative to this literature, the main contribution of my paper is to focus on the differential effect of stable and temporary jobs. The idea that employment protection hindersjob creationand thereby explains high unemployment rates has gained momentum in recent decades. Consequently, several European countries have implemented public policies favoring temporary contracts or weakening the job security associated with open-ended contracts.9The empirical literature studying the consequences of such policies has focused mainly on their direct impact on individuals’ earnings and employment trajectories.10However, it is important to understand whether temporary jobs have similar implications as stable jobs for cohabitation and fertility decisions to grasp the full consequences of public policies favoring more flexible labor markets.It is empirically challenging to assess whether the timing of employment explains the timing of family formation and to estimate the differential impact of stable and temporary jobs. Individuals who find a stable or temporary job sooner are likely to have unobserved characteristics that may also influence the timing of their cohabiting relationship (selection) and the three transitions may impact each other (reverse causality). To overcome these issues and make progress toward identifying causal effects, I use the multivariate mixed proportional hazard rate model ofAbbring and van den Berg (2003). Under the no-anticipation assumption, Abbring and van den Berg show that this empirical model enables to estimate causal effects in a dynamic setting where treatments and outcomes are duration variables, even when their timings are affected by correlated time-constant unobserved characteristics. More recently,Gaure et al. (2007)showed with Monte-Carlo experiments that Abbring and van den Berg empirical approach is able to accurately separate the causal effects of dynamically assigned treatments from sorting effects, and this empirical model has been used in various settings (e.g., seevan den Berg, van der Klaauw, van Ours, 2004,Abbring, Berg, Ours, 2005,van Ours, 2006,Jahn, Rosholm, 2014orMoschion and van Ours, 2019). However, to my knowledge this paper is the first to use this method to estimate the differential effects of stable and temporary jobs on family formation.To disentangle causality from selection, Abbring and van den Berg’s duration model includes potentially correlated unobservable characteristics impacting the timing of the different events of interest, and estimate their joint distribution simultaneously with the parameters of interest. In this setting, identification relies on comparing individuals with similar observed and unobserved characteristics, but different with respect to the timing of their first stable or temporary jobs. Intuitively, the idea is to estimate whether one event systematically occurs shortly after another event no matter when the first event occurs, as selection would imply a strong correlation between both timings but not a quick succession of events (seeAbbring and van den Berg, 2004).The main goal of my empirical analysis is to highlight that stable jobs have different effects than temporary jobs on the likelihood to start a family. In this context, it is key for my estimation strategy that individual do not intensify (with success) their job search differentially between stable and temporary jobs before their first cohabitation, in anticipation of this event. To increase the plausibility of this assumption, I exclude from my empirical analysis individuals who obtained their first jobs in the same year as their first cohabiting relationship. I also present graphical evidence that their is no Ashenfelter’s dip in the probability to enter a first stable or temporary job just before the first cohabiting relationship, which is suggestive that violations of the no-anticipation assumption is not of major concern for my analysis. Lastly, I study whether the estimated effects of stable and temporary jobs vary by educational attainments. As highly educated individuals are more likely to find a first job, especially a first stable job, shortly after intensifying their job search, if the no-anticipation assumption was of concern, we would expect to find stronger effects of first stable jobs on first cohabiting relationships among individuals with higher levels of completed education. My heterogeneity analysis shows opposite results. In this context, even though it is impossible to be 100% sure that the no-anticipation assumption holds, it seems unlikely that violations of this identifying assumption are a major threat for my main findings.My findings provide evidence that job stability has an impact on the probability to start a cohabiting relationship and on the probability to have a first child. First stable jobs multiply men’s and women’s instantaneous probability of entering a first cohabiting relationship by 3.9 and 3.5 times, respectively. By contrast, first temporary jobs multiply women’s instantaneous probability of entering a first cohabiting relationship by 1.1 times only, with no significant impact for men. Being permanently employed also affects the probability of having a first child positively, both indirectly (through its effect on cohabitation) and directly, while being in temporary employment has no direct impact on fertility decisions and a much lower indirect impact. Overall, my results highlight that the decrease in the share of permanent employment among young workers likely explains part of observed delays in family formation in recent decades.Previous studies have shown that job insecurity decreases overall fertility. In particular,Prifti and Vuri (2013)andLopes (2018)show using natural experiments in Italy and Portugal respectively, that job insecurity negatively impacts women’s probability to have a first child. However, the mechanisms through which job insecurity impacts fertility remain unclear. My results therefore complement these findings by providing a likely mechanism: I show that delayed stable employment delays cohabitation, and thereby also delays childbearing, which may result in a lower fertility, especially for women, as women’s chances of having a child decrease with age.11Furthermore, cohabitation is an interesting outcome in and by itself. In recent decades, the proportion of individuals living alone has increased, especially among young adults,12and a few studies have highlighted that living alone is associated with lower levels of happiness (e.g., seeChen, Ours, 2018,Verbakel, 2012). Understanding the determinants of living with a spouse vs. alone therefore seems an important question, and to my knowledge this paper is the first to highlight that entry into employment, and especially into stable employment, increases individuals ability to start a first cohabiting relationship.The paper is organized as follows.Section 2describes the institutional setting, the survey and the main variables of interest.Section 3develops a graphical analysis based on anevent studyto describe how the probability of cohabitation evolves around the timings of the first stable or temporary jobs.Section 4develops the main analysis using Abbring and van den Berg’s timing-of-events methodology.Section 5concludes.",Fanny,None,None
"1. IntroductionThe polarization of the labor market is now a well-documented phenomenon in the US (Autor et al. (2003)Autor et al. (2006)) and Europe (Goos and Manning (2007),Goos et al. (2014),Dustmann et al. (2009)), beginning in the mid-1980s and accelerating in the 1990s. It corresponds to a strong increase in the share of employment in high-paying abstract occupations and low-paying manual occupations, relative to the share of routine occupations in the middle of the wage distribution. Routine occupations are indeed easier to automate using information technologies, as they contain a large share of repetitive tasks. This has led researchers to reconsider the canonical model of skill-biased technological change toward a more subtle understanding of the labor in terms of tasks. Technology can substitute for workers in a subset of tasks (Acemoglu and Autor (2011)). This process has led to a dramatic deterioration of economic opportunities for low-skilled non-college-educated workers and particularly males (seeAcemoglu and Autor (2011),Autor (2019)orVerdugo and Allègre (2020)). First, workers with low ability who lose their relatively well-paid routine occupations tend to reallocate to manual occupations that pay less on average, as they have no comparative advantage in abstract occupations (Cortes (2016)orAutor (2019)). Second, this creates a “displacement effect”, which lowers the demand for this factor and creates downward pressure on wages for both workers in the occupation that disappeared and occupations to which a share of the workers from the middling occupations reallocate. (Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018),Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017)). We argue that, in a context in which labor market institutions do not allow wages to fully adjust, this process could lead to lower employment.Surprisingly, the impact of this process in terms of aggregate employment has received limited attention (with some notable exceptions, however – see the literature review). The conventional wisdom is that this process has limited implications in terms of aggregate labor market performance. The destruction of routine occupations is accompanied by the massive creation of abstract occupations, mainly for high-skilled workers, and manual jobs for low-skilled workers, especially in theservice sectors(Autor and Dorn (2013)).Autor et al. (2015)document an extremely limited impact of technology shocks implying routine job destruction on aggregate employment at the local labor market level in the US. Trade shocks have been argued to be much more costly in terms of aggregate employment (Autor and Dorn (2013)) but seem to be weakly related to polarization (seeGoos et al. (2014)andAutor et al. (2015)). In the context of task-biased technological change,Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017)andAcemoglu and Restrepo (2020)provide a framework in which wages adjust, allowing the lower occupations to absorb the excess labor supply from the occupations (or tasks) that disappeared at the cost of a downward wage adjustment. We argue that the polarization process could have had a very different impact from that in the US in certain European countries, given the higher minimum wage in place in the latter. In a rigid wage environment, wages do not necessarily adjust to clear the labor market, especially in the left tail of the wage distribution, where the minimum wage plays a crucial role in the wage determination process. This may prevent the creation of a sufficient number of low-paying jobs for low-skilled workers, who cannot reallocate to abstract occupations, to compensate for the destruction of routine jobs, which has been observed in every European country. The United States also has a national minimum wage, but relative to the median wage, it is much lower in many European countries. In France, for instance, in which a significant share of workers (approximately 13% in 2019 according toGarnero (2019)) are paid the minimum wage,Catherine et al. (2015)andCahuc and Debonneuil (2004)document a strong deficit in manualjob creationin the service sector relative to the US economy and relate this difference to the high minimum wage. We argue that, in such an environment, the destruction of routine jobs could have severe consequences in terms of aggregate employment, as routine jobs are often occupied by low-skilled workers, who cannot reallocate to abstract, high-paying jobs.In this paper, we use the European UnionLabor Force Survey(EULFS hereafter), which provides detailed information about the economic situation of a sample of workers from 1983 to 2014 at the subnational level (i.e., on local labor markets). The survey contains comprehensive information on occupations, allowing us to measure the polarization process (i.e., the evolution of the proportion of routine jobs) for each area within a country, which we define as a local labor market (Goos and Manning (2007)andGoos et al. (2014)use the same data). The cross-country dimension of the dataset, with important heterogeneity in minimum wage levels, enables us to measure the heterogeneity in the impact of the decrease in routine jobs on employment and participation rates in a particular local labor market within a country, depending on the level of the minimum wage. Retaining only countries with a national legal minimum wage (8 countries from the 15-country sample ofGoos et al. (2014)), we ultimately have a panel of 86 local labor markets within our sample, as defined by the EULFS. There exists considerable heterogeneity in the levels of national minimum wages, ranging from 0.278 to 0.585 as a percentage of the mean wage of full-time workers. This allows us to identify the role of minimum wages in the impact of increasing job market polarization on labor market performance. Our identification relies on two sources of variation. First, we are able to compare the impacts of different degrees of routine job destruction within the same institutional setting. For instance, the local labor markets within a given country have not experienced the same degree of routine job destruction. Second, we are able to compare some local labor markets with roughly similar degrees of routine job destruction located in different countries and subjected to different institutional settings. The EULFS also contains many socioeconomic characteristics that allow us to control for key variables that plausibly affect both the polarization process and the labor market outcome variable that we seek to explain (e.g., age structure, skill supply,industrycomposition). First, usingfixed effects(local labor market and time) regressions in level, i.e. using within local labor markets variations over time, we show that the decrease in the number of routine jobs in a given local labor market has no impact, or a very limited positive one in a local labor market characterized by a low minimum wage, but it is strongly negatively correlated with the employment and participation rates in a local labor market characterized by a strong minimum wage. This outcome is consistent withAutor et al. (2015), who find a very weak effect of polarization on the employment rate for the US economy. This result holds for European countries characterized by a low minimum wage. The very modest increase observed in some specifications is consistent with the results ofVerdugo and Allègre (2020), who show an increase in the participation rate of women associated with the polarization process, which they interpret as an intra-household response to the decreasing economic opportunities of men. For flexible wage labor markets, this effect should translate into an increase in the overall participation rate. For rigid wage labor markets, however, it is likely that the overall decrease in employment opportunities for males translates into a decrease in participation for this category of workers, which could more than compensate for the increase in women’s participation.We then provide more detailed evidence for the mechanisms. Consistent with ournarrative, we show that a high minimum wage is associated with less creation of low-paying manual jobs following a decrease in the proportion of routine jobs, which we interpret as evidence of the mechanism that we have in mind to explain the effect of employment polarization in terms of aggregate labor market performance. Some of the workers who have no comparative advantage in abstract occupations and who suffer from the destruction of their routine jobs are unable to reallocate to manual occupations due to the presence of a high minimum wage that prevents the creation of low-paying occupations. We also include alternative labor market institutions, such as employment protection, and their interactions with the proportion of routine to understand whether the impact of minimum wage does not capture the effects of other labor market institutions, which may be correlated with the minimum wage. We show that labor market institutions are only weakly correlated with the level of the minimum wage in our sample. In addition, we find that, even when not controlling for minimum wage level, labor market institutions do not explain much of the dynamics in terms of employment in a context of routine job destruction.We address the possible endogeneity of the proportion of routine jobs using aninstrumental variable(IV) strategy. Despite our inclusion of numerous fixed effects and other controls, we cannot completely exclude the possibility of reverse causality, although the decrease in routine jobs is generally considered a demand shock (related to technology shocks). We follow the logic of the instrumental strategy ofKarabarbounis and Neiman (2013)and use the shocks in ICT investment prices (from the KLEMS dataset) that occurred in the 1990s and that are recognized in the literature as having been among the major factors responsible for the decrease in the proportion of routine jobs (seeAutor and Dorn (2013)orMichaels et al. (2014)). The massive adoption of computers and IT technologies substitute for workers (mostly low-skilled) in performing routine taskssuch as bookkeeping, clerical work, and repetitive production and monitoring activitieswhich are readily automatized because they follow precise and well-defined procedures. Specifically, to capture the extent to which a local labor market has been affected by a substantial decline in the price of new technology investments, we rely on a Bartik-type instrument and use the initial sector specialization of the local labor market and the initial ICT capital intensity of sectors, under the assumption that sectors (and local labor markets specialized in these sectors) that use ICT more intensively should be more affected by price shocks in ICT. This assumption allows us to construct the degree of exposure of each local labor market to the (exogenous) technological shocks, explaining the decrease in the proportion of routine jobs. These results are qualitatively similar to those obtained with OLS but are larger in magnitude.Our results suggest that the impact of the minimum wage may depend on the economic context and, more particularly, the rates at which routine jobs are destroyed and the labor market is experiencing structural transformation. In such a context, more flexible institutional arrangements, such as minimum wages negotiated at the sector or firm level, could be much more efficient (as in countries such as Germany and Sweden). Another possibility that might lead to efficiency gains in such an environment is to fix the minimum wage at a sub-national level because local labor markets have very different exposures to global technology shocks.We are not the first to question the impact of polarization on aggregate employment and participation rates.Autor et al. (2015)find little evidence that technology shocks that destroy routine jobs have a sizable aggregate impact on employment for the US economy. We show that this conclusion does not necessarily hold in countries with more rigid wages, due to their poor ability to create low-paying jobs. Two papers are very closely related to the mechanisms that we have in mind to explain the potential cost of routine job destruction in term of aggregate employment. First,Bock (2017)uses a calibratedgeneral equilibriummodel and find that labor market polarization, by displacing unskilled workers from routine to manual jobs, could explain the strong decline in employment for this category of workers given its substantiallabor costs. Using a similar calibration strategy,Albertini et al. (2016)compare the labor market performance of two economies with very different institutional settings (France and the US) in a context in which technology shocks destroy routine jobs.Nellas et al. (2011)also used a theoretical model to compare the employment consequences of the destruction of routine jobs between the US and the UK, which have flexible labor markets, and continental European countries. We directly use data at the local labor market level, which allows us to empirically compare the employment response to polarization across different institutional settings.Jaimovich and Siu (2020)show that the process of polarization may have been responsible for the jobless recovery after theGreat Recessionof 2008 in the US, given the acceleration of the destruction of routine jobs during this period, which did not recover following the recession. We focus on the long-term impact of labor market polarization on and the role of labor market institutions in this outcome.Finally, in a very recent paper related to ours,Lordan and Neumark (2018)use the inflows and outflows of employment across the US states and show that workers who have lost their routine jobs are less likely to find a new job in states with a high minimum wage. Our results are in line with their findings, but our paper is distinct from theirs in several respects. First, we focus on aggregate equilibrium labor market performance instead of labor flows. Second, we analyze the effects on both employment and participation rates. Third, using data on European local labor markets allows us to compare very different institutional settings and heterogeneous minimum wage levels and to compare the impacts of very different labor market shocks within the same institutional setting. Finally, we use an IV strategy, which permits a causal interpretation of our results.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We first present the data that we employ throughout the paper and some basic stylized facts. Then, we present our empirical strategy. Finally, we present our results and conclude the paper.",Paul,Elliot,None
"1. IntroductionOver the past few decades, the gender wage gap in industrialized countries has been narrowing and femalelabour force participationhas been steadily increasing. However, this overall trend varies significantly across time and geography (Goldin, 2006,Olivetti, Petrongolo, 2016). Understanding the different labour market outcomes of men and women during economic transformations has important implications for gender equality, yet it is empirically challenging to study this question (Benshaul-Tolonen and Baum, 2019). Ideally, it requires a sizeable and plausibly exogenous change ineconomic conditionsas well as longitudinal data on labour market outcomes over a long time horizon.This article addresses this challenge by exploiting a substantial and persistent sectoral shock, Norway’s first discovery of oil in 1969, to analyse the effects of an economic boom on individual labour market outcomes for men and women. We leverage the unexpected nature of the shock and the spatial variation in the development of oil-relatedindustrieswithin Norway to identify changes in individual income, household income, and labour supply. We also examine key mechanisms behind these changes, taking advantage of detailed individual- and household-level data that allows us to follow Norwegian residents over their life cycle, before and after the local shock. We hypothesize that the effects of the economic boom on the labour market depend on the substitutability of men and women in the sectors involved and on the reallocation of joint labour supply within households. In addition, the short run impacts may not persist in the long run, for instance, due to the greater flexibility to modify lifetime decisions such as full versus part-time employment, education, fertility, andoccupational choices. We test these adjustment channels for different cohorts of the local population.Following the discovery of oil and the subsequent boom, the income trajectories of men and women are starkly different. Our baseline estimates from anevent studyshow that young working-age men earn significantly higher annual income in booming markets, while young working women, surprisingly, experience a significant fall in annual income. These changes persist for the following 20 years. Importantly, prior to the discovery of oil,differences in incomeacross our treated and control regions are small in magnitude and statistically insignificant, indicating that there were no diverging income trajectories pre-boom. This result is robust to a battery of tests with alternative specifications of the spatial treatment units, to different definitions of the dependent variable, and is not driven by migration across different parts of Norway.The fact that the income of women declines at times of great economic prosperity is relevant not only for gender equality broadly, but also for intra-household equality and decision-making. Since a large fraction of men and women makelabour supply decisionsjointly with their partner, we examine our core result not only for individual workers, but also in the context of households. We exploit data on married couples to show that intra-household dynamics are an important factor in explaining the observed decline in income for women. We find that women who are married before the oil shock experience the largest decline in individual income. However, their total household income increases as their husbands earn more. Overall, women’s relative share of household income declines by 6%. It is difficult to evaluate the welfare effects of such a loss because the reallocation of tasks within the household and the higher aggregate income could benefit both spouses. However, women’s lower share of household income is potentially problematic if it reduces theirbargaining power(Basu, 2006), if it influences marital satisfaction and stability (Bertrand et al., 2015), and if genderinequalityor female unemployment are linked to domestic violence (Aizer, 2010,Anderberg, Rainer, Wadsworth, Wilson, 2016,Cools, Kotsadam, 2017).We isolate the key mechanisms that drive the reduction in female income in booming regions. In particular, we show that the local economic shock decreases female labour force participation by almost 30%. This decline is driven by a reduction in full-time employment, while for men there is little adjustment at the intensive margin among those who are already attached to the labour force. We further show that men move into high-paying occupations following the boom, while women do not. Thus, the widening gender gap in income is driven mostly by women dropping out of the labour force or not having access to high-paid jobs, either directly in the oil sector or in related industries benefiting from its economicspillovers. Importantly, women’s income losses do not seem to depend on their educational choices nor the decision to have children.Finally, we extend the analysis to the next generation of workers, who were children at the time of the oil discovery and join the labour force only after the shock. These children are exposed to the economic shock in multiple ways at young ages, for instance through a rise in family income (Løken, 2010,Løken, Mogstad, Wiswall, 2012). We show that the income losses for women progressively disappears for the following cohorts of female workers. The youngest cohort of girls close the pre-existing lifetime income gap with their peers in control regions. In contrast, male lifetime income remains systematically higher for early and later cohorts. These results complement our main findings with an important long-term outlook. Among men and women already in the labour market, the effects of the oil boom are long lasting. Among the following generation of workers, the economic gains persist for men, while the income losses are only present among the first generation of working women.Our study contributes to a growing literature on the spillovers from localized industrial activities that uses within-country studies (Greenstone et al., 2010). In particular, a number of articles exploit the fact thatnatural resourcesoffer a source of exogenous variation in economic conditions that are associated with increases in local economic activity and employment during booms.1Few studies, however, adopt a within-country design to compare local labour outcomes for female and male workers, with evidence on inequalities among workers and within households even scarcer. One exception isAragón et al. (2018), who find that coal mine closures crowded out female employment in manufacturing and services at the district-level, while male employment rose, with persistent effects over two decades.2Our paper expands this prior literature by emphasizing the differential effects of a local economic shock on male and female workers at the individual level and even inside households.Our study also provides new evidence on the long run effects of a resource-driven boom on individual labour market outcomes of men and women. Existing studies, such as the recent literature on fracking in the US, have leveraged an analogous economic boom, but only explore short to medium-run changes in the labour market. These studies find an overall positive impact on wages and other labour market outcomes (Allcott, Keniston, 2018,Bartik, Currie, Greenstone, Knittel, 2019).3A notable exception is the work byJacobsen and Parker (2014), which uses US county-level data from the 1970s and 1980s to show that oil booms have long-term negative consequences in terms of joblessness and income depression when a boomtown experiences a bust. For Norway, a small body of work examines the long run consequences of the oil discovery on individuals, but gender and within-household decision making are rarely considered.4Another contribution of our study is the novel finding that women’s annual income declines and remains depressed following the boom while men’s income soars. This finding is especially surprising since Norway is considered to be one of the most egalitarian countries in the world in terms of gender norms (UNDP, 2019,WEF, 2020). One of the largest shocks studied in this literature is World War II: following manpower mobilization towards one of the most gendered industries, the military, regions with higher mobilization rates experience an increase in female labour supply (Acemoglu et al., 2004).5The effects, however, are long-lasting only for highly educated women who could enter white-collar occupations (Goldin and Olivetti, 2013). The spillovers from these changes inlabour demandare relevant also for the following generations of women (Fernández et al., 2004) and are linked to lower educational attainment and more precocious marriage and fertility choices (Jaworski, 2014). Given that the Norwegian oil boom is a substantial and long-lasting sectoral shock withgeneral equilibriumeffects on other sectors, our findings highlight the importance of the dynamics of women’s income following a positive shock in a male-dominated industry.Finally, our study contributes to the diverse literature on the responsiveness of spousal labour supply in compensating for labour market shocks and the importance of the “added worker effect” (Lundberg, 1985). While most papers find evidence of a household labour supply response following spousal earnings shocks (Autor, Kostøl, Mogstad, Setzler, 2019b,Blundell, Pistaferri, Saporta-Eksten, 2016,Goux, Maurin, Petrongolo, 2014,Stephens Jr., 2002), others find a limited role for spousal adjustments to smooth adverse shocks (Halla et al., 2020). In line with the majority of this literature, our findings point to a significant role for within-household labour supply adjustments in response to local economic shocks. While the Norwegian oil boom occurred at a time of increasing female labour force participation, our findings are informative for understanding gender equality in the presence of economic shocks.The rest of the article is organized as follows.Section 2illustrates the analytical framework we use to formulate our testable hypotheses.Section 3discusses the Norwegian oil discovery.Section 4presents the data and the estimation sample, andSection 5outlines the identification and estimation strategy.Section 6discusses the results and potential mechanisms.Section 7concludes.",Patrick,Chiara,Po
"1. IntroductionOne-third of state and local defined benefit pensions are so financially troubled that government sponsors may soon need to reduce the benefits promised to current employees (Aubry et al., 2018). Until recently, public pension reforms rarely affected current workers, since state constitutions and statutes traditionally entitle future retirees to the pension formula in place on their date of hire (Monahan 2010; andMunnell and Laura, 2012). Cuts for current workers became more common after the 2008 financial crisis, when courts around the country judged that pensions were crowding out vital government services like K-12 education and police protection (Cloud 2011; andMonahan 2017).1Since then, 17 states have reduced the post-retirement cost-of-living adjustments (COLA) earned by current workers, and cuts to promised annuity payments have been successfully legislated in two states and are under discussion in two more (Munnell et al., 2016).2At the same time, public sector employers are scaling back the generosity of their retireehealth insurance(RHI) benefits as they grapple with rising health costs (Lutz and Sheiner 2014; The Pew Charitable Trusts and the McArthur Foundation 2016). Will these cuts to deferred benefits for current state and local government employees encourage workers to leave for the private sector, and what can workers’ response to such cuts teach us about public labor markets generally?This project takes advantage of a 2005 reform to the Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island (ERSRI) that extended the normal retirement age (NRA), reduced the annual pension benefit, and limited post-retirement COLAs for current public school teachers and state government employees. Most teachers and state employees also lost access to subsidized RHI before age 65.3Importantly, the cuts applied only to ERSRI members who had not vested by June 30, 2005 (had fewer than 10 years of government service on that date). Vested ERSRI members and municipal government employees (covered by the Municipal Employees’ Retirement System, MERS) in Rhode Island were unaffected. This sharp difference in the level of benefits, based on tenure at a specific date, permits a triple-differences research design in which non-vested members of ERSRI are compared, before and after the reform, to vested members and to all members of MERS.4Rhode Island is an excellent setting for the analysis for both conceptual andpragmaticreasons. Substantively, it was the first state government to enact major pension cuts for current workers. Practically, data for the analysis was readily available as ERSRI provided comprehensive personnel records of state and local government employees (except police officers and firefighters) between 2003 and 2017. Importantly, the data show that Rhode Island's public workforce seems representative of state and local governments across the country, so that lessons learned might translate to future pension reforms in other settings.5To generalize the findings from Rhode Island's specific reform, the analysis scales the effect of the cut by the present value of benefits lost, arriving at an estimate of the separation response to a dollar change in deferred compensation. Specifically, the scaling procedure calculates “peak benefit wealth” for every employee in the data, which represents the maximum present value of benefits that an employee could earn given his current earnings trajectory.6Although this calculation follows a long literature, the current context requires a methodological innovation: including employer contributions to RHI in the definition of peakwealth.7For each employee, the magnitude of the cut equals the difference between pre-reform peak wealth and post-reform wealth assuming that the employee separates at pre-reform peak tenure.The results show that the reform caused an immediate 2.4-percentage-point increase in the rate of separation, corresponding to a 12% increase in the baseline separation rate. For a typical non-vested member of ERSRI, the reform decreased lifetime expected present value of deferred benefits by 43%.8Hence, the results imply an employer-specific elasticity of labor supply with regard to deferred benefits of 0.28. This elasticity is consistent with a large literature on the wage elasticity of labor supply, but is somewhat higher than the elasticity found by a growing literature on teacher pensions.9Consistent with expectations and past literature, teachers in Rhode Island were less responsive to the benefit cut than other occupations. Whereas general state employees were 4 percentage points more likely to separate due to the pension cut (a 19% increase in the baseline rate), teachers were only 1.7 percentage points more likely to separate (a 9% increase), and the difference between teachers and general state employees is statistically significant. Scaling by dollars of benefits lost permits the analysis to rule out that these differential effects are due to treatment intensity; teachers display an elasticity of separation of 0.22, while other state workers are twice as elastic, at 0.45. This finding implies that teachers’ labor responses to benefit cuts may not generalize to other state and local occupations.These results have broader implications for the competitiveness of public sector labor markets, and can be applied directly in cost-benefit analyses of public pension and RHI reforms.10Broadly, the analysis suggests that the labor market for mid-career public employees not perfectly competitive.11Although state employees were more sensitive to benefit cuts than teachers, the elasticity of separation for all occupations was less than unitary. This result contributes to a growing body of evidence showing that certain labor markets behave as if employers face little competition – such as the markets for minimum-wage workers, nurses, teachers, and software engineers in Silicon Valley – but is also consistent with amonopolymodel where unionized public employees earn economic rents.12Because Rhode Island is a small state embedded in a largerregional labor market, it likely provides an upper bound on the employer-specific elasticity of labor with respect to deferred benefits that other public employers might face. Whereas public employees in larger states may only be able to find substitutable employers by moving large distances (often to another state), many Rhode Island residents already commute to neighboring states for work. Therefore, public employees in Rhode Island can more easily respond to benefit cuts by taking comparable jobs elsewhere.13On the policy side, the results of this paper combined with prior literature on turnover costs imply that Rhode Island's benefit cut caused a one-time increase in direct costs of between $1.8 million and $8.1 million – small in magnitude relative to the pension savings. However, since government salaries did not compensate for lost pension benefits, highly skilled employees – such as teachers, nurses, and lawyers – may have selected out of public service. Hiring workers of similar quality in the future might become more difficult.14How the loss of skilled workers affects government productivity is difficult to quantify, but may prove important.The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. The next section provides an overview of related literature. The third section describes Rhode Island's history of pension reforms and details the natural experiment that occurred in 2005. The fourth section introduces the data and empirical methodology. The fifth section presents empirical results. The final section concludes that governments contemplating pension cuts should be prepared for moderate disruptions to their workforce, underscoring the market power government employers possess, particularly with respect to teachers.",Laura,Gal,None
"1. IntroductionInterest is an important psychological state and a motivational disposition (Renninger and Hidi, 2016: 8). It can “spark and maintain intrinsic motivation” and initiate and maintain engagement (O'Keefe et al., 2017: 49).1In educational psychology, it is well known that interest promotes learning and improvesacademic performance(O'Keefe et al., 2017: 57). In workplace, recent vocational psychology literature shows that vocational interests (the match or “congruence” between individual interest andwork environment, in particular) are positive predictors of task and training performance,organizational citizenship behavior, and job satisfaction, and negative predictors oflabor turnover(Nye et al., 2019). In the Online Appendix B of this paper, I present original empirical evidence of job interestingness being positively associated with job satisfaction, intention to continue working in the current organization, intention to work harder to help the organization succeed, actual working efforts, and mental health (Appendix B1).2It also shows that the predictive power of job interestingness is relatively large.Although job interestingness benefits both workers and firms, the proportion of workers who find their job interesting varies greatly across countries. In particular, Japan is marked with fewer interesting jobs than other high-income countries. Based on the International Social Survey Programe (ISSP) data averaged over 1997, 2005, and 2015, the proportion of workers who agree that their job is interesting is 77.5% in nine high-income countries (H), but only 54.0% in Japan (Fig. 1).3Similarly, the proportion of workers whodisagreethat their job is interesting is higher in Japan (20.3% in Japan vs. 8.6% in H). The average 5-point scale job interestingness score is lower in Japan (3.47 in Japan vs. 3.95 in H). A comparison with all participating countries in each survey wave also reveals that the job interestingness score of Japanese workers is relatively low (Fig. B1).4Download :Download high-res image (492KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1.

Why are there much fewer interesting jobs in Japan compared to H? Given the scarce literature on how interests are developed and promoted in the workplace, this paper first examines the determinants of job interestingness by performing regression-basedinequalitydecomposition (RBID) proposed byFields (2003). Second, this paper aims to answer the second question by utilizing the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition (BOD) technique. The main results of this study are as follows. First, the RBID results show that both interest match and perceived prosocial meaning of the job are among the three most important factors in both H and Japan. Jobautonomyis the second most important factor in H, whereas relatedness (relationship with management and colleagues) is the second or third most important factor in Japan. This implies that the most effective ways to make a job interesting vary across cultures andwork organizations. Second, the BOD results show that lower level of job autonomy is the largest factor explaining the lower job interestingness in Japan compared to H. Given the low predictive power of autonomy in Japan, however, promoting autonomy is a less effective way to enhance job interestingness in Japan compared to improving interest matching, perceived prosocial meaning, and relatedness.This study contributes to the literature in three main ways. First, to my knowledge, this study is the first to empirically examine the determinants of job interestingness. In the field of educational psychology, theoretical and empirical studies on the development and determinants of interests have been developed (Renninger and Hidi, 2011;O'Keefe and Harackiewicz, 2017). In the workplace, similar studies are lacking, although triggering and developing interests are considered crucial for worker performance (Renninger and Hidi 2019a,2019b;Wille and De Fruyt 2019). This is mainly because in the vocational psychology literature, interests (vocational interests) are considered stable individual traits like personality, which do not generally change in the workplace (Renninger and Hidi 2019a).In economics, previous studies show that job interestingness is an important determinant of job satisfaction; the most widely examined subjective well-being measure (Sousa-Poza and Souza-Poza, 2000;Benz and Frey 2008;Krekel et al., 2019; Appendix B1 of the current paper). However, job interestingness is rather subjective than other determinants such as work attributes (e.g., autonomy, relations with colleagues, working conditions such as salary). How to make a job interesting to achieve higher job satisfaction remains unknown and needs to be explored. In this sense, job interestingness can be interpreted as an important mediator of various work attributes to indirectly affect job satisfaction.On the other hand, job interestingness is not just a mediator for job satisfaction but can directly influence various productivity-related outcomes. As Appendix B1 shows, job interestingness is generally the first or second largest predictor for expected worker retention, organizational commitment, actual working efforts, and mental health. Positive effects of job satisfaction on these outcomes are also known (Weiss and Merio, 2015). However, the positive associations between job interestingness and these outcomes generally remain significant even after controlling for job satisfaction and basic worker andjob characteristics(Table B6). This implies that job interestingness is likely to have direct influences besides indirect influences through job satisfaction. Interest in a job can also have positive effects on learning in the workplace. Such learning effects are emphasized in the context of education (Krapp et al., 1992;O'Keefe et al., 2017), but not so when discussing the effects of job satisfaction (Weiss and Merio, 2015). Positive learning effects of job interestingness are valuable for both workers and firms, especially now that continuous lifelong learning has become essential due to rapid technological changes, globalization, and rising life expectancy (OECD, 2021). These unique effects of job interestingness justify the study on its determinants.Second, this study is also the first to focus on the fact that job interestingness in Japan is much lower than in other countries. Since job interestingness enhances worker motivation and task performance, finding the most effective ways to improve job interestingness has a practical implication in the Japanese economy, which has suffered from low labor productivity for several decades.5Japan is also known for its group- and consensus-based decision-making system andcollectivist culture. Consequently, focusing on Japan and comparing it with other countries sheds light on the possibility that effective prescriptions to motivate workers vary across cultures and work organizations.Third, the empirical approach of this study is closely related to the analysis of meaningful work byNikolova and Cnossen (2020). They examine the determinants of meaningful work based on the psychology theory (self-determination theory), decompose the variations in meaningful work into key determinants, and analyze the consequences of work meaningfulness. Their analysis, however, relies only on repeated cross-section data. I also mainly examine repeated cross-section data. However, I also utilize panel data to check the robustness of the main results by controlling for unobservable individual characteristics, such as response bias, personality, and innate ability, and by considering possible reverse causality mechanism. The BOD technique is also often applied in the decomposition studies of job satisfaction (Hauret and Williams, 2017;Benz and Frey, 2008;Zhang et al., 2019). However, no studies examine the reasons for the cross-country differences in job interestingness.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.Section 2summarizes the key elements affecting interests, which are mainly discussed in the psychology literature.Section 3explains the data sources and variables used in the empirical analysis.Section 4quantifies the relative importance of key elements that affect job interestingness.Section 5decomposes “interesting job” gap between H and Japan.Section 6concludes.",Yoko,None,None
"1. IntroductionRecent research has established that teachers matter for student achievements (Rivkin, Hanushek, Kain, 2005,Rothstein, 2010,Chetty, Friedman, Rockoff, 2014,Chetty, Friedman, Rockoff, 2014, etc.). On the basis of this evidence, policy in the US has, sometimes controversially, moved towards hiring and firing teachers on the basis of measurable impacts on student test scores (see for example, discussion inHanushek, 2009,Thomsen, 2014,Rothstein, 2015,Adnot, Dee, Katz, Wyckoff, 2017). Teacher turnover has potential benefits (e.g.James and Wyckoff 2020) because it is the mechanism by which teachers gain a variety of experience, new ideas and talents are brought into schools, and productive teacher-school matches are formed. However, there are also potential costs for students and schools when teachers move: leavers take school-specific knowledge and experience with them, new arrivals may need extra training, they take time to assimilate and gain much needed school-specific human capital, and there are also administrative costs imposed by turnover. The overall presumption amongst policymakers is that teacher turnover has, on average, adverse impacts onstudent performance. Turnover of teachers is also a perennial concern for parents, particularly when it occurs during the period when students are studying for important exams. However, despite the popular importance of this issue, there are relatively very few quality studies that investigate it empirically, the recent exceptions being:Ronfeldt et al. (2013),Hanushek et al. (2016),Atteberry et al. (2017). There are even fewer studies that investigate the potential channels through which turnover may be disruptive or examine organisational responses to mitigate potential negative effects of turnover. The lack of quality data has made the task of investigating turnover and performance in education, and more generally in the public sector, challenging.Our analysis of teacher turnover is based on a unique dataset that links the teacher workforce in England to students’ achievement records, by school and teaching subject categories, over five cohorts. Using these data, we investigate the effects of teacher entry into schools on the final qualifications of students in the subjects taught by those teachers. The paper contributes to the literature in a number of ways: we improve on the rather limited existing international evidence on the causal impact of teacher turnover, investigate potential mechanisms through which turnover can affect student performance, and provide evidence on how schools respond to mitigate the disruption effects of turnover.Our first key finding is that students experiencing high teacher turnover do less well in their end-of-school exams. The effects are small, though non-negligible relative to other factors that have been found to affect student achievement. A 10 percentage points increase in teacher annual entry rate reduces student point scores in theirGCSEexam (the standardized test at the end of secondary school) by around 0.5% of onestandard deviation. Hence, a standard deviation change in entry rate (14%) leads to a standardised effect size of 0.8% of a standard deviation. This result is similar to that found in studies of teacher turnover in the US (e.g.Ronfeldt, Loeb, Wyckoff, 2013,Hanushek, Rivkin, Schiman, 2016). Students in the middle of the ability distribution, proxied by primary school grades, are the ones most affected by turnover.1Examining potential mechanisms through which turnover affects achievement, we show that it is new teachers’ lack of school-specific human capital that matters. General teaching experience does not play a role (in contrast to the findings inHanushek et al. 2016). Other channels, such as changes in teacher quality, or other teacher characteristics, do not seem to play a role either. We also find that schools do respond to mitigate the negative effects of turnover: new teachers, particularly if they are new to the profession, are less likely to teach in high stakes grades. Our main estimates are, thus, a lower bound on the causal impacts of randomly assigning new teachers to students.2The rest of the paper is structured as follows: the next section explains how our paper contributes to the literature on teacher mobility;Section 3outlines our empirical strategy;Section 4describes the education institutional setting in the UK and the dataset;Section 5presents our main regression results, withSection 5.2investigating the robustness of the analysis;Section 5.3presents results on the potential channels that drive the negative impact of turnover and examines the actions schools take to mitigate these disruptive effects;Section 6concludes.",Stephen,Vincenzo,Shqiponja

"1. IntroductionThe phenomenon of workers moving from a poor to a rich economy is a very prevalent one. It may be an internal migration or commuting move or migration across countries.1It is a salient issue, with such migration flows very high on the political agenda in many rich countries. When a worker moves to an economy richer than the home economy, what are the outcomes of the move? There is a view whereby the migrant gains from this move are very large. For example,Kennan (2013)estimates a gain in net income of 125% in a model of migrants from poor countries to rich ones. This view is reinforced by findings in the literature, whereby there are large GDP per capita and wage cross-country differences; see, for example, the review inJones (2016).It is not straightforward, however, to answer the question of the gains and costs of the move to a rich country. The difficulty is related to the need to disentangle the effects of income differences on movers decisions from many other determinants of such mobility. The set of determinants includes geographical distance, socio-demographic factors, including family linkages andsocial networks,credit constraints, welfare benefits, insurance motives, psychological issues, and more. Many estimates in the literature are potentially biased due to substantial mis-specification of the model, when omitting relevant determinants, often because data are unavailable. This paper studies a case that allows to isolate the pure effects of cross-country income differences. The data set consists of repeated cross-sections of aLabor Force Surveyof Palestinian workers who were working in Israel and in the local economy. The survey sampled both movers and stayers within a unified setting.2During most of the 1980s a sizeable fraction of the male labor force from these areas worked in Israel, a far richer economy.3The features of this labor market were such that the other cited determinants of mobility played no role. There existed a situation, whereby a worker could decide to work in a richer economy and place himself there by a daily or weekly commute. Without the confounding factors, the decision to work in the rich economy can be estimated without bias. The data used here engender the following set-up: capital and productivity differences were sufficiently high so as to conform oft-documented rich-poor countries differences, typically not found within a single country. At the same time, the relatively short distances facilitated a low-cost move from the poor to the rich economy.A key rationale underlying the analysis is the distinction between factors external to the worker, such as technology, capital, and institutions, and factors embodied in the worker, such as skills and abilities. Hence, when estimating wage equations so as to infer the gains of the move from a poor to a rich economy, it explicitly address the question of what workers experience in the richer economy (say, higher TFP), what is taken from the poor economy (human capital), and their choices in moving (self-selection).Importantly, it takes into account the fact that movers and stayers are typically constrained in terms of the job tasks offered and the skills required for them. The paper recognizes that workers face job tasks requirements and particular rewards for their skills in performing these tasks. It connects withAutor and Handel (2013), who estimate a similar self-selection model with U.S. job and wage data, and note the issue of skill bundling within tasks. The bundling in the current paper is in terms of location, tasks, and skills. Workers are demanded for a particular task, utilizing a bundle of skills, rewarded in a specific way, in each location.The task perspective is relevant for many cases of foreign minorities in advanced economies. Often, workers belonging to such minorities are demanded to perform low-skill tasks. In a review of migration, productivity, and the labor market,Peri (2016)emphasizes, the importance of recognizing the role of tasks performed by migrants, especially manual tasks. He references studies documenting this widespread phenomenon, showing that employment in manual, low-skill occupations is a salient feature.I use a self-selection model employing two alternative estimation methodologies to examine wage regressions of movers and stayers. I analyze the findings across the two economies both in terms of the mean wage differential and in terms of the distributions involved. My findings offer a new take on the outcomes, as the pure effects ofincome differences inthe choice to move to a rich economy are made up of diverse elements, operating in opposition. Productivity differences in favor of the richer economy, due to differences in TFP and in the stock and quality of physical capital, are sizeable and operate to raise wages. However, lower returns to human capital and lower stocks of human capital for movers, operate tolower wages. The latter is due to negative selection on observables by movers, who are offered low-skill tasks in the rich economy. The latter effect offsets to large extent the former gain, sometimes overturning it. Self-selection on unobservables, however is positive, consistently with the nature of the tasks in question.These findings reveal largegrossdifferences and smallnetmigrant gains, due to the afore-mentioned offset. The findings also imply that the self-selection of movers in terms of skills is not the unique major determinant here, and that the productivity differences involved need to be recognized as playing a big role. Knowing the patterns of self-selection does not suffice to understand the poor to rich economy move.The contribution of this paper may be better understood when noting that the literature often looks at the move from poor to rich economies (i) without disentangling the income differences motive from the other motives, and (ii) anticipating a big productivity gain due to the rich economy having higher TFP and capital. This paper shows that with respect to point (i), there is normally the potential for substantial misspecification and bias, while the unique data set used here eschews such bias. With respect to point (ii), the paper emphasizes the idea that tasks are tied to locations, and so workers choose a location-task-wage ‘pack’ that determines rewards to the skills bundled in the task. The low rewards for tasks offered to movers generate a substantial offset to the productivity gain.The paper proceeds as follows.Section 2offers the background and context in the literature.Section 3presents the model. It elaborates on the role of skills and tasks in the model and highlights the distinction between factors external to the worker and those embodied in the worker.Section 4presents the Palestinian labor market and its key features, justifying the use of various elements in the model, and discusses the data set (with further elaboration in online Appendix A).Section 5presents the two econometric methodologies, with details given in online Appendix B, and discusses why there is no misspecification in the current case.Section 6presents the results andSection 7discusses them, with further analysis in online Appendix C.Section 8concludes.",Eran,None,None
"1. IntroductionHow does the birth of the first child affect a woman’s earnings, as compared to her childless female co-workers? What is the main source of the wage penalty to mothers in the workplace? Is there an association between firms’ child-related leave policies and the motherhood penalty? To answer these questions, this paper exploits a rich 12-year panel of confidential administrative data from a large manufacturing company in France to investigate the parenthood pay gap within the firm.Despite having made significant progress in the labour market, women continue to earn considerably less than men, remain highly underrepresented in the upper part of the earnings distribution and their career develop at a slower pace (Blau and Winkler (2017);Bertrand (2018)). One of the most prominent factors preventing women back is that they continue to bear the brunt of the labour-market costs of non-market work, in particular childcare (Waldfogel (1997);Budig and England (2001);Lundberg and Rose (2000);Miller (2011);Olivetti and Petrongolo (2017);Lundborg et al. (2017)). A large literature showed that most of the career costs of children are due to intermittency or reduced labour supply, i.e. part-time switches, lower investments in skills and human capital depreciation (Angrist and Evans (1998);Altonji and Blank (1999);Albrecht et al. (1999);Bertrand et al. (2010);Adda et al. (2017)). Other works have investigated the role of productivity differences related to workforce commitment and social norms (Azmat and Ferrer (2017);Bertrand et al. (2015)), sorting of workers into differentindustries, occupations and firms (Bayard et al., 2003), differences in bargaining ability (Card et al., 2016), and the long-term effects of childcare duties on mothers’ earnings and career opportunities (Angelov et al. (2016);Lundborg et al. (2017);Kleven et al. (2019b);Kleven et al. (2019a)).A recent stream of research has exploredgender differencesin careers within firms (Bronson and Thoursie (2020);Hotz et al. (2018)). In line with this literature, this paper uses personnel data from a French firm from 2005 to 2016 to provide evidence that thepromotiongap between mothers and their childless female co-workers is the main driver of the motherhood penalty in the workplace. An important limitation of previous works stands in the inability to precisely measure promotions. Focusing on one firm allows us to create reliable criteria to identify vertical moves within the internal hierarchy. Our main contribution stands in the provision of a detailed empirical characterization of the difference between parents’ and non-parents’ career patterns within the firm by clearly identifying both job transitions in the internal career ladder and the change in earnings attached to such transitions.On the one hand, the clear identification of promotions within the firm is our comparative advantage for studying the main mechanism through which the child penalty operates in the workplace. On the other hand, we acknowledge that we are estimating local effects and that our findings are suggestive as far as other similar firms are considered. Our company is very large – it accounted for 61,000 employees in 2016 – has establishments all over the Frenchterritoryand, as we show, its employees do not differ from the average French population. It is also a very attractive firm, which pays higher wages than the average of its sector and, on top of remuneration, provides different welfare-entitlements. In this sense, we believe that a firm perspective can offer an interesting insight on the practices that companies can adopt to mitigate the motherhood penalty. Indeed, very recent works have suggested that public policies, in particular parental leave and child care subsidies, have actually played a limited role in improving mothers’ labour market outcomes (Kleven et al., 2021). Given these findings, new studies are focusing on the role played by individual firms in the provision of extended parental leave and paid family leave (Goldin et al., 2020). We believe that if such practices are not gender-neutral, they can negatively affect mothers’career advancements.To analyze the motherhood penalty in the workplace we develop a difference-in-differences analysis in which we estimate changes in labour market outcomes for employees who experience the birth of the first child as compared to a group of childless co-workers. While trends are similar prior to childbirth, after the transition into motherhood, women’s earnings fall with no evidence of catching-up. Eight years after the birth of the first child, mothers are still earning around10%less than non-mothers. The main source of the motherhood penalty is the gap in promotions. In the year of and in the year immediately following childbirth, mothers’ career advancements drop. Only two years after birth, they start again to make some upward moves within the firm’s hierarchy. However, the wage gains attached to such moves are much lower than those of non-mothers. Mothers end-up in a slower and less steep career path, a “mommy track”, that leads them behind non-mothers in the job ladder and largely decreases their probability to be promoted in a managerial position. The promotion gap also contributes to explain the widening in the performance-related pay, i.e. the pay component related to individual productivity, which share on overall earnings tends to increase with job title. Despite not having a direct measure of workers’ productivity, all our estimates include individualfixed effectsthat allow us to hold constant individual intrinsic productivity. We further investigate the possible role of discrimination and find that the difference in career patterns between mothers and non-mothers is highest in early career, then decreases with tenure. This finding is consistent with statistical discrimination (Altonji and Pierret, 2001).Evidence on the motherhood penalty is common to many countries, despite the wide range of policies and norms (Kleven et al., 2019a). Most of our knowledge comes from the experience of Northern European countries, characterized by both high female employment rates and generous public family policies.Kleven et al. (2019b), using administrative data for Denmark and anevent studymethodology, show that the long-run child penalty in earnings is about 20 percent and that this can explain up to80%of the residual gender pay gap in the country.Angelov et al. (2016)compare the income and wage trajectories of women to those of their male partners before and after parenthood in Sweden. They find that 15 years after the first child was born, the male-female gender gap in income increased by 32 percentage points. Studies on the French population are much more scarce, a gap that we contribute to fill.Wilner (2016)uses matched employer-employee data and estimates a motherhood penalty in hourly wage of around5%for the first child, smaller than our findings of10%1However, due to the sample specific population considered – the sample selected only covers individuals who entered the labour market after 1995, who are on average 26.9 years old – these results are not readily comparable with ours.A more recent literature has moved the analysis of the motherhood penalty to the workplace. This is the stream of research we primarily speak to. In particular, our paper is closely related to the work ofBronson and Thoursie (2020). Studying college-educated Swedish employees from 1985 to 2013 and defining promotions as an employee’s large wage increase relative to his/her co-workers, they find that women’s probability of promotions drops around the timing of childbirth and that this drop accounts for about40%of the gender difference in cumulative promotions by age 45 for individuals who ever have children. However, asBaker and Holmstrom (1995)note, defining promotions as movements from a lower average pay to a higher average pay can be problematic for analyzing the relationship between wages and promotions. Focusing on a single firm further allows us to give a more precise measure of promotions. We characterize both job transitions in the internal career ladder and the change in earnings attached to such transitions. We also explore the motherhood gap in promotions both at the extensive, i.e. the probability of being promoted, and at the intensive margin, i.e. the number of career advancements within the job ladder, conditional on being promoted.Another stream of this literature has focused on the role of workplace characteristics in explaining the divergence in careers of women and men (Nielsen et al. (2004);Felfe (2012);Beblo et al. (2008);Goldin (2014);Cortés and Pan (2019)). Note that since we focus on a single company, our results are not contaminated by different human resource practices across firms, nor by the sorting effect of mothers and non-mothers across firms with different job amenities and pay2Hotz et al. (2018)find that women’s job mobility, relative to that of men, increases with the onset of parenthood. They also find that the income penalty to motherhood declines with improvements with the family friendliness of workplaces, in particular facilitating mothers in working more hours. In this sense, we are able to further suggest how specific firms’ practices related to extended parental leave and paid family leave can influence the motherhood penalty. In particular, we believe that the non-gender-neutrality of some our company’s internal policies, such as guaranteeing extra-weeks of leave or paid child-related leave to mothers only, despite non directly affecting their earnings, influence their managers’ assessment in terms of chances of career advancement. Our findings are consistent withThomas (2020), who shows that, in a world where statistical discrimination exists, extended maternal leave policies exacerbate and widen the motherhood gap in promotions.Evidence on the effects of fatherhood on earnings are more scarce and controversial. The predominant idea is that men gain from fatherhood. According toMillimet (2000), firms are willing to increase fathers’ wages since they assume that men with children are more reliable and less likely to relocate. Fathers are seen as more committed to paid work and advantaged over childless men in several ways, for example being offered higher starting salaries (Correll et al., 2007).Simonsen and Skipper (2008)estimated a4%−6%gain in earnings for fathers in Denmark. Other findings question this view.Cools and Strøm (2016), on a panel of employees over the years1997−2007, found a small wage penalty for men with children in Norway. This penalty was larger for fathers who work full time in the private sector and mostly explained by paternity leave. Instead,Wilner (2016)found that men in France do not receive any premium nor suffer any penalty from fatherhood. These results are in line with our findings: we find no effects of parenthood for male employees.The structure of the paper is as follows. We describe the institutional context and the dataset inSection 2. InSection 3we present our empirical strategy.Section 4shows the main results and explains the underlying mechanisms of the child penalty for mothers. InSection 5we propose a decomposition of this penalty, while inSection 6we perform different robustness checks.Section 7concludes.",Claudio,Dominique,Elena
"1. IntroductionDespite convergence over time, substantial gender earnings and wage gaps persist in most countries. A large portion of the gender earnings and wage gaps has been attributed to the presence of children in the household, e.g.:Bertrand et al. (2010);Chung et al. (2017)andKleven et al. (2019). If the presence of children plays a key role in explaining gender earnings and wage gaps family policies become potentially relevant tools to address them.Parental leave regulations are indeed a central element of family policies in mostOECDcountries. They have expanded over time from narrow maternity leave to broader parental leave entitlements designed to support both working parents. Maternity and paternity leave is available to mothers and fathers, respectively, around the time of child-birth or adoption. Parental leave covers longer employment-protected periods. Parental leave can be either an individual right or a family entitlement. In an attempt to encourage the take-up of parental leave by fathers some countries reserve a portion of the leave to be taken exclusively by fathers. We refer to father-specific leave to encompass the paternity leave and the portion of the parental leave reserved for fathers. We classify the rest as mother-specific leave.1The empirical literature on the effect of parental leave programs on female labour market outcomes is as yet inconclusive. However, leave duration seems to play a key role.Olivetti and Petrongolo (2017)conclude that leave entitlements over a year may be detrimental to female employment.2The evidence on the effects of father-specific leave is scarcer due to their more recent introduction and lower take-up rate.3Despite the public policy debate and the empirical interest on the effects of parental leave programs, there are however surprisingly few theoretical contributions.Bastani et al. (2019)explore the efficiency enhancing role of mandatory parental leaves when workers can be career oriented or family oriented and firms are not allowed to offer differentiated contracts due to anti-discriminationlegislation. They show that, in this context, a mandatory parental leave can be part of the socially optimal policy. In contrast, in a model where social norms concerning childcare activities arise endogenously from the most frequent behavior in the previous generation,Barigozzi et al. (2018)show that parental leave can reduce social welfare.Erosa et al. (2010),Xiao (2020), andDel Rey et al. (2017)explore the effects of parental leave provisions in the presence of search and matching frictions.Erosa et al. (2010)consider three channels for parental leave effects - bargaining, redistribution andjob creation- within a relatively comprehensive model and explore, using simulations, the effects of leave policies on fertility, leave take-up and employment.Xiao (2020)proposes, and estimates using Finnish data, a search model with human capital accumulation, preferences for job amenities, and employer’s statistical discrimination in wage offers and hiring.Del Rey et al. (2017)consider a simpler model that focuses on the job creation channel and explore, analytically and graphically, the effects of leave duration on wages and unemployment. They consider a single type of worker. This could correspond to a benchmark situation in which all workers are identical and treated the same regardless of gender, or alternatively to a situation with segmented markets. In reality, men and women often compete for the same jobs and firms are likely to take this into consideration when assessing the value of posting a vacancy. Leave entitlements targeted at either fathers or mothers are likely to affect both. Indeed, increasing the duration of father-specific leave has been frequently advocated as a labour market gender equalization measure, but there is hardly any theoretical analysis of the possible effects of this policy.In order to explore the effects of parental leave entitlements for mothers and fathers we extend the labour search and matching model inDel Rey et al. (2017)to include two types of worker, males and females, who compete for the same jobs. Each individual can be jobless, working or on parental leave. We also consider endogenous job search intensity and endogenous leave take-up rates. We find that increases in type-specific leave duration have a positive direct effect on leave planning effort and hence take-up rates, and on job search intensity. In the case of job search intensity, however, there is a negative indirect effect throughlower wages. Increases in type-specific leave duration have generally ambiguous effects on effective market tightness and wages. To provide further insights, we first explore the effects of changes in leave duration on equilibrium wages and effective market tightness for given job search intensity and leave take-up rates, and identify analytically the main mechanisms. We then allow search intensity and leave planning effort to vary and resort to simulations to assess the total impact of reducing gender gaps in leave entitlements.We calibrate the model and simulate changes in leave duration for four different countries: France, Italy, Norway and Portugal. These countries display representative patterns in terms of total leave duration available to both parents and distribution of time institutionally allotted to each parent. To facilitate comparisons, we focus on full-rate equivalent weeks awarded to fathers and mothers, i.e. the length of the paid leave in weeks if it were paid at 100% of previous earnings. We simulate four different policy scenarios: 1) a benchmark scenario in which we eliminate the leave awarded to fathers and mothers in order to assess the contribution of parental leave policies to existing gender gaps; 2) an increase of 10 full-rate equivalent weeks of leave awarded to fathers; 3) a decrease of 10 full-rate equivalent weeks of leave awarded to mothers; and 4) a final scenario in which we divide the total full-rate equivalent weeks of leave currently available for both parents equally between mothers and fathers.In the benchmark scenario, in which we eliminate the leave currently awarded to fathers and mothers, we find that gender wage gaps are reduced by 4.5 percentage points (henceforth pp) in Norway (from 12.8% to 8.3%), 1.0 pp in France (from 10.8% to 9.8%), 0.8 pp in Italy (from 5.3% to 4.5%), and 0.7 pp in Portugal (from 12.7% to 12.0%). Female employment rates fall in all four countries because effective separation rates increase when we eliminate job-protected leaves. Still, female job search intensity increases in France, Norway and Portugal following the resulting increase in wages.An increase of 10 full-rate equivalent leave weeks awarded to fathers yields a dramatic percentage increase in male leave take-up rates in the four countries. However, in Italy and France, which start from very low male leave take-up rate levels, the effect on labour market outcomes is very small. In Norway and Portugal, higher male leave take-up rates result in more significant decreases in male wages and increases in effective market tightness. The increase in effective market tightness has a positive, although small, effect on female wages. Despite the direct positive effect of longer leave duration on male job search intensity, male job search intensity decreases in all cases due to a large decrease in male wages.A decrease of 10 full-rate equivalent leave weeks awarded to mothers reduces the gender wage gap in all countries but the effects, although larger, remain small: from 10.8% to 10.2% in France, from 5.3% to 4.9% in Italy, from 12.8% to 11.4% in Norway, and from 12.7% to 11.9% in Portugal.Section 2 provides an overview of parental leave policies in OECD countries, with special focus on our countries of interest.Section 3presents the model.Section 4derives the equilibrium equations.Section 5analyses the effect of increasing type-specific leave duration in the benchmark case with exogenous job search intensity and leave take-up rates.Section 6includes the calibration and simulation results, andSection 7concludes.",Elena,Maria,Jose
"1. IntroductionAn extensive and longstanding literature on the effects of children on household behavior emphasizes their costs in terms of maternal time inputs. Empirical research from high-income countries fuels this by exclusively finding a negative causal relationship between family size and maternal labor supply.1Hence, economists often hypothesize that having more children, especially young ones, clearly decreases the time mothers spend in the labor market. However, from a theoretical point of view, the sign of the relationship between family size and maternal labor supply is ambiguous. Under reasonable assumptions, a woman is predicted to decrease her leisure time after increasing her fertility. However, some women will increase labor supply and focus on monetary investments while others will reduce labor supply and focus on time investments in order to increase child quality. Besides the monetary inputs in child quality, there are recurring costs of children that do not vary with the mother's hours of work. These fixed costs decrease available income for other consumption, which makes increases in labor supply more valuable by increasing the marginal utility of income.2This paper provides new insights about the effect of fertility on maternal labor supply in a setting with a low level of average householdwealth, informal child care provision within extended households, and a high prevalence of informal work. These are all conditions that are typically more prevalent in middle- and low-income countries than in high-income countries; all playing a potentially interesting role in the relationship between fertility and maternal employment. First, low income implies that households already have a high marginal utility of income. Budgetary consequences of children might be more severe in these households and they can have a larger impact on the mother’s propensity to take up employment in order to provide for additional resources. Second, if there are other household members who provide some child care, this will lower the return to maternal time relative to monetary investments into the children. Hence, they increase the incentives to augment labor supply and focus on monetary inputs. Third, the informal labor market might provide preferable employment opportunities to mothers: informal employment might be easier to arrange with child care schedules, which are often half-day, it might provide the possibility to take care of the children while working, and fixed costs of work might be lower in informal than in formal employment.In order to establish a causal link between the two variables, aninstrumental variableapproach exploiting parental preferences for mixed-sex siblings, as outlined inAngrist and Evans (1998), is used. My empirical analysis uses data on a sample of about 500,000 Mexican women. The setting provides two attractive features. First, Mexican census data from 2010 allows for observing detailed labor market outcomes in both the informal and formal sectors as well as for identifying the complex household constellations for a large sample of mothers. Second, Mexican parents show a preference for a mixed-sex sibling composition of their children while at the same time there are no strong preferences and discriminatory practices toward one sex.My results confirm the presence of mixed-sex sibling preferences: Families with two children of the same sex are more likely to have another child compared to those with children of different sexes. Taking into account the potential endogeneity of fertility with the proposed instrumental strategy, I can reject negative effects on employment at the 10 percent significance level and rule out moderate employment decreases due to an increase in family size at the 5 percent significance level, such as decreases of more than 2.1 percentage points. Employment in the informal sector increases by 4.3 percentage points when fertility increases beyond two children. This effect is statistically significant at the 10 percent level and corresponds to a 17 percent increase relative to the average employment level in the sample. With 95 percent confidence, I can rule out decreases in informal employment of more than 0.8 percentage points. There is no effect on employment in the formal sector. This is in line with suggestive evidence that informal jobs provide greater flexibility to care for children compared to formal jobs for women in my sample. I further show that having more than two children increases the probability of living with the maternal grandmother who might provide childcare. Moreover, I find suggestive evidence that the positive employment effect is mainly driven by women who live in households with relatively low household wealth, which have a particularly high utility value for labor income as family size increases. Fathers do not change their employment status or working hours in response to an increase in family size. One potential explanation for the differential effect of family size on mothers and fathers is that the labor market environment was more favorable for women around the time of theGreat Recessionand, hence, women were increasingly responsible for the provision of financial resources to the family.In contrast with findings for other settings, in particular with those for high-income countries, I do not find evidence for negative employment effects of an increase in family size. This raises a number of questions: Can potential violations of the identification assumptions challenge the findings? Are there heterogeneous effects across the working hours distribution for the group of compliers? And what can be learned from the estimated effects that pertain to the group of compliers, i.e., mothers who had more children than they otherwise would have due to the sex composition of their first two children? I provide several pieces of evidence in order to shed light on these questions.First, I carefully assess the concerns that are discussed with respect to the internal validity of the instrument (for example,Wolpin and Rosenzweig, 2000andLee (2008)) using several additional data sources. None point to a violation of the identification assumptions. In addition, I take advantage of a formal test procedure for the validity of the identification assumptions proposed byHuber and Mellace (2015). Applying this test, I cannot reject the null hypothesis that the identification assumptions are valid. Second, I estimate local quantiletreatment effectswhich correspond to the effects of having more than two children on the maternal working hours distribution of the complier subpopulation. My findings suggest that fertility increases maternal labor supply in the formal sector at the intensive margin by shifting a few quantiles from around 20 to 40 hours, while mainly having an impact at the extensive margin in the informal sector. Third, I assess the question of generalizability beyond the group of mothers who comply with the instrument. The proportion of compliers is estimated to be around three to four percent and compliers are, on average, different from otherpopulation groupsboth in terms of their observable characteristics and potential labor market outcomes. This challenges the one-to-one transferability of this local effect to a broad group of women. However, by imposing further assumptions, I can bound the effect of having more than two children on the propensity to be informally employed to be non-negative for all mothers in the sample based on approaches byBrinch, Mogstad, and Wiswall (2017)andKowalski (2021a).My paper is primarily related to the large literature on the relationship between fertility and female labor supply. As illustrated in Online Appendix Table A1, there are numerous studies on high-income countries that unambiguously find a negative effect of an exogenous increase in family size on maternal labor supply at the extensive margin.3In contrast, Online Appendix Table A2 indicates that the few studies examining this relationship in middle- and low-income countries find mixed results.4Agüero, Marks, 2008,Agüero, Marks, 2011find close to zero and insignificant effects of different fertility measures on the decision to work in a pooled sample of middle- and low-income countries.Cáceres-Delpiano (2012)finds a significant negative effect on the probability of working when increasing fertility beyond one child, but no significant effect when moving beyond two.Cruces and Galiani (2007)andHeath (2017)find significant negative effects of having more than two children and of the number of children, respectively, on the probability to work. I contribute to this literature by providing evidence that mothers do not necessarily decrease their employment when having a larger family and by identifying multiple mechanisms that can explain the difference in the results between high- and lower-income countries, for example, low wealth and informal care provision by other family members.5,6In addition to the effect on maternal employment, there are other dimensions of maternal labor supply that are important to consider. First, I go beyond the effect at the extensive margin of maternal labor supply and investigate how the working hours distribution of compliers changes with children. Among the studies of middle- and low-income countries in Online Appendix Table A2, onlyHeath (2017)investigates the intensive margin of labor supply and finds a positive effect of having children on self-employment conditional on employment.7Second, I illustrate that informal compared to formal labor arrangements appear to provide more job flexibility at the cost oflower wages. Distinguishing between the two, I show that women increase employment in informal jobs when having more children.8,9Most of the studies listed in Online Appendix Tables A1 and A2 rely on an IV strategy that is applied in a specific context. Still, the local nature of the estimated local average treatment effects is rarely discussed, despite its importance for interpretation and the derived policy implications. One exception isBisbee, Dehejia, Pop-Eleches, and Samii (2017), who apply the samesex-instrument across a large number of countries and time periods and provide an approach to extrapolate the complier-specific local average treatment effectacross different contexts. In contrast, my paper zooms in and investigates the potential to extrapolate the local treatment effect for compliers to a broad group of womenwithin a context. Hence, the two studies are highly complementary in the discussion about the local nature of average treatment effects that are estimated using the instrument in a specific context.The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows:Section 2provides background information on households and several aspects of the labor market in Mexico. This information is helpful for putting the results into perspective. InSection 3, I describe the data and the construction of the sample. In particular, I provide details on informal employment in the Mexican setting.Section 4explains the empirical strategy and assesses the underlying identification assumptions.Section 5presents my findings on the relationship between family size and parental labor market outcomes. InSection 6, I provide some evidence on potential mechanisms behind my findings. The extrapolation of the effects for compliers to non-compliers within the sample is discussed inSection 7. The final section offers some concluding remarks.",Julia,None,None
"1. IntroductionBetween 2010 and 2020, women born in the UK in the 1950s have been affected by several reforms of the state pension age (SPA), resulting in increases of up to six years. Partly because of lack of effective communication, a large proportion of these women were not aware of the changes, thus leading to public discontent, campaigning and several parliamentary discussions (Thurley and McInnes, 2020)The overall effects of pension reforms are complex but are often analysed only partially. In their report to the European Commission,Bettio et al. (2013)remarked that gender imbalance in pensions is affected by three separate sets of factors. The first is ageing: women have higher life expectancy than men and their past employment patterns typically differ substantially to those of men both in participation and remuneration (Costa Dias et al., 2016); in addition, the effect of family arrangements are also asymmetrically distributed as evidence on the child wage penalty indicates (Kleven et al., 2019). The second factor is past pension reforms and particularly the asymmetric effects occurring from the privatisation of risk that has accompanied the shift from entitlement-based to benefit-based pensions. The third factor is the effect of short-term pressures connected to the different responses of women and men to labour market changes and economic crisis. In addition to reduced working lives due to caring responsibilities, pay and career gaps, women also make up the majority of those giving and receiving late life care (McKenna, 2017). The pension gap can thus be seen as the cumulative outcome of genderinequalitiesaccumulated over the life course that determine women's lower pensions entitlements (Arcanjo, 2019;Burkevica et al., 2015;Tinios et al., 2015).Using changes in the UK SPA as a natural experiment, in this paper we concentrate on the effects that waiting longer than anticipated to reach SPA has on labour market participation, mental health andlife satisfactionof women affected by the reform. To our knowledge, the effect on mental health and life satisfaction has not been analysed before. In addition, we investigate time use changes, income and financialwellbeingas possible mechanisms that affect wellbeing. Not only we analyse the effect on women, but also investigate spill-over effects on their partners which to our knowledge have rarely been considered in the large literature on gender impacts of pension reforms. Finally, we also provide novel evidence on the heterogeneity of the effects by showing that changes in the SPA have larger negative effects on women who already are more vulnerable to low income andpoverty.Ours is the first comprehensive analysis of the direct and indirect effects that the changes in the SPA in the UK had on cohorts of women born in the 1950s.Cribb et al. (2016)andCribb and Emmerson (2019)have analysed the impact of the change in the SPA on employment, income, poverty and deprivation using either cross-section or a very short panel of 5 quarters, focussing only on the first part of the reform By analysing the impact of the full reform that ended up equalising the SPA between men and women and by using an eight-year long panel data we control better for various confounding factors and are able to identify heterogeneous effects across groups of women by level of education, partnership status and phase of the reform. With the additional investigation of spill-over effects on partners, we provide important information for the design of future reforms wishing to redress gender inequality in later life.",Marina,Simonetta,None
"1. IntroductionIncome inequalityin mostOECDcountries has increased almost uninterruptedly since the mid-1980s (OECD, 2014). While capital incomes were the main driver ofinequalityin the US and Europe at the beginning of the 20th century,Piketty and Saez (2014)show that the recent increase is mainly due to rising inequality in labor incomes.1But while there seems to be a consensus on the descriptive facts, there still remains a vigorous debate over the drivers of increasing inequality (see e.g. the comprehensive survey inAcemoglu and Autor, 2011).In this paper, we study how shifts in the supply of skills in Germany can help explain the evolution of wage differentials between differentdemographicgroups defined by education and age. Contrary to much of the literature that has focused on aggregate skill premiums, we pay particular attention to heterogeneity across different age groups.Fig. 1documents this heterogeneity, showing the evolution of skill premiums in Germany between 1980 and 2008 separately for young and old workers, where young workers are defined as individuals aged 21 to 30 and old workers as individuals aged 31 to 60. In the top left panel, we plot the medium-to-low skill premiums, where the low-skilled are individuals with missing or at mostlower secondary educationand the medium-skilled individuals with anapprenticeship, vocational training and/or high school degree. While the premium for old medium-skilled workers remained relatively flat over the time period considered, the premium of young medium-skilled workers more than doubled, from 11 log points in the mid 1980s to 25 log points in the 2000s.2The development of the high-to-medium skill premium is depicted in the bottom left panel ofFig. 1, where the high-skilled are defined as individuals with a college degree. While the college premium of young high-skilled workers fluctuated around a value of 33 log points, the premium of old workers followed a mild U-shaped pattern, starting from 52 log points in 1980, passing through a low of 47 log points during the 1990s, and then increasing again to 51 log points in 2008.3Download :Download high-res image (326KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. Skill Premiums and Relative Supplies.Notes: This figure plots on the left hand side the difference in composition constant mean log earnings between medium- and low-skilled workers (upper left) and high- and medium-skilled workers (bottom left) who work full-time, live in West-Germany and have not moved from East to West-Germany, separately for the young and old between 1980-2008. The right hand side depicts the corresponding difference in log supplies in efficiency units of all workers in West-Germany including full-time, part-time and vocational training spells but excluding marginal part-time spells. For more details on the construction of the skill premiums and efficiency supplies, seeSection 3.3and AppendicesA.4andA.5.The distinct dynamics of age-specific skill premiums shown inFig. 1, especially those between medium- and low-skilled workers, are striking and have largely gone unnoticed in the literature so far.4Our core hypothesis is that these changes in relative wages are largely driven by changes in the supplies of different skill groups in conjunction with secular increases in the demand for skilled workers. To provide some first supporting evidence, the right column ofFig. 1plots the relative supplies of medium-to-low skilled and high-to-medium skilled labor, separately for young and old workers. Focusing on the top panel, we see that the relative supply of old medium-skilled workers increased in an almost linear fashion, similar to the relative supply of old high-skilled workers shown in the panel below. In contrast, the relative supply of young medium-skilled workers increased steadily up until the mid-1990s but then started to decline again over the following decade. This trend reversal closely mirrors the corresponding skill premium dynamics, pointing towards an important role for labor supply in determining skill premiums and wage inequality in Germany.Fig. 2corroborates this point, plotting the medium-to-low and high-to-medium skill premiums of both young and old workers against their respective relative supplies, both linearly detrended to absorb, for instance, the impacts of secular skill-biased technological change. Except for the young high-skilled5, there is a clear negative relationship despite the many rigidities governing the German labor market.Download :Download high-res image (358KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 2. Scatter Plots Premiums vs. Relative Supplies (1980-2008).Notes: This figure plots skill premiums against their relative efficiency supplies, separately for young and old workers. Each circle represents a specific year. All variables are linearly detrended over the period 1980-2008. For more details on the construction of the skill premiums and efficiency supplies, seeSection 3.3and AppendicesA.4andA.5.To test our hypothesis more rigorously, we set up an analytical production function framework in which increases in the relative supply of more skilled workers and skill-biased technological change work in opposite directions in determining wage premiums. Building on previous work byCard and Lemieux (2001), we distinguish between three different education-based skill groups and between young and old workers, emphasizing the role played by imperfect substitutability across age groups and changes in educational attainment across cohorts. Using high quality administrative data for Germany covering the period 1980-2008, we show that our proposed framework is able to account for the differential patterns in observed skill premiums very well, especially for the medium-to-low skill premium. Methodologically, we contribute to the literature by estimating standard errors in a more sophisticated way, accounting for the uncertainty induced by generated regressors and the serial and cross-equation correlation of the key variables involved using a moving block bootstrap approach (Kunsch, 1989). As it turns out, standard errors based on this method are up to five times larger than those based on conventional methods.After having established a close link between the supply and price of skills, in the second part of the paper, we trace the precise origin of the observed shifts in relative skill supplies. Using data from the Germanmicrocensus, we document the long-term trends in educational attainment across cohorts born between 1950 and 1981. We show that after the fertility decline starting in 1965, there was a pronounced trend break in the educational attainment of the native West German population, with the shares of high- and low-skilled natives relatively increasing and the share of medium-skilled natives decreasing markedly. Apart from a recent study byAntonczyk et al. (2018), who provide a detailed comparative analysis of wage inequality in the US and Germany, this observation has gained little attention in the literature. We also show that low-skilled immigration, a possible alternative explanation put forward in the literature (Dustmann et al., 2009) only plays a secondary role in explaining the rising medium-to-low skill premium after 1990.In focusing on heterogeneity across age groups, our paper provides a more nuanced view of the main changes in wage inequality in Germany relative to the existing literature. Consistent with the findings ofCard and Lemieux (2001), we find strong evidence for imperfect substitutability between different age groups, suggesting that an exclusive focus on aggregate skill premiums, as is common in much of the literature, may miss an important part of the underlying heterogeneity of a country’s wage structure. Our empirical results are informative for policy makers who have an interest in identifying those subgroups of the population that are most affected by changing fundamentals in the labor market. The key finding that changes in skill premiums are largely driven by changes in relative supply is particularly meaningful since future changes in age- and skill-specific supplies are relatively easy to project based on available demographic andschool enrolmentdata, thus allowing tentative predictions about future changes in wage inequality.Our modelling approach is closely linked to a literature which started with the seminal paper byKatz and Murphy (1992)who use a CES-production function framework to systematically link supply and demand factors to wage premiums. In introducing imperfect substitutability between young and old workers, we build on work byCard and Lemieux (2001)who study the evolution of wage inequality across skill and age groups in the US, Canada and the UK. Our analysis also relates to a range of studies that have used German administrative data to study the rise in German wage inequality. Most closely related is the work byDustmann et al. (2009)who document trends in German wage inequality and perform an extensive analysis of competing explanations, identifying compositional changes (DiNardo et al., 1996), a decline in unionization (Antonczyk, Fitzenberger, Sommerfeld, 2010,Biewen, Seckler, 2019), skill-biased demand shifts favoring the high-skilled, polarization (Goos, Manning, 2007,Autor, Katz, Kearney, 2009,Autor, Dorn, 2014) and changes in the supply of skills (Goldin and Katz, 2009) as key contributors. Contrary to our work,Dustmann et al. (2009)do not allow for imperfect substitutability between young and old workers and focus exclusively on changes in the aggregate medium-to-low and high-to-medium skill premiums. However, as shown inFig. 1, wage inequality does not change uniformly for young and old workers. Our findings therefore complement and extend their more aggregate analysis.Similar to this paper,Boockmann and Steiner (2006),Reinhold and Thomsen (2017), andAntonczyk et al. (2018)emphasize the role of cohort effects as important drivers of lower-end wage inequality in Germany and show various pieces of descriptive evidence that are consistent with our findings.Card et al. (2013)identify an increasing dispersion in person- and establishment-specific wage premiums as well as increasing assortative matching as key factors behind rising wage inequality in Germany.Goldschmidt and Schmieder (2017), in turn, focus on the role of domestic outsourcing, calculating that it contributed some 10% to the increase in German wage inequality since the 1980s. Finally,Burda and Seele (2016)document a strong negative correlation between changes in relative labor supply across demographic subgroups (defined by gender, age and geographical region) and changes in these groups’ relative wages following the German Hartz reforms in 2003-2005, suggesting, in line with our findings, that labor supply factors are an important driver of rising German wage inequality.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we present our model framework relating relative labor supplies to skill premiums. InSection 3, we describe our data set, explain the construction of our key variables, and present graphical evidence on the evolution of skill premiums and efficiency supplies for young and old workers. These are the patterns we aim to explain inSection 4, where we estimate the key structural parameters of our model. InSection 5, we present ourcohort analysis, studying the long-term trends in educational attainment in Germany.Section 6concludes the paper.",Albrecht,Daniel,None
"1. IntroductionIn recent years, many developed countries have reformed their pension systems to address the rising fiscal costs ofpopulation aging. A key element in many of these reforms has been to encourage senior workers to postpone retirement. One strategy for promoting higher labor supply among the elderly is to remove the earnings test on pension income, such that workers above the threshold age for (early) retirement maintain strong incentives to work. This also removes an important source of economic inefficiency, as the retirement earnings test widens the wedge between employers’ wage costs and workers’ net pay considerably, discouraging work even when its social value by far exceeds the private value of the forgone leisure. However, the fact that not all workers have equal opportunities for extending their careers, e.g. due to poor health, outdated skills, or arduous work, has raised concerns about the distributional consequences of such policies.Many countries still have earnings tests in various forms for individuals who retire before the statutory retirement age, including Germany, France, Belgium, Austria, and USA (see, e.g.OECD (2017, Table 2.A2.1) andBörsch-Supan et al. (2018, (Table 1) for recent overviews). In the present paper, we examine to what extent removing a retirement earnings test (RET) and introducing actuarial neutrality in the pension system represent a tradeoff between equity and efficiency. We exploit a Norwegian pension reform implemented in 2011, which for a large group of workers transformed an earnings-tested early retirement program into an unconditional life-long pension annuity that could be claimed on actuarially neutral terms by every eligible worker from the age of 62, regardless of own labor earnings. The reform implied that pension entitlements previously reserved for those who actually left the labor market were distributed among all workers. As a result, thelifetime valueof the new unconditional early retirement pension was reduced for workers who retired at the earliest possible occasion. For those who continued working into the early retirement period, the pension was increased.Several studies have investigated thelabor supply effectsof policies relating to a retirement earnings test (RET). In general, the literature separates between two types of RETs, depending on deferral options. When deferral is possible on actuarially neutral terms, the earnings test is in some sense superficial, and, for a rational forward-looking agent, work incentives are largely unaffected. RET reforms of such schemes have been evaluated in both the US (Friedberg, 2000;Song and Manchester, 2007;Haidar and Loughran, 2008;Engelhardt and Kumar, 2009) and in the UK (Disney and Smith, 2002). To the extent that these studies find positive labor supply effects of the RET removal (e.g.,Friedberg, 2000, andEngelhardt and Kumar, 2009), this is likely to reflect risk-aversion, shortsightedness, or simply failure to understand that withheld benefits are not lost, but just paid out later on (Brown et al., 2013;Rabinovich and Perez-Arce, 2019).When deferral is not an option, the effect on work incentives is obvious: Any postponement of retirement reduces the lifetime pension entitlement.Baker and Benjamin (1999)evaluate a sequential elimination of such a “real” RET in Canada in the 1970s and estimate a 10 percentage points increase in full year work among 65–69 year olds.Brinch et al. (2017)use a difference-in-differences approach to study the effects of a stepwise real RET-removal in Norway during 2008–10 on the earnings of 67-year-old men. They find a sizeable positive earnings effect for workers who are still active at age 66. The pension reform examined in the present paper has also previously been evaluated in this context, disclosing a substantial overall labor supply effect (Brinch et al., 2015;Hernæs et al., 2016).In summary, the existing empirical evidence suggests that abolishing (real) earnings tests onpension paymentsis an effective strategy for increasing labor supply among seniors. However, so far the distributional consequences of RET policies have received less attention. One notable exception isBönke et al. (2018), who investigate the distributional effects of the introduction of an actuarial deferral option in the German early retirement system in 1992, which essentially removed a real RET. Their findings indicate large positive labor supply responses, at the cost of increasedinequality. Another exception isHernæs and Jia (2013), who investigate the distributional effects of a stepwise increase in the earnings threshold for RET in Norway in 2002 (applying at age 67–69). They find a positive labor supply effect at the intensive margin, driven by those who were still active at the age of 66 and had earnings around the thresholds. Since these thresholds were quite low, work incentives were primarily improved at low earnings, and, as a result, the reform led to a decrease in old-age earnings inequality. There is also a small related literature examining the distributional consequences of raising the early retirement age (Cribb and Emmerson, 2019;Morris, 2019;Geyer et al., 2020).A priori, it is not clear how the labor supply responses to the RET removal affects the overall old-age labor earnings distribution. On the one hand, effects at the extensive margin should reduce overallincome inequality, since richer people tend to work regardless of RET, and hence have less scope for increasing their labor supply. On the other hand, it has been argued that manyelderly workerswith physically demanding and poorly paid jobs do not really have the option of extending their career much beyond the early retirement age. These “worn-out workers” will thus become the losers in a regime where annual pensions are tightly attached to the age of actual retirement. Moreover, as pointed out byEtgeton (2018), employees with low education andlow payare generally those who are most exposed to involuntary job loss and therefore have less possibilities to adjust the timing of retirement in accordance with own preferences.Our empirical analysis builds on complete administrative data, covering the entire Norwegian population, with employer information and individual earnings trajectories from 1967 onwards. The data allow us to single out the group of private sector workers that was exposed to the removal of the earnings test (approximately 23% of the active workforce). Our primary empirical strategy is to compare the last two birth cohorts (1946–47) that were subjected to a real retirement earnings test with the first two cohorts (1949–50) that were exposed to a fully actuarially neutral pension system with no earnings test. The data allow us to compute virtually complete lifetime earnings histories for all these cohorts. We show that while the distribution of prime-age earnings – defined as average annual earnings over the 40-year period from age 21 to 60 – is almost identical for the pre- and post-reform cohorts, their earnings paths after the early retirement age (62 years) diverge considerably. Our analysis confirms the findings ofHernæs et al. (2016)of large average labor supply effects at age 63 and 64, and we are able to show that these effects remain strong at ages 65–67, and even stretch beyond statutory retirement to age 68 at which point work incentives were unaffected by the reform.We carry out a novel empirical analysis in three parts. First, we explore how the labor supply responses vary across the prime-age earnings distribution. Our main strategy is to divide the sample into deciles based on accumulated labor earnings from age 21 to 60, and estimate the effect of the pension reform separately within each bin. We find that the labor supply responses to strengthened work incentives are surprisingly similar across the distribution of prime-age labor earnings. For all earnings deciles, except at the very top, employment rates during age 63–65 increased by approximately 20 percentage points, whereas (unconditional) hours worked per week increased by 7–10 h. During age 66–67, the employment rate increased by 10–15 percentage points and hours worked per week by 3–5 h. In total, we estimate that the reform caused an increase in hours worked by as much as 42% during the five-year early retirement period. Some of these effects remained even after the end of this period, despite almost unchanged economic incentives at this point. At age 68, we estimate a 4 percentage point increase in employment and a 2 h increase in work per week. In terms of employment status and hours worked, the weakest response is found among the top-earners, who had relatively high employment rates even prior to the reform and thus had less potential for an increase. In terms of absolute earnings, on the other hand, the effects are largest at the top of the prime-age earnings distribution.Second, we characterize the winners and losers. As the reform essentially shifted pensionwealthfrom early to late retirees, the clearest winners are those who would have preferred to continue working throughout the early retirement period in both regimes (the “always-workers”). For this group, the new pension entitlements can almost be considered an annual lump-sum transfer. The clearest losers are those who would have preferred to leave the labor market at the earliest possible occasion in both regimes (the “never-workers”). For these workers, the reform merely reduced the lifetime value of their early retirement pension (by approximately 21%). Assuming that nobody decides to leave (remain in) employment as a result of higher (lower) take-home wages, we can identify the definite winners of the pension reform as those who continued working until the statutory retirement age in the pre-reform period. Likewise, we can identify the definite losers as those who left the labor market at the lowest early retirement age in the post-reform regime. Defined this way, we find that 15% of the eligible workers can be counted as definite winners, whereas 6–7% is definite losers. Comparing these two groups, we show that the “always-working” winners tend to be individuals with higher prime-age earnings, higher education, more prestigious occupations, and much lowersickness absencein the past than the “never-working” losers.Finally, we examine the distributional consequences of the reform more directly by examining its effect on the distribution of accumulated pension and labor income after age 62. In order to do so, we use the pre-reform cohorts to construct a sample that matches the post-reform cohorts on gender, prime-age earnings, and age 60 earnings, and treat the observed old-age outcomes for this adjusted sample as counterfactual observations for the post-reform sample. The resultant trajectories allow us to disentangle the effect of the new entitlement rules – given the pre-existing labor supply behavior – from the consequences of the reform-generated changes in labor supply. Our findings show that while roughly 40% of the workers lost out in terms of lower pension entitlements, the large labor supply responses ensured that the vast majority (93%) came out with higher overall old-age income. The new entitlement rules also led to a considerable increase in old-age income inequality, whereas the labor supply responses were more or less neutral in distributional terms. The resultant increase in income inequality turned out to be considerable. Measured by theGini coefficient, overall old-age income inequality increased by approximately 21% as a direct result of the reform. However, in contrast to recent studies examining the impact of higher early retirement age (Cribb and Emmerson, 2019;Morris, 2019), we find no indications of severepoverty. This must be interpreted in light of the relatively resourceful group of workers that are included in our analysis. By focusing on private sector workers who are eligible for the early retirement program both before and after the reform, we essentially limit our attention to workers who are still in employment at age 60 and who have had stable careers over many years with relatively high earnings. Although this group of workers is not representative for the full population of potential retirees in Norway, they may be quite representative for the type of workers that governments might successfully convince to extend their labor market careers.",Asbjørn,Simen,Knut
"1. IntroductionIn most industrialised societies, women perform moreunpaid workin the home and less paid work in the market than men.Fig. 1documents this gendereddivision of labourforOECDcountries: on average, men spend a larger fraction of their total daily time working for pay than women, while the reverse is true for unpaid work. Economists have long viewed this pattern as the result of intra-household specialisation according to comparative advantage (Becker, 1973,Gronau, 1973,Gronau, 1973), assuming that women are, on average, relatively less productive in the labour market than men.2More recent work, however, suggests that gender gaps in the labour market arise onlyaftercouples begin to divide labour along gender lines, assigning primary responsibility for unpaid child-rearing activities to women (Blau, Kahn, 2017,Goldin, 2014,Goldin, Kerr, Olivetti, Barth, 2017,Kleven, Landais, Søgaard, 2018,Lundberg, Rose, 2000,Lundborg, Plug, Rasmussen, 2017,OECD, 2017). But ifgender differencesin labour market productivity are more likely a result rather than the initial reason for gendered specialisation in families, what other factors motivate couples to divide labour along gender lines?Download :Download high-res image (251KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1.Gender gaps in percentage of total time spent in paid andunpaid workNote:Own calculations based onOECD family database (2016)data, a compilation of time use studies from each country containing information on men’s and women’s (self-reported) time spent on work activities as a percentage share of total daily time. Gender gaps are calculated as the difference in male vs. female country averages. The category paid work is taken as is from the data, while the category unpaid work is formed by aggregating unpaid and care work (excluding personal care). The category total work is formed by aggregating paid and unpaid work.The present paper focuses on gender norms and their potential power to reinforce the gendered division of labour. In recent years, gender norms received increasing attention by academics and policy makers concerned over their potentially negative impacts on the economic efficiency of households (Akerlof, Kranton, 2000,Bertrand, Kamenica, Pan, 2015,European Commission, 2016,OECD, 2017,OECD, 2017). Using a model of household labour supply,Cudeville and Recoules (2015)show how gender norms and couples’ desire for social conformity can distort male and female labour supplies in couples where women have a comparative advantage for market work. While the theoretical model is intuitive, the impact of norms on household division of labour is notoriously difficult to study empirically. Prior work has documented behaviours that are consistent with the notion that social gender norms regulate women’s relative involvement in market work (Akerlof, Kranton, 2000,Alesina, Giuliano, Nunn, 2013,Bertrand, Kamenica, Pan, 2015,Fernandez, Fogli, 2009,Fernández, Fogli, Olivetti, 2004,Fortin, 2005,Fortin, 2015), but much of the evidence is also consistent with alternative channels. For instance, systematic gender differences in productivities or in hedonic returns to engaging in market versus care work would yield similar results and are likely not orthogonal to gender norms (seeGörges and Nosenzo, 2020, for a detailed discussion).3In this paper, I take advantage of a controlled lab experiment to study the causal impact of gender norms on couples’ specialisation choices. By varying the salience of gender norms exogenously and ruling out gender differences in productivity and preferences by design, this paper provides evidence that norms exert adirecteffect on division of labour choices, independent of other motives that may factor into that decision outside the lab. 192 subjects, real heterosexual couples, play a symmetricbattle of the sexes-style coordination game, in which each partner can choose one of two available actions. Across treatments, I vary whether the labeling of the actions is neutral (Avs.B) or makes gender norms salient (Careervs.Family). Coordination occurs when each of the two available actions are simultaneously chosen by one of the partners (i.e., each partner ‘specialises’ in one of two actions), but payoffs are asymmetric and favour the player who choseCareer/A. Each subject plays with their real partner and a randomly matched stranger of the same sex as their partner.The main result of the experiment is that women’s specialisation choices are highly sensitive to the salience of gender norms. Compared to theNeutralgroup, women opt forCareerat a significantly lower rate in theNormgroup. The reduction is large, women inNeutralchooseCareermore than twice as often compared to women inNorm. Notably, the drop occurs both when women are paired with their partners and strangers. This shows that gender norms directly affect women’s behaviour and, by extension, lower their claims to a joint pie, even when they receive no other forms of compensation and intra-couple redistribution is ruled out (as is the case with strangers).A second result is that men’s response to the salience of norms is much weaker than that of women and sensitive to whether men are paired with a stranger or their real partner. When paired with their real partner, men in theNormgroup are in fact no more likely to opt forCareerthan men inNeutral; a quantitatively large, yet statistically not significant increase of around 20 percentage points is only observed in stranger pairings. Exploring potential mechanisms for this heterogeneity, I find suggestive evidence that this discrepancy might be a result of men’s marriage market signalling, in the spirit ofBursztyn et al. (2017). Specifically, I document patterns consistent with the interpretation that some men care to signal progressive gender attitudes to their potential long-term partners—“acting feminist”—but not to an anonymous, randomly matched woman. An alternative explanation, differential beliefs regarding partners’ and strangers’Careerchoices, is not borne out by the data.Apart from its contribution to the growing economics literature on gender norms, the paper’s perspective on norms as a coordination device relates it to a small number of experimental studies on the effectiveness of focal points (Crawford, Gneezy, Rottenstreich, 2008,Isoni, Poulsen, Sugden, Tsutsui, 2013,Isoni, Poulsen, Sugden, Tsutsui, 2014). In a study most closely related to this paper,Holm (2000)shows that gender in itself can provide a focal point in a symmetric coordination game where the two pure strategyNash equilibriaresult in unequal payoffs. He presents evidence that mixed-sex pairs of players are indeed more likely to coordinate than same-sex pairs and that the equilibrium that favours the male player is focal. Surprisingly, despite recurring interest in the question of whether gender norms provide a focal point in the household division of labour problem in the theoretical literature (Baker, Jacobsen, 2007,Engineer, Welling, 1999,Hadfield, 1999), it has not been studied empirically. The present paper addresses this gap by studying a classicbattle of the sexesgame played byrealheterosexual couples and mixed-sex pairs of strangers, thus offering insights into whether societal gender norms, or couple-specific norms, can improve coordination outcomes.The paper also contributes to a growing literature on economic experiments with real couples (for an overview, seeHopfensitz, Munro, 2020,Munro, 2018). Most closely related to this study are the experiments byGörges (2015)andCochard et al. (2018), who study division of labour.Görges (2015)finds that women are more likely to perform an unpaid real effort task to reach efficiency gains when paired with their partner compared to women paired with a male stranger.Cochard et al. (2018)present couples with an abstract public good game and show that women are no more likely than men to shift money or time from their private into the public account. This result is somewhat surprising given that, outside the lab, women are frequently observed to spend more time than men providing the family public good.4BothGörges (2015)andCochard et al. (2018)conjecture that their findings may be related to the salience of gender norms, which is low in the lab setting inCochard et al. (2018), and lower for individuals playing with strangers compared to real partners inGörges (2015). The present paper corroborates this interpretation by providing first empirical evidence that women tend to claim a smaller share of a joint pie when gender norms are salient.The paper is organised as follows:Section 2lays out the experimental game, while details on the procedure are provided inSection 3. The main results are supplied inSection 4, andSection 5presents analyses regarding the mechanism.Section 6offers a discussion and concludes the paper.",Luise,None,None
"1. IntroductionHiring entails considerable costs for the employer: locating the best candidate for a position can be a time-consuming and exhausting procedure. Because of the existence of these fixed costs, certain hires that are profitable in relation to their variable costs are not made because potential employers are unwilling to pay these fixed costs on top of their variable costs.Manning (2006)reports that hiring costs in theLabour TurnoverSurvey conducted by the UK Institute for Personnel are between 2.4% and 11.2% of earnings. More recently,Muehlemann and Pfeifer (2016), using firm-level data from Germany, find that average hiring costs per new worker are substantial, averaging around 4700 €, or about 8 weeks of earnings. Still, hiring costs are likely to vary a lot depending on the type of firms and the economic context. They may be greater for a small business that lacks a human resources department to efficiently vet candidates. Furthermore, when the future activity or the worker’s quality is uncertain, these expenses can be amplified. Risk-averse employers may not want to take the risk of a bad fit, especially when separation costs are significant. Finally, the risk premium that an employer adds to these costs is likely to be influenced by the current economic climate.This paper examines the introduction of a hiring credit for small firms in France in 2008, in order to give new light on how to boost employment during a crisis. This credit was not announced in advance by the French Government and therefore could not be anticipated. For 18 months, alllow wagehires (lower then 1.6 times the minimum wage) in firms with less than 10 full-time equivalent workers in November 2008 were eligible to a partial refund of its employer contributions. One expects this hiring credit to increase employment in eligible firms, at least while it lasts. It could do so for three different reasons. First of all, if it is integrated by firms as a wage subsidy (a reduction of labor cost). Second, if it leads firms to change the timing of their hires to take the opportunity of the credit (a displacement effect). Third, if it is integrated by firms as an adjustment subsidy and leads them to hire more (but also to terminate more employment relationships). The actual source ofjob creationwill matter for the sustainability of jobs created by the hiring credit and its longer term effects. Indeed, jobs created thanks to a wage subsidy may no longer be profitable once the credit is over and might be eliminated. Also, jobs are not really created by a displacement effect as much as their timing is modified: in the long term, the total number of months worked in addition thanks to the hiring credit in this case should be 0. However, jobs created thanks to an adjustment subsidy are in theory sustainable beyond the duration of the credit because their variable costs are not in question. To sum up, in the short term, all of these scenarios lead to the same outcome: an increase of employment in eligible firms. But they will have different outcomes once the credit is over: stability of employment growth in the case of the hiring subsidy hypothesis and negative employment growth in the two others.This research builds on two previous studies that looked at the impact of the 2009 hiring credit on employment and worker flows,Cahuc et al. (2019)andAnanian and Pons (2017). They used different data and evaluation strategies and reached divergent conclusions.Cahuc et al. (2019)find a positive effect of the 2009 hiring credit on employment whileAnanian and Pons (2017)find no effect on hiring and separation flows. Both, however, are unable to explain why employment in eligible firms could increase or remain high after 2009 since they only consider the hiring credit’s static effect in 2009, rather than its dynamics from 2009 to 2012, i.e. whether eligible firms in 2008 continue to benefit from it in 2012. The channel of job creation can only be determined by looking at what happens after 2009, and in particular whether jobs created in eligible firms are sustainable. For this purpose, I use an exhaustive administrative database linking employer and employees (theDéclaration Annuelles des Données Socialeor DADS) to measure the evolution of full-time equivalent (FTE) employment in eligible and ineligible firms to the credit from 2007 to 2012. By calculating the average difference between eligible and ineligible firms month by month while adjusting for their baseline differences, I can assess the effect of eligibility on employment growth before and after the implementation of the hiring credit. That is, I implement a dynamic difference-in-difference approach. I also use an administrative survey (the “Enquête sur les Mouvements de Main d’Oeuvre d’Oeuvre” or EMMO) to measure the effects of the credit on worker flows. My estimation approach is close toCahuc et al. (2019)but compared to them, in addition to look at worker flows, eligibility is fixed over time which allows to look at the longer term effect of the hiring credit and not just its effect in 2009.2The hiring credit had a positive effect on employment in eligible firms. First, from January 2009 to July 2010, employment growth was consistently higher in eligible firms compared to similar ineligible firms controlling for initial differences. This is mainly explained by a surplus of hires. Second, the hiring credit had a more than transitory impact on employment in eligible firms: employment growth did not fall below similar ineligible firms following the end of the hiring credit, as one would have expected if jobs created by the credit were destroyed. This means that jobs created thanks to the credit are sustainable. Firms did not integrate the credit as a wage subsidy and there was no displacement effect. On the contrary, the credit led firms to create new positions even though their profitability was uncertain in the context of the 2009 recession. In the end, I estimate that the public cost per month of work was low: less than 19% of its private cost; and that it came at no cost for ineligible workers in eligible firms.I contribute to the literature on employer subsidies as a means of promoting employment by examining the medium-term impact of hiring subsidies in the context of the French recession of 2009, and demonstrating that hiring subsidies achieve this goal, but for different reasons than traditional wage subsidies. In his review of the literature,Katz (1996)argues that existing evidences broadly support wage subsidies as an efficient tool to raise the demand for labor, especially fordisadvantaged groups. But he also models hiring subsidies akin to wage subsidies while there may be several important differences. More recent articles have focused specifically on hiring subsidies and highlight their ambiguous effect on employment.Chirinko and Wilson (2016)find that state hiring credits in the US increase employment but also that eligible firms change the timing of hires, which may lead to an overestimation of their impact on employment.Neumark and Grijalva (2017), which are reviewing the effect of state hiring credits in the US too, find that hiring subsidies increase churning more than net employment but seem to be more efficient during recessions.Saez et al. (2021)show that a temporary employment subsidy in Sweden had long term effect even after its repeal. My results are also in line with the literature on dynamiclabor demand, according to which employment reacts quickly to shocks on labor costs, with a delay that is clearly infra-annual (Hamermesh, 1988).This article is divided into several parts. InSection 2, I describe two type of models that can help to illustrate the effect of a hiring credit on labor flows and employment. InSection 3, I present the 2009 French hiring credit and the context of its implementation. InSection 4, I introduce the different sources I use. InSection 5, I highlight several importantdescriptive statistics. InSection 6, I describe the methodology I use and its results. Finally, inSection 7, I show several robustness checks and inSection 8, I conclude.",Cyprien,None,None
"1. IntroductionAs technology evolves more rapidly, firm-provided employee training can play an increasingly important role. Training can update and extend the schooling qualifications of workers in their jobs and deliver important private and social benefits. The pandemic crisis may also represent an opportunity for firms to invest in the skills of their workers in the context of growing importance of remote work. However, employee training also faces a number of well-known obstacles. These include worker mobility, namely through poaching by other firms, andcredit constraintsfor firms to fund the direct and indirect costs of training. Such obstacles can lead to sub-optimal levels of this particular type ofhuman capital investment(Leuven, 2005).Even if the obstacles above can be addressed, firms may find it difficult to estimate the returns to their training activities. Training sessions may be more or less effective; and the relationship between human capital improvements and gains in productivity and sales may be difficult to establish, leading to uncertainty that can further discourage training. This point is further underlined by the fact that the academic literature on the firm-level returns to employee training has not yet drawn on experimental or quasi-experimental variation. All approaches adopted so far are based on assumptions about the production technology of firms (Almeida, Carneiro, 2009,Konings, Vanormelingen, 2015,Mehra, Langer, Bapna, Gopal, 2014), controls for firm heterogeneity, including firmfixed effects(Barrett, O’Connell, 2001,Dostie, 2018,Goux, Maurin, 2000,Zwick, 2006) or case studies of single or small numbers of firms (Krueger, Rouse, 1998,Lyons, 2020). As stated inFialho et al. (2019), ’it is very difficult to measure the returns to training [for employers] and very few studies have attempted to estimate it’ (page 24).Brunello and Wruuck (2020)also highlight this point and argue that a ’more systematic assessment of the benefits [of training for firms] could contribute to explain the heterogeneity in training investment’ (page 29).2In contrast to the literature above, this paper is one of the first to provide evidence on the effects of employee training on firm performance based on potentially quasi-experimental variation, even if not drawing on a randomised control trial. The variation in training across firms that we use here is drawn from a large, 200 million euro training grants programme supported by theEuropean Social Fundof the European Union. This programme, FIG, implemented in Portugal, supported the training of employees of differentskill levels, from factory workers to managers, and in diverse areas, including innovation, marketing, andinternational trade(Bloom, Manova, Van Reenen, Sun, Yu,Bloom, Reenen, 2007). FIG involved five annual calls between 2007 and 2011, all studied here, each one receiving applications from about 2000 firms. As demand exceeded the funding available, less than half of the applicants were selected and funded, receiving a grant of about 30,000 euros on average. While assignment to treatment is not random (and in, that sense, our study is observational), variation in treatment status is influenced by the changing circumstances of each call, namely the funding available, the number of firms applying for support, and the binding (or not) nature of minimum scores, as explained in detail in the next section.Our analysis is based on matching the administrative data from all applicants in each call to a rich matched employer-employee panel. This allows us to follow both the funded and the rejected firms, using difference-in-differences (Lechner, 2011), and drawing on a more comparable (self-selected) set of firms. We follow these firms over a period of up to ten years before their application and up to ten years after the funding was or was not awarded. (Our approach bears some similarity toHolzer et al. (1993), which studies a training programme in Michigan, andHowell (2017), which studies an R&D programme in the US. See alsoCriscuolo et al. (2019)which studies the effects of an industrial policy in the UK, which can also include worker training components.) Moreover, we consider a very large number of potential firm-level outcomes, all of which collected from the same compulsory surveys across firms and years, to provide a comprehensive analysis of the effects of training. Some of these variables have not been examined before in the training literature. We also examine the effects of training at different times over the business cycle, which strengthens the external validity of our findings.Our findings indicate that, first, the training grants had a significant positive effect on training activities: both training expenditure and training hours more than double. This increase also involved limited deadweight loss: we estimate that at least 74% of the grant led to additional training and, under some assumptions, cannot rule out some form of crowd-in (whereby the increase in training exceeded the support provided by the programme). Our finding of limited deadweight is in contrast to several studies (Abramovsky, Battistin, Fitzsimons, Goodman, Simpson, 2011,Hidalgo, Oosterbeek, Webbink, 2014,Leuven, Oosterbeek, 2004,Schwerdt, Messer, Woessmann, Wolter, 2012) but certainly not all (Goerlitz, 2010,Holzer, Block, Cheatham, Knott, 1993). Our results may be driven by the format of the programme, which required an application by interested parties (where they made their cases about the relevance of the grant) and established levels of co-payment by firms that decreased with the generality of the skills provided.Second, we find that the additional training driven by the programme led to economically and statistically significant improvements in several dimensions of firm performance. Sales, value added, employment, productivity, and exports increase in the firms that received the training grant compared to the control group of unsuccessful applicants. On the other hand, total (accounting) investment and profits appear to not be positively affected by training, although these variables are subject to measurement error. As to the variables that increase, the effects are typically of around 10%, emerge one or two years after the grant is provided and the training is conducted, and in some cases remain in place for at least ten years. Interestingly, the employment effects we find tend to be stronger in periods of recession. This may correspond to a positive form of training ’lock-in’, in contrast to the case of training programmes for the unemployed, which may reducetransitions to employmentat least in the short-run.The large and durable positive effects in several firm performance variables and the relatively low cost of the additional training indicate that there may be significant underprovision of employee training. At the same time, the results highlight the potential of public programmes in addressing at least part of this underprovision. Quasi-experimental evidence may also go some way in informing firms regarding the likely returns from training. Our results also contribute to the evaluation of the 100 billion European Social Fund (Becker et al., 2013), of which FIG was a small component, and towards the design and implementation of the new funding schemes currently under plan to alleviate the pandemic crisis.The structure of the remaining of the paper is as follows:Section 2describes the training programme evaluated here.Sections 3presents the data sets used (and their descriptive statistics) and4discusses our methodology.

"1. IntroductionThetime seriesliterature has recently focused on variation over time in the labor wedge — the difference between the marginal rate of substitution of consumption for leisure and the marginal product of labor — as a measure of labor market frictions. This paper first demonstrates that in the standard representative-agent model typically utilized for these exercises, labor-wedge differences are isomorphic to differences in a parameter capturing the agent’s relative preference for leisure. It then documents significant cross-sectional variation in this labor wedge (or preference for leisure). Quantified in terms of hours supplied, the necessary adjustment to reach a labor wedge that is constant across countries, ranges from a 54% decrease (1,073 yearly hours) in labor supply for Hungary, to a 33% and 31% increase for the Netherlands and Switzerland (464 and 517 hours per year respectively).Finding these substantial differences naturally raises the question of what lies behind. I try a long list of potential explanatory factors that the literature has suggested as important for labor market frictions, but I also widen the scope of potential explanations to include cultural values. A cultural measure, chosen by virtue of being the closest theWorld Values Survey(WVS) gets to asking individuals about their relative labor/leisure utility, is by far the most robust explanatory factor and improves significantly on the explained variation.2To further test my cultural interpretation that (part of) the cross-sectional labor-wedge variation reflects differences in preferences, I turn to U.S. micro-level data. As suggested by previous work, individuals’ attitudes are partly shaped by their contemporaneous environment and by cultural beliefs and values passed down by previous generations.3Within the United States, second and successive generations of immigrants share the contemporaneous, first component. They do, however, differ in the dimension of beliefs and values that are passed down by previous generations. I exploit this inherited cultural component by assigning individuals the preference for leisure measure associated with their stated country ofancestry. Reassuringly, in reduced-form regressions of individuals’ labor supply, this preference measure does exhibit statistically significant explanatory power: In the United States, descendants of immigrants from countries with a weaker preference for leisure tend to work more hours, in line with the suggested interpretation of the model’s measure as capturing some underlying difference in actual preferences. The same relationship is present also when looking at children of migrants in Sweden.Finally, the paper asks the question of what differences in preferences for leisure theoretically imply for the level of labor taxation, and whether this prediction lines up with the observed empirical relationship. Theoretically, a stronger preference for leisure implies a lower optimal level of labor taxation. The reason for this negative relationship is that a stronger preference for leisure is associated with a more elastic labor supply, and therefore also with greater distortionary effects from labor taxation. Empirical data verify the relationship between labor taxation and leisure-preference differences;taxesare significantly and negatively correlated with a stronger preference for leisure, also after controlling for total government spending and a number of labor market indicators. The investigation of the relationship between labor taxes and leisure preferences serves two purposes. Firstly, in the spirit of an “out-of-sample” test, it corroborates the documented leisure-preference differences. But perhaps more interestingly, the choice of lower labor taxes in the face of a more elastic labor supply can be interpreted as suggestive evidence of a responsiveness of policy choices to underlying cultural differences — ignoring this policy endogeneity (if the suggested differences in preferences are true) leads to an underestimation of taxation’s distortionary effects in a cross-country setting.4Beliefs about cross-country differences in cultural values may also be important for international cooperation. For example,Guiso et al. (2009)show that beliefs regarding trustworthiness affectinternational trade. Interpreted as partly reflecting differences in preferences, the country results in this paper are at odds with what is popularly believed5and generally reflected in the media.6The cultural interpretation of labor-wedge differences,after controlling for typical measures of labor market frictions, imply that several southern European countries have a weaker preference for leisure than do northern and western European countries.So far, this introductory discussion has used the term “culture” without offering a more precise definition, and at times has used “culture” interchangeably with “preferences.” Throughout the analysis, I followGuiso et al. (2006)and define “culture” asthose values and beliefs that are passed down fairly unchanged from generation to generation. Cultural values are part of the deep mental programming shaping the lens through which people view themselves and their surrounding environment, and how people act in that environment. For my analysis, key in this definition is thepersistence— thatthose values and beliefsare not a continuously updated best-response to a changing environment, but remainfairly unchangedas people migrate.Relation to the literatureThis paper is related to at least three different fields in the economics literature. The first is the strand of the empirical business-cycle literature that studies labor market frictions over time by backing out a labor wedge from a representative-agent model; this is technically identical to backing out a labor wedge for the purpose of studying cross-sectional variation.Chari et al. (2007), using a model nesting the one used here, show that time fluctuations in output, labor, investment, and government consumption can be characterized by fluctuations in corresponding output, labor, investment, and government consumption “wedges”, and that any friction used in this model can be expressed as a combination of these wedges.Shimer (2009)uses a similar accounting exercise to back out a labor wedge in a representative-agent model.7In this paper, potential between-country differences in the labor wedge, using the terminology ofChari et al. (2007)orShimer (2009), would be observationally equivalent to differences in the model’s relative preference for leisure. If those labor-wedge differences were unrelated to differences in preferences, one would expect the measure to be more strongly correlated with a host of labor market indicators than with a survey-based measure of preferences; as previewed above, I obtain the opposite result. While cultural values, reasonably assumed to be roughly constant at business-cycle frequency, cannot feasibly account for labor-wedge fluctuations within a country at that frequency, comparisons of the magnitude of labor-wedge fluctuations across countries could be distorted by differences in preferencesSkibińska (2016)is one example of such a comparison).The second concerns the general importance ofculture, particularly for outcomes and choices in the labor market. Closely related to this paper,Mocan and Pogorelova (2015)employ data from the European Social Survey (ESS) on the labor supply decisions of second-generation immigrants to investigate the effects of taxes and a cultural “taste for leisure” on labor supply decisions, and find that both factors have an impact.Moriconi and Peri (2019), also using ESS data and a similar approach, find evidence that country-specific labor-leisure preferences explain a non-negligible share of variation in employment rates across countries. However, neither of these papers study the questions via the macro-level lens that this paper utilizes, nor do they at all look at the type of policy predictions and outcomes thatSection 5in this paper investigates.Fernandez (2007)andFernandez and Fogli (2009), also employing an “epidemiological” strategy but using U.S. Census rather than ESS data, show that culture has a significant impact on female labor-supply decisions and fertility behavior.Giavazzi et al. (2013)document an impact of cultural traits on female employment rates and hours worked; they try to exploit changes in cultural traits over time, and between countries to avoid the issue of attitudes responding to economic and institutional conditions.Eugster et al. (2016)look at the impact of culture on unemployment spells by exploiting a Swiss languageborderbetween Romance and German speakers, that does not follow political or labor-market borders. They find that Romance speakers’ job search lasts for 22 percent longer that the German speakers.Becker and Woessmann (2009)reject the Weberian hypothesis of a Protestant work ethic having spurred economic prosperity in (north)western Europe. Instead, they argue that education promoted the growth of human capital and prosperity. Since this educational channel was the result ofProtestantism, with its instruction to read the Bible first-hand promoting literacy, the importance of culture as such is not rejected.Another paper closely related to this isFalk et al. (2018); they document significant cross-country differences for six different types of preferences (none of which are preferences for leisure), and show that these differences in preferences have predictive power for numerous aggregate- and individual-level outcomes.Falk et al. (2018)also share this paper’s agnostic approach towards exactly what drives a certain cultural characteristic in a given country.Guiso et al. (2006), andFernandez (2011)provide excellent literature reviews of the impact of culture on economic outcomes.Third, over the last decade, a growing body of literature has attempted to tackle the issue of cross-country differences in labor supply.Prescott (2004)argues that differences in labor supply between the United States and the European G7-countries stem solely from variations in taxation.Rogerson (2006)suggests that taxes and productivity changes together can explain the changing patterns in hours worked across countries.Rogerson (2008)expands on this hypothesis by looking at sectoral data. He argues that the marketservice sectorin Europe never expanded the way it did in the United States, due to the higher labor taxes in Europe.McDaniel (2011)andRogerson (2008)both include home production in a model otherwise similar to the one used byPrescott (2004), and also attribute changes in hours worked to changes in taxes and productivity levels.Bick et al. (2019)show that part of the U.S-Europe difference can be attributed to educational composition and seasonal sampling differences.Bick et al. (2018)focus on comparing countries at different stages of development and find that the number of hours worked is higher in low-income countries than in high-income countries.Aguiar and Hurst (2007)document a significant increase in the number of leisure hours in the United States over the past two generations. A shared feature of these papers (exceptBick et al. (2018)is a focus on the temporal aspect of conditions driving labor supply while preferences for leisure, among other things, are still assumed to be constant across countries.8",Andreas,None,None
"1. IntroductionOver the last decade, discussions over immigrant assimilation have become increasingly heated in political arenas across the Western world. On the one hand, nativist politicians argue that risingmulticulturalismposes a threat to the preservation of autochthonouscultureand hence ensuring immigrant assimilation is essential. On the other hand, some mainstreamdemocratic governments, such as that of Denmark, have made assimilation mandatory to grant immigrants full access to social benefits. While most liberal democracies agree to concede rights and protection to immigrants, whether assimilation should constitute a duty for accessing public services is an increasingly debated question. Yet little is known about the role that assimilation plays in immigrants' access to important services, like health or education. Do discriminatory attitudes of natives affect immigrants' access to these services? Can newcomers mitigate entry barriers to welfare services by signaling assimilation? What incentives drive such biases?Using a field experiment, this paper addresses these questions by focusing on access to early- and compulsory-education. Education is arguably the most crucial means of easing the socioeconomic integration of first- and second-generation immigrants. First, it constitutes a fundamental engine ofhuman capital formationand upward mobility (Chetty et al., 2011;2017,Card et al., 2018). Second, it acts as a powerful tool to inculcate sharedcivicvalues and to enhance social cohesion (Billings et al., 2014). In this study, I assess the presence of discriminatory attitudes towards immigrant families in the acquisition of school-related information, and evaluate the potential of cultural assimilation to mitigate such barriers. Before the school registration period takes place, families engage in an active process of gathering information in order to decide upon a school for their children. By selectively providing information, schools can influence their applicant pool and ""cream skim"" students by discouraging certain incoming families from enrolling their children. Although declining to provide information and denying access to a given service is not equivalent, previous evidence suggests that the former is causally linked to participation decisions (Hastings & Weinstein, 2008;Hoxby & Turner, 2013). Ultimately, this behavior can result in worsened educational outcomes for minority students through limited access to high-quality schools, thus harming their later labor market opportunities. Hence, investigating unequal treatment in the provision of information helps to reveal underlying discriminatory attitudes from schools that can significantly influence immigrant students' long-term labor market outcomes (Acemoglu & Angrist, 2001).To quantify the size of these discriminatory frictions and study the role of immigrants' cultural assimilation on discrimination, I emailed more than 2500 kindergartens and compulsory schools located in theCommunityof Madrid in the period leading up to the 2018 student registration. In these messages, three types of fictitious couples, one Spanish and two Romanian, requested to visit the school.1The respective Romanian couples signaled different levels of cultural assimilation with the origin of their child's name. Similar to other studies, I signed the emails using common Spanish- or immigrant-sounding names to evoke the different ethnic origins of the couples. Whether cultural assimilation mitigates discriminatory behavior is evaluated by testing for the presence of distinctive response patterns of the schools. To enhance the comparability across family profiles, I fix a number of socioeconomic characteristics that drive the selection into assimilation and affect discrimination. These characteristics include paternal occupation and working sector, the language proficiency of the couple, and the age-adequacy of the child.The Spanish context provides a particularly suitable context for analyzing the aforementioned questions. From 1998–2008, the foreign-born share of the population increased by 10 percentage points. This constituted one of the most remarkable immigration periods experienced in recent history by anOECDcountry. With specific regard to theeducation system, immigration led to significant native flight towards private schools and increased student-teacher ratios in public schools (Farré et al., 2018). Moreover, this occurred after public education had been transferred from the central to regional governments, the size of the private school network had increased, and parents' freedom of choice favored (Arellano & Zamarro, 2007).A focus on immigrant families' name choices as a proxy of assimilation provides a number of advantages relative to other widespread measures. First, studying the implications of cultural assimilation by looking at actual assimilation outcomes, likeintermarriagesor labor-market assimilation, can produce misleading conclusions. The reason being that such measures are equilibrium outcomes that depend on the interplay of both natives' and immigrants' actions and are therefore constrained by the stance of the native population (Fouka et al., 2021). Second, other proxies of assimilation, such as naturalization, might be affected by financial restrictions, labor market prospects, the composition of immigrants'social networks, etc. They hence can fail to disentangle assimilation from other factors associated with socioeconomic success since they may be disturbed, ultimately, by discriminatory attitudes. Name-choices, on the other hand, are unconstrained by such barriers, act as crucial markers of individual identity, and carry significant cultural content (Algan et al., 2013). At the social level, names are relevant descriptors of a family's cultural background and trigger preliminary judgments about ethnic groupaffiliation. Shifting towards native names manifests learning about the host culture, or making a durable choice of remaining in the country (Abramitzky et al., 2020). At the same time, names reflect a personal choice that embodies a migrant family's trade-off between transmitting their own cultural identity and adapting to the traditions of their new environment.Several findings emerge from this analysis. First, I find that immigrants who chose a foreign (Romanian) name for their children face important discriminatory barriers in the acquisition of information (9 p.p. lower response rate relative to a baseline of a 77 % response rate for natives). Second, I show that immigrant parents' decision of giving their child a native name significantly reduces discrimination by 50 %. The emails from the Romanian couple who chose a Spanish name for their child are significantly more likely to get a response than those from the couple who selected a Romanian name (73 % as opposed to 68 % response rate). I perform a number of checks (i.e., considering the qualitative tone of the response and employing a duration analysis of the delay in response) that support the robustness of my findings.To uncover the main mechanisms driving the results, I assess whether a diverse set of predictors explain the differences in response patterns. In particular, I consider both the characteristics of the schools and their surrounding geographical areas. At the school level, I examine attributes that are associated with higher tuition expenditures and the type of instruction. This set of characteristics includes the type of school (i.e., whether it is public, charter, or private), the age of the child, the linguistic model, and the number of extra services provided by the school. At the geographical level, I account for political preferences, incidence of Romanian immigration, and the size and housing prices of the neighborhood or municipality where the school is located. Overall, the aforementioned qualitative nature of findings remains across schools with differing characteristics. From a statistical standpoint, I find no significant heterogeneous effects in any of the considered dimensions. However, I find that response patterns display substantial variability based on these characteristics. This suggests that the findings may suffer from limited statistical power to detect heterogeneity. Altogether, the evidence is consistent with certain school level incentives (e.g., the age of the child being served) and community characteristics (e.g., relative presence of Romanian migrants) mediating observed discrimination.The case for statistical discrimination cannot be entirely ruled out in the current setting, despite being arguably weaker than in similar audit studies focusing on the labor market. Thus, results may not be entirely attributed to prejudice or taste-based discrimination stemming from perceived cultural assimilation. In absence of direct evidence for the role of taste-based vis-à-vis statistical discrimination, some patterns suggest that the findings can be partially associated with the former. For instance, the observation that there is a larger gap between assimilated and non-assimilated families in kindergartens is consistent with perceived place of birth not being the main driver of the results. However, I cannot exclude the possibility that statistical discrimination plays a significant role in explaining the gap between assimilated and non-assimilated families. Irrespective of their causes, the findings are relevant from a regulatory perspective. Even if school staff use names as proxies for parental background, the differential treatment based on ethnically distinct names is likely to be seen by courts as a pretext for discrimination (Kline & Walters, 2020).2This paper is related to several strands of the literature. First, it speaks to the ample body of work on immigrant assimilation. An increasing number of studies have leveraged the informativeness of migrant parents' name choices as a proxy of cultural assimilation. However, most focus on understanding the labor market penalty associated with foreign-sounding names using observational data (for instance,Arai & Skogman Thoursie, 2009;Goldstein & Stecklov (2016)andAbramitzky et al., 2020). My study differs in two ways. First, it evaluates the influence of assimilation efforts on discriminatory attitudes inaccess to educationservices. Second, it concentrates on the implications of assimilation at early-life stages as opposed to evaluating outcomes observed in adulthood.My analysis also contributes to the literature on school choice. Existing scholarship has provided ambivalent evidence regarding the impact of the latter on student stratification (Böhlmark et al., 2016;Söderström & Uusitalo (2010;Zimmer & Guarino (2013;Gortazar et al., 2020). The presence of heterogeneous preferences based on family socioeconomic characteristics has been a widely studied motive that rationalizes these findings (Burgess et al., 2015;Hastings et al., 2009;Beuermann et al., 2019). Yet little research has been conducted on the role of school ""cream skimming"" through the generating of informational frictions. This is largely due to the fact that observational studies do not allow to disentangle the two. In response to such limitations, a few studies have adopted an experimental approach to understand the active role of schools in dissuading minority students. These include, among others,Diaz-Serrano & Meix-Llop (2016)for homosexual parents in Catalonia (Spain),Pfaff et al., 2021)for religious minorities, andBergman & McFarlin Jr. (2020)for children with poor behavior, learning disabilities, and low achievement in the US.3To my knowledge, however, there has been no comprehensive study that quantifies specifically the role of assimilation on schools' attitudes towards migrants.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. I begin in Section 2 by introducing the institutional setting. Section 3 presents the experimental design and the data. Section 4 shows the main results. Sections 5 and 6 provide the heterogeneity analysis and the robustness checks. Section 7 discusses the limitations of the experiment and the interpretation of results. Finally, Section 8 concludes.",David,None,None
"1. IntroductionThe number of refugees living in European countries increased dramatically in the mid-2010s, with EU countries receiving almost five million asylum applications between 2013 and 2018 (Eurostat 2019). In Germany alone, close to one million refugees entered the country in the second half of 2015 (BAMF2016). This influx had important repercussions on public policy. Measures were implemented, first, to provide humanitarian assistance to the refugees and, then, to integrate them into the host countries.Using data from Germany, this study focuses onearly childhood educationand care (ECEC) as a potential factor contributing to the integration of refugee families. By providing care and early education to children below the compulsory school age, ECEC services have the potential to reach many refugee families, who often have very young children (e.g.Gambaro et al., 2018). Indeed approximately 144,000 refugee children under the age of seven arrived in German with their families between January 2014 and December 2017.1Moreover, refugee women tend to display high fertility soon after arrival, making the provision of ECEC particularly relevant for them (Liebig and Tronstad 2018).There is wide consensus that ECEC services can help the acquisition of the host-country language amongst migrant children with a different first-language. Indeed, research documents positive effects of ECEC on children's outcomes, suggesting that migrant children stand to gain disproportionately from ECEC attendance (amongst others,Bleakley and Chin 2008;Cornelissen et al., 2018;Drange and Telle 2015;Felfe and Lalive 2018).2By contrast, relatively little attention has been dedicated to the specific benefits ECEC may provide to migrantparents. One exception is the study of Norway byDrange and Telle (2015), who find no effects of immigrant children's ECEC attendance on their parents’ integration, measured byemployment and education. In this paper, we contribute to this emerging literature and investigate the unique position of refugee parents and the role of ECEC provision for their integration.Refugees are a particularlyvulnerable groupof migrants. Especially in the first years after arrival, they typically have worse health, poorer language skills, and much lower employment rates than other migrant groups with otherwise similar characteristics (Dustmann et al., 2017;Fasani et al., 2018). In addition, dispersal policies, which apply to refuges but not to migrants, can make refugees feel socially isolated (Fasani et al., 2018). Therefore, we hypothesize that refugees with young children are likely to benefit from their children's participation in ECEC in several ways. First, they are likely to profit from the social contacts that ECEC participation potentially brings. Regular interactions with ECEC staff and other parents are likely to give refugees the opportunity to practice the host country language and foster job search networks (Dustmann et al., 2017;OECD 2016). Indeed, most surveyed refugees who have recently arrived in Germany and are employed report having found their job through social contacts (Eisnecker and Schacht 2016). Second, parents whose children are enroled in ECEC may develop familiarity with thecultureof the host country by seeing their children learning the language, celebrating local traditions, and possibly enjoying attending a host-countrycommunitysetting such as an ECEC centre (e.g.Dustmann 1996;Avitabile et al., 2013). Third, as with all parents, ECEC services relieve refugees, especially mothers, from child care duties, freeing up time to participate in employment or training courses as well as to actively engage in the integration process (e.g.Müller and Wrohlich, 2020).To estimate the impact of ECEC attendance by refugee children on the integration of their parents, we have the advantage of drawing on a large, recent survey, providing data from a nationally representative sample of refugees who applied for asylum in Germany between 2013 and 2016. This dataset includes a rich set of information on pre- and post-migration characteristics of the respondents and of their family members, including children. Using geographical identifiers, we link this survey data to administrative data on local ECEC services, capturing variation across lower administrative levels (counties) within federal states. We further augment our data with administrative information on the economic and institutional characteristics of the county where survey respondents live.Our estimation strategy exploits the fact that refugees arriving in Germany are randomly dispersed, first across federal states, then within each respective state to ensure an even distribution throughout the country. As a consequence of this dispersal policy, the communities where refugees settle differ greatly along several dimensions. One dimension relevant to families with children under school age regards the availability and characteristics of ECEC services, which may make it more or less likely that refugee children attend a centre. Our estimation strategy uses German dispersal policy and the geographical differences in ECEC services as exogenous source of variation: by applying a factor-basedinstrumental variable(IV) approach, we avoid bias from selection into ECEC and we are able to offer the first estimates that support a causal interpretation of the association between refugee children’ participation in ECEC and the integration of their parents.A further contribution of our study is that we capture different dimensions of integration. Through aprincipal component analysis, we construct an integration index that combines the information contained in twelve survey items, spanning the domains of economic, cultural, and social integration. Our results show that ECEC participation of refugee children substantially affects the integration of their mothers, whereas we cannot detect significant effects for fathers. The integration of parents whose children attend ECEC is significantly higher than the integration of parents with children not attending ECEC, with the difference equivalent to 22% of the average integration of the sample. The IV estimate shows that the integration boost given by ECEC enrolment for mothers is about 67%, which is equivalent to living in Germany for more than six years. Examining the individual items underlying the integration index, we show that the effects are particularly strong for self-assessed language proficiency and the perceived probability of future employment in Germany.We extensively test the validity of our instrument and the robustness of our results. In particular, we control for the county level average integration of refugees without children and of refugees withschool aged childrenonly. The integration of these two groups is arguably affected by the overall suitability of the local context but cannot directly benefit from ECEC provision. Indeed, we run a placebo test of the effect of our instrument (an index that summarizes different dimensions of the county level ECEC supply) on the integration of refugees without children or with children of school age only and show that it does not have a significant relationship with their integration. Finally, we exploit the longitudinal nature of the survey and estimate a model including individualfixed effectson the sample of families that participated in two survey waves. The panel results confirm that ECEC enrolment of refugee children has a positive and significant effect on the integration of their mothers, whereas estimates were not significant for fathers.Our results provide new evidence on the integration of refuge families in a European country. In particular, they show how ECEC services hold the potential to support the integration of not only, as conventionally assumed, refugee children, but of their parents too. Our findings also call for greater attention to the distinct circumstances of refugee mothers relative to their male counterparts.",Ludovica,Guido,C.
"1. IntroductionSince the late 1940s, Current Population Survey (CPS) household survey data has been a primary measure of the health of the U.S. labor market (U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census 2006). It has served as a key data source for policymakers, as well as for thousands of social science studies in the last half-century. But the COVID-19 pandemic has presented an unprecedented challenge to the CPS data collection process and, in turn, for the representativeness of the resulting data. During the pandemic, the size of the CPS sample declined by approximately 16 percent, driven primarily by a 37 percent decline in the size of entering cohorts over a period of several months.One prime candidate for these changes is an unprecedented change in interview method. In order to adhere to social distancing protocol, in-person interviewing was officially suspended by the Census Bureau on March 20th, 2020 (U.S. Census Bureau 2020).1In-person interviewing is the preferred method of interviewing newly entering households and households that reenter the survey one year after their initial interviews. It is also utilized for around 25 percent of respondents in the other survey months who lack phone access or otherwise express a preference for an in-person interview. The propensity to be interviewed in-person is strongly associated with important sociodemographic measures. On average, respondents interviewed in-person have lower educational attainment, lower income, and are more likely to identify as non-white or Hispanic. In this paper, we document trends in nonresponse and associated changes in thedemographiccomposition of the survey during the pandemic and show that the cessation of in-person interviewing can account for these changes.We also test for evidence of an alternate channel for these patterns, namely that geographic variation in the intensity of COVID cases may have driven this increased nonresponse, but we do not find evidence that such variation was an important factor. Instead, the evidence is consistent with a causal link running from interview method to both respondent demographic characteristics and labor market outcomes.We explore the link between interview method and respondent characteristics by making use of the fact that cohorts of respondents surveyed over the same months of the pandemic vary in whether they entered the survey in a period prior to the pandemic via an in-person interviewing option or during the pandemic months when in-person interviewing was suspended. Our analyses indicate that after in-person interviewing was suspended, survey participation among prime-aged respondents in the absence of in-person interviewing was positively correlated withlabor force participationand employment. However, this was not true for all respondents. For those who initially responded to the survey only in the second or later months of their assigned survey rotation, which we use as a proxy for requiring additional effort being required on the part of field representatives to secure respondent participation, we estimate higher rates of unemployment and lower rates of labor force participation. Without narrowing the focus to prime-aged respondents, this pattern appears to go in the opposite direction due to a significant shift toward relatively older respondents entering the survey in cohorts recruited after in-person interviewing was suspended.In what we view as a conservative counterfactual exercise, we randomly draw a pool of “missing” prime-aged respondents from a subsample of these harder-to-recruit respondents in a manner that balances the composition of the overall sample selected during the pandemic months according to race/ethnicity, age, income, gender, and education. Using this alternate sample, we estimate modestly higher rates of both unemployment and labor force participation, suggesting that potential respondents who experienced employment shocks during the pandemic were less likely to participate in the survey in the absence of in-person interviewing.This study relates to a large existing literature on survey nonresponse. A comprehensive summary of issues related to nonresponse in the CPS and other key labor market and demographic surveys is beyond the scope of this article, but we point interested readers to Meyer, Mok and Sullivan (2015) for a thorough overview of the subject.2This study is among a very small body of work we are aware of investigating the effects of the pandemic on nonresponse in the CPS and the first study we are aware of to focus on how the change in interview method affected the monthly survey data.3Our primary aim in writing this article is to highlight how the interview method used in social and demographic surveys affects the characteristics of respondents. One important upshot of our results is that web-based surveys, which have been used extensively during the COVID pandemic and are used increasingly in a wide variety of settings across the social sciences, may be unlikely to reach important subgroups in the labor market and may, thus, fail to be representative of the population at large, even with survey weighting.",Jason,Kathryn,None
"1. IntroductionA minimum wage is a form of labor regulation in which a state or a local government sets and regulates the lowest amount of remuneration that employers must pay to workers. As the regulation is imposed on employers, observing their response to the minimum wage helps to predict the economic consequences of the minimum wage, such as changes in employment. For this reason, many economists have examined the impact of a minimum wage using firm or establishment-level data (Bossler and Gerner, 2020;Card and Krueger, 1994;Neumark and Wascher, 2000;Dube et al., 2007;Skedinger, 2006;Haepp and Lin, 2017;Gan et al., 2016;Luca and Luca, 2019;Fan et al., 2018).A vast majority of the existing studies employing employer-based data focus on firms that were operating before a change in the minimum wage policy arrives. In other words, the literature explored howincumbentfirms make decisions to exit from the market and to adjust their employment, labor productivity, profitability or prices in response to a change in the minimum wage (Aaronson et al., 2008;Harasztosi and Lindner, 2019;Huang et al., 2014;Stewart and Swaffield, 2008;Draca etal., 2011;Riley and Rosazza Bondibene 2017).This paper contributes to this strand of the literature by focusing on the effect of the minimum wage onnewestablishments and their characteristics. Due to the employment protection law and other adjustment costs stemming from the putty-clay nature of technology, incumbent firms are less likely swiftly to adjust certain aspects, such as their employment or capital intensity, in response to a change in the minimum wage (Sorkin, 2015;Johansen, 1959). In contrast, new firms have more flexibility when choosing an input mix between labor and capital or can even reconsider whether to enter the market in the first place (Williamson, 1968;Bachmann et al., 2014). The aspects of the minimum wage impact on new firms allow us to draw implications regarding the long-term effects of the minimum wage because the changing composition of entering firms would gradually be reflected in aggregate indicators (Aaronson et al., 2018). However, despite its importance, only a few empirical studies have validated this theoretical prediction.We exploit the introduction of the minimum wage in South Korea in 1988 to identify the impact of the minimum wage on new plants. In particular, we compare changes in the characteristics of new plants in more affected sectors with those in less affected sectors. Because the employer bears thelabor cost, the minimum wage would have more ‘bite’ on low-paying sectors. We use the remuneration to workers prior to the introduction of minimum wage to capture the heterogeneous degrees of exposure to the minimum wage across sectors.1To be more specific, we define the intensity of the treatment at the sector-level using the fraction of firms for which the average wage to workers was below the initial minimum wage. We then apply a generalized difference-in-differences framework to repeated cross-sectional data of new plants to explore the causal effect of the introduction of the minimum wage on various characteristics of new plants.First, we confirm that the introduction of the minimum wage in Korea in 1988 was a binding regulation for entering businesses. Specifically, we document that the average remuneration to workers at new plants increased as a result of the minimum wage introduction. We then show that new plants in sectors highly exposed to the minimum wage started with fewer employees. This stands in contrast with the findings ofBaek and Park (2016), who showed that the introduction of the minimum wage did not negatively affect the employment of existing plants. Another finding helps explain the smaller employment size of new plants. These firms adopted capital-intensive technology—i.e., a higher capital-to-labor ratio—as a response to the introduction of the minimum wage.We also find an improvement in labor productivity at new plants. The increased capital intensity may be part of the cause, and the positive self-selection mechanism could have been working as well; only entrepreneurs who could make more out of workers chose to enter the market after the introduction of the minimum wage. Our findings on the productivity of new plants are in line with recent findings showing that the minimum wage could enhance the overall efficiency of an economy by improving the productivity of incumbent firms and forcing less productive firms to exit the market (Riley andRosazza Bondibene 2017;Luca and Luca, 2019).2We make two distinct contributions to the firm-level studies of minimum wages. First, our results are based on data that cover all firms which have been subject to the introduction of the minimum wage. As will be explained in detail in the following sections, the minimum wage in Korea was initially applied to establishments with ten or more employees in themanufacturing sector, and our dataset covers not a sample but the universe of establishments meeting this criterion. This makes our estimates, based on the population of plants subject to the introduction, more representative than those in previous studies that use samples of firms. Most firm-level analyses tend to underrepresent the firms being affected by the minimum wage due to the nature of firm-level surveys. While those affected firms tend to be small, detailed firm-level information, such as that pertaining to revenue, wage, and employment, is much more readily available for sufficiently large firms.3Therefore, compared to previous works employing firm-level data, our work is less likely to suffer from bias stemming from the underrepresentation of firms being affected by the minimum wage.Second, to the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to examine the impact of the minimum wage on certain characteristics—i.e. employment, capital intensity, and labor productivity—of new establishments entering the market. A few papers have examined the impact of the minimum wage on firm's decisions with regard to whether or not to enter the market. Using the state minimum wage increase in the U.S.,Rohlin (2011)finds that the minimum wage negatively affects the entry of new establishments measured by the share of the new business birth. On the other hand,Aaronson et al. (2018)documents an increase in restaurant entries following the state minimum wage hikes in the U.S.4This paper explores the impact of the minimum wage on various characteristics of plants that have chosen to enter the market. This allows us to draw detailed implications regarding the long-term consequences of the introduction of the minimum wage. In particular, we document that capital deepening was as a potentially important channel by which to improve the productivity of entering firms. Therefore, the introduction of the minimum wage would have caused an increase in per-worker output at the cost of an employment reduction over the long run.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.Section 2provides information about the introduction of the minimum wage in South Korea.Section 3provides a description of the data used in the analysis, followed by a discussion on the empirical model.Section 4presents the main result along with various robustness checks.Section 5concludes the paper.",Jisun,Changkeun,WooRam
"1. IntroductionHostile sexism invokes explicitly negative beliefs about women and can be difficult to capture in survey data due to individuals’ reluctance to reveal their true beliefs. This paper develops a new measure of hostile sexism in the U.S. using publicly available Google Trends data which incorporates multiple dimensions of sexism. After explaining the construction of the index and the underlying Google data, we then use this new measure to study the association between hostile sexism and the gender wage gap.Google data provides several advantages over previous measures constructed exclusively with the General Social Survey (GSS) (Charles et al., 2009,2018). First, it identifies sexism at a more local level, providing a larger sample size compared to studies that examine labor market outcomes of women at the state level. Second, it is based on searches that occur mostly in private. In contrast, the GSS collects data with face-to-face interviews, a method that may understate an individual's sexism due to social censoring (Bound et al., 2001;Tourangeau and Yan, 2007;Berinsky, 1999,2002).The work most closely related to ours isCharles et al. (2018)who study sexism, the gender wage gap, and household decisions of women across states, measuring attitudes about women with survey responses from the General Social Survey (GSS). However, we approach the same issue with a different method for measuring sexism that relies on Google search data. This allows us to study sexism and the wage gap in a media market, a smaller geographic area than a state. This is appealing intuitively because a media market more closely resembles a local labor market than a state. Especially in large states, there can be significant variation in wage gaps andcultureacross media markets in the same state. For example, in Odessa, TX, we estimate that the average woman with the same education, occupation, andindustryearns 76 cents for every dollar the average man earns. In Austin, the average woman earns 82 cents for every dollar earned by a comparable man.There is also considerable variation in hostile sexism across media markets, with the most sexist areas having sexism levels that are threestandard deviationsabove the mean and the least sexist areas having levels that are four standard deviations below the mean. Interestingly, we find that some of the most important predictors of hostile sexism are related to the economic outcomes of men. Lower levels of college attainment for men, lower labor force participation rates, and lower rates of employment are all associated with higher levels of hostile sexism. Those same outcomes for women are also associated with sexism, but are less informative in predicting it.Overall, we find that including our newly developed index in the estimation of the wage gap between white men and white women that exists after controlling for education, occupation, industry, and age narrows the gap. This result is consistent with discrimination and we find corroborating evidence that sexism is related to discrimination by showing larger correlations in circumstances in which discrimination would be less costly. The seminal work ofBecker (1971)predicts that sexism may decrease a woman's relative wage by causing disutility among employers, co-workers, or customers who interact with women. However, discrimination could be less prevalent in competitive markets because employers who choose to pay to discriminate may be driven out. (See, for example,Blau and Khan, 2017;Janssen et al., 2016; orHirsch et al., 2010.)Consistent with the idea that the extent of discrimination that occurs is influenced by its economic costs and benefits, we find that sexism has a greater correlation with the wage gap in less competitive labor markets. We assess the competitiveness of labor markets with worker characteristics such as education, industry, and gender and find that sexism has a greater correlation with the wage gap in less competitive industries, in industries in which workers are more likely to directly interact with customers, and in industries with a smaller share of female workers. Furthermore, we also find that sexism has a greater correlation with the wage gap for workers without college education. Finally, we find that sexism is associated withlower wagesof women and somewhat weaker evidence that it is associated with higher wages of men.There may also be an indirect correlation because sexism can influence the non-labor market choices of women, such as marriage and having children and hostile sexism is correlated with these household decisions as well.Akerlof and Kranton (2000)predict that utility from household decisions depends on the extent an outcome is consistent with identity. Norms in more sexist areas may reinforce a more traditional female identity, and women in these areas may feel compelled to pursue household decisions traditionally associated with being female. (See, for example,Bertrand et al., 2015orFernandez and Fogli, 2009).1Consistent with this idea, we find that in more sexist areas, women are more likely to marry, have children, and spend more time at home relative to men.Because we exploit geographic variation in the wage gap, household decisions, and sexism within the U.S. to obtain our results, our work is also closely related to the strand of the literature that examines how household decisions and economic outcomes of women vary geographically within the U.S. Many have studied the evolution of household decisions and economic outcomes of women through time (e.g.,Bailey et al., 2014;Hsieh et al., 2019;Black and Spitz-Oener, 2010). In contrast, relatively few examine how household decisions and economic outcomes of women vary geographically within the U.S.Beaudry and Lewis (2014)study the change in the gender wage gap over the 1980 – 2000 time period using cross-city differences, attributing a decline in the wage gap over this time period to the adoption of computers.Black et al. (2014)explain the cross-city difference in the labor supply of married women with variation in commuting times.We proceed by first explaining the construction of the measures of sexism and the wage gap inSection 2.Section 3explains our methods and presents results for the correlations between sexism and the wage gap.Section 4examines the correlation between sexism and male and female wages and considers alternative explanations for our results.Section 5offers our conclusions.",Ann,Andrew,None
"1. IntroductionModels of Skill-Biased Technical Change (SBTC) have been very influential in the analysis of wageinequality. These models posit that a key driver of inequality is the increasing demand for skilled workers due to the development of new technologies (Autor, Katz, Krueger, 1998,Juhn, Murphy, Pierce, 1993,Katz, Murphy, 1992,Tinbergen, 1974,Tinbergen, 1975). If the growth in the demand for skilled workers outstrips the growth in the supply of these workers induced by rising educational attainment, then the skill premium (i.e. the wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers) will grow. Understanding the drivers of the skill premium is viewed, through the lens of these models, as being critical to our understanding of broader wage inequality patterns. A wide range of empirical work has been inspired by these models and has focused on the skill premium as a key outcome of interest.The skill premium is, however, not a comprehensive measure of wage inequality. In this paper we highlight the fact that wage inequality – and in particular the “between-skill-group” component of wage inequality – may fall even as the skill premium is rising. This is due to the fact that overall between-group inequality depends not only on the wage gap between the two skill groups, but also on the size of each group. All else equal, a rise in the skill premium increases between-group inequality. However, a rise in the skill share, all else equal, will decrease between-group inequality if the share of skilled workers is high enough. Hence, in an environment where both the skill premium and the share of skilled workers are growing (as is the case in practice), a rising skill premium may be observed alongside a decline in between-group inequality. We show that over recent years in the U.S. the between-group component of inequality has indeed declined in absolute terms, even as the skill premium has continued to rise. The same pattern is observed in many local labor markets. Increases in the skill premium therefore do not provide clear insights for understanding the rise in overall wage inequality in the U.S. economy over recent years.Our analysis uses data for the period 1980–2019 from the U.S. Census and the AmericanCommunitySurvey. We begin by verifying the well-documented rise in the skill premium and in overall wage inequality in the U.S. economy over this time period. We then perform a decomposition of the variance of log wages into a component related to differences between skill groups (i.e. those with at least some college education and those with at most a high school degree), and a component related to wage differences within skill groups. Naturally, the skill premium is unrelated to the within-group component, but one may expect that it would provide useful guidance on the evolution of the between-group component. This is not however the case. Over the most recent decade (2010–2019), in spite of the continued increase in the skill premium, between-group inequality actually fell.In order to clarify why between-group inequality can fall even as the skill premium is rising, we analyze the statistical link between these two measures. Between-group inequality depends not only on the skill premium, but also on the relative size of the two skill groups.1Holding the skill composition constant, a rise in the skill premium indeed leads to more between-group inequality. On the other hand, changes in the share of skilled workers (holding the skill premium constant) have an ambiguous effect on between-group inequality. A rise in the share of skilled workers will lead to a rise in between-group inequality if the share of skilled workers is below 50%, and will lead to a decline in between-group inequality if the share is above this threshold. This threshold is empirically relevant, given that it was crossed in the U.S. economy during the 1980s. Indeed, between 2010 and 2019, the downward pressure on between-group inequality exerted by the rising share of skilled workers empirically dominated the upward pressure on between-group inequality exerted by the rising skill premium.2Our conclusions about the lack of a direct empirical link between the skill premium and overall between-group inequality (in an environment where skill shares are changing) are valid beyond a measure based on the variance of log wages, and are also observed when using other standard measures of inequality such as the Gini or the Theil indices. We also illustrate the potentially diverging signs of the change in between-group inequality and the change in the skill premium using data at the local labor market level. We find that locations where the skill premium went up but between-group inequality fell between 2010 and 2019 account for around one-fifth of the total workforce in 2019.The SBTC framework is considered to be the “canonical model” for understanding changes in wage inequality (Acemoglu and Autor, 2011). The model is conceptually attractive and has proven to be empirically successful, at least over certain time periods and subject to some caveats (see for exampleAcemoglu, 2002,Autor, Katz, Kearney, 2008,Card, Lemieux, 2001,Carneiro, Lee, 2011,Goldin, Katz, 2008,Johnson, 1997). Even though the predictions of the SBTC model relate solely to the skill premium, it is generally perceived to be a useful model in terms of understanding (at least some of) the reasons behind the rise in overall wage inequality. For example, as summarized byAcemoglu (2002), “the recent consensus is that technical change favors more skilled workers, replaces tasks previously performed by the unskilled, and exacerbates inequality”. In a more policy-oriented setting,Mishel et al. (2013)state that “the influential “skill-biased technological change” (SBTC) explanation claims that technology raises demand for educated workers, thus allowing them to command higher wages – which in turn increases wage inequality”, whileSteelman and Weinberg (2005)argue that “overall, the best explanation for the increase in wage inequality appears to be skill-biased technical change”. While many of the papers that study wage inequality provide more comprehensive analyses that go beyond the skill premium, the usefulness of the SBTC model as a framework to understand overall wage inequality relies on the premise that the skill premium is informative about broader inequality patterns.Our paper makes two key contributions to the literature. The first is to show that, in an environment where both the skill premium and the share of skilled workers are changing, there is no direct empirical link between changes in the skill premium and changes in overall inequality patterns. As we indeed observe for the U.S. and for many local labor markets in the 2010s, between-group wage inequality may decline even as the skill premium is rising. In such cases, between-group differences are not contributing to the rise in overall inequality in spite of the increase in the skill premium. Understanding the evolution of the skill premium is therefore not necessarily in and of itself useful in order to understand why inequality is changing. Researchers and policymakers who are interested in understanding why aggregate measures of inequality are rising should be cautious about drawing inferences based on the rise in the skill premium alone.The second key contribution of the paper is to show that educational expansions will lead to changes in wage inequality that go beyond the channel that has been highlighted in SBTC models, i.e. the idea that an increase in the supply of skills decreases inequality because it puts downward pressure on the skill premium. As we show, in addition to this indirect effect through the skill premium, a change in the supply of skills has a direct effect on inequality due to the statistical properties of standard inequality measures. This direct effect may amplify or offset the indirect effect operating through the change in the skill premium. It is important for researchers and policymakers to take this additional channel into account when considering the inequality-related implications of an educational expansion policy.The key messages of this paper also apply to the more recent literature which presents a more nuanced view of the impacts of technological change by distinguishing between the skills that workers possess and the tasks that they perform (Acemoglu, Autor, 2011,Autor, Levy, Murnane, 2003,Goos, Manning, 2007). Recent work in this area, such asAcemoglu and Restrepo (2021), focuses on how the automation of certain tasks has led to changes in the wage structure across differentdemographicgroups. Similarly to the SBTC literature, their framework assumes that the size of each demographic group is fixed. Hence, while the results inAcemoglu and Restrepo (2021)provide key new insights about how the wages of different groups have evolved, if we want to understand aggregate changes in between-group wage inequality (and hence the contribution of between-group differences to overall inequality), it is crucial to also take into account how the relative size of the different groups has changed. Our results show that overall between-group inequality may fall even if the relative wage gaps across demographic groups are rising. Moreover, educational expansions and other changes in the demographic composition of the economy may have first-order effects on aggregate measures of inequality that go beyond what is captured by the relative wage structure.",Imran,Guido,None

"1. IntroductionBetween 1966 and 1976, China experienced 10 years of large-scale political upheaval: theCultural Revolution(CR). In 1966, Chairman Mao Zedong launched the CR as he believed some leaders within the party were taking China in the wrong (capitalist) direction. Mao called upon Chinese youth to purge the anti-revolutionary elements of the government, the party, and society more generally. In the initial phase, most government leaders and party officials, from the president (Shaoqi Liu) to many factory and village heads, were removed from power.The Cultural Revolution affected many aspects of contemporary Chinese society. Particularly important were the interruptions to the schooling of as many as 17 birth cohorts. In the first two to three years of the CR (1966–1968), all schools in urban China, including colleges and universities, were closed. Later, primary and junior high schools were gradually reopened. However, senior high school recruitment did not restart until 1972, while merit-based university enrolment did not resume until after the CR in 1977 (Deng, Treiman, 1997,Meng, Gregory, 2002). As a result, cohorts born between 1947 and 1963 (hereafter labelled as the CR cohort) experienced a number of years of schooling interruption and many were denied the chance to obtain a university degree.A question naturally arises as to whether, and by how much, this large-scale interruption to schooling affected theeducation levelof the next generation.1High persistence of educational attainment across generations is well established in the literature for many countries. A large number of studies, relying on different strategies, have identified causal intergenerational education links.2Among these studies,Maurin and McNally (2008)perhaps is the most relevant one to this paper. In that paper they investigated how an event occurred in France in 1968, which led to an abandonment of entrance examinations and a subsequent increase in education level of the relevant birth cohort, affected education level of the children of that birth cohort. They found that not only such a schooling expansion increased education level, occupation, and wages of the parental cohort, but such positive effects were also transmitted to children of the cohort.For China, studies on the intergenerational transmission of education focus mainly on the average intergenerational educational correlation and its change over time (see, for example,Fan, Yi, Zhang, 2021,Hertz, Jayasundera, Piraino, Selcuk, Smith, Verashchagina, 2007,Magnani, Zhu, 2015).3In this paper we intend to focus on estimating intergenerational impact of the large scale schooling interruption during the CR.4The interruptions to schooling during the CR can be thought of as a natural experiment, but, unlike other natural experiments in the area of education, schooling interruptions during the CR affected a whole generation of youth (17 birth cohorts) and for as long as one to eight years. An understanding of the intergenerational educational impact of an event of this scale is very important. Recent literature has found that historical shocks at ‘crucial junctures’ often have a long-lasting influence on a country’s economic growth path (see, for example,Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson, 2001,Iyer, 2010,Nunn, 2008), and that human capital accumulation is an important channel through which these historical events affect contemporary economic development (seeCaicedo,Waldinger, 2012, for example).Understanding the intergenerational impact of this large-scale schooling interruption can also increase our understanding of the long-lasting impacts of political upheavals in the developing world on long-run economic development through the intergenerational transmission of education. In today’s world, political upheavals, wars, and other conflicts are far from being eradicated. Children in many parts of the world are being denied the chance to go to school because of such adverse shocks. As human capital accumulation is one of the main driversof economic development, these negative schooling shocks affecting the education levels of the current generation will have an impact far beyond the immediate economic development of these war-torn economies.In this paper, we first establish the link between the interruption of parents’ schooling during the CR and their children’s educational achievement by estimating a reduced-form model. We find that children whose parents experienced more years of interrupted schooling during the CR complete fewer years of schooling and are less likely to go to university relative to their counterparts whose parents either experienced fewer years of interrupted schooling or were not affected by the CR at all.We then make attempts to gauge the causal intergenerational impact of this large scale school closure using interrupted schooling as the IV. To do so we consider two potential confounding factors. One is that the schooling closure may also captures other events which occurred to the same city-cohorts cell at the same level. Thus the correlation we found may not be the school closure effect but a combination of many different events. The second is that the interrupted schooling may affect children’s education through other channels rather than parental education.To understand whether parental schooling interruption in ourregression analysisis, in fact, capturing other adverse experiences of parents during the CR, we identify two other likely events during the CR that some or most of the parental cohorts also experienced: the first is the violence that occurred during the initial years of the CR, and the second is the incidence of the Sent-Down Youth (SDY) program, under which some of the CR cohorts were sent as teenagers to work in the countryside for many years. We try to establish that these events are unlikely to have the same degree of variation to the same city-cohort cell as the schooling interruption effect. We also add direct controls to measure the two events in the reduced-form estimation. Our results suggest that controlling for these potential confounding factors does not change the statistically significant negative relationship between parental schooling interruption during the CR and their children’s educational achievement. This supports the view that there is a strong independent parental schooling interruption effect on the education of the next generation.We then examine the potential channels through which the interrupted schooling of parents may affect children’s years of schooling. In this part of the analysis we use parental human capital-related outcome variables, including parental final education achievement, occupation, income, health, and fertility behaviours, as the dependent variables and examine whether parental schooling interruptions during the CR have an impact on each of these outcome variables. While we find significant correlations between interrupted schooling and final schooling achievement, occupation and income (no effect on health and fertility), it is likely that the correlations to income and occupation are through its impact on parental education. Indeed once controlling for their education achievement, the relationships between parental interrupted schooling and occupation and income become neither economically meaningful nor statistically significant. These results suggest that parental interrupted education impacts children’s education through parental educational achievement but not through the other variables we included.These insights give us some confidence that perhaps we could use the parental interrupted schooling during the CR as the instrument for parental education and estimate a causal intergenerational impact of the schooling interruption during the CR with 2SLS regression.5Conditional on our IV satisfy all the assumptions, the Local AverageTreatment Effect(LATE) interpretation of the IV results give us the causal intergenerational impact of the schooling interruption during the CR. This is because the LATE interpretation of our IV result compares the compliers in the treatment group whose parents’ education level was reduced only because of the schooling interruption during the CR and the compliers in the control group whose parents’ education level was not reduced because they did not experience the schooling interruption during the CR. This interpretation of our results may not be considered as the overall intergenerational transmission coefficient for China as a whole.Using a LATE interpretation of our results, we find that a one-year decrease in parents’ schooling as a result of school interruptions during the CR leads to around a 0.32-year decrease in the child’s schooling and a reduction of 4.1 percentage points in the child’s probability of obtaining a university degree. This is a large effect. Considering that on average for our children’s sample, 22% of people obtained a university degree, the reduction for the children whose parents’ education was cut short because of the schooling interruption reduced by almost a quarter. We also carry out a large number of robustness tests for potential violation of the exclusion restrictions.The main contribution of this paper is to examine the intergenerational impact of the large scale negative schooling shock during the CR. This contribution is twofold: First, although the existing literature on intergenerational education transmission has identified the causal effect, the literature often focuses on rich countries with limitedpositiveeducational shocks at the lower end of the education distribution (such as the introduction of a compulsory schooling law) (see, for example,Oreopoulos, Page, Stevens, 2006,Piopiunik, 2014). The interruptions to schooling during the Chinese CR enable us to analyse the intergenerational education consequence of a larger-scale schooling shocks (between one and eight years) at the higher end of the education distribution (by preventing people from obtaining senior high school, college, or university degrees) relative to existing literature. Second, unlike the examples in the existing literature, the schooling interruption during the CR affected educationnegatively, while compulsory schooling laws studied in the literature examinespositiveshocks. To the extent that education shocks may have asymmetric impacts, that is the effect for a given level of increase in education may differ from the same level of decrease, it is of great importance to observe the magnitude of the impact of these negative shocks, which are more in line with the experience of today’s developing world. A potential reason for asymmetrical impact could be related to the psychologists finding that negative shocks often have stronger impact on people’s behaviour than positive shocks (see, for example,Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Finkenauer, Vohs, 2001,Corns, 2018).The rest of this paper is organised as follows.Section 2describes how the Chinese Cultural Revolution affected the educational attainment of certain birth cohorts, and describes two other relevant historical events that were part of the CR experience of the parental cohorts.Section 3discusses the data.Section 4investigates the reduced form relationship and tests for potential confounding factors.Section 5examines the channels through which parental schooling interruption during the CR may affect children’s educational achievement andSection 6presents the 2SLS results and robustness tests.Section 7concludes the paper.",Xin,Guochang,None
"1. IntroductionA number of studies suggest that long-term labor supply responses to policy changes are significantly larger than short-term responses (Kleven, Schultz, 2014,Gelber, Jones, Sacks, 2020). Here, we would like to explore the underlying mechanisms behind such results. An improved understanding of what causes sluggish responses is crucial, as it will lead to better predictions of the path of labor supply responses to prospectivepolicy reforms, and may also help policy-makers to design policies to reduce sluggishness in responses.State dependence in labor supply has been discussed before, seeHaan (2010);Hyslop (1999);Prowse (2012). Positive state dependence leads to sluggish response paths to policy changes and can be reflected by the differences between short- and long-term elasticities. As pointed out byHeckman (1981), past labor market experience has a causal effect on currentlabor supply behavior. The contribution of the present paper is to provide explanations to such patterns.We develop a model that allows for different mechanisms that leads to sluggish labor supply responses to policy changes, extending the static one-period labor supply model ofDagsvik and Jia (2016). The components of sluggish responses are econometrically identified and used to simulate effects on the path of adjustment following from ataxpolicy change.In our model, we let past experiences work on current choices via three different channels: first, we let past labor market experience directly affect current period preferences for leisure (Woittiez, Kapteyn, 1998,Kubin, Prinz, 2002); second, we allow past experience to influence the job opportunities faced by the individual, through the signaling and scaring effects (Spence, 1973,Arulampalam, Booth, Taylor, 2000); and third, we allow for status quo bias in choice (Samuelson and Zeckhauser, 1988), reflecting people’s tendency to avoid change. This third component can also be related to optimization frictions or adjustment costs, seeChetty (2012),Chetty et al. (2011),Kleven and Waseem (2013), andGelber et al. (2020). Under suitable parametric assumptions, individuals’ observed working hours over time can be used to separate the contributions of these channels, while taking account of unobserved individual heterogeneity.Our model adds to a previous study byHaan (2010), who first introduced the idea of incorporating state dependence in labor supply decisions in a tax simulation setting.1We argue that disentangling the mechanisms of state dependence is important for improving the predictive power in a practical tax policy setting. More importantly, the different mechanisms of our model have different implications for individuals welfare, and call for differentlabor market policiesto reduce potential welfare losses caused by sluggishness. Whereas the first component of state dependence refers to sluggishness in preferences and therefore is attributed to individual preferences, the two other components of state dependence may result from inefficiencies in the labor market.We estimate the model on panel data of married or cohabiting females obtained from Norwegian administrative registers for the period 2003 - 2009. The model provides good predictions of observedlabor market transitionsover time. To further validate, we apply the estimated model to a holdout sample from the original data and find again that the model fits the data well. In addition, we show that the out-of-sample prediction performance of our model is on par with a much more flexible model where past labor market status enters “semi-parametrically”.We use the estimated model to simulate the effect of a tax cut and map out the time frame of labor supply adjustments. The simulation results suggest that there is an adjustment period of about five years before the full effect of the reform is approximately realized.2The first-year effect amounts to only about one third of the full effect. The predicted long-term effect is close to the predictions of a standard one-period model (without state dependence), as would be expected from the conceptual framework. We further conclude that status quo bias, which is modeled as a simple fixedswitching costin our setting, is the dominant source of sluggishness in responses to policy changes. To explore how strong the results depend on our parametric assumptions, we do a series of robustness checks where we re-estimate the model under alternative assumptions.The paper is organized as follows: The model and its empirical specification are described inSection 2, whereas the data is described inSection 3. InSection 4we discuss the estimated model and the simulation results. In particular, we describe how preference dependence, labor market constraint dependence and switching costs contribute to persistence, and present a simulated time frame of adjustment.Section 5provides a conclusion.",Zhiyang,Trine,None
"1. IntroductionThere is a long-standing debate on how unemployment affects the wage demands of unemployed job seekers (Mortensen, 1970;Feldstein & Poterba, 1984;Addison et al., 2013;Krueger & Mueller, 2016). The reservation wage – also known as the acceptance wage or the minimum asking wage – is the minimal wage level at which a job seeker would accept a job offer. Economic intuition about market clearing and supply and demand pressures predicts that asking prices decline after a period of time if a product fails to sell – both in the labor market and in any other market such as the housing market. However, the phenomenon is perhaps more relevant in the labor market because it is likely to affect unemployment levels and starting wages across the business cycle.Various job search theories explain why the optimal reservation wage might decline with unemployment duration, either because the value of leisure time and unemployment benefits decline over time (Kasper, 1967;Mortensen, 1986), because job seekers faceliquidity constraints(Crosslin & Stevens, 1977), because of human capital depreciation or because of imperfect information and learning about the expected benefits of continued job search (McCall, 1970;Burdett & Vishwanath, 1988). However, little is known about the empirical relation between unemployment duration and reservation wages. Most existing studies rely on cross-sectional data, but identification is not straightforward with such data because OLS estimates are likely to be biased because of the reverse causal pathway from reservation wages to unemployment duration, and because validinstrumental variablesare hard to find in this setting. There are somelongitudinal studiesbut almost all these studies rely on yearly data from panel surveys (Addison et al., 2009;Pannenberg, 2010;Addison et al., 2013) in which identification is complicated by the fact that a full year is a long time step in unemployment spells and that it is often difficult to account for transitions between interviews. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one study that relies on high-frequency longitudinal data. This seminal study byKrueger & Mueller (2016)contains the best available evidence – perhaps the only credible available evidence – on the effect of unemployment duration on reservation wages. Krueger and Mueller conclude that “reservation wages decline at a modest rate” and the fact that in their full sample the estimated duration effect was not statistically significant led others to interpret the Krueger and Mueller study as showing that reservation wages are not affected by unemployment duration (Schmieder et al., 2016).In this study we present original longitudinal data about the asking wages of job seekers in Belgium to identify the effect of unemployment duration on reservation wages and to investigate how this effect varies with job seekers’ characteristics. The job seekers in our data were interviewed three times with three-month intervals. The main findings are that reservation wages decline with unemployment duration by about 0.4 percent per month and we find stronger declines among men and among workers who earned high wages in their previous jobs.This study aims to contribute to various literatures. First, this study provides evidence on the decline of reservation wages with unemployment duration. The finding itself, which is essentially that asking prices are lowered over time as a product fails to sell, should be less surprising than the fact that this is the first study to provide this evidence. As we argued above, this is largely a result of challenges relating to data and methods. And although our results may appear to contradict the findings ofKrueger and Mueller (2016), we argue that they do not: their point estimates are close to ours and we will argue that a decline of the asking wage by 5 percent per year is substantial and not modest. We also contribute to the empirical literature by showing that cross-sectional estimates of the effect of unemployment duration on reservation wages are subject to substantial upward bias because exits from the unemployed population are non-random, and that adding the usual controls only partly eliminates this bias.Second, understanding the effect of unemployment duration on reservation wages is important because it provides one channel for the effect of the unemployment rate on wages across the business cycle. The findings of this study are in line with the recent literature that shows that the wages of workers starting in new jobs fall with unemployment duration (Schmieder et al., 2016) and that starting wages are much more cyclical than wages in the overall labor market that are usually characterized by wage stickiness (Pissarides, 2009;Haefke et al., 2013). Even in the presence of downward wage rigidity within jobs and within employment spells, the reservation wage channel opens up a causal pathway from unemployment to the wage bill because the mean unemployment duration is countercyclical. Our results also imply a reinterpretation of earlier findings reported in the literature on starting wages.Schmieder et al. (2016)assume that asking wages are constant over the unemployment spell (they rely onKrueger and Mueller (2016)) and therefor interpret the 0.8 percent per unemployment month fall in starting wages as a duration effect resulting from stigma, human capital depreciation, etcetera. Our estimates suggest that the duration effect on starting wages is smaller than what these authors report.Third, we report empirical evidence on the heterogeneity of the duration effect on reservation wages with respect to gender and previous wage levels. Inspired by the learning model ofBurdett and Vishwanath (1988)and assuming wage dispersion and job seekers who do not know the distribution of their wage offer function, we argue that job seekers infer the wage offer distribution using information about their previous wages (anchoring or reference-dependence) so that workers with high previous wages experience stronger declines in reservation wages as they receive signals about their wage offers during search. We speculate that heterogeneity of the duration effect by gender could result from eithergender differencesin risk-aversion and self-confidence or gender differences in the relation between unemployment duration and the disutility of being unemployed. We will show that the empirical evidence is more in line with the latter than the former explanation.The remainder of the article is structured as follows. Section 2 presents theories about the effect of unemployment duration on reservation wages in a framework of nonstationary job search models. Section 3 discusses the problem of identification of duration effects and reviews the empirical literature. Section 4 introduces the data and design of our study. Section 5 presents the results and section 6 concludes. More details about the data and additional results are included in various online appendices.",Nick,Sarah,None
"1. IntroductionA bourgeoning literature seeks to determine the underlying causes of gender pay gaps (Blau and Khan, 2017). The explanations of the gaps can be broadly classified into three strands. First, different preferences of women and men may lead them to make different job choices, or to behave differently on the job (Azmat, Ferrer, 2017,Cook, Diamond, List, Oyer,Flory, Leibbrandt, List, 2015). Second, women may be subject to greater constraints on their choices of, or flexibility within, jobs, due to, for example, household and family constraints or social norms (Bertrand, Goldin, Katz, 2010,Black, 1995,Card, Cardoso, Kline, 2016,Corcoran, Courant, Noonan, 2005,Goldin, 2014,Hardy, Kagy, 2020,Manning, 2013). Third, the gaps may reflect outright discrimination (Boring, 2017,Card, DellaVigna, Funk, Iriberri, 2020,Egan, Matvos, Seru, 2017,Goldin, Rouse, 2000,Hengel, 2018,MacNell, Driscoll, Hunt, 2015,Mengel, Sauermann, Zölitz, 2018,Sarsons, 2017,Sarsons, 2019).However, most of the literature on gender pay gaps is based on data from high-income countries. Evidence from developing countries is much sparser. This owes in large part to the lack of high-quality data in developing countries. Nevertheless, we may expect gender wage gaps to be as prevalent in developing countries. Indeed, many of the related potential drivers, such as norms, preferences and expectations, are even more pronounced in many developing countries (Duflo, 2012,Giuliano, 2018,Jayachandran, 2015,Jayachandran, 2019,World Bank, 2012).We address the data issue by using administrative records for more than 80,000 workers from 70 large garment export factories in Bangladesh. Thesalarydata come from electronic wage records of the factories, and have several advantages over more widely available labor survey data. First, our administrative data identify the worker’s precise occupation in the factory, and record wages as well as overall income. The administrative data are also likely more precise than data reported in labor surveys.1Moreover, for a subset of workers, we have very detailed skills assessments that allow us to measure wages conditional on skills. Finally, our sample of more than 80,000 workers from a single sector is much larger than is typical for labor force surveys.We analyze the gender wage gap in the Bangladeshi readymade garment (RMG) sector, a sector of central importance for development. Garment export sectors are a catalyst for both women’s participation in the wage labor market and for sustained export-led growth in low-income countries (Gereffi, 1999). In Bangladesh, the sector employs more than four million workers, around half of whom are women (Farole et al., 2017).2Even now, among women with less than university education who work in full-time wage jobs, 40 percent are employed in the garment sector (Bangladeshi Labor Force Survey (LFS), 2017). Employment opportunities in the sector have resulted in higher educational attainment and delayed marriage for young women in Bangladesh (Heath and Mobarak, 2015). Given the RMG sector’s role as the most important gateway for women into formal employment in many low-income countries, our data from Bangladesh provide an important case study of gender wage gaps in a setting representing the early stages of a typical export-led growth process.InFigure 1, we use data from the 2017 LFS to compare the wage gap in the RMG sector to other sectors of the Bangladeshi economy. The LFS data show that women employed in the RMG sector earn 10.5 percent less than their male counterparts, controlling for quadratics in education and age.Figure 1orders 11 sectors with significant female participation by the size of the gender wage gap. There are seven sectors, employing 25 percent of women working full time in these 11 sectors, with smaller gaps, and three sectors, employing 32 percent of these women, with larger gaps. Thus, the wage gap in the RMG sector represents roughly the median gap women face in the country’s economy.Download :Download high-res image (183KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. The figure shows the gender wage gaps across 11 sectors identified in the Bangladeshi Labor Force Survey 2016/17, with sectors sorted by absolute size of the wage gap. The wage gaps are estimated controlling for 2-digit industry codes, and quadratics in worker years of schooling and age interacted with dummies for each of the 11 sectors. Values in brackets show share of women in sample from sector. The sample is restricted to full-time workers with less than college education.Turning to the more precise administrative data from our 70 factories, we find an overall wage gap of around 20 percent in these factories, more than half of which is explained by the overwhelming predominance of males in management roles. When we focus on non-supervisory shop-floor workers, positions where women are well represented, the gap falls to 8 percent. To disentangle the drivers of this wage gap, we use unusually precise skills data to control for worker ability to an extent that non-experimental papers have so far struggled to do. Our ability measure captures the raw skills that the workers offer the employer, allowing us to study the extent to which the same skills provide men higher wages than women.3We estimate that skills explain up to a half of the wage gap, but a significant gap remains conditional on skills, suggesting that women capture less of the surplus their work creates.Combining data from surveys of a nearly representative subset of the workers in our 70 factories with a model, and using the fact that all workers in our sample would have started their careers in the sector with very similar entry wages, we decompose the wage gap into three parts. The first part arises fromgender differencesin within-factory salary increases, the second from differences in movements across factories, and the third from differences in the length of careers in the sector. Given the cross sectional / short panel nature of our data, the cross-factory component is not observable directly in the data, but can be estimated structurally from the model. We find that roughly half of the wage gap is attributable to men having longer careers in the sector. The other half is explained in roughly equal parts by men’s faster wage growth within factories and more frequent movement between factories. The role of cross-factory wage increases suggests that lower mobility of female workers play a part in reducing their wage growth. In line with this hypothesis, we find that, relative to men, women change factories more often in areas where many factories are located within walking distance, though we do not find a significant effect of this factory density measure on wage gaps directly.Our evidence is most consistent with gendered norms limiting women’s commuting options and possibilities to move between employers, hurting their bargaining position with factories (Manning, 2013), in line with other recent research on the constraints that commuting puts on women in South Asia (Borker, 2018,Sajjad, Anjum, Fiedl, Vyborny, 2017). We find little evidence thatpromotionor wage growth rates of women are affected by their marital or parental status, in contrast to recent evidence from higher income countries (Adda, Dustmann, Stevens, 2017,Kleven, Landais, Posch, Steinhauer, Zweimuller, 2019,Kleven, Landais, Sogaard, 2018).The fact that women in the sector earn less even conditional on precise skills measures is consistent with female workers having weaker bargaining positions vis à vis factories. Weaker bargaining positions could stem in principle from a number of alternative sources. As argued above, women may have fewer employment options outside the garment sector: 40 percent of women with less than tertiary education in full-time non-agricultural wage-employment in Bangladesh work in the RMG sector, compared with only 15 percent of men.4Hardy and Kagy (2020)document norm-based limitations on the “appropriate” jobs for women in Ghana. However, if a lack of employment options outside the sector drives the results, we might expect women to pursue their careers at least as vigorously inside the sector as men, for example by moving as much as men between factories to gain promotions. The results from our data and model do not suggest that this is the case. Our results are more consistent with women’sbargaining powerbeing weakened by broader gender norms that restrict women’s access to labor markets regardless of their marital of parental status. Such norms are still widespread in the South Asian context, and are often motivated by concerns for the safety and “modesty” of women when moving in the public (Dahr, Jain, Jayachandran, 2019,Dean, Jayachandran, 2019,Field, Pande, Rigol, Schaner, Moore, 2019,Munoz-Boudet, Petesch, Turk, Thumala, 2012).Gender norms may also directly affect work effort and career ambitions of workers of both sexes.Bertrand et al. (2015)find that many women in the U.S. curtail their career ambition so that they do not earn more than their spouses. For the Bangladeshi garment sector,Macchiavello et al. (2020)show that managers and workers of both sexes believe that women are less capable supervisors in the factories, even though objective measures do not support these beliefs. Such dynamics could reduce the career ambitions of women in the sector, resulting inlower wagegrowth both internally and through movement across factories, consistent with recent research showing that minority workers in French supermarkets reduce work effort when working under biased managers (Glover et al., 2017). Interestingly, while we do not find evidence that marital or parental status affects female worker’s career behavior, we do find that married men move more frequently between factories, consistent with “breadwinner” norms directly affecting career behaviors of men (de Linde Leonard and Stanley (2015), andSobel (2012)).We begin by describing the data we use in the analysis in more detail. We next examine the gender wage gaps, first using the full administrative sample, and then the subsample of the data that allows us to control for the worker skills. We then briefly describe the model that allows us to back out wage growth rates when workers move between factories. We conclude by discussing evidence on how marriage, childbearing, and the density of factories around worker’s workplaces affect the wage gaps and worker mobility of men and women in the sector.",Andreas,Christopher,None
"1. IntroductionThe financing of Pay-As-You-Go pension systems, where labour income taxes paid by the working population are used tofinancethe pensions of the retired population, has become a major problem for manyOECDcountries (Barr, 2006;Attanasio, Kitao, & Violante, 2007;McGrattan & Prescott, 2017). That is, the increase in life expectancy (Attanasio et al., 2007;Kontis, Bennett, Mathers, Foreman, & Ezzati, 2017;OECD, 2019b), and decrease in fertility to below the replacement level (Attanasio et al., 2007;OECD, 2019b) has led to rising dependency ratios. The most commonly suggested solution for this financing problem is to make people work longer (Breyer & Kifmann, 2002;Munnell & Sass, 2009;Maestas & Zissimopoulos, 2010;Harkin, 2012;Kitao, 2014). When comparing the employment rate of individuals over 55 with those aged 25–54 in various developed countries, there is still a significant margin for improvement in this respect. In the United States, for example, 63.5% of the population aged 55–64 and 33.0% of the population aged 65 to 69 was employed in 2018, which is remarkably less than the 79.9% employment rate for the population aged 25–54 (OECD, 2019a).1In practice, however, raising the employment rate of people aged 55 and over is not that straightforward. There are various explanations for the lower employment rates of people over 55, one of which isage discriminationin hiring (Boissonneault et al., 2020). Using correspondence field experiments, previous research has found considerable evidence of age discrimination in hiring in the United States (Johnson & Neumark, 1997;Lahey, 2008;Farber, Silverman, & von Wachter, 2016;Neumark, Burn, & Button, 2016,2019;Neumark, Burn, Button, & Chehras, 2019;Neumark, 2018), the United Kingdom (Riach & Rich, 2010;Tinsley, 2012;Riach, 2015;Drydakis, MacDonald, Bozani, & Chiotis, 2017), and the European Union (Ahmed, Andersson, & Hammarstedt 2012;Riach, 2015;Baert, Norga, Thuy, & Van Hecke, 2016;Carlsson & Eriksson, 2019).2,3Hiring discrimination pushes older individuals, especially those who are unemployed (Deelen, de Graaf-Zijl, & van den Berge, 2018) or unsatisfied with their current job (Scharn, Sewdas, Boot, Huisman, Lindeboom, & Van Der Beek, 2018) out of the labour market, forcing many to claim retirement benefits before full retirement age. To induce and enable people to work longer, it is, therefore, crucial to understand the mechanisms underlying age discrimination and craft policies to relax them.In the economic literature, two main theoretical models provide explanations as to why employers may discriminate against older workers when hiring new employees:Arrow's (1973)model of statistical discrimination andBecker's (1957)model of taste-based discrimination. The model of statistical discrimination posits that age discrimination in the hiring process is driven by stereotypes concerning older workers’ productivity (Arrow, 1973). When making hiring decisions, recruiters often have a limited amount of information about a job applicant, such as their age, gender,education level, and work experience. As a result, they might use this limited information as a signal for other, unobserved characteristics concerning the applicant's productivity (Arrow, 1973;Spence, 1973;Vishwanath, 1989;Blanchard & Diamond, 1994;Moscarini, 1997;Kroft, Lange, & Notowidigo, 2013;Eriksson & Rooth, 2014). Following this theory, older applicants might not be hired because older age signals, for example, lower levels of physical ability (Schmidt & Boland, 1986;Hummert, Garstka, Shaner, & Strahm, 1994;Finkelstein, Burke, & Raju, 1995;Kroon et al., 2018) or flexibility (Warr & Pennington, 1993;AARP 2000;Büsch, Dahl, & Dittrich, 2009;McCann & Keaton, 2013).4On the other hand, the taste-based discrimination model indicates that employers discriminate against older job applicants because they, their employees, or their customers might experience a decrease in utility when interacting with older workers (Becker, 1957).5,6Although some of the correspondence studies mentioned above also tried to test these models empirically (e.g.,Baert et al., 2016;Drydakis et al., 2017;Lahey, 2008;Neumark, Burn, & Button, 2016), the results of these studies concerning the explanations for age discrimination in hiring are often inconclusive. While correspondence field experiments are a great tool to measure hiring discrimination convincingly, the method is less suitable to gain insights into the causes of this discrimination. In recent years, however, researchers have used alternative ways to gain insights into the underlying mechanisms of age discrimination in hiring. In particular,Richardson, Webb, Webber, and Smith (2013)use a lab experiment to test which stereotypes predict discrimination. More concretely, they design a vignette experiment in which participants evaluate fictitious job applicants, of whom age is varied, for a hypothetical job vacancy. The authors examine whether a fictitious applicant's age affects perceptions about their reliability,sociability, trainability, and intellectual competence and to which extent these perceptions play a mediating role in the hiring decisions of the participants. They find that, although an applicant's age negatively affects evaluations of her or his trainability and sociability, the effect of the applicant's age on hiring evaluations was not mediated by these work-related competencies. Additionally,Burn, Button, Corella, and Neumark (2019)experimentally test whether the ageist language in job ads is correlated with hiring discrimination. These authors find that language related to ageist stereotypes is over-represented in the phrases selected by machine learning algorithms as predicting discrimination. Older workers are more likely to be discriminated against when job ads use sentences related to physical ability, technology, or communication skills.7Evidence of stereotypes’ effect on the hiring of older workers can also be found insurvey research. BothTaylor and Walker (1998),Carlsson and Eriksson (2019), andJensen, De Tavernier and Nielsen (2019)surveyed employers, respectively in the UK, Sweden, and Denmark, regarding their perceptions of older workers and different workplace practices, among which recruitment practices. Where bothTaylor and Walker (1998)andCarlsson and Eriksson (2019)found an association between different perceptions of older workers (e.g., concerning their trainability) and recruitment practices,Jensen et al. (2019)did not. Furthermore, Turek and Henkens (Turek and Henkens, 2020) used employer surveys from Poland to assess how likely employers are to recruit people over 50 years old and studied how the probability of inviting an older candidate to an interview varied as the skill requirements of the job post changed. These authors observed that older candidates were less likely to be hired in jobs requiring computer-, physical-, social-, creative-, and training skills.8In the present article, we contribute to this literature by using a state-of-the-art vignette experiment in line withRichardson et al. (2013). In our experiment, we show participants with genuine hiring experience a series of fictitious résumés, varying over the applicants' age, gender, and some other attributes, which they had to evaluate for a hypothetical vacancy. The participants had to assess these fictitious profiles concerning various characteristics related to the productivity-related stigma identified inBurn et al.'s (2019)literature review and potential negative attitudes towards collaborating with older employees in line with the theory of taste-based discrimination. Consequentially, our design enables us to identify employer perceptions and attitudes towards older job candidates and to explore the degree to which these perceptions and attitudes act as drivers of potential age discrimination. We randomly assigned subjects to review applicants for one of eight job vacancies varying along four different dimensions, i.e., the required degree of skills, the level of customer contact, the required amount of physical effort, and the required level of technological knowledge associated with the job, allowing us to investigate the heterogeneity in unequal treatment of older job applicants by these four dimensions. Furthermore, we surveyed our participants concerning their background characteristics to identify the possible moderating effects of these characteristics on age discrimination in hiring (e.g., participants' age and the percentage of older workers employed by their companies).This study improves on the previous literature in four meaningful ways. First, we investigate a more systematic and extensive set of explanations for age discrimination in hiring compared to previous research (i.e., all factors identified by the existing theoretical and survey-based literature). While former contributions restricted their attention to a limited set of stereotypes (e.g.,Richardson et al. (2013)and the studies based on employer surveys, mentioned before), our research takes into account (almost) all stereotypes identified byBurn et al. (2019)in their literature review. Additionally, while none of the former contributions investigates (nor controls for) taste-based discrimination (Becker, 1957), we consider employers’, customers’, and employees’ potential negative attitudes towards collaborating with older employees as an alternative explanation for age-based discrimination in hiring. Second, we also use a more systematic method (i.e., a vignette experiment and a thorough mediation analysis) to analyse the relative importance of these factors compared to most existing studies (except forRichardson et al. (2013)). Third, in our study, we account for many more of the pathways through which individual characteristics andjob characteristicsinteract with age. The vignette experiment used byRichardson et al. (2013)and the surveys byTaylor and Walker (1998),Carlsson and Eriksson (2019), and Turek and Henkens (2019) only questioned employers about a limited number of characteristics involving the job (in the case ofTaylor and Walker (1998)and Turek and Henkens (2019)) or the individual participants (in the case ofTaylor and Walker (1998),Carlsson and Eriksson (2019), andRichardson et al. (2013)) as moderators of age discrimination. Lastly, our vignette study is an improvement overRichardson et al. (2013)in terms of scale and external validity. Our study features 2000 candidate evaluations (a much larger sample than that employed byRichardson et al. (2013)), studies both men and women (whereasRichardson et al. (2013)only used male applicants), considers several different types of job vacancies (Richardson et al. (2013)used only a position in the IT industry), and studies the behaviour of actual human resource managers (whileRichardson et al. (2013)mainly worked with students).9,10Taken together, these improvements provide scholars and policymakers with more general insights into the mechanisms underlying age discrimination (as well as its moderators).",Hannah,Ian,Stijn
"1. IntroductionArtificial Intelligence (AI) is possibly the most promising technology currently in development which has potential applications across a wide range ofindustriesand functions. While it offers the possibility to increase productivity and create new jobs, it may also replace humans to reduce costs (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2019) and potentially lead to lower labor share, increasedinequality(Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2018b), and disruptions in many industries (Mateos-Garcia, 2019). Hence, its impact is a matter of immense interest to both economists and policymakers – especially in economies with declining productivity growth and shrinking working-age populations. Still, little in known about the level of adoption of AI technology across firms, its penetration within occupations, and its impact in the labor market.In this paper, we start by providing some key facts on the demand for AI skills in the United States across occupations and industries and show how it has evolved over the last decade. Most interestingly, we examine which firm characteristics predict the demand for AI skills to give a sense of the types of firms that may have adopted AI earlier. Finally, we estimate a wage premium for AI skills and analyse how wages and skills in other jobs change when the firm demands AI-skilled labor.Indeed, the extent to which firms use AI remains a black box. The firm-level adoption of AI is hard to estimate since it would require a specific knowledge on the type of technology the firm uses in the production function. However, because the application of AI technology by firms requires a highly-specialized human capital (Gofman and Jin, 2020), the demand for labor with AI skills can proxy for the use of AI technology. Based on this insight, our approach is to track the demand for AI skills using data on the online job vacancies collected by Burning Glass Technologies (BGT) which contain nearly a universe of online job postings since 2010.BGT provides us with detailed information on the skill set of each vacancy and a broad range of other details about the job and the employer.1AI vacancies are identified using a list of skills that are directly associated with the knowledge of AI technology or the ability to use AI-related software, such as ”artificial intelligence”, ”machine vision”, ”deep learning” or ”speech recognition”. Thus, an “AI vacancy” is a vacancy that requires at least one AI-related skill from this list. Our main measure of the demand for AI skills is the ratio of AI job postings over the total number of job postings. The unique qualities of the BGT data allow us to follow the demand for AI skills across industries, occupations, firms, and even job titles.First, we document a fast growth in the demand for AI skills over time. We show that the demand for AI skills grew 4 times over the period from 2010 to 2019. Firms are striving to hire more employees with AI-related skills, especially in the last three years, and the demand is still gaining momentum. As expected, the demand for AI skills is highest in the Information sector, but it is also high in Professional Services, Administrative and Support Services, andFinancesectors. Among occupations, Computer and Mathematical occupations present the highest intensity of the demand for AI skills, followed by Architecture and Engineering and Science occupations. In sum, the data shows that the demand for AI skills has been growing fast across a wide range of sectors and occupations – it is not limited to the IT-related industries and jobs.Second, we explore which firm characteristics explain the demand for AI skills and find that large firms with high cash holdings and high R&D investments on average demand AI skills in their vacancies more. These results are consistent with the predictions of a simple theoretical framework that examines which firm-level characteristics predict the automation with the use of AI algorithms, and consequently the demand for AI skills. We develop this framework by extending the task-based model ofAcemoglu and Restrepo (2018a). In our framework, firms differ in terms of size, productivity, and the fixed cost of automation, and thus will tend to automate with AI differently. Specifically, the framework predicts that large scale firms will have a higher demand for AI-skilled labor, while firms facing higher fixed costs of automation will demand less AI skills.Next, we move on to exploring the variation in pay across vacancies and estimate the wage premium associated with AI skills. Job postings demanding AI skills do offer an 11% premium within the same firm and a 5% premium within the same job title. We explore how the premium differs across industries and occupations. As expected from the fast growing demand for AI skills in Computer and Mathematical jobs, there is a substantial wage premium for AI skills in these vacancies. Indeed, AI is a valuable IT-related skill. But to our surprise, we find that the premium for AI skills is the highest for Management occupations, suggesting that in these jobs AI skills carry even more value for employers. This evidence of an especially high premium for AI skills in Management jobs highlights that the AI’s value may rest in its combination with a broader organizational change.Finally, we explore whether firms demanding AI-skilled labor show evidence of changing demand for other, non-AI, jobs in terms of wages and skill requirements. We find that firms demanding AI skills more intensively tend to offer higher salaries in their non-AI vacancies. This evidence is consistent with a view that AI technology can facilitate the demand for high-skilled jobs complementing it. To further explore how non-AI jobs change with the rise in the demand for AI, we examine which skill groups go hand-in-hand with AI skills in the firm. We find that jobs that require Software, Cognitive, Social, Project Management, and People Management skills are complementary to AI jobs, while jobs requiring Customer Service skills show evidence of being substituted by AI.The results presented in the paper provide one of the first aggregate pieces of evidence on the diffusion of AI technology in the United States. Overall, our findings on the pervasiveness of the demand for AI-skilled labor across industries and occupations suggest that AI is likely to be a driver of significant transformations in the labor market over the next decades. These results can inform policymakers deciding on future education andlabor market policiesas well as workers deciding about investing in their human capital that is necessary to fit the profile of the employee of the future.The paper aims to contribute to the literature analysing the effect of new technologies on labor market outcomes. Our primary contribution is to the recent empirical literature analysing the effect of AI technology on labor.Felten et al. (2019)find that occupations impacted by advances in AI experience a small positive change in wages, and no change in employment. Using the job vacancies data,Acemoglu et al. (2020)show that AI changes the composition of occupations in firms, but there is no evidence of a massive job destruction due to AI.Alderucci et al. (2020)document that the number of firm’s AI-relatedpatentsis positively related to the firm’s employment growth rate, but also is positively associated with the within-firm wage inequality. We complement this literature by providing evidence on the wage premium for AI skills and on how the intensity of the demand for AI skills is related to the average wages and skills required in non-AI vacancies.Brynjolfsson et al. (2018),Felten et al. (2019), andWebb (2019)build indices showing the impact of developments in AI technology on the occupations’ task content. The authors are able to identify jobs in which tasks will be most and least affected by AI. These indices are useful to classify jobs that are more or less likely to be transformed and replaced by AI technology. We complement this literature by documenting the extent of the actual demand for AI-skilled labor across firms, industries, and occupations.We also complement the research on the effect of technology on labor by providing a simple theoretical framework helping to understand which firms are more likely to automate with AI and thus more likely to demand AI skills in their vacancies. In this, we build on the task-based framework ofAcemoglu and Restrepo (2018b). The authors provide a model that shows how machines can have a dual effect on labor markets. On the one hand, machines can replace human labor in some tasks and thus reduce labor share, employment, and wages; on the other hand, they can promote the creation of new tasks in which labor has a comparative advantage and may counteract the replacement effect. This framework with a specific application to AI is used inAcemoglu and Restrepo (2018a). Other relevant conceptual work on labor displacement as the result of automation includesAcemoglu and Autor (2011),Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014), andBenzell et al. (2015).This paper also contributes to a recent but fast-growing stream of literature that documents the diffusion of AI technology (Acemoglu, Autor, Hazell, Restrepo, 2020,Blair, Deming, 2020,Goldfarb, Taska, Teodoridis, 2019,Goldfarb, Taska, Teodoridis, 2020). Our descriptive evidence on the demand for AI skills is close to the findings in the paper ofGoldfarb et al. (2019)that documents how widespread AI skills are in job postings across industries and occupations. However, our analysis differs substantially from this research. The authors’ primary focus lies in comparing AI with a few other new technologies and on identifying whether AI has features of a general-purpose technology (Bresnahan and Trajtenberg, 1995). Also, the authors abstract from studying the predictors of the AI adoption or the effects that the demand for AI labor has on other jobs, while our paper addresses these questions. Our descriptive evidence is also consistent with a supplementary part of the analysis inBlair and Deming (2020)that shows an increase in the demand for machine learning skills in job postings. However, their research focuses on the jobs’ upskilling after theGreat Recession, and hence we do not intersect in the rest of the analysis. Also,Acemoglu et al. (2020)show a descriptive evidence on the growth of the share of AI vacancies across industry sectors and across geographies. Their analysis beyond the descriptive part, however, has a different focus than ours and we consider our findings highly complementary. The authors show that firms demanding AI skills change the composition of occupations within the firms by hiring less for jobs at risk of replacement by AI. At the same time, we provide evidence on the wage effects and skills requirements in non-AI jobs in firms demanding AI specialists.Finally, we contribute to the research analysing the evolution in the demand for various skills and premium for skills. We used papers ofDeming and Kahn (2018)andDeming and Noray (2019)to define 10 non-AI skills for which we control in our regressions. We contribute to this literature by comparing the premium for AI skills vis-as-vis premia for other skills and by documenting complementarities between AI and non-AI skills.This paper proceeds as follows.Section 2describes our data and sample and outlines the procedure we use to estimate the demand for AI skills.Section 3presents the descriptive analysis on the demand for AI skills in the overall U.S. economy and across industries and occupations. It also shows which firm characteristics predict the demand for AI skills.Section 4analyses the wage premium for AI skills.Section 5presents evidence on the effect of the firm-level demand for AI skills on non-AI vacancies.Section 6concludes.",Liudmila,José,Mireia
"1. IntroductionSince the Great Financial Crisis, UK productivity and output have fallen significantly and mysteriously behind their pre-2008 trend in both levels and growth rates (Barnett, Batten, Chiu, Franklin, Sebastia-Barriel, et al., 2014,Bryson, Forth, 2015,Haldane, 2017), as shown inFig. 1. There has been controversy over what has caused this dramatic change in the behaviour of productivity. One explanation of the puzzle, introduced byPatterson et al. (2016), is that occupational mismatch between workers and available jobs is causing a significant fraction, up to two-thirds, of the productivity puzzle.Download :Download high-res image (160KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. The aggregate output per worker in the UK (seasonally adjusted). Trend lines are fit using data from 1990Q1–2007Q4. Source: ONS.This paper uses new, big data on job vacancies to show occupational mismatch does not in fact explain a significant proportion of the UK productivity puzzle. Our vacancy data side-steps issues with the administrative vacancy data previously used to look at the contribution of mismatch to the productivity puzzle and we also include all of the UK in our analysis. We use a combination of vacancy stock data and official data to construct counter-factual paths for output, productivity, and employment that show what would have happened in the absence of occupational mismatch.Using new data, we fundamentally challenge the view that the productivity puzzle is largely driven by occupational mismatch. We find no evidence of mismatch contributing to the productivity puzzle. Our results are driven by significant heterogeneity in how easily workers are matched to jobs across occupations.The UK productivity puzzle remains stubbornly difficult to solve. A range of mismeasurement or output revision issues have been offered as explanations, including the way intangibles such as research and development are measured (Haskel et al., 2015), and erroneous pre-crisis measurements of the productivity of thefinancesector. Of a 16 percentage point puzzle in level terms in 2013Q4,Barnett et al. (2014b)suggest that mismeasurement could explain 4 percentage points, while another 6 to 9 could be accounted for by investment in intangibles, high rates of firm survival, and impaired resource allocation. The UK’s high wage flexibility has also been touted as a possible causePessoa and Van Reenen (2014),Blundell et al. (2014): the fall in the price of labour coupled with the rise in the cost of capital has meant a fall in the capital to labour ratio and an associated fall in labour productivity. Cyclical explanations, includingcredit constraints(Riley et al., 2014) and labour hoarding (Martin and Rowthorn, 2012), struggle to explain the long duration of below trend productivity growth.The analysis of mismatch in the labour market has a long history that begins with the indices ofNickell (1982),Lilien (1982), andJackman and Roper (1987). The seminal work on how mismatch can negatively affect aggregate labour market outcomes is byŞahin et al. (2014)and looks at how mismatch can add to unemployment. This framework gives counter-factuals for unemployment, productivity, and output in a scenario in which a social planner can optimally assign jobseekers to reduce mismatch.Smith (2012)uses a similar framework to examine unemployment dynamics and, using UK JobCentre Plus data, estimates that around half of the rise in UK unemployment during the crisis was due to mismatch. We also adopt this mismatch framework.The closest paper to ours isPatterson et al. (2016)who use the framework ofŞahin et al. (2014)to show that the difference between the counter-factual and realised paths for productivity explain a significant fraction of the UK productivity puzzle between 2007 and 2012; namely up to two thirds of the deviation from the trend-growth in labour productivity. A substantial boost in aggregate output is also shown to result from eliminating occupational mismatch.We make several key contributions relative to the existing literature. We revisit previous work byPatterson et al. (2016)suggesting that occupational mismatch is a major contributor to the UK’s productivity puzzle, finding a different conclusion. We extend the previous analysis to cover the whole of the UK1and use a measure of unemployment based on designated national statistics rather than the less accurate Jobseeker Claimant Count. We demonstrate how naturally occurring2big data on online job ads can be used formacroeconomiclabour market analysis. We create new estimates of matching elasticity and matching efficiency by occupation. Finally, we uncover significant labour market heterogeneity across occupations that was not apparent in similar previous work.The structure of the paper is as follows:Section 2describes the online job vacancies data and the other data we use to construct counter-factuals,Section 3describes the search andmatching theorywe use and the mismatch theory ofŞahin et al. (2014), andSection 4presents results. Results are split into the estimation of the matching function (Section 4.1), counter-factual simulations (Section 4.3), and accounting for differences with the results ofPatterson et al. (2016)(Section 4.4).Section 5concludes.",Arthur,Bradley,David
"1. IntroductionThere are unanswered questions about individuals who are increasingly stringing together multiple jobs in order to make ends meet. Although these discussions often refer to the growing gig economy, they also refer to individuals holding two or more wage andsalaryjobs. Knowing the level and trend of multiple jobholding, as well as the characteristics and earnings of multiple johbolders, is important to economists and policymakers.The dominant source of data for research and published information on multiple jobholders in the United States is the Current Population Survey (CPS). The CPS is the nation's premier representative survey of households, providing monthly labor market statistics. Widely cited statistics from the CPS show that the multiple jobholding rate in the U.S has been declining during the past several decades. Yet several recent studies have suggested that multiple jobholding is underreported in the CPS, and this underreporting may be getting worse over time.1In this article, we propose a new data source for research and analyses about multiple jobholding – the U.S. Census Bureau's Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD). The LEHD are administrative data that nearly encompass the population of workers. The use of LEHD administrative data is both a uniquely-defining characteristic of our research and a significant advantage in quantifying and analyzing multiple jobholding in the U.S. In addition to the large sample size, two additional characteristics of LEHD data are: 1) LEHD combinesdemographicdata from various sources to develop workforce information by characteristics such as gender and age, and 2) LEHD has earnings information for each job that an individual holds.The reference period of the LEHD data is a calendar quarter. As such, the first step in our research is to define multiple jobholding based upon the available information in the quarterly administrative data. We define a multiple jobholder as an individual who holds two or more jobs in a quarter and at least one of the jobs is a long-lasting stable job.We find that over the 1996:Q2 – 2018:Q1 time period, the LEHD multiple jobholding rate averages 7.2 percent of all employed individuals. This multiple jobholding rate has been rising during the past several decades, from 6.8 percent in 1996:Q2 to 7.8 percent in 2018:Q1. The LEHD multiple jobholding rate is cyclical, declining in both the 2001 and the 2007-2009 recessions. These patterns are different from those measured by the CPS: the CPS multiple jobholding rate is much lower in magnitude, and the CPS multiple jobholding rate is declining over the past several decades with no evidence of cyclicality. The rising trend of multiple jobholding in the LEHD, in contrast to the declining trend in the CPS, suggests that multiple jobholding is becoming more important in the U.S. economy than previously known.We introduce a data generating process (DGP) to understand the differences between the LEHD and the CPS multiple jobholding rates. We model the different definitions, the different coverages, the different reference periods (time aggregation), and differences in reporting behavior that exist between the LEHD and the CPS. This model of the DGP indicates that short duration jobs that are missed by the CPS's one-week reference period are more important than definition and coverage differences, and this model suggests that increasing survey misreporting in the CPS plays an important role.The LEHD has earnings information for all jobs, rather than just the primary job as in the CPS. We document that earnings from all secondary jobs are, on average, 27.8 percent of a multiple jobholder's total quarterly earnings. This 27.8 percent is essentially constant over time with little if any evidence of cyclicality. We also document that the multiple jobholding rate exhibits an inverted-U shape across the range of total full-quarter earnings, and at every percentile of total earnings, multiple jobholding provides on average more than 25 percent of total earnings for individuals who are multiple jobholders. In aregression analysisthat controls for age, gender, andindustry, multiple jobholders earn more at all jobs than do non-multiple jobholders.The roadmap of this paper is as follows. We begin with a literature review of multiple jobholding. In section three, we discuss how to define multiple jobholding from quarterly administrative data that does not contain information on hours worked or weeks worked during the quarter. We provide a thorough description of the data in section four. In section five, we quantify the 7.2 percent average LEHD multiple jobholding rate, and we document the trend and cyclicality of the LEHD multiple jobholding measure. We compare the LEHD multiple jobholding measure to the CPS multiple jobholding measure in section six. We present gender and age data, industry data, and duration data in section seven. Section eight looks at earnings, including both simple tabulations and a regression analysis. Section nine offers some concluding thoughts and suggestions for next steps.",Keith,James,None
"1. IntroductionThe recent escalation of the US-China trade war resulted in a substantial disruption of trade between the two countries. US imports from China hit a 5-year low in 2019, ranging about 33bn US dollars below their value from 2015. US exports to China were about 9.5bn dollars below 2015-levels. Comparing shipments in 2016-2017 to the years 2018-2019, US imports from China decreased by 14-23 percent, while US shipments to China decreased by 15-27 percent.1Disruptions are not limited to aggregate trade flows. While exposed exporting firms have to cope with an artificial increase in the price of their sold products, importers have to pay more for their purchases or find new suppliers. Both see their competitiveness eroding and lower sales and profits force them to re-optimize their cost structure and investment decisions, including theirlabor demand.In this paper, we use newly collected information from online job-vacancy postings in China to document firm-level reactions to the trade war reflected in labor demand. By observing information on the number and content of online job ads between May and November 2019, we capture the most recent round of US tariff increases and Chinese retaliation. This enables us to evaluate responses to the trade war at an early stage of firms’ hiring process along several dimensions. Our results provide novel insights into the propagation of short-term responses by firms to adversetrade policyshocks.An important feature of the trade war is that the introduction of new tariffs did not follow a rule-based rationale in the context of conventionalWTOanti-dumping or safeguarding regulations. In fact, the US administration first based tariffs on national security interests, but later raised tariffs on goods even if they were not currently imported from China (Bown, Kolb, 2019,Handley, Kamal, Monarch, 2020). This lends support to a key identifying assumption: that Chinese firms had no influence on the timing, magnitude and coverage of the tariffs.2Moreover, magnitude and product coverage of the additional (discriminatory) tariffs have been unseen for decades, which enables us to study a policy experiment that is unique in contemporaryeconomic history.Indeed, the theoretical linkages between tariffs and firms’ labor demand can be manifold and predicted outcomes are potentially ambiguous. Some intuition can be derived from trade models with heterogeneous firms and imperfect product-market competition (Melitz, 2003,Melitz, Ottaviano, 2008,Melitz, Trefler, 2012). Depending on modeling assumptions and initial product-market conditions, tariffs are either fully or partly passed through to customers, while lower profits follow in both cases. With (partial) pass-through and downward-sloping demand, exporters face lower sales, downscale their production, and might eventually demand less labor. Moreover, (partial) absorption of a tariff-induced price increase might result in lowersalaryoffers by firms, as they seek to preserve market access (and restore profit margins) through lowering their factor costs.3Adjustments by firms facing new tariffs on their imports after Chinese retaliation are more difficult to predict. On the one hand, firms sourcingintermediate inputsfrom the US might switch to alternative (second best) suppliers, which potentially undermines their competitivenessvis-à-visless exposed firms (e.g.,Handley et al., 2020b). Fewer job postings could reflect an ensuing decline in labor demand. On the other hand, instead of switching suppliers, exposed firms could manufacture the tariffed inputs themselves and hire additional workers.4This is reminiscent of the rationale proclaimed by the US administration when it imposed additional tariffs on Chinese goods: higher tariffs might boost domestic production and employment through import substitution.At least two elements complicate such reasoning. First, the US-China trade war has created substantial economic uncertainty among Chinese firms (Benguria et al., 2020). While selection, timing, and magnitude of additional tariffs did not follow any rule-based mechanism, also their duration is unknown. Second, job vacancy postings signal firms’ willingness to investnowinto theirfutureworkforce. With the future being uncertain, such investments might be delayed, so that a positive employment effect becomes less likely to materialize in the short run (Bloom, Bond, Van Reenen, 2007,Ghosal, Ye, 2015,Stein, Stone). Further complicating elements relate to the characteristics of the Chinese labor market itself. Depending on the intensity at which firms compete for qualified staff, there might be more or less room for adjustments in published salary offers. Similarly, formal and informal labor market institutions that determine the costs of hiring, firing and delayed hiring might influence firms’ adjustments.Against this background, we present reduced-form evidence on the effects of tariffs on firms’ labor demand, as reflected by their publicly posted hiring announcements via a major Chinese job-portal. A main advantage of using online jobadvertisementsis their rich information that is typically not observable in firm-level census or survey data. This includes, for instance, the number of open positions and their change over time, as well as the average wage offered for a particular job. Besides this, we are able to observe different forms of non-wage compensation (such as bonuses, subsidies and insurance packages) as well as specifications of job prerequisites (e.g., previous working experience or educational background). Our identification strategy relies on a firm-specific measure of exposure to the trade war, which we construct based on pre-trade war information about firms’ product mix and trade partners in a matched firm-level customs data set.Our panel regression results suggest that firms exposed to higher US tariffs responded by posting systematically fewer job ads. The reduction amounts to about 2.4-3.2 percent for an average firm, which adds up to about 5,600 fewer job postings in total. A negative impact is also found for the average wage compensation indicated in the job ads. Our estimated 0.5 percent decrease corresponds to about $70 lower earnings per year in an average job offer. Such reductions appear to be balanced out partly by other forms of compensation, such as bonuses. This might suggest that firms shift towards more flexible and performance-based compensation schemes as they face higher US tariffs. Moreover, we find a robust and negative relationship between US-tariff exposure and the required educational background, while requirements on previous job experience do not show any statistically significant response. The reduction in educational-background requirements might reflect that US tariffs disproportionately targeted relatively skill-intensive products.5In contrast to these findings, we do not detect any comparable systematic adjustments to China’s retaliatory tariffs on US products. While the sign of the corresponding coefficient tends to be the opposite of that for US tariffs, their magnitude and precision are substantially lower. This is similar to findings of related studies in the US, where import tariffs fail to create new jobs or boostmanufacturing sectorperformance (e.g.Flaaen, Pierce,Goswami). In fact, any notable producer gains seem to be either offset by costlier imported inputs, or by the recent (and potentially temporary) nature of these tariffs that prevents firms from investing into new jobs quickly.6Our main findings are maintained after submitting our results to a number of robustness checks, although we document some differential responses across firms of different size, ownership, or product mix.Overall, the US-China trade war appears to hurt both firms and job-seekers, creating losers on both sides. This conclusion is in line and complementary to existing studies on the trade war, which focus primarily on the US economy (Amiti, Kong, Weinstein, 2020,Amiti, Redding, Weinstein,Fajgelbaum, Goldberg, Kennedy, Khandelwal, 2020,Flaaen, Pierce,Goswami,Handley, Kamal, Monarch, 2020,Waugh, 2019) or on trade and investment effects in third countries (Egger, Zhu, 2019,Meinen, Schulte, Cigna, Steinhoff, 2019). We add to this literature by shedding light on the experience of Chinese importers and exporters during this episode of political escalation.Our reduced-form evidence provides novel insights on short-term labor-market effects of the trade war. While existing studies typically rely on more aggregatedregional labor marketdata, we uncover another layer by observing firm-level adjustments in the number and content of vacancy postings over time. Our findings are also similar toJavorcik et al. (2019), who report decreasing online-hiring activity in the UK after theBrexitreferendum, due to increased trade policy uncertainty. While their approach relies on differential industry-sector and regional exposure to a major trade-policy shock, we explicitly control for aggregate variation along these dimensions to document more nuanced adjustmentswithinfirms. Our findings corroborate evidence on the adverse effects of international political disintegration and uncertainty on economic activity. Finally, by using newly collected data from a Chinese job board, our study also contributes to a growing literature which uses online vacancy postings to analyze and compare labor market dynamics in different countries, as we will discuss in the following section.The rest of the paper is organized as follows.Section 2introduces and describes our data in detail, along with the sample used to carry out the analysis of the present paper and its potential limitations. InSection 3, we provide additional background information on key events of the trade war, which are relevant for our identification.Section 4explains our empirical strategy to identify the impact of tariffs on labor demand.Section 5presents our results, including robustness checks, explorations of heterogeneous responses across firms, and a short discussion of the implications of our findings.Section 6concludes.",Chuan,Karsten,Mingzhi
"1. IntroductionUnderstanding how peer composition affects individual outcomes is crucial for a better insight into human capital accumulation and designing more effectiveeducational policies. The existence ofpeer effectshas important implications regarding the optimal allocation of students between schools and classrooms. In the context of higher education, peer effects are essential for guiding affirmative action policies and financing and admission policies in a broader sense. Moreover, peer effects may impact long-term outcomes that extend well beyond schools.We contribute to the literature by providing evidence of ability peer effects in higher education on short- and long-term educational and labor market outcomes. To do so, we take advantage of longitudinal data over twelve years with detailed information on incoming students from the prestigious Faculty of Economics, Business, and Accounting at the University of Sao Paulo (USP) in Brazil.In general, the empirical estimation of peer effects is challenging, as discussed byManski (1993). First, groups of students are usually not formed randomly. Therefore, individuals belonging to the same group may have similar unobservable characteristics that confound the estimation of peer effects. Second, while an individual affects her peers’ outcomes, she is also affected by the group’s results, generating a problem of simultaneity. A solution for dealing with the simultaneity problem is to consider predetermined or time-invariant group characteristics, such as previousacademic performanceor gender.Our identification strategy relies on students’ exogenous allocation across classrooms and idiosyncratic variation in the average ability of different cohorts (defined as a combination of admission year, major, and daytime or evening stream) of students across time, similar toHoxby (2000).1Since students cannot control their cohort or classroom composition, we use the natural fluctuation in cohort characteristics to estimate how peers affect individual outcomes such as performance and dropout in university, graduateschool enrollment, and formal labor market participation up to 15 years after college admission. As we have information on students’ predetermined ability through university admission exam records, we can also deal with the simultaneity problem. While we do not detect any impact of ability peer effects on academic results at university, we find that peers impact graduate school enrollment and labor market participation in the long run.Other studies attempt to estimate peer effects by seeking exogenous sources of variation in group formation to deal with the selection problem.2In higher education, many studies take advantage of students’ random allocation to dorms to estimate how roommates affect academic outcomes. Some examples areSacerdote (2001),Zimmerman (2003),Foster (2006),Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2006),Griffith and Rask (2014)andMehta et al. (2019)who use data from American universities;Han and Li (2009),Brunello et al. (2010), andJain and Kapoor (2015)who use data from China, Italy and India, respectively. Overall, the evidence points to mixed results. Some studies find positive peer effects on performance. In contrast, other studies find effects that are not significant or vary according to students’ characteristics or the outcome.3However, it is not clear that roommates’ peer effects are comparable to those occurring in larger groups or classrooms, which are likely to be the most relevant unit of analysis when considering ability peer effects. Moreover, in higher education, measuring peer effects can be particularly challenging. In most countries, the random assignment of students to classrooms is not usual. In the United States, first-year students typically do not choose a field of study and take classes in different subjects, making the definition of the relevant peer group challenging.Arcidiacono and Nicholson (2005)circumvent some of these issues by focusing on students who graduated from U.S. medical schools between 1996 and 1998. When controlling for school-specificfixed effectsto deal with endogenous group formation, they find that peers do not significantly impact individuals’ performance and specialty choices. Additionally, a few studies use the random allocation of students to peer groups in military settings in the U.S. to study ability peer effects in higher education, such asLyle, 2007,Lyle, 2009,Carrell et al. (2009)andBrady et al. (2017). They find evidence of significant peer effects, although impacts are heterogeneous and depend on groups’ definitions. However, in the military, the interaction between peers is more intense than in many higher education settings, as students also live together.Outside of the U.S., there is some evidence of significant ability peer effects in higher education in environments where teaching methods rely on group work, such as tutorials. Using data from the Netherlands,Feld and Zölitz (2017)andBooij et al. (2017)take advantage of students’ random assignment to workgroups and tutorials to study ability peer effects in university. While results differ for low- and high-ability students, both studies find that medium-ability students benefit from brighter peers. Using data from a selective French university where class size is small (25 to 30 students),Brodaty and Gurgand (2016)show that teacher effects are strong, but peer group effects are negligible.Notably, a growing literature shows that peer effects in school may affect other long-term dimensions such as college (Bifulco, Fletcher, Jung Oh, Ross, 2014,Bifulco, Fletcher, Ross, 2011,Fischer, 2017,Mouganie, Wang, 2020) and labor market outcomes (Black, Devereux, Salvanes, 2013,Carrell, Hoekstra, Kuka, 2018), as well as future interactions between ethnic groups (Carrell et al., 2019). In contrast,Anelli and Peri (2017)find that high-school peers have little impact on major choice, college completion, and labor market outcomes. For college students, there is also evidence that peers impact major choice (Giorgi et al., 2010).In contrast with most of the literature, we analyze a higher education context where teachers adopt more traditional teaching methods, such as lectures, and student interactions mainly occur during class time, as undergrads rarely live in university dormitories or shared apartments.4Our institutional context is particularly favorable to investigate the presence of classroom peer effects. The undergraduate office automatically enrolls first-semester students in a set of compulsory courses. Students attend classes either with their entire cohort or in one of two sections based on their first names. Within a cohort, sections are constant, and students attend the same courses, ensuring a high degree of interaction. First-semester undergrads also participate in many social events in the first week of classes, which guarantees that they get to know each other before courses begin. Importantly, undergraduates have no discretion over which courses or sections to attend in the first semester. The first-semester allocation highly correlates with subsequent class allocation, even if some students may switch sections and choose some elective courses in later terms.Apart from tracking students up to 15 years after university admission, our data also allows us to consider different sets of peers for a given student and address the challenge of measuring peer influences at the appropriate level. In general, capturing the proper level ofpeer interactionin higher education is not straightforward. Indeed,Sacerdote (2011)hypothesizes that the inability to identify the correct peer group could be behind the non-significant effects found in most of the literature. In our main specification, we restrict the peer group to students who attended courses together. For course outcomes, we also take a more restrictive approach and perform an analysis at the student-course level using course fixed effects. Finally, we also present results by employing a broad definition of peers, composed of the entire cohort.Our results show that when students’ interactions occur mostly in classroom environments, peer effects in contemporary academic outcomes are bound to be negligible. However, peers seem to affect individuals’ prospects regarding graduate school enrollment and labor market participation. Onestandard deviationincrease in cohort peer ability increases labor market participation by up to 15 percentage points and the probability of enrolling in graduate school by 10 to 12 percentage points.5Thus, our paper contributes to the literature on peer effects in higher education in several critical dimensions. First, compared to most existing studies, ours has the advantage of relying on a long span of longitudinal data, which allows us to follow students 15 years after university admission, and a larger sample. Second, the nature of peer effects we study, mainly driven by interactions between students attending classes together, is relevant for many higher education settings and likely to be considerably different from contexts where students also live together. Third, by considering different sets of peers, we can better deal with peer influences at the appropriate level. Finally, we provide evidence of classroom peer effects from a prestigious university in Brazil. This setting makes our study quite relevant from a policy perspective, given that Brazilian (selective) universities have extensively implemented affirmative action policies in the last few years.We structure this paper as follows. InSection 2, we provide background information on higher education in Brazil, the University of Sao Paulo (USP), and its Faculty of Economics, Business, and Accounting. InSection 3, we present the data and somedescriptive statistics. We present our empirical strategy and results inSections 4and5, respectively.Section 6concludes.",Andrea,Fernanda,None
"1. IntroductionMost organizations seek to design employee evaluation systems that encourage workers to put forth maximal effort, that permit differentiated rewards andsanctionsfor various performance levels, and that stimulate employee skill development through feedback and learning generated as part of the appraisal process. The purported mechanisms through which present-day teacher evaluation design might improve the average quality of instruction are through (a) incentives to motivate teachers, (b) tools for retaining high-performing teachers and deselecting low-performing ones, (c) shifts to the labor market pool of prospective teachers, and (d) feedback mechanisms to improve the skills of current teachers. Most consequential teacher evaluation policies attempt to achieve a blend of these accountability and skill developmental goals. While these multiple goals are firmly part of the design of most modern teacher evaluation policies, researchers and policy makers have reflected surprisingly little on their interactions.In this paper, I argue that a clear explication of the tenets underlying teacher evaluation policies is critical to estimating their likelihood of success. I develop a stylized model ofteacher effectivenessthat includes improvement from evaluation. My model’s central contribution is to highlight that improvement in teaching effectiveness from evaluation depends not only on the independent effects of accountability pressures and skill development supports, but also on their interaction. From this model, I identify several conditions that determine the effectiveness of potential teacher evaluation policy designs.I then develop a set of simple simulations to assess the effect of policies that emphasize the growth or accountability aims of teacher evaluation. To do so, I draw on the current causal evidence base to select parameters related to my model’s production function. I build on prior work fromStaiger and Rockoff (2010),Winters and Cowen (2013)andRothstein (2015). I extend their simulations by allowing for teachers to improve their skills as a result of evaluation, by assessing the effect of evaluation policies on outcomes beyond test scores, and by explicitly modeling potential interactions between accountability pressures and skill development in teacher evaluation designs. As Rothstein notes, models that incorporate selection and deselection effects into and out of the profession are ill-suited to evaluation by experiment (either random assignment or natural) because their effects take a decade or more to manifest. This fact motivates my simulation.My simulations shed light not only on particular conditions that determine the effectiveness of teacher evaluation, but also provide insights on four broad typologies of teacher evaluation frameworks relevant to many countries’ policy-making contexts. I model the effects of teacher evaluation policies that (i) impose accountability pressures on all teachers; (ii) provide developmental supports for all teachers; (iii) combine accountability pressures with skill development supports for all teachers; and (iv) apply accountability pressures to one group of teachers and skill development supports to a different group. I describe the third policy design as treating evaluation for accountability and evaluation for growth as complements and the fourth design as treating them as substitutes.My simulation’s central contribution is that, given reasonable parameter bounds derived from the causal literature, the potential benefits of an evaluation system that applies accountability and growth supports to all teachers are dwarfed by its potential risks. My simulations synthesize Winters and Cowen’s(2013)conclusion that the hypothesized benefits of dismissing less effective teachers are muted by natural attrition with Rothstein’s(2015)insights that a skill-constrained supply of prospective teachers influences optimal dismissal rates. The critical insights my simulations contribute beyond theirs and those byStaiger and Rockoff (2010)is that evaluation may improve teacher effectiveness in addition to serving as a mechanism for dismissal. In fact, the most important determinants for improving average teacher effectiveness are the rate of skill development from ongoing supervisor feedback over several years and thelabor supply effectsof evaluation policies, both of which are empirically indeterminate. Even if evaluation for growth and evaluation for accountability have cross-productivity effects, the upper-bounds on these effects are relatively low. Thus, evaluation policies that jointly maximize skill development rates of current teachers and starting skill endowments of future teachers hold the most promise. As a result, I conclude that an evaluation policy that treats evaluation for growth and accountability as substitutes rather than complements is more likely, across various plausible scenarios, to produce improved student outcomes.",David,None,None
"1. IntroductionEconomic theoryoffers two alternative views of occupational licensing with opposing implications for minority workers. The first view sees licensing as a barrier to entry that restricts labor supply and, thereby, reduces employment and raises incumbents’ wages (Friedman, 1962,Stigler, 1971). This supply-restricting effect is likely to be felt if the qualification requirements for licensing are more stringent than the labor market equilibrium qualification level in the absence of licensing. According to this view, licensing diminishes the employment opportunities of minorities if minorities have a harder time fulfilling the qualification requirements (Kleiner, 2000). The alternative view sees licensing as a signal of quality, revealing information that would otherwise be costly for employers and customers to obtain (Akerlof, 1970,Leland, 1979). This quality-assuring effect is likely to arise in the presence of asymmetric information. If theinformation asymmetrygives rise to statistical discrimination, licensing may then enhance the labor market outcome of minorities (Blair, Chung, 2018,Law, Marks, 2009).This paper studies two types of licenses for one occupation in the U.S. – dental assistants (DAs) – to provide evidence that the labor market effects of occupational licensing vary, depending on therestrictivenessof the licensing requirements and the extent of pre-existing information asymmetries regarding professionals’ competence.DAs are now the most numerous members of a dental team, outnumbering dentists by three to one. As a relatively new and fast-growing occupation, their scope of practice has gradually expanded over time. Licensing requirements for DAs depend on their job scope. At the entry level, all states allow DAs to perform entry-level procedures (legally referred to as “basic supportive procedures”); six states and D.C. require an entry-level license for these procedures. Beyond the entry-level procedures, DAs’ scope of practice has varied substantially over time and across states. One particular procedure, taking X-rays, is now recognized by both the Dictionary of Occupational Titles and O*NET as a task routinely performed by DAs, yet it was allowed only through gradual scope-of-practice (SOP) expansions. At present, all states allow DAs to take X-rays; twenty states require a state-issued X-ray permit for this procedure. This paper focuses on the effects of these three regulations over the last four decades: the X-ray SOP expansion, the X-ray permit, and the entry-level license.To study the effects of the regulations on the labor market, I use a generalized difference-in-differences (DiD) method exploiting variations across states in the timing of the regulations. I use the Current Population Survey (CPS) to obtain a sample of DAs and their hourly wages between 1979 and 2019. This data is supplemented with the decennial Census 1980–2000 and the AmericanCommunitySurvey (ACS) 2001–2019 for robustness, as the Census/ACS data offer a larger sample of minority DAs. However, Census/ACS does not provide hourly wages, but only annual earnings for all jobs held in the past 12 months, which may include income from other occupations.The CPS estimates suggest that, in the absence of any occupational regulation, minority DAs’ wages are 11 percent lower than the wages of non-Hispanic white DAs with similar observable characteristics. The X-ray SOP expansion has large, positive, statistically significant effects on both average wages and the employment of DAs. The X-ray permit requirement, although having small effects on overall wages and employment, is associated with a statistically significant 8 percent reduction in the size of the wage gap between non-Hispanic whites and minorities (henceforth, the racial wage gap). In other words, the X-ray permit requirement reduces the racial wage gap. This income-equalizing effect is also found in the Census/ACS data, where the X-ray permit requirement reduces the annual income gap between non-Hispanic whites and minorities by 6 percent.In contrast, although estimates for the effects of entry-level licensing are sensitive to the choice of dataset and the inclusion of state-specific trends, all estimates point to either a widening of the racial wage gap or null effects on the racial wage gap. The CPS estimates suggest that entry-level licensing has small, statistically non-significant effects on average wages but is associated with a 5 to 6 percent increase in the size of the racial wage gap (albeit only statistically significant at the 10 percent level).1The Census/ACS estimates suggest small effects (less than 1 percent) on both average earnings and the racial income gap.What could account for the differences between the effects of the entry-level license and the X-ray permit? Recent empirical research suggests that licensing with stringent qualification requirements reduces the representation of minorities in an occupation, plausibly because minorities have more difficulties fulfilling the licensing requirements (Cathles, Harrington, Krynski, 2010,Federman, Harrington, Krynski, 2006). Several recent papers also show that licensing can improve the employment opportunities of minorities and reduce the racial/gender wage gap if the license reveals information that would otherwise be difficult to ascertain (Blair, Chung, 2018,Law, Marks, 2009,Law, Marks, 2017).2Could these mechanisms be at play here? Entry-level procedures involve low risk and are always performed when the supervising dentist is present in the treatment room; in contrast, DAs usually take X-rays without the dentist’s immediate presence in the treatment room (Bird and Robinson, 2017, p. 35). X-ray procedures also involve higher risk due to the harm of radiation exposure and the potential for cross-contamination of equipment and environmental surfaces (Bird and Robinson, 2017, p. 629). Hence, a DA’s competence is particularly crucial for X-ray procedures. To the extent that information regarding minorities’ competence is noisier than information about non-minorities’ (Bartik, Nelson, 2019,Card, Giuliano, 2016), a risk-averse dentist-employer is less likely to hire a minority for X-ray procedures. The X-ray permit requires at least six hours of training and the passage of an exam on dental radiography. These requirements provide some assurance about the DA’s ability to take X-rays and can plausibly alleviate statistical discrimination by reducing the information asymmetry between dentists and minority DAs.To test these mechanisms, I investigate whether the possession of an alternative signal of ability changes the effects of the X-ray permit.Arcidiacono et al. (2010)show that statistical discrimination is less severe among college graduates because post-secondary education allows individuals to signal their ability to potential employers. I split the sample in two, the DAs who have never attended college and those who have had some post-secondary education, to examine how the effects of licensing vary by DAs’education level. The wage-equalizing effects of the X-ray permit are larger for DAs who have never attended college than for DAs who have attended some college, suggesting that the X-ray permit serves as a signal of quality that substitutes the education signal.I also estimate the effects of the education and exam requirements associated with entry-level and X-ray procedures. Results suggest that, for the X-ray procedures, education/exam requirements alone, unaccompanied by a state-issued license, do not reduce the racial wage gap. For entry-level procedures, the education requirement alone poses enough of an entry barrier for DAs, amounting to a barrier similar to that of the entry-level license requirement.3This is consistent withCathles et al. (2010)andFederman et al. (2006)’s findings that stringent qualification requirements reduce the representation of minorities in an occupation.Event studygraphs suggest that, like the entry-level license, the X-ray permit also has supply-restricting effects in the first few years after implementation. However, as minority DAs acquire the X-ray permit over time, the quality-signaling effects of the permit overcome the supply-restricting effects.These findings relate to a body of research that shows licensing can be a barrier to entry that restricts labor supply (Friedman, Kuznets, 1945,Gittleman, Klee, Kleiner, 2018,Kleiner, 2013,Kleiner, Kudrle, 2000,Kugler, Sauer, 2005,Thornton, Timmons, 2013,Timmons, Thornton, 2008). These previous studies all find large positive effects of licensing on incumbents’ earnings. In contrast, the entry-level licensing studied here has small effects on average DA wages or income. This difference is not surprising as DAs are regulated by dentists – their employers – whereas the occupations in previous studies are mostly self-regulated. I find suggestive evidence that all three regulations are associated with positive, albeit statistically non-significant, changes in dentists’ hourly earnings, which attests to the hypothesis that the regulations were adopted by dentists for the benefit of dentists.Section 2.4explores the factors that influence the timing of the regulations.Recent empirical research also shows that licensing can enhance efficiency by reducing information asymmetry, particularly in markets where quality information is important but difficult to ascertain (Anderson, Brown, Charles, Rees, 2020,Law, Kim, 2005). A separate strand of research shows that information regarding minorities’ ability or qualification is often noisier, which gives rises to statistical discrimination; policies such as standardized testing, drug tests, credit checks, and criminal background checks can enhance minority workers’ educational (Card and Giuliano, 2016) and employment opportunities (Bartik, Nelson, 2019,Doleac, Hansen, 2020,Wozniak, 2015) by providing more precise information than what would be revealed in an interview. Recent papers have shown that occupational licensing can also enhance minority workers’ labor market outcomes by reducing information asymmetries regarding worker quality (Blair, Chung, 2018,Law, Marks, 2009,Law, Marks, 2017).This paper also contributes to the study of the labor markets for non-physician health workers (Thurston, Libby, 2000,Thurston, Libby, 2002) and adds to a growing literature on SOP regulations for non-physician health workers (Kleiner, Marier, Park, Wing, 2016,Kleiner, Park, 2010,Markowitz, Adams, Lewitt, Dunlop, 2017,Stange, 2014,Wanchek, 2010,Wing, Marier, 2014). I review these papers inSection 2. The main difference between DAs and the occupations in previous studies – nurse practitioners (NPs), physician assistants (PAs), and hygienists – is that DAs have lessautonomyand are complements for dentists in the production function (DeVany, Gramm, Saving, Smithson, 1982,Thurston, Libby, 2002). In contrast, the previously studied occupations are imperfect substitutes for doctors/dentists (Kleiner, Marier, Park, Wing, 2016,Wing, Marier, 2014).",Xing,None,None
"1. IntroductionHow do individuals adjust their work hours in response to a permanent wage change? Knowing the responsiveness of labor supply to wage change is important to understand the implications of policies affecting individuals’ budget constraint. These policies range fromtaxandwelfare programsto the alteration of institutional features of labor markets. Consequently, this understanding is crucial for the effective design of tax/transfer systems, and for assessing theefficiency costsof labor income taxation (Keane, 2011). The Congressional Budget Office periodically reviews different types of labor supply elasticities to understand the changes in the economy’s supply of labor in response to adjustments in federal tax rates (McClelland, Mok, 2012,Reichling, Whalen, 2012, andRussek et al., 1996).1Another motivation to study labor supply response to wage change is to explain the secular decline in the work hours per worker over last many decades (Kopytov et al., 2020). One of the explanations for this decline has been that rising productivity and wages reduce work hours through the income effect.The theoretical prediction for the labor supply response to a permanent-unanticipated wage change is ambiguous. In the standard neoclassical static model of labor supply, a permanent wage change is associated with income and substitution effects which go in opposite directions. For example, in the case of a wage increase, the income effect causes work hours to decrease while the substitution effect causes work hours to increase. The net effect of the wage increase thus depends on the strength of the income and substitution effects.2There are two common problems in observing the labor supply response to a permanent wage change. First, it is difficult to find an exogenous permanent wage change. Wage changes, either within or across jobs, may be correlated with employee unobservable characteristics or may be accompanied by changes in responsibilities, both of which may affect work hours directly. A second issue is the worker’s inflexibility in adjusting work hours as documented inBlundell et al. (2008)andGolden, Lonnie and Gebreselassie, Tesfayi (2007). The work hours are typically decided by the employer and can rarely be adjusted by the worker. Thus, even with an exogenous wage change, we may not observe people changing work hours. Field experiments that generate a permanent change in the wage would be financially infeasible.Several papers have studied the labor supply response to a permanent wage change by estimating the Marshallian elasticity, which is the percentage change in work hours for a one percent change in wage. The literature has differentiated elasticities for males and women as they are considered to have very different elasticities. One stream of literature has addressed the wage endogeneity issue by either using instruments for wages or employing a difference-in-difference framework by using exogenous wage changes generated by tax policy changes (Blundell, Duncan, Meghir, 1998,Eissa, 1995and other studies mentioned inBlundell and Macurdy (1999)). Most of these studies have found small and positive Marshallian elasticities for men: a simple average of Marshallian elasticities in 23 studies reviewed inKeane (2011)is +0.06 (median = +0.05).In another stream of literature, researchers have focused on case studies of groups of workers in which a clear source of wage variation can be identified, and where individuals are free to choose work hours. Although the results are less generalizable, the knowledge of workers and institutional details make these studies attractive.3Boulier (1979)studies the labor supply of self-employed dentists using cross-sectional data collected in 1968 and finds that their annual hours are negatively related to the price of a tooth extraction with an elasticity of -0.049.Doran (2014)exploits the fare change in 2004 to estimate the wage elasticity of daily hours for New York City taxicab drivers to be +0.05.Pencavel (2015)studies the labor supply of workers at plywood mills in the Pacific Northwest from 1968 to 1986. Modeling these co-operative mills as a group of self-employed individuals who collectively decide their hours worked, the estimated elasticity of supply of hours worked is -0.3, although it is imprecisely estimated.In the same vein,Ashenfelter et al. (2010)study the hours response to wage changes of New York City (NYC) taxicab drivers by estimating their long-run elasticity of labor supply.4These drivers were free to choose their work hours, and they experienced a change in their hourly wage due to changes in the fare structure in March 1996 and May 2004. Comparing the driving behavior of the taxis before and after the fare change, the authors estimate long-run wage elasticity for drivers who own their taxis to be -0.2. Thus, for a 10% increase in hourly wage, the drivers decreased their work hours by 2%.However, there are some limitations of the data used inAshenfelter et al. (2010), which might have resulted in biased estimates. First, the estimation uses only a small sample of taxi owners who self-report driving the taxis and do not rent them to other drivers. The study thus provides no information on the choices of the large majority of taxi drivers who are employed as contract workers by taxi companies (around 90% of all drivers). These “renter-drivers” may have a different response to wage changes as compared to the “owner-drivers”. For example, since the owner-drivers experienced an additional income effect due to an increase in medallion prices after the fare change, they are likely to reduce their work hours by a larger amount. The estimated owner-driver elasticity will thus be more negative as compared to that of the renters (and average driver). Second, even for the subsample of owner-drivers who self-report driving their taxis exclusively, the medallionfixed effectmay not be a good proxy for driver fixed effect if these drivers rent the taxi to other drivers. In such a case, the medallion hours and wage may not correspond to owner hours and wage which can affect the elasticity estimate. For example, in the extreme case when owners only rent their taxis and don’t drive themselves, the estimation sample would comprise only renters, who experienced smaller income effects and hence a smaller reduction in hours. Thus, the estimated elasticity will be biased in the positive direction as compared to the true elasticity of owner-drivers. Lastly, the estimation uses miles driven as a proxy for work hours. If the driver waiting time, such as time spent stuck in traffic or queuing at the airport, is significant, or if the driver-specific speed changes as the fare changes, this can cause measurement error in work hours leading to division bias (Borjas (1980)). In presence of division bias, the estimated elasticity will be a weighted average of true elasticity and minus one. Since these biases go in opposite directions, the net effect on the estimate is ambiguous.In this paper, I estimate the long-run elasticity of labor supply of NYC taxicab drivers using a new dataset and fare change that allows me to overcome the data limitations inAshenfelter et al. (2010). I use electronically recorded trip records for the universe of NYC yellow cab drivers that enables me to (a) estimate the elasticity using the population of all the drivers (instead of a subsample of owner-drivers), (b) directly control for driver fixed effects (instead of medallion fixed effects), and (c) use exact measures of work hours (instead of using miles driven as a proxy for hours). I use a fixed effectsinstrumental variableregression model to estimate the wage elasticity. The instrument that causes an exogenous change in the wage is the city-wide fare change that affected all drivers in the data. I first show that the fare change resulted in increased driver hourly wages. I then use the fare change indicator as an instrument for the wage in a labor supply equation to estimate the wage elasticity. The identification relies on the exogeneity of the fare change to the labor supply equation. I argue that this assumption holds because the fare change is unlikely to affect driver preferences to work through any other path than wage change.The results show that the fare change increased driver hourly wages by 12.8% (≈$3.5) and decreased monthly work hours by 6.4% (≈11 hours), leading to a long-run wage elasticity of -0.5: for a 10%increasein the hourly wage, the driversdecreasetheir work hours by 5%. Thus, the income effect dominates the substitution effect. Drivers respond both at the intensive and extensive margins by driving fewer shifts and fewer hours per shift. At the market level, this decrease in work hours only marginally affects the aggregate supply of rides, as the slack created by the decrease in work hours by drivers is compensated by new drivers entering the market. Since the model essentially does a “before-after” comparison within drivers, one needs to be careful about other changes occuring along with the fare change that might have influenced work hours or wages. I discuss such changes and argue that their effect on elasticity estimate is likely to be small.Since positive elasticities are theoretically possible, I explore the heterogeneity of the elasticity estimate by hours quantiles and driver types. The quantile estimates suggest that while the elasticities are likely negative for the entire distribution of hours, the magnitude is smaller at lower quantiles. This is plausible as the lower hours quantiles experienced a smaller income effect and hence reduce work hours by a smaller amount. Comparing subsamples of drivers, I find negative elasticities for full-time and part-time drivers, drivers who drive during different times of the day, renter-drivers and owner-drivers. Thus, the heterogeneity analysis reveals that elasticity is negative for different hours quantiles and several driver types. I do not find positive elasticities.The long-run elasticity estimate inAshenfelter et al. (2010)(-0.2) is smaller in magnitude than what this paper finds (-0.5). I explore if the data limitations inAshenfelter et al. (2010)can explain the difference. I replicate results inAshenfelter et al. (2010)using the same data source and estimate a smaller-in-magnitude elasticity of -0.4. I find that focusing on owner-drivers moves the elasticity estimate in the negative direction. These owner-drivers experience the same wage increase but reduce the work hours by a larger amount, likely because of the additional income effect due to an increase in the medallion price. On the other hand, I find that the bias due to using medallion fixed effect as a proxy for driver fixed effect moves the elasticity estimate in the positive direction. Owner-drivers are frequently observed renting their taxis, which creates the possibility that the medallion hours and wage may not correspond to owner hours and wage. Elasticity estimates with and without these shared taxis are different, suggesting this bias is substantial. Furthermore, I show (theoretically) that pooling the owners and renters using medallion fixed effect causes the estimated hours change and elasticity to be biased in the positive direction. Lastly, the division bias is found to be negligible, suggesting that the instrumental variable estimation strategy corrects for this bias. Thus, if the bias due to using medallion fixed effect as a proxy for driver fixed effect is strong, it is possible to get an estimate that is smaller in magnitude than what I find, explaining the difference in estimates.The study makes several contributions to the labor supply literature. First, the results add to the literature on Marshallian labor supply elasticity of men by presenting an elasticity estimate that is more negative than many previous studies. Second, the analysis shows that the previous estimate using data from the same labor market may have been biased due to data limitations. Third, the negative elasticity supports the argument that rising wages and the resulting income effect is one of the reasons for the decline in the work hours per worker over many decades. Finally, the results provide insights into the labor supply of individuals in anindustrythat is largely under scrutiny due to the entry of Uber and other ride-sharing apps, and one that has been extensively studied by labor economists.The most direct policy implication of the results is for designing policies regulating ride-sharing apps that affect the permanent wages of taxicab drivers. Focusing on NYC taxicab drivers limits generalizing the elasticity for other workers. However, since the drivers are almost exclusively males, a case can be made that the elasticity estimate is closer to the elasticity of males. More studies like these in other settings should provide useful evidence for policymakers to improve tax/ transfer systems.",Swapnil,None,None
"1. IntroductionAssortativematingon education —that individuals with similar education match with one another more frequently than would be expected under a random mating pattern or that partners’ educational attainments are positively correlated— has been studied in economics since the seminal work byBecker (1973). Many social scientists have documented a strong and increasing educational homogamy1(e.g.,Bruze, 2011,Chiappori, Iyigun, Weiss, 2009,Greenwood, Guner, Kocharkov, Santos, 2014,Schwartz, Mare, 2005). More recently,Gihleb and Lang (2016)have warned about the use of inappropriate statistical techniques when studying the evolution of assortative mating over time, and concluded that there is little evidence supporting an increase in educational homogamy.Mogstad et al. (2019)have shown that assortative mating has been declining over time among college graduates, whereas the low-educated have been increasingly sorting into internally homogeneous marriages.In this paper, we focus on the impact of education on spousal education. We estimate linear matching functions derived from a parsimonious matching model where individuals match on human capital. The model allows us to derive linear matching functions which link wife’s (resp. husband’s) human capital to husband’s (resp. wife’s) human capital. In practice, human capital is not observed by the econometrician, and instead we use years of education. Under classical measurement error, it is well-known that the OLS regression estimate of the slope of wife’s (resp. husband’s) education on husband’s (resp. wife’s) education will be biased towards zero. A validinstrumental variablecan fix this, and help us in dealing with other endogeneity concerns such as omitted variables bias (e.g., if individuals match on other characteristics correlated with human capital). We use genetic data to obtain potentially valid instrumental variables and infer the causal effect of education on spousal education using a sample of couples from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS).We use a polygenic score for educational attainment as an instrumental variable for educational attainment. The polygenic score —a single quantitative measure ofgenetic predispositionbased on genetic variants present in the entire genome (seePlomin et al., 2009)— is constructed to predict educational attainment of married individuals using data from the HRS, building upon the recent findings from a large scale GWAS of educational attainment (Lee et al., 2018), and following recent work in economics (Barth, Papageorge, Thom, 2020,Papageorge, Thom, 2020).2We are the first to rely on molecular data to exploit potential exogenous variation in educational attainment, allowing for the possibility that our instrument violates the exogeneity condition using the approach byConley et al. (2012), in a marriage market application. Our OLS estimates of the matching functions show that an additional year in husband’s (resp. wife’s) education is associated with an average increase of 0.41 years in wife’s education (resp. 0.63 years in husband’s education). We also find that a onestandard deviationincrease in husband’s educational attainment polygenic score (EA PGS) increases husband’s education by about 0.64 years and wife’s education by about half of this magnitude, 0.31. Our IV (2SLS) estimates, using husband’s EA PGS as the (excluded) instrument for wife’s education, suggest that an additional year in husband’s education increases wife’s education by about 0.49 years. Using wife’s EA PGS as the excluded instrument for husband’s education, we find that an additional year in wife’s education increases husband’s education by about 0.76 years.While the educational attainment polygenic score (EA PGS) is a relevant instrument for education and is considered to be randomly assigned at conception (Mendelian randomization), at least after accounting for population stratification, this is a necessary butnota sufficient condition to use the EA PGS as a valid instrumental variable.3Polygenic scores for spousal education may affect own education above and beyond their effects on spousal education, and hence violate the exclusion restriction.4Greater polygenic propensity for educational attainment has been linked to higher cognitive aptitude, self-control, and interpersonal skills in childhood (Belsky, Moffitt, Corcoran, Domingue, Harrington, Hogan, Houts, Ramrakha, Sugden, Williams, Poulton, Caspi, 2016,Rabinowitz, Kuo, Felder, Musci, Bettencourt, Benke, Sisto, Smail, Uhl, Maher, Kouzis, Ialongo, 2019), and more recently, to larger brains (Elliott et al., 2018),5but also to lower scores on the ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) index (de Zeeuw et al., 2014). Since intelligence and personality, amongst other attributes, are relevant in the marriage market (Dupuy, Galichon, 2014,Lundberg, 2012), it is important to assess the consequences of departing from the exclusion restriction.To allow for the possibility that the exogeneity condition is violated, we relax the exclusion restriction following the approach inConley et al. (2012)whose implementation is carefully discussed byClarke and Matta (2018).6In particular, we allow for the own EA PGS to have a direct effect on spousal education. We cannot rule out a positive causal effect of husband’s education on wife’s education so long as a one standard deviation increase in husband’s EA PGS directly increases wife’s education by less than 0.2 years. Similarly, we cannot rule out a positive causal effect of wife’s education on husband’s education so long as a one standard deviation increase in wife’s EA PGS directly increases husband’s education by less than 0.3 years.There is an extensive literature on education in the marriage market, which studies empirical matching patterns or the effect of education, via adjusting for observable characteristics (Chiappori, Oreffice, Quintana-Domeque, 2016,Oreffice, Quintana-Domeque, 2010), using within-siblings or within-twins variation (Huang et al., 2009) or instrumental variables (Lefgren and McIntyre, 2006).Larsen et al. (2015)claim that using the variation in male educational attainment induced by the WWII G.I. Bill may provide the most transparent identification strategy to date: their findings suggest that the additional education received by returning veterans caused them to “sort” into wives with significantly higher levels of education. While theirs is an interesting identification strategy, it only exploitscohortvariation.Earlier work had studied the impact of male scarcity on marital assortative mating using the large shock that WWI caused to the number of French men (Abramitzky et al., 2011), used quarter of birth as a (weak) instrument for female education (Lefgren and McIntyre, 2006), or data on twins to assess assortative mating and how education is productive in marriage (Huang et al., 2009).7Our work is also related to studies on genetic assortativeness.8These articles use genetic information from large scale GWASs that are also the core of our analysis. While they are instrumental for our analysis, our work departs from them, if only because our focus is on the causal effect of education on spousal education, and not spousal resemblance at the genotypic level.9Moreover, we find that genetic assortativeness on education polygenic scores is much smaller than assortativeness on education, and that it essentially disappears after controlling for education and population stratification, consistent with recent work byBarth et al. (2020).Our research also broadly speaks to the increasing “genoeconomics” literature that studies the genetic determinants of socioeconomic outcomes (Barban, De Cao, Francesconi, 2021,Beauchamp, Cesarini, Johannesson, van der Loos, Koellinger, Groenen, Fowler, Rosenquist, Thurik, Christakis, 2011,Benjamin, Chabris, Glaeser, Gudnason, Harris, Laibson, Launer, Purcell, 2007,Conley, Fletcher, Dawes, 2014). While a few studies in economics have used genome-wide polygenic score as an instrumental variable (see alsoBöckerman, Cawley, Viinikainen, Lehtimäki, Rovio, Seppälä, Pehkonen, Raitakari, 2019,von Hinke Kessler Scholder, Smith, Lawlor, Propper, Windmeijer, 2016), we are the first to study the causal effect of education on spousal education using genetic data as a source of potential plausible exogenous variation using the approach byConley et al. (2012).As we shall see, our IV results are valid for a range of mild violations of the exclusion restriction, directly tackling the issue ofpleiotropy, which in the context of genome-wide scores leads to concerns about the number of potential pathways through which the score could influence the outcome.10Hence, our work complements and expands the economic literature using genes (or genetic markers) as instrumental variables (e.g.,Cawley, Han, Norton, 2011,Fletcher, Lehrer, 2011,von Hinke Kessler Scholder, Smith, Lawlor, Propper, Windmeijer, 2011,von Hinke Kessler Scholder, Smith, Lawlor, Propper, Windmeijer, 2013,von Hinke Kessler Scholder, Smith, Lawlor, Propper, Windmeijer, 2016,von Hinke Kessler Scholder, Wehby, Lewis, Zuccolo, 2014,Norton, Han, 2008).The rest of the paper is organized as follows.Section 2derives reduced-form linear matching functions and discusses how to identify the causal effect of education on spousal education.Section 3defines the polygenic score for education and how to handle potential deviations from IV assumptions.Section 4describes the data sources, the construction of the polygenic score and presents somedescriptive statistics.Section 5contains the main estimates.Section 6concludes the paper.",Nicola,Elisabetta,Sonia
"1. IntroductionMany studies have documented associations betweenpovertyand less beneficial behavior. For example, the poor are less likely than those with higher incomes to make use of preventive health services, and more likely to smoke cigarettes, play the lottery, and borrow more often at high cost.1Despite long-standing debates in economics and other disciplines, the reasons for such behavior remain unclear and the topic itself controversial. One recent hypothesis has focused on the financial circumstances of the poor and the potentially detrimental impact of these on attentional focus: In a sample of farmers from India,Mani et al. (2013)found that participants showed reduced attentional performance before harvest, when poor, compared to after harvest, when rich. The authors suggested that a preoccupation with monetary concerns may leave the farmers before harvest with fewer mental resources available for other processes.2In the only other study to have investigated this hypothesis empirically to date,Carvalho et al. (2016)assigned a sample of low-income US individuals randomly to perform a number of cognitive tests before or after payday. The individuals surveyed before payday faced poorer financial circumstances than those surveyed after payday. However, the authors found no before-after differences in cognitive function in the full sample or selected subgroups. These mixed empirical findings, and the dearth of studies on this hypothesis in general, highlight the need to identify, at a more detailed level, the groups of individuals in which poor financial circumstances might have detrimental effects on cognitive function.To contribute to this area of study, we therefore analyze heterogeneity in the effect of financial circumstances on attention, focusing on identifying individuals in whom poorer financial circumstances have negative effects. To do so, we use data from the experiment conducted byCarvalho et al. (2016). For our heterogeneity analysis, we use the causal forest method byAthey et al. (2019), which was developed specifically to explore heterogeneoustreatment effectsin experiments. The method can be described as an adaptive nearest-neighbors approach that exploits ideas from the random forest machine learning literature to determine the relevant neighborhoods for estimating conditional average treatment effects at given points in the covariate space. Compared with traditional ordinary least squares (OLS) subgroup analyses, the causal forest method allows non-linear treatment effects to be estimated in a fully flexible way and circumvents the need to specify an interacted model, which may not always be straightforward (especially when the number of covariates is large). We examine effect heterogeneity using a rich set of 37 policy-relevant, pre-treatment covariates, including age, income, employment status, and measures of financial strain in the past. Our causal forest analysis proceeds in the following steps: First, we investigate which covariates are particularly relevant for heterogeneity in the treatment effect. Next, we examine how the effect varies across the most important variables. Subsequently, we study, in greater detail, the effect heterogeneity in regions of the covariate space where the previous step indicates particularly detrimental effects.The results of our analysis suggest that there is strong effect heterogeneity in the two covariates age and income. For old and young individuals who received a very low income around the time of the experiment, we find that the poorer financial circumstances before payday had detrimental cognitive effects. We verify this finding using a second, independent, experiment conducted byCarvalho et al. (2016). Our results provide further evidence that there may be a causal effect of poverty on attention. They also demonstrate the benefit of using the causal forest method to identify treatment effect heterogeneity that may have been overlooked in traditional subgroup analyses.The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.Section 2describes the experiment and our analysis sample.Section 3explains the causal forest method.Section 4presents average effect estimates for the full sample, the results of our heterogeneity analysis, and investigates the findings of our heterogeneity analysis in an independent experiment.Section 5concludes.",Helmut,Heinrich,Martin
"1. IntroductionIn the last two decades of the 20th century, many countries implemented trade liberalization policies which opened them up to the international markets. Conventional theories such as Stopler-Samuelson’s theorem have stressed thatfree tradewould lead to a greater degree of equality in a developing country. However, as evidence shows and reviewed in Online Appendix F, the skill premium, defined as the relative wage of the high-skilled and low-skilled workers has risen in the past decades following the trade liberalizations in those countries which implemented such policies.1In this paper, by extending the labor specialization model inMadanizadeh (2017)andChaney and Ossa (2013), I develop and quantify a micro-founded model ofinternational tradewith endogenous skill intensities at the firm level to complement the researches explaining such a phenomenon. I show how opening to trade can raise skill premium in an economy through endogenous decisions on the specialization at the firm level, and within-industry reallocations of labor. In this new framework, consistent with the empirical findings,2I show how international trade induces firms to increase the level of worker specialization3and become more skill-intensive; and how it increases the relativelabor demandof high-skilled workers vs. low-skilled ones, since there is more gain in specializing the high-skilled workers. Taking the supply of workers fixed, the relative wage of high vs low-skilled workers may increase as the relative demand has increased.In this framework, a firm decides about the structure of itsdivision of labor. Basically, the firm chooses how many divisions of specialization it needs, how many tasks a worker should perform in a division, and how it can coordinate different divisions to produce the output. In particular, a firm pays some “Fixed Specialization Costs (FSC)”,4designs its organization and assigns its workers to different imperfect substitute groups, performing different tasks. Having more groups means higher division of labor and specialization, thus higher gains.The firm faces a trade-off: implementing more groups gives a productivity gain to the firm at the cost of paying the FSC. This trade-off generates aneconomy of scalebased on the firm’s desire to meet its production demand. Higher demand provides more incentive to the firm to pay FSC and increase its division of labor. Consequently, an increase in the production demand or in the firm’s productivity would induce the firm to increase the number of its specialized groups, resulting in an increase in its labor productivity.Also the less substitute the groups are, the higher gain the firm enjoys from this specialization. Here, I assume the skilled workers are generally less substitutable with each other giving an advantage towards their specialization.5This means that the difference between high and low-skilled workers is that the skilled workers’ gain from specialization is more than low-skilled ones’. Therefore, a firm benefits more from specializing the high-skilled workers. This gap in productivity gain generates a shift toward the specialization of high-skilled workers. Thus, an increase in a firm’s production demand or an increase in its productivity leads to the firm’s decision to specialize its skilled workers more. This biased expansion consequently increases a firm’s relative labor demand (the ratio of the demand for high-skilled vs low-skilled workers).International trade, through a reduction in trade costs, introduces a rise in demand. This new demand induces the more productive firms to export; thus, old and new exporters restructure to not only become more specialized but also more skill-intensive.6With a reduction in trade costs, a larger number of productive firms and exporters endogenously decide to become more skill-intensive, and demand a larger number of high-skilled workers relative to low-skilled ones. This horizontal organizational expansion, especially in the new exporters, increases the proportion of more skill-intensive firms in theindustry. Such organizational changes in the above-mentioned firms result in a reallocation of high-skilled workers within the industry toward the exporters. I show how these changes can result in a rise in the aggregate relative demand of high-skilled, relative to low-skilled labor, and consequently a rise in their relative wages.A by-product of the described model is the introduction of a new channel for the gains from international trade.7As previously described, trade integration increases the exporters’ degree of specialization which raises their overall labor productivity; hence, leading to a rise in the aggregate productivity leading to increases inreal wages, which is similar toChaney and Ossa (2013).To show the model’s results quantitatively, I calibrate the model to the data from Mexico as a developing country by matching some moments of the model with the Mexican data. I match the fraction of exporters, the export share of sales, skill premium, and the average number of employees per firm from data to the predictions of the model to calibrate the primitive parameters of the model. Then I analyze several counterfactual scenarios to find out how much of the increase in the skill premium in a trade liberalization period can be elucidated by my model. I find that 10% of the rise of the skill premium in Mexico from 1985 to 1993 can be explained by this model through changes in the bilateral iceberg trade costs. I also examine the counterfactual policies of changing fixed exporting cost, foreign aggregate demand, and relative supply of high-skilled labor.Finally, I analyze some comparative statics of changes in fundamental parameters of the model: gains from specialization and fixed specialization costs. I show that an increase/decrease in the gain from the specialization of high/low-skilled workers or a decrease in the fixed cost of specialization for the high-skilled workers can increase the skill premium; although they have different implications on the extensive and intensive margins of trade.Related Literature:In contrast to conventional theories, skill premium rose in the last decades following the worldwide trade liberalizations, even in developing countries. Evidence and the related mechanisms are reviewed in the Online Appendix F. This paper develops a new mechanism complementary to the “skill-biased technology” mechanism for describing the skill premium through the lens of labor division and endogenous firm organization.First, my model is close toBustos (2011)which shows that more productive firms and exporters upgrade their skill-biased technologies and become more skill-intensive. In contrast, this paper constructs a micro-founded model for the endogenous skill intensity as an organizational decision of a firm, similar toCaliendo et al. (2015). My model is more particularly focused on within-firm organizational decisions rather than a technology selection.Second, my work is related toHarrigan and Reshef (2011),Burstein et al. (2013)andBurstein and Vogel (2017)which employ a skill-biased production technology with inherently correlated productivity and skill intensity at the firm level. Therefore, the trade will result in the survival of more productive firms and thus the more skill-intensive ones. Thus, a direct consequence would be higher skill intensity in the industry, resulting in an increase in the skill premium due to the rise in the aggregate demand for skill. But, in my model, all the changes happen endogenously inside the firm due to a rise in the output demand or a rise in an unbiased firm’s productivity. In other words, in contrast toBurstein and Vogel (2017), I make this skill-biased technology to be endogenous and firm-dependent. In my paper, it is the firm that decides about its organization and the level of specialization towards skilled workers and chooses to be biased towards more skilled workers. InBurstein and Vogel (2017), the critical issue of firm’s demand has no role in the organization of the firm and no role in the skill-bias effect.From the micro-foundation point of view, this paper relates to the original work of Adam Smith (1776). Similarly, it relates toBecker and Murphy (1992)that shows if workers focus on narrower tasks, they get higher returns, and thus a more extensive division of labor increases productivity. Also, this paper is close toChaney and Ossa (2013)that show how exposition to larger markets and exportation can induce firms to increase the division of labor and become more productive. It is also related toAcemoglu and Autor (2011)andCostinot (2009), as they study the patterns of specialization and comparative advantage across tasks.Moreover, this paper is connected toCaliendo and Rossi-Hansberg (2012),Caliendo et al. (2015)where they study the role of organization and the number of layers in a firm and how international trade can affect it. They show that reducing trade costs and the increase in demand will induce firms, especially the exporters, to increase the number of organizational layers and expand. In my paper, I focus on the distributional effects of trade on firms’ horizontal organization and labor division. Caliendo and Rossi-Hansberg’s model focuses on the vertical organization of a firm whereas my model is discussing a horizontal expansion of a firm. In other words, two firms can have different divisions of labor in a layer but have the same number of layers. Also, in this paper, the wage differences are coming from differences of high-skilled versus low-skilled substitutability which is a result of the gain from specialization.On the empirical side, the literature is very narrow.Coviello et al. (2019)use micro data of judges in Italy and show that the productivity of judges increases as they specialize and focus on cases of a certain type.Garicano and Hubbard (2009)show that in US law firms, specialization increases as market size extends.Tian (2019)uses Brazilian firm-level data and shows that firms’ division of labor and thus their productivity increases with city size which is a proxy for the market size; this effect is larger for more export-oriented industries. They also show that larger cities reduce the costs associated with larger labor divisions and thus it increases the specializations in firms. Also,Duranton and Jayet (2011)use data from French cities and show that the level of specialization increases in larger cities. These few available papers are all in line with the predictions of this paper supporting the role of market size on the level of labor specialization.The rest of the paper is organized in the following order.

"1. IntroductionResearchers have, for quite some time, recognized the role of the welfare state on migration. The literature on this topic has primarily focused on two main areas. One set of studies has examined the role played by unemployment insurance (Antolín and Bover, 1997;Hassler et al., 2005;Tatsiramos, 2009;Jofre-Monseny 2014). These analyses generally conclude that unemployment benefits need to be large to deter migration. Another group of studies has focused, instead, on the role of family benefits as welfare magnets, primarily in the United States (Gelbach, 2004;McKinnish, 2007). For the most part, this second literature concludes that welfare migration is limited and typically larger for families living close to stateborders.Economists have also studied the impact of old-age pensions on other family member's social and economic outcomes, primarily in developing countries. Studies in that literature have focused on the impact of old-age pensions on children's schooling (Case and Deaton, 1998), children's health (Duflo, 2003), living arrangements (Hamoudi and Thomas, 2014), consumption (Angelucci and Di Giorgi 2009), and labor market participation (Juarez and Pfutze, 2015;Galiani et al., 2016;Borrella-Mas et al., 2016;Bratti et al., 2018). However, although strong family ties are recognized as a migration deterrent (Spilimbergo and Ubeda, 2004;Alesina et al., 2015), the literature has yet to explore the role of old-age non-contributory pensions received by extended family members on the migration of working-age individuals.In this paper, we look at how old-age non-contributory pensions received by extended family members might influence the internal migration of younger, working-age individuals in Spain. Spanish non-contributory pensions accrue to individuals who have not worked sufficiently to qualify for contributory pensions and who have no other sources of income (OECD, 2019). For those eligible, the program raises household income –an increase that may be shared with other family members. This typically parental inter-vivo support is more likely to benefit theoffspringresiding nearby for various reasons.First, as emphasized byFu (2019), close relatives are more likely to become future caregivers than those residing far away. As such, parents might be more inclined to assist their nearby offspring.Second, in-kind transfers (such as the provision of room and board, childcare or home cooked meals), which often have no close substitute, can only be provided if the two parties involved live nearby (Laferrere and Wolff, 2006).Spain shares with other Mediterranean welfare states, such as Greece and Italy, a generous public pension system and a strong reliance on the family unit as the ultimate safety net (Ferrera, 1996;Börsch-Supan, 2013). Despite having a structurally high unemployment rate and large spatial unemployment differences,1internal migration remains rather low in Spain (Ahn et al., 1999;Antolín and Bover, 1997). Internal migration is particularly low relative to other European countries, as well as relative to other developed and less developed economies. Spain is the only European nation with a 5-year internal migration intensity that falls below 10 percent (Bell et al., 2015).2This was not always the case. During the 1960s and 1970s, many Spanish workers emigrated from economically struggling regions like Andalucía or Extremadura to the prosperous regions of Madrid or Cataluña (Bover and Velilla, 2005). The expansion of the welfare state has been previously proposed as a potential explanation for the low level of internal migration in Spain (Antolín and Bover, 1997;Bover and Velilla, 2005). However, the role played by the welfare state in explaining migration has not been directly examined. Internal migration may no longer be indispensable if there exists a reliable public safety net. In Europe, where public safety nets characteristic of a welfare state are widespread, adverse shocks have translated into higher unemployment rates and lower labor force participation rates. On the contrary, in countries with a less extensive welfare state, as is the case of the Unites States, adverse shocks lead to higher migration rates instead (Blanchard and Katz, 1992;Jimeno and Bentolila, 1998;Jauer et al. 2019;Mitze, 2019).We follow previous literature and consider internal migration as the relocation to a new labor market in response to geographic differences in expected utility at destination and at the origin, focusing on the role that monetary and in-kind support from nearby relatives may play in predicting such moves. Working-age individuals may take into consideration the support from relatives –particularly, the non-transferable kind, such as room and board or childcare– when deciding whether to out-migrate. Ideally, to gauge the impact of non-contributory pensions on migration, we would like to have longitudinal data on individuals’ residential location, receipt of parental support, as well as parental residence and old-age pension receipt. This would allow us to directly gauge the impact of old-age pensions received by parents on children's migration. Unfortunately, such dataset does not exist. However, it is reasonable to assume that the likelihood of having a family member receiving a non-contributory pension is positively correlated to the share of non-contributorypensionersin their location. Then, we can rely on data from the SpanishLabor Force Survey, the Residential Variations Statistics, and the Social Security Statistics for the 1988 through 2015 period, to examine the impact of non-contributory pensions –as captured by thepolicy reformthat introduced new non-contributory pensions in 1991 (pensions that gradually replaced the existing social assistance pensions over the 1990s, 2000s, and early 2010s) – on the migration of working-age individuals. In an attempt to isolate the effect of the policy change, we exploit cross-province differences in the take-up rate of the newer pensions over the 1988 through 2015 period, while accounting for a wide range of individualdemographicand human capital traits, as well as temporal and provincial fixed-effects. In addition, we include several province-specific time varying traits potentially correlated with non-contributory pension receipt, such as differences between origin and potential destination provinces (weighted by historical internal migration flows) in per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP), employment rates, housing prices, the share of the population receiving unemployment benefits, and the share 65 years of age or older.We find that old-age non-contributory pensions are associated with reduced migration among young, less skilled, 25-to-35 years-old men and women. Our results prove robust to the use of alternative samples that exclude the foreign-born, provinces providing alternative sources ofincome support, or the years during which a Dependency Law was in place. Additionally, they do not predate the regulation of non-contributory pensions in 1991, nor can the differential take-up rate of the pensions across provinces be predicted by differences in migration patterns across provinces prior to the 1991 reform.We also consider two potential mechanisms at play -namely, intergenerational reciprocity and limited employment opportunities (Chan and Ermisch, 2015). We fail to find evidence of intergenerational reciprocity orquid pro quoexchanges, as disability pensions –more likely to be linked to the care of their recipients, do not generate the same response. Additionally, the observed impact of non-contributory pensions on the lack ofregional mobilityamong younger, less skilled cohorts is not driven by those with young children who might benefit from the childcare and childrearing assistance provided by older family members. Rather, limited employment opportunities might be the primary reason for the role of non-contributory pensions on the limited out-migration of young men and women with less human capital for various reasons.First, the effect is concentrated on younger individuals with either less education or no work experience, for whom we know job openings are limited.Second, only the safety net provided by non-contributory pensions seems to matter, hinting on the relevance of family, possibly in-kind support more likely to dominate among low-income families (Moreno-Mínguez, 2017), who also might be in a worse position to assist their offspring in their labor market search. Youth emancipation, educational programs and work internships targeted at this younger cohort of men and women might prove helpful in promoting their migration and, in the process, address labor market imbalances.This study is innovative in its effort to assess the link between public assistance in the form of old-age non-contributory pensions and migration of working-age individuals. Unlike prior work examining the role of unemployment insurance or welfare benefits, our focus is on old-age non-contributory pensions received by the elderly. Assessing their impact on the migration of younger cohorts is especially important in a country like Spain where, despite the expansion of the welfare state during the past decades (Guillén and León, 2011), families still provide the ultimate safety net (Bentolila and Ichino, 2008). The ability to rely on the assistance provided by extended family members living nearby may have contributed to the relatively low out-migration of working-age individuals facing employment challenges. Ourintentis to gauge if that has been the case and, when applicable, to what extent.In addition, we wish to understand the types of public assistance associated to distinct migration responses, as well as the affected demographic groups, to gain insights into the mechanisms at play. If only certain types of pensions matter, it might be indicative of systematic migration challenges faced by the offspring of specific population subgroups qualifying for such pensions,i.e.low-income households. Likewise, learning about the demographic traits of those impacted allow us to further understand some likely determinants, such as limited employment opportunities for those younger, less educated, and unexperienced.Finally, to date, most of the research on the impact of non-contributory pensions has focused on Latin American and African countries (e.g.Duflo, 2003;Juarez and Pfutze, 2015). Analyzing the Spanish case allows to extend our understanding of the impact of old-age non-contributory pensions on the social and economic outcomes of family members in the context of a developed economy –an analysis that may yield a different set of policy recommendations. In this regard, the findings contribute to the literature on emancipation decisions of youth in Southern European countries by informing about how, through diminished internal migration, the welfare state might be associated to ongoing emancipation delays (Aparicio-Fenoll and Oppedisano, 2015;Ahn and Sánchez-Marcos, 2017).",Catalina,Cristina,None
"1. IntroductionLanguage skills impinge on many social and economic outcomes. In particular, it has been extensively documented that immigrants proficient in the host-country language enjoy enhancedemployabilityand substantial wage premia.Bleakely and Chin (2004)andChiswick and Miller (2007)are just two prominent examples of a fairly large and geographically diverse literature.1Thus, policies aimed at promoting additional language skills are likely to alleviate wageinequalityand raise efficiency, owing to the positive externality generated by the acquisition of a second language (Selten and Pool, 1991;Church and King, 1993).A few studies have also examined the transmission of language skills between first- and second-generation immigrants. More specifically,Bleakley and Chin (2008)andCasey and Dustmann (2008)for the cases of the US and the UK, respectively, found that the parents’ English-speaking proficiency is positively correlated (in a causal sense) to children's English proficiency. These findings imply that the family language background influences the linguistic skills of the next generation; that is, the language deficiencies of the first-generation immigrants are not fully offset by other institutions, such as the school.2Therefore, language-related earning inequality (as well as other distortions in other social outcomes) are likely to persist across generations.Thus, the focus of the existing literature has been on the behavior of immigrants in societies with a predominant language. The main concern there is the speed of assimilation of minority groups. However, the economic value of language skills and the issue of language transmission across generations are not only relevant for migrants, but also for general populations living in multilingual environments. Many countries and regions are bilingual, in the sense that there exist two speech communities of significantly large size and a relevant fraction of native-born individuals with native competences in both languages.3Here, the primary issues are different: the economic value of bilingualism, theendogamyof different speech communities, and the long-run contest between competing languages fordominance.In this paper, we analyze for the first time the intergenerational transmission of language in bilingual societies. Our results indicate that such a channel reinforces the impact of policies that promote bilingualism and contributes to the large and persistent effect of language skills on labor market performance, as well as on other social outcomes. In addition, we argue that the implementation of language-in-education policies and their intergenerationalspilloversmay actually improve the vitality and, eventually, the chances of survival of minority languages.We specifically focus on the effect of the parents’ language skills on the language(s) spoken with the children, thus examining one of the potential channels that can drive the positive correlation between the level of proficiency of parents and children found in the existing literature (Bleakley and Chin, 2008;Casey and Dustmann, 2008andKuziemko, 2014). The language spoken by parents at home may influence the children's linguistic repertoire (provided the school and other institutions do not fully compensate the family's influence), as well as linguistic preferences and identity formation. These factors may influence off-springs’ productivity and network formation, or may even shelter them from discrimination, with long-term effects on labor market outcomes.Our empirical analysis focuses on the case of Catalonia, one of the bilingual regions of Spain. Catalonia is a particularly interesting case study. Firstly, communication is not at stake in this bilingual society due to the universal knowledge of Spanish (a very strong global language, with more than 400 million native speakers). Thus, the consequences of acquiring additional skills inCatalan, the local language, cannot be attributed to its communicative benefits. However, the degree of bilingualism is asymmetric, since only a fraction of native Spanish speakers is proficient in Catalan, whereas all native Catalan speakers are fully bilingual (high proficiency in both Catalan and Spanish). Previous research showed that knowledge of Catalan increases employability (Rendon, 2007), earnings (Di Paolo and Raymond, 2012;Cappellari and Di Paolo, 2018) and the formation of linguistically-mixed couples (Caminal and Di Paolo, 2019).Secondly, Catalonia experienced a language-in-education reform that introduced bilingualism at school, which can be exploited to identify the causal effects of parents’ language skills on language transmission. The language-in-education reform we study in this paper (Language Normalization Act, LNA) was implemented in 1983 by regional authorities and introduced Catalan as a medium of instruction (together with Spanish) in Catalan schools. This significantly enhanced Catalan proficiency among native Spanish speakers, without altering their proficiency in Spanish. Thesociolinguisticcharacteristics of the Catalan population in the early 1980s were crucially affected by the massive immigration flows from the rest of Spain that took place in the 1960s and early 1970s. Since Catalan was strongly repressed during the dictatorial regime (1939–1977), a significant fraction of the Spanish-speaking population at that time had limited or no knowledge of Catalan. The main purposes of the LNA reform were to foster bilingualism and biliteracy in the society (regardless of language background) and to “normalize” the use of the local language as to preserve its vitality.Previous papers studied the effects of the LNA reform on national identity (Clots-Figueras and Masella, 2013), the wage returns to education (Cappellari and Di Paolo, 2018) and partnership formation (Caminal and Di Paolo, 2019). This paper adds to this literature by examining the intergenerational spillovers generated by the new language skills induced by the reform.We begin our analysis by presenting a simple choice-theoretic framework of the intergenerational transmission of language in a bilingual society that portrays the optimal choice of the language(s) parents use with their children as balancing their own linguistic preferences with the welfare of their children (as measured by their labor market outcomes). The goal of the framework is twofold. First, to understand the main channels through which a language-in-education policy, like the LNA reform, may influence the language parents speak to their children. Second, it helps interpreting some of the stylized facts and empirical results. While emphasizing the effect of the reform on language skills, the model also points to two additional channels: (i) the potential effect of the reform on linguistic preferences, and (ii) the positive effect of the reform on the formation of mixed-couples, and its implications on the language used with the children. We show that, under certain conditions, the pattern of intergenerational transmission of language in an asymmetric bilingual society is indeed affected by language skills and, moreover, such a positive influence only concerns (somewhat surprisingly) the weak (local) language.We next turn to the empirical analysis by proposing an identification strategy that takes advantage of the LNA reform as a natural experiment. We exploit the heterogeneous effect of exposure to bilingualism during compulsory schooling by native language to identify the causal effects of oral skills in Catalan among native Spanish speakers on the language spoken with their children. Since Catalan was orally transmitted within Catalan-speaking families (even during Franco's era), the reform boosted oral Catalan skills only among native Spanish speakers. We leverage on year of birth and native language to construct aninstrumental variable(IV) for the Catalan skills of native Spanish speakers. The validity of the instrument relies on the assumption that non-language cohort effects in language transmission are common between Catalan and Spanish speakers, and we provide corroborating evidence based on several robustness checks.We show that parents’ language skills matter in the intergenerational transmission of language. The reform had a significant impact on the Catalan proficiency of native Spanish speakers, increasing it by on average around one point on a 10-points scale (15% increase) for those who were exposed to the reform for their entire compulsory education period (10 years), relative to the benchmark of no exposure. Using the proposed IV, we find that the increase in oral proficiency induced by the reform among native Spanish speakers raises their propensity to use Catalan with their children by two fifths of a point of the 1–5 scale with which language use is categorized in the data. Such an effect implies an 18% reduction in the average gap in Catalan use between native Spanish and native Catalan speakers. Additional estimates obtained from a non-linear model for ordered outcomes with an endogenous covariate indicate that increasing oral skills in Catalan by one unit raises the probability that a native Spanish speaker uses only Catalan with the first child by 13 percentage points. We also estimate the reduced-form effects of the reform, which provide evidence about the direct effect of exposure to bilingualism during compulsory education on language transmission. The reduced-form model predicts that the probability of using only Catalan for Spanish speakers with no exposure to the reform is 22%, whereas for those fully exposed to the reform such a probability jumps to 40%.Previous studies have documented the positive effect of additional skills in the local language on labor market and other social outcomes. Policies that promote the knowledge of minority languages not only tend to reduce wage inequality, increase efficiency and reduce endogamy among the affected generation. We show that those policies may also generate intergenerational spillovers, extending the above benefits to future generations and reinforcing the short-run responses. Clearly, such long-run effects may significantly contribute to the vitality and preservation of local languages.The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows: InSection 2we provide a brief historical account of the sociolinguistic dynamics of Catalonia.Section 3presents the outline of the theoretical framework, which is formally presented in the Appendix.Section 4contains a description of the data used in the empirical analysis.

"1. IntroductionIn Europe, some young people seemingly have it all, while others have nothing. In some countries, the school-to-work transition (STWT) – the period from the completion of studies to the attainment of a stable job – goes smoothly and young people find themselves a job soon after completing their education, while others find the process to be a long one, sometimes needing years to complete their STWT. In this respect, Germany and Italy, for instance, are at opposite ends of the spectrum. One possible explanation for why this is the case, at least for young people with a higher-secondary-school diploma, is the fact that the German system is based on the dual principle (education and training go hand in hand), while the Italian system is sequential in essence (first education, and then work-related competences) (Pastore, 2015;2018).This paper aims to fill in two important gaps in previous research. First, we aim to measure the duration of the STWT in different European countries in the same comparable way, following the principle that the transition is completed when the young person secures at least a stable job. We use the only definition available in the EU-SILC data of “regular job,” namely a job of at least six months in length. InSection 5, we also address the case of the transition to a permanent job. Second, we try to identify the main determinants of dramatically different duration paths across a selection of 14 EU countries, the only ones for which comparable information is available in our dataset. Following a relatively recent stream of literature (Ryan, 2011;Vogel, 2002;Caroleo and Pastore, 2007;Pohl and Walther, 2007;Pastore, 2015;Hadjivassiliou et al., 2018), we identify different STWT regimes and compare them in our empirical analysis.There has been only one previous attempt to measure the duration of the STWT.Eurostat (2012)examined transitions to any kind of job across all EU member states and found extremely short and smooth durations, including in South European countries. However, their measure may be partly biased. It mirrors, in fact, the effect of two-tier reforms and the ensuing diffusion of temporary work arrangements, which have shortened the duration of unemployment spells, but not the duration of the overall STWT, meaning here a transition to a permanent job or a temporary job that is considered satisfactory by young people (ILO, 2020). However, it is well known that most young people do not stop searching for a new job and consider themselves to still be “in transition” until they have attained a permanent job or a satisfactory temporary job. Therefore, caution must be exercised in considering the attainment of a temporary job as an end to the STWT.In this paper, we reach a very different conclusion regarding the actual distribution of the duration of the STWT in Europe by examining the transition to a regular job. We no longer see a commonEuropean social model, as found in theEurostat (2012)analysis, but rather the re-emergence of completely different STWT regimes across the continent. In other words, it is the process of homogenization due to two-tier reforms that is apparent in theEurostat (2012)analysis.We aim to measure the overall length of the STWT from when education is completed, and the last degree is achieved, to when the individual has found a “regular job,” without constraining our observation period to the first two years of the transition.In step two of the analysis, we study the determinants of the duration of the STWT, in terms of a young individual's probability of finding a job, using a parametric duration model with a Weibull distribution, chosen as a result of statistical testing as the best fit to the data at hand [in terms of thebayesian information criterion(BIC) and theAkaike information criterion(AIC)]. Further, we study the consequences of the recent diffusion of temporary contracts on the duration of the transition, splitting the analysis of duration by type of job contract (permanentvstemporary). In addition, the analysis is repeated, both accounting for and excluding student-workers, in order to measure the impact of this sub-collective on the overall results.This paper adds to the existing literature on the STWT in several ways. First of all, we use duration models to estimate the determinants of the probability of exiting from the STWT. We distinguish individuals by their level of education, which allows us to assess the different impact that our determinants have on the duration of unemployment according to individuals’ level of education. Then, as noted above, we extend the analysis to different types of STWT regime, which allows us to examine several institutional factors, for which we try to identify the relevance.What emerges is an extreme variability in the overall duration of the STWT across European countries. Considering only the individuals who have completed the transition, in some countries this lasts nine months (UK), while in others (Italy), this lasts 34 months (on average). It is in fact widely recognized that the duration of the STWT depends on the type of STWT regime and, more specifically, on the actual institutions on which they are based. In fact, the characteristics of theeducation systemand its ability to stimulate the acquisition of skills and competences required in the labor market may be decisive factors in shortening and smoothing the STWT. However, an important role is also played by how the labor market functions and, in particular, by local unemployment levels. The survivor functions used to this aim allow us to identify the effective performance of each country, after controlling for all covariates measuring individuals’ characteristics.Last but not least, we test whether there is duration dependence in the STWT. Previous research regarding the duration of unemployment spells, focusing on individuals who have lost their job and who are therefore not necessarily young, has found some evidence of negative duration dependence (Lancaster, 1979;Nickell, 1979): with increasing duration of unemployment, the probability of finding a job decreases. Supply- and demand-side factors explain this finding in turn: workers’ human capital quickly loses value, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, potential employers consider longer durations of unemployment as evidence of a low attitude and motivation to work. Later research has demonstrated, however, that negative duration dependence is essentially due to omitted heterogeneity in unemployed job seekers (Heckman and Borjas 1980;Heckman and Singer, 1984): those who have longer unemployment spells and also lower job-finding rates represent the majority of the unemployed and are less skilled and motivated than average. The policy implications of these two approaches are different, but they can be effectively combined. In the first approach, duration dependence can be mitigated simply by increasing the degree of labor-market flexibility, while, in the second approach, only training policy, specifically targeted at the deficiencies of individuals with low skills, can change the overall duration of unemployment.In our case, before correcting for unobserved heterogeneity, results show the presence of negative duration dependence in accordance withLancaster's (1979)andNickell's (1979)findings; however, when we account for unobserved heterogeneity, a positive duration dependence clearly emerges from the data, which is consistent across countries. An important contribution of this paper is that it provides a specific interpretation of this positive duration dependence as mirroring a process of learning by searching: in other words, young people learn work-related skills during their search, which increases their chances of finding a job over time.The structure of the paper is as follows.Section 2illustrates the methodology adopted in the empirical analysis and explains how it allows our interpretative hypotheses on the determinants of the duration of the STWT to be addressed.Section 3discusses several aspects of the definition of the main variables used in the empirical analysis.Section 4presents the results of the descriptive andregression analysis.Section 5addresses several remaining concerns and robustness checks. Finally, concluding remarks are provided in Section 6.",Francesco,Claudio,Antonella
"1. IntroductionIntegrating the labor markets of their member countries has been a key objective within the European Union and the associated non-member states. One of the main rationales of these efforts being that these policies are designed to spur gains in innovation and productivity and, consequently, growth (e.g.Hunt, Gauthier-Loiselle, 2010,Peri, 2012). A potential downside of such policies, however, is that easier access to external labor markets may undermine firms’ incentives to train their own workers in countries attracting (many) immigrant workers. This kind of trade-off is arguably of particular relevance in countries with highly developedapprenticeshipsystems, such as Switzerland, which serve a large number of adolescents across a broad range of different occupations. Indeed, in the Swiss context, apprenticeship training remains the main educational track at the upper-secondary level, serving about two-thirds of each incoming cohort (SERI, 2019).In this paper, we estimate – against this broader background – employers’ short-run substitution between the training ofapprenticesand the hiring of cross-border workers (hereafter CBWs), i.e. non-resident immigrant workers who live in one of the neighboring countries but who work regularly in Switzerland. From the perspective of an employer, being located closer to thebordermay provide the opportunity to have easier access to fully trained skilled workers. Consistent with this argument, previous studies document substantive costs of hiring skilled workers for Swiss employers (Blatter, Muehlemann, Schenker, 2012,Muehlemann, Strupler Leiser, 2018) and show that firms’ training intensity is quite sensitive to these costs (Blatter et al., 2015). Moreover, training apprentices can be costly for employers – about a third of all apprenticeships are associated with, in some cases substantive, net costs from apprenticeship training – and a greater supply of skilled workers may further tip the balance between training and hiring if it brings down skilled workers’ wages, relative to those of apprentices in the same occupation. We therefore hypothesize that (easier) access to CBWs will decrease the costs of hiring skilled workers, and eventually also the wages of skilled workers, and that this will lead some firms to substitute away from training their own workforce to hiring more or additional CBWs in the medium run. We also expect that the substitution is more pronounced for the higher skilled occupations, which are characterized by both high training costs and high hiring costs, as we will discuss in more detail below.In our empirical analysis, we exclusively focus on the substitution with CBWs for both substantive and methodological reasons. First, and in contrast to many immigrants both working and living in Switzerland (resident immigrant workers, henceforth1), CBWs presumably have skills similar to those of natives and they have the advantage that they usually speak the same language as natives (e.g.Hoen, 2020,Stöhr, 2015). We therefore expect that the substitutability will be higher between apprentices and CBWs than between apprentices and non-native workers in general – many of whom are low(er) skilled and/or do not speak any of the country’s official languages.2Second, CBWs are quantitatively relevant in the Swiss labor market: CBWs made up about 4.8% of the total workforce in the year 2008 (i.e. the year which marks the endpoint of our empirical analysis), representing about 18.2% of the total foreign workforce in that year. Moreover, in relative terms, the increase in CBWs has recently been much greater than in resident immigrant workers; between 1995 and 2008 (our analysis period), the total number of CBWs increased by about 46.1% (from 146,773 to 214,377); then, between 2008 and 2018, it increased by an additional 46.4% (to a total of 313,926 CBWs).3Third and finally, the focus on CBWs gives us the opportunity to implement a simple but powerful instrumental-variable approach based on the country’s geography. Obviously, a firm’s possibility to fall back on CBWs depends on its location relative to the national border. The closer to the border a firm is located, ceteris-paribus, the larger the pool of CBWs potentially available for this firm. Thus, we consider the shortesttravel timefrom a firm’s location (i.e. the municipality it is located in) to the country border as a valid instrument for the share of CBWs a firm employs, as we will argue in much more detail below.Our empirical approach is very close to the one used byDustmannet al. (2017), who exploit the introduction of a policy in 1991 which led to a sudden and large influx of Czech CBWs into the German labor market. Specifially, the policy allowed Czech workers to seek employment, but not residence, in border municipalities (see alsoMoritz, 2011). They find a moderate negative effect on native wages and a rather large negative effect on native employment – the authors find that a one percentage point increase in the number of Czech CBWs decreased native employment by about 0.93% three years after the policy has been implemented. They also find that the employment effects are more pronounced for unskilled workers, who represent a closer substitute for inflowing Czech workers. Our empirical strategy is also close to that ofBeerli et al., 2018, who use a difference-in-differences approach to study how the removal of all remaining immigration restrictions for workers from the European Union increased the number of CBWs to Switzerland – and how this in turn affected employment and wages in the regions close to the border. Overall, they find that the removal of the remaining restrictions led to an increase in overall native employment, arguing that the policy increased overalllabor demandby firms.Broadly consistent with the evidence fromDustmann et al. (2017), we find that firms which have easier access to hiring skilled workers partially substitute the training of resident apprentices with hiring additional cross-border workers. Our OLS and 2SLS estimates are consistent with each other and are robust across a wide range of robustness checks. Moreover, as expected, 2SLS estimates are larger (in absolute value) than the corresponding OLS estimates, and they are precisely enough estimated to rule out statistical equivalence between OLS and 2SLS estimates. We also find that the negative effect of CBWs on the number of apprentices is increasing in the underlying hiring costs. Our preferred 2SLS estimate implies that an increase in the average share of CBWs across firms of 1.14 percentage points (corresponding to the observed increase in the share of CBWs between 1995 and 2008, i.e. our analysis period) leads to a corresponding decrease in the number of apprenticeship positions of about 2% (equal to about 3500 apprenticeship positions in absolute terms); a significant effect in both statistical and substantive terms.In contrast to our study, previous studies on the effects of immigrants on the Swiss labor market have mainly focused on the overall effect of immigration on either wages and/or employment among residents (i.e. natives and previous immigrants).4For example,Gerfin and Kaiser (2010), using the structural skill-cell approach, estimate the wage effects from immigration for the period 2002 to 2008. Their findings are mixed: While natives face no wage pressure on average, previously immigrants’ wages are negatively affected. Across educational subgroups, highly-educated workers incur the largest wage losses.Favre et al. (2013)reach similar conclusions, applying a shift-share instrumental-variable approach and focusing on the period between 2002 and 2010. Moreover, their analysis also covers CBWs. They find no overall negative effects of immigrants or CBWs on employment, neither for Swiss-born nor for previously immigrated workers. Again, however, they find statistically significant effects for certain educational subgroups. According to their analysis, a one percent increase in the workforce due to immigration leads to a drop in the employment rate of high skilled Swiss-born workers of 0.3 percentage points. Moreover, while immigration does not affect the employment rate of previously immigrated workers, CBW inflows do: a one percent increase in the workforce due to CBWs decreases the employment rate of previously immigrated workers by 0.2 percentage points. Similarly,Basten and Siegenthaler (2019)find that immigration had limited negative effects on natives’ employment and wages.Ruffner and Siegenthaler (2016)explicitly focus on the increase in the number of CBWs in a difference-in-difference approach and conclude that CBWs helped firms overcome their skill shortages and increased firms’ productivity without crowding out native employment. The study byBeerli et al. (2018), already mentioned above, also finds that the overall effects of immigration were positive. Our study complements this literature by providing estimates on the substitution of apprentices with CBWs, a question which has not yet been adressed in the empirical literature so far. It also illustrates that there is nothing contradictory in finding both positive and negative effects of immigration at the same time and that immigration policy may therefore involve difficult policy trade-offs.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.Section 2gives some background on immigration to Switzerland, describes the institutional background of the Swiss apprenticeship system, and formulates our main hypothesis.Section 3presents the main data sources and the construction of the key variables, along withdescriptive statisticsof the key variables.Section 4discusses our empirical strategy.Section 5presents the main results, as well as several robustness checks.Section 6concludes.",Manuel,Andreas,None
"1. IntroductionThe advent of the internet has fundamentally changed the way how workers and employers search for each other and eventually form a match (Autor, 2001). This trend is mirrored by the increased use of online search and recruiting tools by individual job seekers and employers (DeVaro and Gürtler, 2018). Online search tools go along with a considerable decline in search frictions arising from imperfect information and transaction costs. Given these developments, a question of particular interest is whether search via the internet along with the improved market information help to establish better matches in the labor market.So far, the empirical literature has primarily focussed on the impact of online job search on job finding probabilities. Studies dealing with the relationship between the internet and unemployment outcomes have remained inconclusive, though, as the effects range from zero to positive.1While the established effects on job finding probabilities may reflect a change in matching efficiency, they tell us nothing about the internet’s impact on the quality of matches arising from online search. The present study aims to fill this gap, by exploring the effect of the expansion of high-speed internet on match quality outcomes of newly hired workers. To do so, we exploit a quasi-experimental setting created by the expansion of high-speed internet (DSL) at the regional level in Germany. Using a combination of administrative and vacancy-level data, we merge employment histories of newly hired workers with information on their recruitment processes. Compared to previous studies, which often rely on job seekers’ search channels, this allows us to explicitly compare outcomes of online and non-online recruits.There are several mechanisms through which online job search and recruiting tools may improve the match quality of newly hired workers. First, employers may use the internet for online screening, e.g., by restricting online applications only to those candidates possessing the required qualifications. Second, by way of identifying and notifying plausible matches based on matching algorithms, online recruiting software may speed up the process in which employers and individuals find one another. As a result, online tools are likely to raise the number of meetings between employers and individual job seekers per time unit. Theory predicts that a potential increase in matching efficiency will give rise to an increase in the reservation match quality (Krueger, 2000), which will in turn raise productivity, workers’ earnings, and firms’ profits.Yet, another hypothesis is that the internet may take a role in reducing the quality of matching due to adverse selection: The underlying rationale is that the dramatic decline in search and application costs may entail excess applications, with many workers applying to considerably more jobs compared with more traditional search channels. Excess applications are likely to be especially relevant for poor candidates, who would not have applied if the submission of their applications had been more costly. This may create additional costs of screening, as employers need to spend more time and effort in establishing the required qualifications of their applicants (Autor, 2001). Overall, these considerations make clear that the direction of the internet’s effect on the match quality is generally ambiguous.Despite a key role in theory, only a small number of studies have empirically analyzed this issue.2Moreover, a limitation of the existing studies is that they rely on information on individual job seekers’ search strategies. This is problematic as the use of the internet for individual job search does not necessarily imply that individuals were actually hired through online recruiting. The reason is that job seekers may use multiple job search channels.3Based on a combination of administrative and vacancy-level data, our study contributes to this sparse literature by explicitly comparing new matches that were hired through online search and recruiting to those that were formed via different recruitment channels. An additional novelty of our study is that we are able to address the phenomenon of excess applications that may arise with online search, as our data allow us to retrieve information on the number (and fraction) of suitable applicants. A further contribution of our analysis is that we exploit a quasi-experimental setting created by the expansion of high-speed internet (DSL) at the regional level in Germany. The source of variation - described in detail byFalck et al. (2014)- stems from technological peculiarities of the traditional public switched telephone network (PSTN), through which the early generations of DSL have been implemented. The crucial issue causing exogenous variation in DSL availability is that, while the length of the copper wires connecting households and the main distribution frames (MDFs) – whose distribution was determined in the 1960s – did not matter for telephone services, it strongly affected the DSL connection. In particular, there exists a critical value of 4,200 meters, such that for municipalities with distances to the next MDF that lie above this threshold no access to DSL was possible. The only way to provide internet access was to replace copper wires by fiber wires, which took time and was costly.Using this exogenous variation in internet availability during the early DSL years, we start by estimating the internet effects on characteristics of job matches at the municipality level. We instrument DSL availability at the municipality level by the distance to the next MDF and measure characteristics of jobs in the flow of newly hired workers coming out of unemployment. In this group, the impact of the internet on outcomes such as employment stability is more likely to capture effects that arise from a change in search channels than in the group of workers searching on-the-job. The reason is, as we will argue below, that the restriction in internet availability prior to the DSL expansion was more binding for unemployed than for employed job seekers. This is especially relevant as estimation at the municipality level only allows for identification of intention to treat (ITT) effects. To explore more direct effects of theusageof online recruiting, we additionally link the employment outcomes of newly hired workers to vacancy-level data. Though this comes at the expense of a much smaller sample size, it enables us to obtain a more comprehensive view on the effects. First, employment histories after (online) recruitings are informative on effects on conventionaljob characteristicsand outcomes such as employment stability and wages. Secondly, the vacancy-level data are informative on applications and vacancy creation. This enables us to explore concessions that employers make when choosing a candidate, which may be considered as a measure of job-worker mismatch. For ease of exposition, we refer to the joint set of outcome measures as match quality indicators, where it should be kept in mind that some of these (notably conventional job characteristics) may just reflect job quality rather than match quality.Based on this empirical strategy, we document the following key findings. The results from the municipality-level analysis suggest that for the full sample the increase in internet availability affects neither employment stability nor wage outcomes. If anything, internet availability reduces employment-to-unemployment transitions for formerly unemployed male and white-collar workers. For these subgroups the effects are found to be non-negligible, but the precision of the estimates is low. The analysis based on vacancy-level data confirms the absence of any effects of online recruiting on wages and provides evidence of a slight increase in employment stability, with the effect being driven by reduced employment-to-employment transitions. Looking at potential mechanisms underlying the absence of major effects, we find that online recruiting leads to a dramatic increase in the number of applications and raises the share of unsuitable candidates, while at the same time inducing employers to post more vacancies. We also find some weak evidence that adverse selection with online recruiting is more relevant for females.The remainder of the paper is laid out as follows. The next section provides descriptive evidence for the diffusion of broadband internet at the individual and employer level and its importance for job search and recruiting behavior.

"1. IntroductionThe integration of European labor markets in the European Union (EU) has substantially increased the migration of workers acrossborders. For high-income countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) such as Norway, the 2004 EU enlargement had especially large effects on the supply of manual workers with low reservation wages. The EU enlargement led to a rapid increase in labor immigration, and a large share of the labor immigrants entered the Building and Construction (BaC) industry. The opening of borders has been shown to narrow labor market opportunities and decrease the relative earnings of native, male, vocational skilled workers in Norway (Bratsberg, Raaum, 2012,Finseraas, Røed, Schøne, 2019) and in Finland (Kousmanen and Meriläinen, 2019). Similar effects are found in Germany after the opening of borders to Czech cross-border workers in 1991 (Dustmann et al., 2017).The BaC industry is heavily male dominated, and therefore, men were much more affected by the EU enlargement than women. Typical femaleindustries, such as health, retail and education, did not experience the same increase in the share of immigrants. And although unemployment is insured through the social security system, long-term declines in relative wages due to labor market competition are typically not covered. For the household, therefore, adjusting female employment could potentially play a role as insurance against the decline in household earnings. In this paper, we analyze how wives’ labor supply responds to their husbands’ decrease in earnings. We estimate the effect of the EU enlargement on employment and earnings for men employed in the BaC industry and their wives. To compare the role of wives’ labor supply relative to public insurance through the social security system, we also measure the effect of the EU enlargement on the probability of receiving unemployment benefits, sick leave benefits and disability insurance.An important precondition for the wife’s labor supply to increase is that the leisure time of husbands and wives is substitutable through home production. The substitutability of home production might, however, be constrained by norms and preferences for male and female abilities in these tasks and ideals regarding who should be the family breadwinner (Bertrand, Kamenica, Pan, 2015,Fernández, Fogli, 2009,Fernández, Fogli, Olivetti, 2004). To investigate the role of substitutability in home production, we estimate the effect on the uptake of parental leave for both partners and estimate the heterogeneity of effects according to the presence of children and age of the youngest child.To identify the effect of increased labor market competition on household outcomes, we exploit licensing requirements in parts of the BaC sector.1Mainly due to safety reasons, some occupations, such as electrician and plumber, need a license to perform their work, while other occupations, such as painter and carpenter, need not. Access to a licensed occupation is given to workers with certified vocational training (e.g., education as an electrician). The right to work in a licensed occupation can also be given to immigrant workers, but usually after a lengthy bureaucratic process for formal approval of their educational skills. Thus, the requirements give native Norwegians with the right education a competitive advantage with regard to employment in licensed occupations.2The sample is men who were working in the BaC industry in 2003, one year before the EU enlargement, and their wives. We define a worker as “exposed” or “sheltered” (treatment and comparison groups) based on whether they have a certifiedvocational educationthat gives access to a licenced occupation.3The educational paths that qualify individuals for licensed and non-licensed occupations are similar, with two years of education in school and two years of practice to become a tradesman. Therefore, the treatment and comparison groups are similar workers with the same amount of education in the same industry but are exposed differently to the immigrant shock. We later show that the wives of exposed and sheltered workers are very similar: The wives have the same educational levels and work in similar industries. What separates the wives is whether they are married to an exposed or sheltered husband. Empirically, we analyze the questions within a difference-in-differences framework, where sheltered workers and their wives are compared to exposed workers and their wives before and after the enlargement of the EU in 2004.This study makes contributions to two main streams of literature. First, it contributes to the broad literature analyzing the consequences of labor immigration on local labor markets. In standard models of the labor market, an increase in supply of labor immigrants, will (at least in the short term) reduce the relative earnings of workers with comparable skills. However, the empirical literature has not reached consensus with respect to the size of the effects and includes studies reporting negative and sizable effects (see e.g.,Borjas (2003)) and studies reporting small and not statistically significant and even positive impacts (see e.g.,Ottaviano and Peri (2012)). Part of the reason for the empirical controversy is related to differences in methodological approaches that identify parameters that are not directly comparable (Dustmann et al., 2016). However, the empirical literature seems to agree that native workers who compete most directly with immigrants are also the ones who experience the strongest downward pressure on wages.Second, this study contributes to the literature on household optimization, household responses to income shocks and the added-worker effect (AWE) (Ashenfelter, 1980,Becker, 1973,Heckman, Macurdy, 1980,Lundberg, 1985)). These models predict that a wife responds by increasing her labor supply when her husband’s labor market opportunities deteriorate. The AWE literature often reports small effects of husbands’ unemployment on wife labor supply, measured by plant closings or mass layoffs (Bredtmann, Otten, Rulff, 2018,Eliason, 2011,Halla, Schmieder, Weber, 2020,Hardoy, Schøne, 2014,Stephens, Jr., Melvin, 2002).4Bredtmann et al. (2018)find that the AWE varies greatly between different welfare regimes, indicating that the availability of other types of insurance plays a role in the size of wives’ labor market response. In addition, there is evidence that other types of shocks to household long-term earnings, such as sharp reductions in husbands’ social insurance benefits, induce larger responses among wives (Autor, Kostøl, Mogstad, Setzler, 2019,Fadlon, Nielsen, 2015).Halla et al. (2020)find, consistent with constraints on the substitutability of home production, that the labor market response of a wife to her husband’s unemployment is lower in couples with children younger than two years of age. To the best of our knowledge, however, there is no direct measure of the division of home production tasks in the AWE literature.The empirical results show that exposed workers experience a fall in their employment probability and labor earnings after the EU enlargement over the whole period 2004–2015. The negative effects stabilize at around -30,000 NOK (around 6 percent lower earnings) and around 2 percentage points lower employment probability. Only around 6 percent of the total earnings loss is compensated by public transfers. The probability of receiving unemployment benefits increases with 2 percent, while the take-up of other benefits (such as health benefits) is not affected. Increased wives’ earnings plays a comparatively larger role as insurance and compensate around one third of the husband’s earnings loss, largely driven by increases in labor supply at the intensive margin. However, we do not find that the change in the division of market work within the household affects the division of home production as measured by the sharing of parental leave. We do not find that having small children poses a constraint on the labor market response of the wives either, indicating that there are no strong norms against female labor supply when the children are small. This may contribute to the large labor supply response to the fall in husbands’ earnings.The paper proceeds as follows: In the next section, we present the institutional setting anddescriptive statisticson labor market immigration to Norway after the EU enlargement. Thereafter, we present the data and the empirical specifications. Then, we discuss the results and provide sensitivity analyses, before we provide conclusions in the final section.",Pål,Marte,None
"1. IntroductionWomen are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) college majors and occupations.1Even with a STEM degree, young women’s participation decreases at each stage of the STEM pipeline (Xu, 2008). Why is the lack of women in the STEM fields a concern? First, we face a scarcity of STEM workers and there are signs showing substantial shortage in STEM labor supply while demand has been steadily increasing over decades.2Second, as most of the STEM fields pay higher salaries than non-STEM fields, the lack of women in STEM may contribute to the gender wage gap (Beede, Julian, Langdon, McKittrick, Khan, Doms, 2011,Kahn, Ginther, 2017,Noonan,Xue, Larson, 2015). Third, when young women lack role models to motivate them and help them envision themselves in those positions, they are deterred by the idea that STEM is a “man’s field” where girls do not belong (Shapiro and Williams, 2012). Last, when women are not involved in STEM, products, services, and solutions are designed by men and according to their user experiences. The needs that are unique to women may be overlooked (Clayton, Collins, et al., 2014,Fisher, Margolis, 2002,Hong, Page, 2004).The aim of this paper is threefold. First, I ask how much of the gender gap in STEM college majors can be explained bygender differencesin ability sorting. This requires me to revisit the long-lasting debate on whether women are less prepared on STEM-related subjects and avoiding STEM college majors because of that. Second, I ask why women with STEM degrees are less likely to work in STEM occupations than their male counterparts. In particular, I assess how much ability, ability sorting, and preferences can explain the gender gap in STEM attrition after collegegraduation.3Third, by simulating the counterfactual choices, I estimate the pecuniary returns to a STEM career for women who chose a non-STEM path byskill leveland discuss how much contributes to the gender wage gap.I analyze the questions above using unique administrative data from Purdue University, one of the nation’s leading public STEM institutions. It contains academic records of undergraduate students who graduated between 2007–2014 and is linked to the First Destination Survey conducted by the Purdue Center for Career Opportunities. The data provide rich information on individuals’ high school records, standardized test scores, college transcripts, and information on the first job since college graduation. To explore the endogenous choices of major and job between STEM and non-STEM and, more importantly, the gender differences in these choices, I apply an extended Roy model where individuals maximize their expected earnings by making the field choices conditional on the two latent skills,General Academic SkillandSTEM-specific Skill, as well as preferences over the field of study and workplace. It is not the intention of this paper to revisit the dynamic problem of college major choices, which fully explores college performance and how that affects one’s choice or update one’s belief, which has been well documented in higher education literature (e.g.Ahn, Arcidiacono, Hopson, Thomas, 2019,Arcidiacono, 2004,Arcidiacono, Hotz, Kang, 2012,Rask, Tiefenthaler, 2008). The main focus of this paper, by adopting the Roy model, is to assess to what extent the gender differences in ability sorting explain the gender gap in STEM fields and quantify the pecuniary returns to STEM degrees and careers.I first show that, on average, skills are statistically weaker determinants of college major choice for women than men; however, gender differences in ability and ability sorting together explain only a small portion of the gender gap in STEM majors. This finding complements the large literature on the gender gap in college STEM degrees. While there is abundant literature that covers ability sorting in choice of college major4and gender differences in college major choice,5the debate on whether and to what extent the gender gap in STEM can be explained by gender differences inabilityand gender difference inability sortinghas not been settled. Some studies find that academic preparation in math and science is crucial in choosing a quantitative college major, and women’s low entry to STEM is mostly due to a lack of innate ability and less readiness in related subjects (Aucejo, James, et al., 2016,Card, Payne, 2017,Eccles, 2007,Ethington, Woffle, 1988,Hanson, Schaub, Baker, 1996,Speer, 2017,Trusty, 2002). Others argue that the small gender differences in preparation do not explain the large gender gap in STEM majors (Dickson, 2010,Kimmel, Miller, Eccles, 2012,Saltiel, 2019,Turner, Bowen, 1999,Xie, Shauman, A, 2003,Zafar, 2013), which aligns with the finding in my paper.Second, I find that the gender gap in major choices is more pronounced among high-ability women. High-ability women arelesslikely to choose a STEM major whilemorerewarded in a STEM occupation than their high-ability male counterparts. The counterfactual analysis shows that the return to a STEM career for a high-ability woman is about $13,000–$20,000 in annualsalary. About 13.66% of the gender wage gap among college graduates can be explained by the return to STEM careers among the non-STEM women in the top 6.67% of the ability distribution.6To the best of my knowledge, this paper is the first to document the disproportionate and considerable number of high-ability women who choose a non-STEM path, quantify the total pecuniary return to STEM careers for this group, and then link the return to the gender wage gap. These findings add to the literature looks at the gender gap in college major as a substantial contribution to the gender wage gap (Blau, Kahn, 2017,Brown, Corcoran, 1997,Daymont and Andrisani, 1984,Eide, 1994).Third, I contribute to the limited work on understanding the link between field choice and job choice. Young women’s participation decreases at each stage of the STEM pipeline with greater gender stratification in STEM occupations thanSTEM education, suggesting that factors other than ability or training generate gender gap in STEM occupations. Some studies find the demands of family and children are major nonacademic barriers for women on the pathway to a STEM profession (Hanson, Schaub, Baker, 1996,Kimmel, Miller, Eccles, 2012,Xie, Shauman, A, 2003).Hunt (2016)finds the major factor that drives the high exit rate of women leaving STEM fields is lack ofpromotionopportunities by female engineers, while the family-related constraints and dissatisfaction with the working conditions are only secondary factors. Taking one step back, I focus on STEM attrition regarding the first job choice of STEM college degree holders and investigate the gender differences in opting-out of STEM fields right after college graduation, which is one of my chief contributions in this paper.I find no evidence showing that ability or ability sorting matters for STEM occupation choice or the gender gap in STEM occupations. In fact, part of the gender gap in STEM attrition could be attributed to the gender segregation in different STEM majors and how we define STEM jobs. Specifically, women are more represented in less Math-intensive STEM majors. Moreover, graduates from less Math-intensive STEM majors are more likely to be well-matched to and to take jobs in non-STEM occupations. Further, by fully decomposing the job decision equation, I show that both work-life balance preference and home regionfixed effectslargely explain the gender gap in STEM attrition. Female STEM degree holders who return to their home state are more likely to opt-out of STEM fields, potentially attributed to women’s preference on job location, family-related reasons, and stereotyping at their home state.",Xuan,None,None
"1. IntroductionWe isolate the economic effect of COVID-19 that operates through the fear of infection: The fact that people voluntarily hunker down and curtail economic activities in response to local outbreaks, even without government-mandated lockdowns. Our estimate provides a unique reference point for the economic costs of the epidemic itself, which gives a sense of how much lockdowns are to blame for the ongoing economic crisis and also how quickly the economy may recover as lockdowns are lifted.Our estimation exploits regional variation in South Korea’s COVID-19 outbreak, as well as the absence of mandatory lockdowns or other social-distancing measures imposed by the government.2Korea had only 30 confirmed infections prior to February 18, 2020, when “Patient 31” attended a religious gathering of the “Shincheonji” sect in Daegu, a metropolitan city in Gyeongbuk province. By February 28, the number of cases in Korea had exploded to 2337, with 1989 cases (or 85.1 percent) in the Daegu–Gyeongbuk region (DG hereafter) alone. Of these, more than 60 percent were traced to Shincheonji.Fig. 1depicts cumulative COVID-19 infections per thousand on February 28 and March 15 by region. Importantly, it is not the case that DG is more susceptible to the Shincheonji sect, which has members and churches spread all over Korea. The regional variation in infections was uncorrelated with any other underlying socioeconomic factors as well, providing grounds for a natural experiment.3Download :Download high-res image (435KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. Confirmed COVID-19 infections across administrative regions.Notes:Circle sizes represent cumulative infection cases per thousand. 1st and 2nd largest circles are the city of Daegu and Gyeongbuk province, respectively. DG, shaded in gray, is the only region with more than 0.1 cumulative cases per thousand.Source:KCDC.The Korean government prioritized intensive testing and contact tracing over social distancing during this period, and never mandated a lockdown. This resulted in two additional advantages of our estimation strategy: (i) Economic reactions were not prescribed by the government’s promulgation of what are essential or non-essential economic activities, unlike in the vast majority of countries, and (ii) As of May 20, 2020, its containment strategy resulted in a very low cumulative infection rate of 0.06 per thousand in Korea, excluding DG, ensuring that the direct effect was entirely confined to DG with a rate of 1.6 per thousand.We exploit this setting using difference-in-differences (DiD) on data from an establishment survey, and separately from a household survey. The scheme captures the causal effect of the outbreak on local employment relative to the rest of the country. The establishment survey allows us to break down the effect by industry and establishment size, and the household survey allows us to estimate the effect by occupation, education, age, gender, and employment type. Our results are robust to seasonal adjustments and heterogeneous pre-trends between regions.ResultsOur causal estimate implies that even in the absence of lockdowns, a one per thousand increase in confirmed infections leads to a 2 to 3 percent drop in local employment. In comparison, non-causal estimates for the United States or the United Kingdom, which implemented large-scale lockdowns, range from 5 to 6 percent. Thus, our results suggest that a significant fraction of their job losses may also be due to voluntary reductions in economic activity by private businesses and consumers, rather than a consequence of government-mandated lockdowns, with the caveat that an estimate from one country cannot be readily applied to other contexts.Employment losses caused by local outbreaks stem mostly from reduced hiring by businesses and are mirrored by a rise in labor market non-participation rather than unemployment. Broken down by industry, losses are concentrated in the accommodation/food, education, real estate, and transportation industries, similar to (non-causal) patterns observed in the US and UK.In addition, the causal effects of the COVID-19 shock without lockdowns are very unequally distributed: More or less all employment losses were accounted for by small establishments (fewer than 30 employees), while large establishments on average grew. Less-educated workers, the young, workers in low-wage occupations and on temporary contracts, and the self-employed lost the most jobs to the COVID-19 shock, even controlling for industry effects. In a nutshell, the most economicallyvulnerable groupseven before the shock experienced the most dire effects. However, while the COVID-19 shock hit industries in which women are over-represented harder, the within-industry effect was positive for women and negative for men. Consequently, the total causal effect destroyed more jobs for men than for women. All these patterns of causal effects—with the exception of the breakdown by gender—are similar to what we observed in the US and UK: The unequal effects of COVID-19 are the same with or without lockdowns.4Our finding that a rise in infections itself destroys jobs, even in the absence of lockdowns, suggests that lifting lockdowns may lead to only modest employment recoveries absent faster reductions in COVID-19 infection rates. In fact, the US unemployment rate remained in double digits and household spending continued to recover only slowly in June 2020 (https://tracktherecovery.org), despite most states reopening. The UK started to reopen all retail shops in mid-June, but year-on-year foot traffic was still down by 50 percent, from a drop exceeding 80 percent in March and April of 2020 (https://www.spring-board.info/benchmarks). Almost half of UK survey respondents chose safety as the number one factor when deciding where to shop (https://www.retaileconomics.co.uk).5Of course, this is not to say that lockdowns are economically harmless either. As a blunt tool to squash infections, they may cause more economic damage than necessary. Targeted policies can contain the epidemic more effectively at a lower economic cost (Aum, Lee, Shin, 2020,Aum et al., 2021).",Sangmin,Sang,Yongseok
"1. IntroductionHigher education decisions constitute one of the largest individual lifetime investments, andeconomic conditionsat the time of such investments matter. Individuals who graduate during recessions have lower lifetime earnings (e.g.Kahn (2010),Oreopoulos et al. (2012)orAltonji et al. (2016)). Another important determinant of lifetime earnings are specialization choices in higher education. For instance, the variation in earnings across college majors is almost as large as the average wage gap between college and high school graduates (e.g.Altonji et al. (2012);Arcidiacono (2004)). Surprisingly, little is known about the joint effects of economic conditions and specialization decisions on earnings.1The current paper tests whether individuals who specialized in fields of study when related sectors were growing earn higher wages later in life. To this end, we match individual data with national statistics for eight high-incomeOECDcountries. We then compare individuals of similar characteristics and abilities who made their specialization choices under comparable macroeconomic conditions but at different times. Those who specialized in fields of study when related sectors were growing earn 2-3% higher hourly wages in 2011 (on average, roughly a decade after graduation). We also find that these positive wage effects are driven by those who later work in occupations related to their field of study. Indeed, for these individuals the effects are much larger; 6-7% higher hourly wages.We then test for heterogeneity in both who chooses fields of study associated with growing sectors, as well as in the wage impacts of doing so. We find men to be less likely to specialize in growing fields, because they avoid traditionally female fields whose related sectors have grown more over recent decades (i.e. health care and education). This begs the question of whether men might be foregoing wage benefits. We find that this is not the case for men with at least a bachelor’s degree, for whom specializing in traditionally female fields is associated withlower wages. However, for men with vocational degrees we do not find the same result, and hence non-wage factors must drive their reluctance towards female fields (e.g. gender identity as suggested byAkerlof and Kranton (2000)).Exploring differences in our findings across countries, we find more traditional gender norms but larger reductions in gender wage gaps in countries where men are more reluctant to specialize in growing fields. We also show thatgender differencesin specialization choices together with our estimates for wage returns to specializing in growing fields can generate around 20–30% of the reduction in gender wage gaps between 1980 and 2012.For our analysis, we use data from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) on individuals aged 20–65 who obtained post-secondary degrees between 1980 and 2010 in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Spain, Japan, Sweden, and Finland. PIAAC data includes both educational choices and subsequent labor market outcomes, as well as individual characteristics and detailed measures for ability. PIAAC data also provides variation in the timing (cohorts) and levels of higher education completed (university and vocational degrees). Using information on individuals’ field of study and year of graduation, we match PIAAC data to national statistics on value-added of related sectors. We then determine whether related sectors were growing or shrinking at the moment individuals chose their field of study. For robustness, we also construct an alternative measure based on growth in employment instead of value added.Certain endogeneity issues make estimating the wage effects of choosing fields of study associated to growing sectors challenging. For instance, students who specialize in growing sectors could simply be of higher ability. We address this issue by including detailed measures for individuals’ cognitive and non-cognitive ability into our regressions. We also control for additional macroeconomic conditions – business cycle, government spending, strength of unions – at the time students made their specialization choices to account for the possibility that for instance certain high-wage (low-wage) sectors could be more likely to grow during booms (recessions). Additionally, individuals who choose certain fields may be different than others in ways reflected in their wages but not by our controls. For this reason, we also include field and field-by-countryfixed effectsinto some specifications of our wage regression. Identification of the wage effect in these specifications is in the same spirit as that used in studies on wage effects of graduating in a recession. However, in such studies economic conditions are measured in the year of graduation, whereas we use sector-specific economic conditions measured at the time of specialization.2Our results hence indicate that even among individuals specializing in the same field within the same country, those who did so when related sectors were growing earn higher wages later on. One issue we cannot address with our data however is the fact that growing sectors might imply a larger supply of graduates in related fields which could depress wages. Given that suchlabor supply effectswould most likely bias our estimates downward, we interpret our results of 2-3% higher hourly wages for choosing growing fields as lower bounds.3There are reasons to think that sector-specific economic conditions might impact men’s and women’s specialization decisions differently. On the one hand, most studies indicate that male students take expected earnings more into consideration than female students when making specialization decisions (e.g.Zafar (2013),Long et al. (2015),Montmarquette et al. (2002)). At first glance, our results on the positive wage effect of choosing growing fields together with men being less likely to specialize in growing fields, seem to stand in contrast to these findings. However, fields of study are also notably segregated by gender, and this is quite persistent over time. In all countries in our sample, men are much more likely than women to specialize in engineering whereas they are much less likely to choose fields such as education or health care which have grown more over recent decades.In line with this observation, whereas most literature finds that gender differences in specialization choices play an important role for explaining men’s higher wages (e.g.Black et al. (2008),Gemici and Wiswall (2014),Machin and Puhani (2003)), more recent studies suggest a negative relationship with gender gaps. For instance,Ngai and Petrongolo (2017)show that the rise of theservice sector(being female dominated) can account for some of the narrowing of gender gaps in hours worked and wages.4In a similar spirit,Cortes et al. (2018)attribute the simultaneous decrease of college educated men and the increase of comparable women in cognitive/high-wage occupations to a growing valuation of “female” skills (especially social skills). Our findings that suggest an important role of gendered specialization choices for the reduction in gender wage gaps contribute to this recent literature by highlighting both labor market benefits to women as female fields grow, but also the potential negative effects for men due to their reluctance to specialize in these fields.Blom et al. (2015)find that women are more responsive than men in adjusting their choice of major during recessions. While their findings point to a greater adaptability of women, ours highlight the lack thereof on the part of men.In addition and different from most existing literature, our data include not only individuals with college degrees but also those with post-secondary non-tertiary degrees (so-called vocational, professional, or associate degrees). We can thus analyze the wage impact as well as the determinants of choice of field of study for all individuals for whom specialization decisions matter for future labor market outcomes, and we are able to study potential differences in outcomes and decisions across degree types.Finally, few studies on the effect of economic conditions on education decisions and labor market outcomes consider countries other than the United States.5Using PIAAC data, available for different countries, we contribute to this literature with a multi-country analysis which enables us to relate our findings to cross-country differences in gender norms and the evolution of the gender wage gap.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: InSection 2we describe our data and we present descriptive evidence for our variable of growth in related sectors and show that it is a meaningful predictor for labor market opportunities in different fields of study.Section 3presents our main estimation of wage effects of specializing in fields of study when related sectors are growing. InSection 4we test for heterogeneity.Section 5explores differences in our results by country, discussing the role of gender norms and the implications of our results for the gender wage gap.Section 6concludes.",Jennifer,Zoë,None
"1. IntroductionAlthough the literature analyzing the effects associated with public expenditures on health (e.g.,Cremieux et al., 1999), education (e.g.,Jackson et al., 2016) and labor market programs (e.g.,Ham et al., 2011) is rich, little is known about related effects of public expenditures in other areas such as sports. This is surprising, given that sports participation can improve health (e.g.,Charness and Gneezy, 2009), educational success (e.g.,Stevenson, 2010), as well as labor market outcomes (e.g.,Lechner, 2009). Furthermore, policy makers commonly legitimate public expenditures on sports with the explicit objective of fostering such effects (e.g.,Federal Ministry of Interior, 2010).We use nationwide micro-level panel data for Germany to explore whether sports-related public expenditures (SPEs) at the municipality level may lead to labor market success at the individual level. In Germany the total amount of annual public expenditures on sports is estimated at approximately €10 billion. The largest shares (i.e. about €3-4 billion each) are spent on physical education (P.E.) teachers in schools as well as the construction and maintenance of sports infrastructure (Pawlowski and Breuer, 2012). We focus on the latter since sports infrastructure forms the basis for sports activity acrossallage groups. Recently, it became an explicit policy target in order to reduce physical inactivity in society.1We focus on the lowest administrative level, that is, municipalities, because money spent by regional authorities on sports facilities is commonly channeled through local authorities.The expenditure data come from the accounting records of more than 12,000 municipalities in Germany and are matched withmeteorological data, information on the socioeconomic characteristics of the local population and extensive individual data from a representative panel of German households, the GermanSocio-Economic Panel (SOEP) (2014). To consider that individuals may not only benefit from the expenditures of their own municipalities but also neighboring ones, we construct a distance-weighted expenditure measure.The rich data set allows us to follow a selection-on-observables approach and exploit the panel structure of our data to identify the effects of interest. In this regard, we control for regional (e.g., population size, population density, weather conditions and geographic information) and individual characteristics (e.g., educational level, family status and household composition) expected to jointly influence public expenditures and labor market outcomes. Moreover, by conditioning on pre-exposure sports participation, labor market performance and various health and social capital indicators, we are able to indirectly control for unobservable individual traits confounding the relation of interest.Overall, our matching analysis reveals sizable effects of local sports facility expenditures on individual labor market outcomes. Forbothmen and women, we observe an economically and statistically significant increase in average household monthly net income of approximately €150 when moving from medium to high levels of SPE.2These effects are captured by earnings gains for men rather than women living in the same household.3Suchgender differencescan also be observed in terms of working time, hourly wages and employment status. Additional analysis based on theSOEP-Innovationssample (SOEP-IS) (2019)suggests that such effects may plausibly occur.4Women in the age cohort under consideration are less likely than men to engage in sportsin generaland to use any of the publicly funded sports facilitiesin particular.Intuitively, one might expect that labor market effects occur through the following channels: comparably larger SPE increase the quantity and/or quality of sport infrastructure inducing changes in sports participation patterns of residents (e.g.,Humphreys and Ruseski, 2007). If these changes are sufficiently large, social capital might increase (e.g.,Schüttoff et al., 2018) and health might improve (e.g.,Warburton et al., 2006). In the end, as argued byLechner (2009), positive labor market effects could unfold through increased productivity, improvedsocial networkingand/or signaling of good health and motivation. Such effects would reduce, if (some) individuals decide to reduce their working time in order to practice (more) sports (Becker, 1965). At the same time, multiplier effects might occur if SPE-induced earning gains by residents are spent on local products and services. Next to suchindividualchannels, other (rather)institutionalchannels might also be plausible. For example, well-equipped sports infrastructure might serve as a soft factor in attracting firms (e.g.,Porter, 1998). Moreover, if local firms are contracted for sports facility-related renovation or maintenance work, one might observe some SPE-induced earning gains for individuals working in these firms.In further analyses, we find some indirect evidence that improved well-being and health as well as an increase in social capital are possible mechanisms that determine how the labor market effects we found may unfold. As such, while recent evidence suggests that higher levels of SPE do not increase the probability to become active (Steckenleiter et al., 2019), our findings suggest that higher levels of SPE may increase activity levels of already active individuals. Since, however, individual gains in social capital and health do not fully explain the effects we find, some other (institutional) channels might also be relevant, though to a lesser extent.The structure of the paper is as follows. We start with discussing the related literature inSection 2.Section 3presents the institutional setting and the sports-related expenditure data.Section 4outlines theeconometricspecification, including details about the sampling, identification and estimation strategies.Section 5discusses the findings.Section 6summarizes the findings and offers some conclusions.

"1. IntroductionOver the last 15 years an impressive number of works has been devoted to highlighting the role played by psychological attitudes in explaining gender gaps in labor market outcomes and women's underrepresentation in the top tiers of the earnings distribution. A robust body of evidence shows that females are more averse to risk and less willing to compete, have a lower degree of self-confidence, tend to face difficulties in negotiations, suffer more under pressure and from receiving negative feedbacks. However, other psychological traits might also play a role. For instance,Alan at al. (2020)show that women's tendency to avoid tasks to be accomplished under public scrutiny is key in explaininggender differencesin leadership propensity.With reference to this finding, we focus in this paper on attitudes toward public speaking. The ability to speak competently in public is essential to work in team and to lead, organize, motivate people and this task seems an important prerequisite for many high-profile careers. For instance,Bandiera et al., (2011)show that managers spend most of their working time talking with/to others (meetings take up 60% of their working hours), suggesting that public speaking might be a key element of highly skilled jobs. On the other hand, public speaking is often considered as an anxiety-generating factor that can negatively impact on personal, academic and professional achievement (Marinho et al., 2017). In lab experiments speaking in front of others is commonly used as an intervention aimed at causing stress (Kirschbaum et al., 1993). The most frequent outcome resulting from public speech anxiety is avoidance of speaking situations (McCroskey, 1997), which sequentially can limit one's involvement and effectiveness in educational pursuits, career opportunities, andcommunityactivities (Daly et al., 1997).To investigate the determinants of public speaking aversion in an incentivized framework, we run a field experiment involving more than 500 students enrolled at an Italian University. The students involved were given the possibility to gain two points to add to the final grade of the exam by solving at home a number of exercises/questions, submitting the solutions to the instructor and accepting to present them orally, either in front of the whole class or at the instructor during office hours. Students were randomly assigned in advance to the group “Presentation to the Class” or to the group “Presentation to the Instructor”. Students had two weeks to decide whether to participate in the proposed task, by submitting their solutions to the problem set. Due to time constraints, we announced that only one third (randomly selected) of participants were required to present their homework.We find that while women are more willing to present face-to-face to the instructor (on average 43% of women), they are considerably less likely to give a public presentation (25%), that is, their willingness to present decreases by 18 percentage points if assigned to the public speaking treatment. In contrast, men tend to participate less compared to women in face-to-face presentation (39% instead of 43%), but there is almost no difference in their willingness to participate if they are assigned to the public presentation (38%).We investigate a number of possible mechanisms. Firstly, we show that public speaking propensity is not captured by other psychological traits, such as risk aversion, self-confidence and self-esteem. We also find that the tendency to shy away from public speaking is also common among women otherwise characterized by high levels of self-confidence and self-esteem. Secondly, consistently with the growing literature stressing the association between female labor market participation and more egalitarian gender attitudes among their children,1we find that women raised by working mothers are less averse to public speaking.Importantly, our main findings do not seem to be driven by strategic avoidance deriving from women rationally choosing not to present in public because they expect to do badly. To support this claim, we firstly show that students randomly selected for the public presentation do not perform worse than their male counterparts. Then, in order to overcome selection problems, we provide additional evidence that exploit a change in the examination system due to the Covid-19 health emergency in which all the students were required to give an oral presentation in front of an audience: we find that no gender differences emerge in public speaking performance.Finally, to understand how individuals react to incentives and time availability/constraints, we have combined our experimental evidence with an on-line survey conducted on a sample of students not involved in the experiment. We find that students are willing to give a public presentation for a reward that is twice of that corresponding to the face-to-face presentation. The required reward is greater for females but the gender gap does not close when rewards for public speaking become higher. In addition, we find that men's propensity to give a public presentation increases more than women's when they are given more time available to prepare for it.This paper contributes to the existing research on gender differences in psychological attitudes (Azmat and Petrongolo, 2014;Bertrand, 2011;Croson and Gneezy, 2009;Niederle, 2015) in that it focuses on public speaking propensity, an aspect which has been overlooked to date. Some economic papers have studied how individuals react to public scrutiny (Alan et al. 2020;Ariely et al., 2009;Battiston et al., 2018) and whether they tend to avoid such types of situation, but, to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first that focuses specifically on speaking in front of an audience. In addition, whereas much existing work on public speaking aversion relies on self-reported measures, or deals with self-selected samples or is unable to control for some important determinants of public speaking propensity (for example, individual ability), our design introduces an exogenous variation that allows us to clearly identify gender differences in public speaking propensity and provides evidence on the determinants of public speaking aversion in an incentivized framework, controlling for quite a large set of cognitive and non-cognitive individual skills.Finally, our work relying both on an incentivized and a survey measure of public speaking attitudes adds to a number of papers seeking to understand how survey and experimental measures of psychological traits correlate (see for instance,Dohmen et al., 2011;Goldback and Schluter, 2018). In line with these works, our results demonstrate that a simple survey question can capture effective public speaking aversion.The results of the present analysis have important policy implications in that they shed light on gender differences in a psychological trait – aversion to public speaking – that is likely crucial for personal and professional success but has been scarcely investigated until now. As this trait, such as other psychological traits, might be the result of nurture rather than nature, a number of policies can be adopted to help women feel more comfortable in public speaking situations.The paper is organized as follows. The related literature is discussed inSection 2.Section 3describes the design of the experiment.Section 4presents the data and reports some balance checks. Our main results are shown inSection 5. InSection 6we investigate a number of possible mechanisms.Section 7discusses whether women strategically avoid public speaking situations. Finally, some evidence on how males and females react to incentives for public speaking is presented inSection 8.Section 9offers some concluding remarks.",Maria,Rosetta,Valeria
"1. IntroductionPost-schooling off-the-job training (Off-JT) is common and can result in a certificate upon completion.2These shorter-term programs are of interest because the number of certificates awarded has increased by over 800 percent over the last thirty years (Carnevale, Rose and Hanson (2012)). However, previous Off-JT literature uses data from the NationalLongitudinal Studyof Youth 1979 cohort, see for exampleLynch (1991),Lynch (1992),Veum (1995)andVeum (1997). It is important to estimate more recent benefits to Off-JT, especially given thatMarcotte (2019)finds that the economic returns to community college education (one type of Off-JT) have grown over time.This paper contributes to the literature by estimating recent returns to Off-JT across levels of formal education. This is important because theNational Center for Education Statistics (2016)reports that among those enrolled in a sub-baccalaureate certificate program in 2011–2012, 34 percent already had a post-secondary credential. Also,Cataldi et al. (2017)report that among 2007–2008 bachelor’s degree recipients, 16 percent had their highest post-baccalaureate enrollment in an undergraduate certificate program and 14 percent had their highest post-baccalaureate enrollment in a post-baccalaureate certificate program. Both programs were reported to be more common than a doctoral degree program or completing an additional bachelor’s degree. Thus, certificate programs are not exclusively enrolled in by those with only a high school degree.Bailey and Belfield (2017)note that scant research has been done on the labor market benefits of stacked credentials (certificates and degrees), despite recent excitement over the possibility that they could help solve numerous problems associated with training a modern workforce. They note that stacked credentials played a central role in the $2 billion Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training Grants Program started by the Obama Administration. An exception that focuses on stacking a post-baccalaureate certificate on top of a bachelor’s degree isGaulke et al. (2019), which uses a correspondence study to measure the impact on callback rates from a post-baccalaureate business certificate. There is no evidence that having the certificate significantly increases the callback rate. Another exception is the recent working paper byMeyer et al. (2020), which uses a fixed-effects difference-in-differences regression and data from Virginia to estimate effects of stacking among adults who already hold one community college credential. They find that stacking increases employment (four percentage points) and increases quarterly earnings by $570 or seven percent.More recent research estimates the returns to certificates from specific types of Off-JT programs using administrative data. For example,Jepsen et al. (2014)find certificates from community colleges in Kentucky increase employment for women, and there are positive wage impacts for both men and women.Stevens et al. (2018)use data from career technicaleducation programsin California to find that certificates increase wages by around 14 percent, and the gains are larger among health fields.Carruthers and Sanford (2018)estimate that students who complete a diploma (longer certificate program) at a state technical center in Tennessee experience increases in earnings, but the returns to terminal certificates are smaller and less economically meaningful.Cellini and Turner (2018)use administrative data to find smaller benefits to certificates from for-profit schools than public schools, whileLang and Weinstein (2013)find no significant difference between for-profit and community college certificates using transcript data and survey data.While there are clear benefits to using administrative data in terms of sample size and avoidingmissing data, there is a downside as well. Specifically, these data do not include information about other types of training that people may be receiving and more detailed information about prior educational experiences. Thus, by using the detailed training data available from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1997 cohort (NLSY97), this paper adds to the literature by estimating recent returns to Off-JT certificates across levels of formal education while controlling for other types of training, albeit with a smaller sample and some missing income data.I use a fixed-effects difference-in-differences regression to estimate impacts on employment and income as is standard in the related literature (for example, see Jacobson,Jacobson et al. (2005),Carruthers and Sanford (2018),Dynarski et al. (2018), andStevens et al. (2018)). This method includes both individual fixed-effects and individual-specific linear time trends, which is the recommendation in Dynarski, Jacob and Kreisman (2018). The model separately controls for enrollment and completion. This is important because the related literature has shown there are returns from completing credits, even in the absence of program completion (see Belfield and Bailey (2017) for an overview of this literature).I find that formal level of education matters for the impact of Off-JT certificate completion by allowing for a main effect of certificate completion, and an interaction term for degree completion prior to Off-JT and certificate completion. For those without a college degree there is a significant and positive impact on employment, regardless of controls for other types of training. However, this does not translate to a significant and positive income premium, likely due to small impacts on annual hours worked. For those with a college degree, I cannot rule out the employment effect is different from those without a college degree. The income premium for certificate interacted with degree completion is positive and significant, and the total impact is also positive and significant for degree completers. This result is robust regardless of whether controls for other types of training are included. This increase in income is partly due to an increase in hours worked among degree completers. While the estimated impact on hours worked is quite similar regardless of whether controls for other training are included or not, the coefficient slightly decreases in magnitude and becomes only marginally significant once the other training controls are included.The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows.Section 2describes some background information on Off-JT and certificates.Section 3describes the NLSY97 data and thesample selection.Section 4describes the fixed-effects difference-in-differences method.Section 5presents and discusses the results on employment, income, and hours worked.Section 6summarizes and concludes.",Amanda,None,None

"1. IntroductionClassrooms around the world are becoming more and more technologically advanced. A growing trend is for schools to provide a personal laptop or tablet to each pupil for use both in the classroom and at home. The idea behind these one-to-one computer programs (or 1:1 programs) is that information and communication technology (ICT) should be extensively involved in the teaching of all subjects. The aim is partly to improve students’ ICT skills, but the ultimate goal is that they will change teaching practices in a way that will enhance learning in general (Islam and Grönlund 2016). Despite their increasing importance, there is little credible evidence on the causal impact of these programs on students’ educational outcomes, especially from high income countries. The urge to know more about the impact of 1:1 has increased even more due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting school closures and transitions to online schooling in many parts of the world. Online schooling generally presupposes that pupils have access to computers and that teachers integrate computers in their teaching practices.We study how the use of ICT in teaching affects student outcomes, for the period 2008 to 2016. We do this by investigating how pupils who are given a personal laptop or tablet, rather than having more limited computer access, are affected in terms of performance on standardized tests in mathematics and language at the end of compulsory school. In addition, we examine how 1:1 programs affect students’ progression to a higher level of education. By surveying all lower secondary schools in 26 Swedish municipalities regarding the implementation of 1:1 programs and combining this information with administrative data, we estimate the impact on educational outcomes using a difference-in-differences design. We compare how educational outcomes change across cohorts for schools that launch 1:1 programs, to changes for schools that have not yet introduced such programs.The theoretical implications of schools’ investments in ICT onstudent performanceare ambiguous: The expenditure a school devotes to ICT will unavoidably come at the expense of other inputs that are likely to affect learning (e.g. the number of teachers or books), and which may be more or less efficient. Similarly, the time that students devote to using technology may come at the expense of other educational activities, which again may be more or less efficient for learning (Bulman and Fairlie 2016).Several previous studies have estimated the effects of investments in ICT on student achievement using credible empirical strategies (e.g.Angrist and Lavy 2002;Leuven et al. 2007;Banerjee et al. 2007;Machin et al., 2007), with very mixed findings. We review the previous literature inSection 2. However, it is uncertain to what extent the findings from this strand of the literature can be generalized to 1:1 programs, as 1:1 initiatives most likely imply a much more intensive use of ICT in the classroom (as well as at home) compared to the initiatives studied in these papers (Hull and Duch 2018).1Some studies have attempted to estimate effects of 1:1 programs on student outcomes, but the majority are plagued with methodological shortcomings (Hull and Duch 2018;Islam and Grönlund 2016;Zheng et al. 2016). Hitherto, two papers provide more reliable evidence on the impact of 1:1 initiatives.Cristia et al. (2012)study a randomized experiment with a 1:1 program in poor regions of rural Peru and find positive effects on students’ general cognitive skills, but no significant impact on test scores in mathematics or language. It is hard to know whether the findings from this context are relevant for schools in developed countries. For instance, very few of the schools in the sample had access to the internet, which puts major constraints on how the technology could be used.De Melo et al. (2014)provide evidence from a setting that bears somewhat more similarities with ours. They study the national implementation of a 1:1 program in primary schools in Uruguay, exploiting the gradual introduction of the program in order to identify its effects. They also do not find any effects on math or reading scores. However, they also show that the computers were not used that frequently in the classroom. In contrast, survey evidence from the National Agency for Education shows that computers and tablets are highly involved in the teaching in Swedish 1:1 programs (seeSection 3).We contribute to the literature by providing one of the first pieces of evidence on the impact of 1:1 programs from a high income country. Compared toDe Melo et al. (2014)we study outcomes at higher ages (lower secondary rather than primary school). While earlier 1:1 studies have focused on short-term impacts (1−2 years) on tests scores, we can follow the students somewhat longer and also examine impacts on their progression to a higher level of education. Specifically, we investigate if exposure to 1:1 programs affects whether students are admitted to upper secondary school and what type of track they enroll in (academic or vocational). This allows us to also capture effects on a broader set of skills compared to merely examining test scores.Moreover, it is proposed in the literature that 1:1 programs may reduce social inequity by providing computers to pupils with low socio-economic status (SES) (e.g.Zheng et al. 2016). But, to our knowledge, there is no rigorous empirical support for this claim. Access to data on parental background, allows us to directly examine whether 1:1 programs reduce the gap in educational performance between students with different SES backgrounds.Furthermore, the rich data we have at hand allow us to perform a number of additional analyses to shed light on some potential mechanisms behind our findings: We examine if the costs associated with introducing 1:1 programs have led to larger classes (a proxy for higher student-teacher ratios), and if these programs have affected the sorting of teachers across schools. We also examine if the effects on student performance differ depending on the type of technology used (laptops vs. tablets).We find no evidence suggesting that 1:1 programs impact average student performance on the standardized tests, the probability of being admitted to upper secondary school, or the choice of educational track. All point estimates are close to zero and the confidence intervals allow us to rule out both medium and large sized improvements on test scores (cf.Kraft 2019). We show that the absence of positive impacts is unlikely to be explained by lower teacher-student ratios or changes in the composition of teachers employed. However, our analysis suggests that 1:1 initiatives may increaseinequalityin education by worsening math skills and decreasing enrollment college-preparatory programs in upper secondary school among students with lower educated parents.The rest of the paper is outlined as follows. We start by reviewing the literature on the effects of ICT in education inSection 2.

"1. IntroductionWorkers’ labor market outcomes vary substantially acrossdemographicgroups. During theGreat Recessionthe unemployment rate increased dramatically, from a pre-recession low of 4.4% in May of 2007 to a high of 10% in October of 2009.1During this period, young workers, non-white workers, and those with no college education experienced increases in unemployment rates of 7 to 8 percentage points, while prime age, white, and those with some college education saw increases of 4 to 5 percentage points. During both expansions and recessions, the unemployment rates for young workers, non-white workers, and those with no college education are typically twice those of their respective counterpart groups.A significant literature exists considering whether countercyclical increases in the unemployment rate are due to inflows (e.g. job losses) or outflows (e.g. hiring).2Recent methodological improvements have led to a consensus of sorts, with outflows appearing to dominate, but with some debate remaining over the relative importance of inflows (e.g.,Elsby et al. (2009),Fujita and Ramey (2009),Shimer (2012)). While numerous researchers have investigated the sources of the high unemployment rates for non-whites (Barrett and Morgenstern (1974)), young workers (Clark and Summers (1982),Choi et al. (2015)), and less-educated workers (Nickell (1979),Cairo and Cajner (2018)), it remains an open question whether aggregate flows are similar across demographic groups, or if disadvantaged workers face special challenges.In order to decompose unemployment rates into component flows for different demographic groups, we extend the methodology of gross flow decomposition. We followShimer (2012)by decomposing the unemployment rate into gross flow transition rates. Further, we build onFujita and Ramey (2009)by decomposing cyclical variation in the unemployment rate into cyclical variation of component flows, with two improvements. First, we extend the two-state decomposition to include transition rates between three states: unemployment, employed, and not-in-the-labor-force. This provides a more-flexible three-state decomposition thanElsby et al. (2015b), which is limited to measuring unemployment fluctuations using the first order log-difference in the unemployment stock.3Second, building on these techniques, we develop a new methodology to decompose the difference in unemployment rates between two groups into the difference in transition rates. This allows us to quantify how much of the differences in unemployment levels can be attributed to differences in each flow between two groups. Although papers such asElsby et al. (2010)andCairó and Cajner (2018)consider the unemployment gaps between groups, to our knowledge we are the first to analytically decompose the gap to explicitly measure the relative contributions of component flows.We use matched monthly CPS data from 1978 through 2017, correcting for misclassification errors followingElsby et al. (2015b)and time aggregation errors followingShimer (2012). We find that the relative importance of the component flows in explaining cyclical unemployment remains consistent across demographic groups, with hiring (UE+IE) always comprising the largest share, movements between unemployment and out of the labor force (UI+IU) the next largest, and separations (EU+EI) the lowest share. In aggregate, we find that 25% of fluctuations are due to the participation margin, slightly smaller thanElsby et al. (2015b).The magnitudes of these flows, however, differ between groups. For young workers hiring explains 70% of the variation, while for other groups it explains only 50–60%. Further, for dominant groups (white, experienced, with college), separations explain about 20% of the cyclical variation in unemployment, while for non-white and young workers separations only explain about 10%. Thus, due to the greater relative importance of hiring, the reduction in hiring during recessions is especially harmful fordisadvantaged groups.We then decompose the gap in unemployment rates between each disadvantaged group and their respective counterpart, finding that separations are the biggest determinant of the gap in each case, with subtle differences between groups. For non-white workers, hiring is almost as important as separations. For young workers, the gap is entirely driven by separations. For individuals with no college experience, separations explain 80% of the gap.We next investigate mechanisms driving these gaps. We find that differences inindustryand occupation can explain around 60% of the gap in separation rates for young and non-white workers and 75% of the gap in separation rates for workers with no college. We examine the role of voluntary and involuntary separations and conclude that unemployment gaps are primarily driven by involuntary separations.Finally, using time-use data from the American Time Use Survey and search data from the CPS, we assess whether search effort can explain the cyclical and level differences in hiring between demographic groups. We find that both young and non-white workers are more likely to spend time searching than older and white workers, respectively, while workers with no college are less likely to spend any time searching than college-educated workers. Conditional on spending any time searching, younger workers and those with no college spend less time searching than their counterpart groups, while non-white and white workers show no difference. We find little evidence that disadvantaged workers spend comparatively less time searching during recessions, although the specifications are under-powered. While we cannot measure the returns to search in the ATUS, we construct a proxy based on the time spent interviewing compared to time spent searching. Young workers spend 6% more of their search time interviewing than older workers, while non-white workers spend 5% less time interviewing than white workers.Thus, although individuals in the three examined disadvantaged groups show similar aggregate unemployment patterns, the mechanisms behind each differ significantly. For non-white workers, the facts that the hiring margin explains almost half of the unemployment gap and that they spend less time interviewing for time searching both suggest that hiring discrimination likely plays a role. This is consistent with experimental evidence on racial discrimination in interview success rates (e.g.Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004)).Young workers’ high unemployment rates are entirely driven by high separation rates. Although they have somewhat higher voluntary separation rates, which could be consistent with lifecycle models of job hopping and experimentation, the vast majority of separations are involuntary. These high separation rates are somewhat offset by young workers experiencing greater hiring rates than other demographic groups, but this leaves them especially vulnerable to depressed hiring during recessions.Finally, for individuals with no college, occupation and industry can explain 3/4 of the gap in the separation rate compared with individuals with college experience. For these workers elevated unemployment rates are largely due to differences in sorting across jobs, although lower search effort could be related to the lower importance of hiring for these workers.In the online appendix we perform a variety of robustness checks. We show that our flow-decomposition results are robust to alternative divisions of workers by race, age, and education. In addition, we show our results are robust to common alternative specifications.Our paper contributes to a large literature on flow-decomposition. Most closely related is the work ofElsby et al. (2010), who perform a two-state decomposition on the unemployment rate for different demographic groups, concluding that hiring is the most important cyclical feature for all demographic groups and separations can explain the difference in unemployment rates between groups. We make several methodological improvements, including a three-state decomposition and estimating the relative contribution of each flow to both cyclical and relative unemployment rates, which reveals substantive differences between demographic groups.Choi et al. (2015)focuses on explaining differences in unemployment and participation rates over the lifecycle. These authors abstract from the cyclicality of flows and instead use a Markov-chain simulation to construct lifecycle unemployment levels. Despite the differences in methodology, they also find that separations are the most important factor in explaining high youth unemployment rates.Our results complement the literature on whether certain demographic groups are the first to be fired during recessions or the last to be hired during recoveries.Couch and Fairlie (2010)andCouch et al. (2016)test this hypothesis for non-white workers andXu and Couch (2017)for young workers, finding evidence that supports the “first-fired” hypothesis but not the “last-hired” hypothesis. Our approach improves the methodology by analyzing cyclical transition dynamics, allowing us to show that while separations are an important part of the story, hiring dynamics play a larger role.Finally, our paper also contributes to a literature on the racial employment gap. We find that the hiring margin can explain a larger fraction of the unemployment gap for non-white groups than for other disadvantaged groups. This is consistent with a large literature on racial discrimination, includingLang and Lehmann (2012),Gobillon et al. (2014), andBorowczyk-Martins et al. (2017).The paper is organized as follows. The data and methodology are are explained inSection 2.Section 3explains the decomposition approach for unemployment fluctuations and finds the estimated contributions for various transition flows. InSection 4we use a similar approach for unemployment gaps and discuss the results.Section 5explores mechanisms that may explain differences between groups. We conclude inSection 6and discuss policy implications.",Eliza,Jhih-Chian,None
"1. IntroductionThe migration of individuals, either within their origin country or internationally, is a global phenomenon in many low-income and middle-income countries.1This has resulted in an increasing number of children being left-behind when their parents migrate. For example, the proportion of left-behind children (LBC henceforth) is estimated to be 27% in Philippines, 36% in Moldova and 39% in Georgia (Cebotari, Siegel, Mazzucato, 2018,Cortes, 2015). In China, the number of children left-behind by parents is very large. According to the Sixth Population Census conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics in 2010, the total number of LBC aged below 18 was over 61.03 million, accounting for 37.70% of children in rural areas and 21.88% of all children in China.An important research question is how the development and well-being of LBC is affected by parental migration. The recent literature suggests that there are two main channels (Griffiths et al., 2018,Wang, 2014). The first pathway is a positive effect associated with increased family income (income effect), which is usually the primaryreason for migration. More abundant family resources enable the family to afford more investment in children’s human capital such as education and health. The second is a negative effect due to the lack of parental care and supervision of children within the family (non-presence effect), which is crucial for children’s development. The net effect of parental migration depends on the relative magnitude of the two effects. Many studies have found that parental migration is linked to the worsening of children’s educational achievement (Cortes, 2015,Meyerhoefer, Chen, 2011,Wang, 2014,Zhang, Behrman, Fan, Wei, Zhang, 2014,Zhao et al., 2014,Zhou, Murphy, Tao, 2014), physical health outcomes (de Brauw and Mu, 2011,Li et al., 2015,Murphy, Zhou, Tao, 2016,Nguyen, 2016) and psychological and behavioral well-being (Botezat, Pfeiffer, 2020,Chang et al., 2019,Lahaie, Hayes, Piper, Heymann, 2009,Lu, Yeung, Liu, Treiman, 2019,Murphy, Zhou, Tao, 2016). Therefore, the negative non-presence effect generally dominates the positive income effect in the human capital development of LBC.Here we focus on rural children whose parents have migrated to work in urban areas in China. According to theNational Bureau of Statistics of China (2016), around 277.5 million rural workers were working or looking for jobs in Chinese cities in 2015. The existing institutional restrictions have preventedmigrant workersfrom bringing their children with them when migrating for work in cities. Due to the household registration system (hukou), rural migrant workers and their families are excluded from full access to social welfare benefits such as pension, subsidized health care and unemployment insurance that are available to local residents in cities (Song, 2014). Migrant children are generally excluded from the publiceducation systembecause of thehukou-based discriminatoryeducational policy(Chen and Feng, 2013). Therefore, rural–urban migrants often have to leave their children in rural villages. Children who are left behind either live with other family members or enroll in boarding schools, in the absence of parental care and supervision.In this paper, we analyze thepeer effectsof LBC on their classmates in rural China. Students’ learning and social interactions generally take place in a class. Specifically, we analyze, in a causal fashion, thespillover effectsof the presence of LBC on the mental health of their non-left-behind classmates in the same classroom. Our empirical analysis is based on the baseline survey of the China Education Panel Survey conducted during the 2013–2014 academic year, which is a nationally representative survey of students, their parents, teachers andschool administratorsin China’s middle schools.A major identification problem is that the potential effect of LBC on their classmates’ mental health may be contaminated by students’ selection into schools. We address this selectivity problem by conditioning on schoolfixed effects. An additional concern is that, within the same school, there may still be a selectivity issue due to endogenous sorting of students across classes. To circumvent this problem, we restrict our sample to students in schools that place students to classes using random assignment. Our identification strategy is to compare the mental health of non-left-behind students from two classes in the same grade of the same school who have similar characteristics and face the same school environment, except for the fact that one class has a comparatively higher share of LBC than the other due to the random assignment of students to classrooms in each school.To preview the main findings, our analysis indicates that the presence of LBC has a negative and statistically significant effect on the mental health of non-left-behind children. Specifically, a one-percentage-point increase in the proportion of LBC in class reduces the mental health index of their classmates by 0.017 of astandard deviation. These deleterious effects on mental well-being are similar for grade-seven and grade-nine students. We find little evidence of heterogeneity in the negative peer effects by student gender and school rank. However, the adverse mental health effects are heterogeneous by class size, with the most pronounced impact found among students in big classes. Furthermore, an examination of the mechanisms driving the negative spillover effect on mental health reveals that a higher proportion of left-behind peers leads to the worsening of class climate and peer-to-peer social interactions. However, we find no evidence that students’ academic outcomes are impaired by left-behind peers in the same classroom. Therefore, the negative mental health effects of LBC seem not induced by their classmates’ dissatisfaction with academic progress.This paper contributes to the literature in the following ways. First, we provide a novel investigation into the social spillovers of LBC on the mental health of their non-left-behind classmates, exploiting random student-classroom assignment within China’s middle schools. In the existing literature, there are only a few studies examining the causal peer effects on mental health.2Exploiting exogenous variation from roommate assignments,Eisenberg, Golberstein, Whitlock, Downs, 2013find little evidence on the contagion of mental health among college roommates. Using cross-cohort variation in the share of same-gender peers who are depressed within schools,Giulietti et al. (2020)find a significant peer effect for females but not for males.Kiessling and Norris (2020)exploit within-school cross-cohort variation in student composition and show that a higher relative rank among peers in school improves students’ long-run mental health. Our paper is the first to analyze the peer effects of students of migrating parents on the mental health of their non-left-behind classmates. This analysis is important since LBC are common in many developing countries.Second, we contribute to the literature on external stressors and children’s mental health. Previous studies mainly focus on stress factors such as parental job loss (Bubonya, Cobb-Clark, Wooden, 2017,Schaller, Zerpa, 2020), disruption of family structure (Brown, 2006,Slade, Beller, Powers, 2017), family income declines (Khanam, Nghiem, Rahman, 2020,Milligan, Stabile, 2011) andvictimization(Le et al., 2018,Turner et al., 2006). Our study shows that children’s mental stress increases when there is a higher proportion of LBC in the same classroom.3Last, our results contribute to the current policy debates on the socioeconomic benefits and costs of rural–urban migration during the urbanization process of a developing country. Limited to an intergenerational perspective within households, most previous studies have documented negative influences of migrating parents on the education, health andpsychosocial developmentof their LBC in rural areas. This study further shows evidence on the adverse spillover effects of LBC on their peers. Therefore, this study also contributes to the recent literature on spillover effects of disruptive peers (Ahn and Trogdon, 2017,Carrell et al., 2018,Carrell and Hoekstra, 2010,Figlio, 2007). Highlighting that the welfare losses of children resulting from adult population’s migration have been understated, our findings have important policy implications for China and other developing countries experiencing continued migration of adult workers leaving their children behind.The remaining paper is organized as follows.Section 2describes the data, andSection 3discusses the empirical approach.Section 4presents the estimation results.

"1. IntroductionEmployee options are widely used by enterprises, and their use is increasing. In China, about 12% of listed firms issued options to employees (except for top managers) in 2015, and the number increased to 16% in 2019, as shown inFig. 1. Such popularity is also in the United States (Lazear, 2004;Oyer, 2004;Oyer and Schaefer, 2005). The motivation for issuing employee stock options is often said to be that it gives employees incentive for high productivity. However, such incentive effect is controversial in the existing literature. On the one hand, scholars believe employee options can link the interests of employees to that of enterprises so that the principal-agent problem between enterprises and employees can be solved and employees become more likely to put effort into their work. On the other hand, there are many divergent opinions. First, the free-rider problem in a multi-agent environment weakens the effectiveness of employee options as incentives (Lazear, 2004). Second, the marginal effect of ordinary employees’ efforts on corporate profits is small, so the incentive effect of employee options is too weak to support firms’ broad-based stock option plans (Barron and Waddell, 2003;Oyer, 2004). Therefore, whether the incentive effect of option ownership on employee performance exists is an empirical question that has not yet been answered.Download :Download high-res image (204KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. The increasing use of employee options in ChinaNote: Data come from China Stock Market & Accounting Research Database (CSMAR), which is a widely used data set of listed Chinese companies.To answer that question, many challenges need to be addressed. Two of the most important challenges to be faced are the availability of data and the endogeneity of option ownership. Although employee options are common in enterprises, the data are usually kept confidential for commercial reasons and remain unavailable to researchers. This makes the empirical evidence of options from employee data scarce. Further, there is an endogenous correlation between option ownership and employee productivity, which might come from either missing variables (such as ability) or reverse causality. This endogenous correlation makes the conclusion of empirical research on the incentive effect of employee options biased and unreliable. However, in this paper, we combine personnel data with option nomination events to solve both challenges, providing the first piece of solid empirical evidence to support the causality research into employee options performance incentives.This paper analyzes the causal effect of employee options on performance in three steps. The first step is to use option nominations data with the difference-in-differences (DID) approach to analyze whether option ownership has an incentive effect on employee performance. We obtain our data from a large listed firm in China. One of the ways employees acquire options in this firm is through nomination by their departments. To elaborate, departments nominated employees for the Employee Excellence Award based on their performance, and then the firm chose the final prizewinners from the nominees and granted options to them in each year. This process shows that, at least from the perspective of the departments, the nominated employees exhibited similar job performance and were eligible for options. Treating employees who were nominated but did not get options as the control group can reduce the systematic difference between the treatment group and the control group, thus mitigating theendogeneity problemin theregression analysis. Additionally, the data we use are longitudinal panel data, including data before and after an employee received options. The unobservable systematic difference between employees who were granted options and those who were not is further eliminated in the DID method. Through DID regressions, we find that, after the individualfixed effectis controlled, the estimated coefficient of option ownership is insignificant, implying that options have no significant impact on employees’ performance.Furthermore, through a dynamic analysis of the impact of options, we find that the difference in performance between the treatment group and the control group does not change significantly in the year following the grant of the options. This further confirms that the ownership of options has no significant impact on employees’ performance. Moreover, we classify options by their vesting schedules to explore whether the dynamic effects of option ownership are robust with different option-vesting schedules. The results show that employees with vested options still do not have better performance subsequent to option ownership.The second step is the robustness check. First, we verify the pre-trend of the DID model in the data. By comparing the time-varying changes in the dependent variables between the treatment group and the control group, we find that there is no significantly different change between the two groups before the treatment group is treated. This indicates that we could not reject the assumption of the parallel trend statistically. Second, to further eliminate the difference between the treatment group and the control group before nominations, we conductpropensity score matching(PSM) to mitigate the endogeneity problem caused by the selective bias in nominations. We find that little difference between the regression coefficients before and after matching, indicating that the basic regression estimation results are robust. Third, we further explore the relationship between the options’ value and employees’ performance. The regression results show that employees’ performance does not change significantly because of the options’ value.The final step is to analyze the heterogeneity of the incentive effect of employee options. We subdivide the samples by gender, education, job levels and option exercising behavior, and perform a DID regression in the subsamples. The results show that the options have no significant effect on employees’ performance, either in gendered subsamples or in education subsamples. Even in employees with option exercising, the effect of option ownership is still insignificant. Moreover, we find that employee options could significantly improve the performance of employees at high job levels but not at low job levels. Therefore, the insignificant incentive effect of employee options on performance is more likely caused by the subtle marginal impact of low-level employees on the company's performance.The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we review the previous literature and document our contributions and limitations; in Section 3, we introduce our data; in Section 4, we present the basic empirical results; in Section 5, we conduct the robustness test; in Section 6, we further conduct the heterogeneity analysis; and in Section 7, we provide the conclusion.",Qiaoqiao,Hong,None
"1. IntroductionThe relationship between ill health and socioeconomic status is well established in epidemiological literature (e.g.Marmot 2005;Lahelma et al. 2019). Nonetheless, questions on causality remain high on the research agenda, while development in research methods and designs promises new advances in understanding the relationship. In this article, I shed light on this question by looking at breast cancer survivors in Finland.Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in both developed and undeveloped countries. Improvements in the early detection as well as treatment have led to an increased number of survivors, but psychosocial and economic consequences of illness may persist. While several studies have attempted to study the labor market effects of illness, or cancer in specific (for example,Bradley et al., 2005;Andersen et al., 2015;Jeon, 2017;Schärfe Jensen et al., 2017a), few have focused on the differences in the impact between socioceconomic groups. However, such evidence is fundamental for understanding the underlying reasons for health and incomeinequalitiesand for a better design of social security, health care, and rehabilitation systems. The association between health and labor market outcomes is likely to defy generalizations, and therefore analyses should take into account social structures (McDonough and Amick III, 2001).This article studies the impact of breast cancer on earnings and employment among Finnish women of prime working age (35–55 years old). In particular, I analyze whether there is a heterogeneous effect according to prior earnings level and to what extent mental health problems mediate the effect. To my knowledge, existing studies have not been able to control for mental health problems (with the exception ofSchärfe Jensen et al., 2017b, who look at psychiatric disorders before cancer); and in general, few studies have analyzed the effect of breast cancer on mental health. Therefore, as an important contribution to the literature, I also study the impact of breast cancer on the prevalence of psychiatric diagnoses among cancer survivors and the impact on earnings when mental health problems are controlled for. Furthermore, examining separately the impact on earnings and total income, we are able to estimate the efficiency of the social security system in protecting incomes among individuals with illness.Rather than using survey information on self-assessed health, which is the most commonly used indicator in studies on the association between health and employment, rich register data of the entire Finnish population spanning the years 2000 to 2016 is employed. This allows a longer term view of developments before and after the diagnosis of cancer. Exploiting the panel dimension of the data, we are able to follow individuals four years before and five years after the person's first diagnosis of breast cancer. FollowingHeinesen and Kolodziejczyk (2013)andFadlon and Heien Nielsen (2019), the identification strategy relies on the timing of the diagnosis: the treatment group is diagnosed with breast cancer between 2004 and 2009, while the control group experiences the same health shock later, between 2010 and 2015. With this strategy, we avoid an important source of unobserved heterogeneity—an advantage compared to many previous studies on the relationship between health and socioeconomic variables. The results are based on difference-in-differences estimations with individualfixed effects.The study contributes to the general literature on the association between health and labor market or other socioeconomic outcomes, and on the competing hypotheses of social causation and social selection (e.g.Blane et al., 1993;Adda et al., 2003;Warren, 2009;Halleröd and Gustafsson, 2011;Aittomäki et al., 2012;Kröger et al., 2015;Hoynes et al., 2016;Lindeboom et al., 2016;Hoffman et al., 2018). From a policy point of view, evidence on the impact of illness on labor market trajectories and economic security is important for a better design for social protection for people faced with health problems and for understanding the indirect societal costs of illness. Potential socioeconomic differences in the impact of ill health on income can partly explain the social gradient in health. Thus the results will provide evidence for the debate on health inequalities. Likewise, the results help us understand howincome inequalitiesare maintained. The study also provides information on one possible mechanism between health shock and earnings by looking at the mediating effect of mental health diagnosis. Studying a country like Finland, with auniversal health caresystem and relatively generoussocial transfers, will also provide evidence on how institutions matter in modifying the association between health shock and economic outcomes.",Maria,None,None
"1. IntroductionThe choice of college major is one of the most important decisions made by young people and can have a great impact on later earnings in the labor market (Altonji et al., 2016). It is well established that academic preparation and student interests are predominant determinants of college major choice – students tend to enter fields that they enjoy and in which they are likely to do well. However, recent research has found that, in addition to absolute skills and achievement, relative class rank in school matters for human capital accumulation and foreducational behavior. In this paper, we use Irish data to investigate whether, conditional on achievement at the end of high school, rank in English and math affects choice of college major. Given its importance to the economy and its large gender gap, we place particular emphasis on whether higher rank in math and lower rank in English causes high school students to be more likely to choose Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) fields in college.There are two major motivations for our study. First, many papers have studied the role of comparative advantage (in particular, in math and English) in determining college major.1However, little work has considered whether students additionally consider their within-school rankings in math and English when making choices. Students may lack information about their academic ability (Zafar, 2011;Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner, 2012,2014;Bobba and Frisancho, 2014) and this uncertainty may lead students to infer their comparative advantage across subjects from their rank across subjects in school.2While relative achievement is informative, it can also lead students astray if the distribution of achievement in their class is not typical. If ordinal rank is important, it could motivate policy interventions to provide information to school students about their absolute achievement level. Second, women are still greatly underrepresented in STEM college programs with serious implications for gender earnings gaps (Card and Payne, 2017).3Previous research has found that this is partly due to female comparative advantage in English compared to math (Speer, 2017;Card and Payne, 2017;Delaney and Devereux, 2019;Breda and Napp, 2019;Aucejo and James, 2019). However, relatively little is known about whether the STEM gender gap can be further explained by the tendency for women to be higher ranked within-school in English and lower ranked within-school in math than men.In this paper, we study whether rank in math and English affects college major decisions, after controlling for multiple measures of achievement and academic interests at the end of high school. There are several reasons why math and English ranks may affect college major choices. Students may develop confidence in a particular area of study from a higher class rank or despondence from a lower one.4The advice students obtain from peers, teachers, or family members about college major choice may depend on school-cohort rank in math and English.5Also, students may be uncertain about their ability and so may rely on rank to infer ability and comparative advantage across subjects.While the recent rank literature has found strong impacts of class rank on many outcomes including earnings, high schoolgraduation, college enrollment, and risky behavior (Murphy and Weinhardt, 2020;Denning et al., 2018;Elsner and Isphording, 2017,2018), there has been little focus on the relationship between rank in English and math in high school and choice of college major. Using UK data,Murphy and Weinhardt (2020)find that students who are ranked higher in a subject in primary school are more likely to complete that subject at A-Level. However, they do not examine rank at the end of high school or the choice of college major.Denning et al. (2018), using data from Texas, find that math rank in 3rdgrade has a positive effect on doing a STEM major in college; however, they do not consider the effects of rank at the end of high school.6Elsner et al. (2019)find that rank within teaching sections in a Dutch university affects subsequent choice of courses. However, their focus is on different choices within the field of business rather than across very distinct fields.We add to the literature in several ways. First, our focus differs from these papers in that, rather than studying the effect of rank at early ages on much later choices, we abstract from rank effects on exam grades and examine the effects of rank on preferences for college choices at the end of high school, conditional on absolute performance at the end of high school. We have grades for each of the 7 or 8 subjects taken in the Leaving Certificate examinations. These high-stakes exams are centrally set and graded and so are comparable across all students. They provide a detailed description of academic readiness at the end of high school and allow us to control for absolute achievement in a variety of subjects as well as for academic interests as revealed by high school subject choices. Thus, we can isolate the effect of math and English ranks on student choices, conditional on their academic interests and achievements.Second, our data include preference rankings over college majors for all high school students who apply for college and, if relevant, the program accepted. Thus, we can study desired college program of study for all persons who consider college, not just for the sample who actually attend. As such, we can see how math and English ranks affect desired college major for all applicants. Third, compared to the U.S., there are several features of the Irish system that make it conceptually easier to study the effects of high school rank on college choices. Unlike in the US, college admission decisions are never influenced by class rank but are predominantly determined by Leaving Certificate points that are solely based on scores in the student's best 6 subjects. Also, both English and math are compulsory subjects throughout high school so we can calculate within-school ranks in these for all students who apply to college. Finally, we add to the literature on the gender gap in STEM. In mixed-sex schools girls tend to be lower ranked in math and higher ranked in English than boys. We examine whether these differential ranks in English and math by gender have explanatory power for the gender gap in the choice of STEM as a college major and for the larger gender gap in STEM in mixed-sex schools compared to same-sex schools.We find that, conditional on achievement at the end of high school, within school-cohort percentile rank in English and math is predictive for field choice, particularly for STEM and Arts and Social Sciences – higher English rank is positively associated with choosing Arts and Social Sciences and negatively with STEM; higher math rank is positively associated with STEM and negatively with Arts and Social Sciences. Notably, these effects occur even though we control for an extensive set of measures of absolute achievement at the end of high school, and the institutional setup implies that within-school rank plays no role whatsoever in college admissions decisions. Subject ranks have some explanatory power for the gender gap in the choice of STEM as a college major in mixed-sex schools – the tendency for girls to be higher ranked in English and lower ranked in math within school-cohorts can explain about 4% of the STEM gender gap in mixed-sex schools and about 10% of the difference in the STEM gender gap between mixed-sex schools and same-sex schools.The structure of the paper is as follows: In the next section, we describe the institutional background and data, and, inSection 3, we describe the empirical methodology.

"1. IntroductionLabor market frictions generated by high search costs can lead to higher rates of non-participation and worse-quality matches between firms and workers (MacMinn, 1980,McCall, 1970). These costs, and their impacts, are often heterogeneous across populations, affecting those who are geographically remote or credit constrained in particular (Abebe et al., 2020). However, search costs are not necessarily harmful; they could help screen out unqualified or uninterested candidates, asKuhn and Skuterud (2004)andHadass (2004)find in internet job search and asAlatas et al. (2016)find in the realm of social protection programs. Understanding the empirical correlates of job-search decisions is important in order to understand the potentially heterogeneous nature of search costs and labor market frictions. Additionally, understanding who responds to reduced search costs, and how that affects program effectiveness more broadly, has important implications for determining optimal recruitment strategies by firms, as well as for labor market program design (Heckman and Smith, 2004)This paper examines the determinants of job-search decisions and the role of search costs on selection into search. I ask, how do individuals’ backgrounds and perceptions affect their job-search decisions, and how does incentivizing search affect these determinants? I consider the decision to look for work abroad in the rural Philippines, where the overseas labor market is large but job search is costly. I combine survey data from 860 individuals ages 20–35 with a novel dataset of overseaslabor demandto measure how the perceived benefits and costs to search, based on individuals’ qualifications, labor-market perceptions, and past exposure to the overseas labor market, affect their decisions to attend and apply for work at a nearby job fair for overseas work. Job and career fairs are commonly used by employers across both developed and developing countries (Chang, 2009,Abebe et al., 2018), and they are a popular means of recruitment in the Philippines for both domestic and overseas positions (Esguerra et al., 2001).I experimentally reduce search costs by offering individuals from randomly selected neighborhoods a modest incentive to attend this nearby job fair. Specifically, they receive a gift certificate to a local fast-food restaurant conditional on job-fair attendance. The randomized incentive to attend a job fair reduces search costs relative to respondents’ outside option by offsetting the time and transportation costs of attending. I show that the cash value of the voucher is greater than the estimated time costs of traveling to the fair for most participants.1Although its value is not perfectly fungible, it will, at a minimum, offset the cost of one meal for approximately four people. Because all respondents are invited to the fair, it should not play an informational role. The incentive is similar in spirit to door prizes or giveaways that employers or coordinating organizations commonly used to entice job-seekers to attend job and career fairs.The survey team hosted this fair in partnership with the municipality, and it attracted more than 750 participants, roughly 30 percent of whom were survey respondents. Enumerators tracked individuals’ attendance and participation at the job fair, including interviews with employers and their outcomes, and I matched this administrative data with survey responses to compare the characteristics of those who search with and without the subsidy and to compare how those who stay and participate in the fair differ from those who leave immediately after retrieving their incentive.Under standard job-search models, individuals will look for work if the expected benefits exceed the expected costs. Those with higher expected benefits from working abroad are more likely to attend the fair, which could include individuals who are more qualified for overseas work or who are more likely to successfully deploy overseas conditional on receiving a job offer. However, more-qualified workers may also have higher opportunity costs of searching and migrating, inducing negative selection on qualifications andeducation levels. Ultimately, the distribution of underlying relative returns to search, which reflect qualification levels, individuals’ outside options, and the costs of search, will determine the overall pattern of selection (Borjas, 1987,Roy, 1951). The presence of imperfect information further complicates selection into job search if individuals’ perceived returns to searching do not reflect their actual returns. Individuals may over- or underestimate their own qualifications, or they may be highly uncertain about their prospects (Diagne, 2010,Falk, Huffman, Sunde, 2006a,Falk, Huffman, Sunde, 2006b). Consequently, labor market perceptions may directly play an important role in the decision to search for work.I expect that incentivizing attendance should bring more people to the job fair, but heterogeneous search costs mean that incentives also may affect selection into search, with the net impact ultimately depending on the relationship between search costs and ability (Abebe et al., 2020). Additionally, the impact on actual applications is potentially ambiguous, as it also will depend on the costs and benefits of applying conditional on attendance.Among my study sample, 13 percent attend a job fair for overseas work. Of those, 79 percent apply and roughly 50 percent are invited for a final interview. These individuals are positively selected not only in terms of their qualifications for work, but also in their perceived likelihood of job-finding. However, perceived wages are not an important predictor of attendance or participation. A randomly assigned incentive dramatically increases attendance regardless of underlying qualifications, but the least qualified leave immediately after receiving their incentive, preventing potential crowd-out during the fair. Only those who are highly uncertain about their overseas job prospects stay to apply for work, indicating that the marginal applicant may use job search as a tool to learn about his or her own labor market prospects. In aggregate, however, the incentive does not increase the number of final interview offers.This paper uses data from the same experiment described inBeam (2016), although the two papers differ in their temporal and topical focus.Beam (2016)examines the impact of job-fair attendance on employment outcomes and labor-market perceptions in the months following the fair, using randomized voucher assignment to instrument for attendance. That paper finds that while attending a job-fair does not lead to overseas migration, it does affect how individuals look for work. Specifically, attendance increases the likelihood of looking for work outside the region and being employed in the formal sector in the months following the fair, indicating that job fairs may help job-seekers learn about their labor market prospects. It also discusses the impact of providing information about overseas wages and about qualifications for overseas work, which affect individuals’ labor market perceptions but not their labor market outcomes.In contrast, this paper unpacks that initial decision ofwhetherto attend a job fair. Specifically, I focus on examining selection into attendance and participation and how reducing search costs with an incentive affects that selection into search. I also expand the set of predictors beyond standard characteristics like age and education by including labor-market perceptions, estimated search costs, and a proxy measure of qualifications for overseas work.This paper joins a growing literature on the causal impact of reducing job-search frictions. Transportation subsidies increase the number of job matches (Phillips, 2014,Abebe et al., 2018), andAbebe et al. (2020)find that incentivizing job applications leads to higher employment, particularly from those more likely to be credit constrained or face high search costs. Conversely, subsidizing job search in South Africa led to no change in employment or wages (Banerjee and Sequeira, 2020), and a job-matching program in Jordan effectively yielded no matches (Groh et al., 2015). In the more general realm of program participation,Duflo and Saez (2003)find that incentivizing employee attendance at a retirement savings plan enrollment fair yields large increases in attendance, but those induced to attend are no more likely to enroll.Additionally, this paper contributes to the literature on subjective expectations about labor-market prospects. These expectations play an important role in job-search and migration decisions (Diamond, 1982,Harris and Todaro, 1970,Mortensen, Pissarides, 1994,Sjaastad, 1962). Biases in expectations have been documented across multiple contexts and tend to be particularly strong in developing countries, where labor market frictions can be high (Arcidiacono, Hotz, Kang, 2012,Attanasio and Kaufmann, 2014,Jensen, 2010,Nguyen, 2008,Banerjee, Sequeira). I find that the perceived likelihood of job-finding, as opposed to wage expectations, is particularly important in the decision to look for work. This complementsMcKenzie et al. (2013), who find that (male) potential Tongan migrants underestimate the likelihood of employment and wages they would earn, andBaseler (2020), who finds that families underestimate domestic migrant earnings. However, unlikeMcKenzie et al. (2013), who find that expected earnings are associated with higher migration application rates, I find that only the perceived likelihood of job-finding matters for the decision to search.2",Emily,None,None
"1. IntroductionEmployment protectionlegislation(EPL) has been at the heart of the political and policy debate in many countries for a long time. By imposing constraints on firms’ ability to adjust their workforce in reaction to the shocks associated with demand, costs and technology, EPL has often been blamed for negative effects at both the micro and macro level, e.g., lower productivity and possibly lower aggregate employment (Hopenhayn and Rogerson, 1993). Therefore, over the past 20 years, various countries have tried to reduce EPL across the board. However, in countries that have introducedlabour market reforms, the EPL rules for open-ended contracts have been barely changed, at least until very recently (Boeri, Garibaldi, 2019,Dolado, 2016), partly owing to political economy considerations (Saint-Paul, 1997). A process of ‘labour market flexibilization at the margin’ (i.e., for temporary or atypical workers) has been frequently implemented, which has led todual labour markets.1A better understanding of the effect of EPL in dual labour markets is important because it can provide insights on some unsettled debates in the empirical literature on the impact of EPL on firm performance. Indeed, several scholars have reported robust evidence of the negative impacts of EPL on labour andtotal factor productivity(Autor, Kerr, Kugler, 2007,Bassanini, Nunziata, Venn, 2009,Bentolila, Dolado, Jimeno, 2019,Bjuggren, 2018,Cingano, Leonardi, Messina, Pica, 2010,Cingano, Leonardi, Messina, Pica, 2016,Hijzen, Mondauto, Scarpetta, 2017).2However, other scholars have reported that EPL may increase labour productivity, such as through a positive impact on innovation (Acharya, Baghai, Subramanian, 2014,Griffith, Macartney, 2014,Koeniger, 2005) or investments in firm-specific training by employees (Belot et al., 2007). Therefore, as forcefully argued byBoeri et al. (2015), more work is needed because most of the empirical literature tends to look at the overall net effects of EPL on productivity rather than at the exact mechanisms.In this paper, we provide new insights on the mechanisms linking labour productivity, EPL and temporary contract use by investigating the effect of EPL on firm-provided training in dual labour markets. To this end, we provide clean evidence on the causal effects of EPL on firm-provided training using a labour market reform, the Fornero Law, that was introduced in Italy in 2012. Using two waves of a representative survey of Italian firms, we leverage quasi-experimental variation in EPL using a Difference in Regression Discontinuities (diff-in-disc) design (see, for instance,Cingano, Leonardi, Messina, Pica, 2016,Grembi, Nannicini, Troiano, 2016). This identification strategy allows us to overcome limitations of previous studies on the effects of EPL using Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) strategies (for example,Bolli and Kemper, 2017), i.e., the role of confounding policies operating at the same cut-off as EPL and possible dynamic sorting.Before the reform, the Italian legislation included size-contingent firing restrictions for open-ended contracts, and based on these restrictions, the firing costs increased sharply above the 15-employee threshold.3These restrictions were greatly reduced in 2012, but only for firms above the 15-employee cut-off, by a labour market reform known as the Fornero Law. Combining the different levels of EPL below and above the 15-employee cut-off with the EPL changes introduced in 2012 gives us a unique opportunity to obtain clear causal evidence on the effect of EPL on training using adiff-in-discdesign. Providing new evidence is important and timely given the paucity of studies that have empirically investigated the interplay between EPL and firm-provided training (seeSection 2) and in light of several reforms that have reduced employment protection, especially at the margin, i.e., for temporary workers, in many countries.4The main results of our paper can be summarised as follows. Our preferred estimates suggest that by reducing EPL for large firms (i.e., firms above the 15-employee cut-off), the Fornero reform increased the average number of trained workers by approximately 1.5 individuals, which corresponds to an approximately 50 per cent increase in the number of trained workersat the cut-offfirm size (3.1 workers were trained on average prior to the reform). The results are not sensitive to an extensive set of robustness checks, including donut-hole regressions to account for potential manipulation of firm size around the cut-off, changes in the bandwidth, changes in the order of the polynomial in firm size, data heaping on firm size, placebo regressions, possible misclassification associated to measurement error in the forcing variable and restricting the analysis to the panel component of the data (and including firm fixed effects), among others.We further explore the main mechanisms that might be behind the estimated effect of relaxing EPL on training. The first is thesubstitutionbetween temporary and permanent workers (Cahuc et al., 2016). Several scholars have found empirical evidence consistent with this prediction (Cahuc, Malherbet, Prat, 2019,Centeno, Novo, 2012,Hijzen, Mondauto, Scarpetta, 2017,Schivardi, Torrini, 2008). Thus, owing to the training gap existing between permanent and temporary workers (Albert, Garcia-Serrano, Hernanz, 2005,Arulampalam, Booth, 1998,Arulampalam, Booth, Bryan, 2004,Booth, Francesconi, Frank, 2002,Cabrales, Dolado, Mora, 2017,Ferreira, de Grip, van der Velden, 2018), the greater use of permanent contracts should also entail higher training. The second mechanism is proposed byDolado et al. (2016). The authors argue that, under plausible conditions, firms’ temporary-to-permanent conversion rates go down when the EPL gap between temporary and permanent workers increases. Temporary workers respond in turn to lower conversion rates by exerting less effort, while firms react by providing less paid-for training to them. Thus, the Fornero reformby reducing the EPL gapmight have contributed to an increase of firms’ training provision to temporary workers.We provide evidence consistent with the first explanation. Indeed, after the Fornero Law, firms for which EPL was reduced increased the number of permanent workers, which enjoy higher training, by about 1.7 units at the threshold. Under the assumption that training is provided to new permanent hires, for instance, temporary-permanent worker substitution induced by the reform at the cut-off would be able to explain alone the whole effect we find on firm-provided training.We make two main contributions to the existing literature, which is discussed in more detail inSection 2. First, we provide robust evidence on the effects of EPL on training in Italy using adiff-in-discdesign in a quasi-experimental setting. Our approach represents an improvement over the existing literature since using thediff-in-discdesign in the Italian context allows us to address some of the weaknesses of RDDs, namely, the existence of other labour market institutions also changing discontinuously at the same margin of firm size as the EPL (i.e. confounding policies). These are the right to create works councils in the firms and the existence of short-work programs for employees in firms under severe economic difficulties, which might affect a firm’s provision of training. Accounting for the confounding policies through adiff-in-discdesign, our analysis leads to different conclusions compared toBolli and Kemper (2017).5Second, we investigate the main mechanisms of the effect of EPL on training, and provide evidence of substitution of temporary with permanent workers around the 15-employee cut-off.All in all, our analysis shows that in countries characterised by very stringent EPL for permanent workers and persistent dualism in the labour market, the excessive use of temporary contracts and the short duration of employment spells may be one key determinant of the incentives for firms to (not) provide training.The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. InSection 2, we provide the theoretical grounds for our empirical analysis and review the empirical literature. InSection 3, we introduce the institutional framework and present our identification strategy. After discussing the data inSection 4, we present our main results inSection 5. In the onlineAppendix B, we discuss potential threats to identification and test the assumptions of thediff-in-discdesign. Some robustness checks are conducted inSection 6.Section 7explores the mechanisms behind the estimated effect. Finally,Section 8summarises the main findings and draws conclusions.",Massimiliano,Maurizio,Giovanni
"1. IntroductionAccording to recent survey measures of nonstandard work arrangements—also known as the gig economy—roughly 30 percent of American adults or household heads engage in informal “gig” work as either a primary or secondary source of income. The estimated participation rate is quite similar across several surveys, despite the fact that each uses a somewhat different definition of gig work.1Although a variety of recent measures indicate that a large share of adults or household heads participates in the gig economy in some fashion, the aggregate amount of gig work performed in the United States has not been quantified. Estimates of gig economy participation along the extensive margin alone could provide a misleading sense of the aggregate economic significance of gig work, especially if it is assumed that all participants engage full-time in gig work. Instead, recent studies examining income from gig work, along with our own previous findings, suggest that most gig employment represents a secondary source of income rather than a primary source (Collins et al., 2019;Bracha and Burke 2014;Robles and McGee 2016). Therefore, a more accurate and meaningful assessment of the gig work phenomenon requires having measures of gig participation along both the extensive and intensive margins. Using our Survey of Informal Work Participation (SCE-SIWP, or SIWP for short), this paper is the first to estimate the aggregate significance of the gig economy using measures of hours worked among gig workers together with measures of participation rates. As online or platform-based gig work (hereafter “online gig work”) is likely to become increasingly common, it is especially important to assess the specific contribution of gig work that makes use of these technologies. We therefore decompose our measures of informal work between online gig work and offline gig work.Another open question regarding the measurement of gig work is how much of it is missing from official measures of employment,labor force participation, and hours. Our survey is nearly unique in permitting an assessment of this “hidden margin” of informal work, as it elicits labor force status and hours using questions taken from the Current Population Survey (CPS) in addition to probing for gig work participation, gig hours, and gig income. Accordingly, this paper is among the first to assess potential distortions in official employment statistics—including the labor force participation rate, the unemployment rate, and the part-time employment rate—due to the failure of the CPS to fully capture gig work along either the extensive or the intensive margin. The only other study we are aware of that estimates misclassification of informal workers in the CPS isAbraham and Amaya (2019). However, their survey did not probe for informal work hours, and their survey-takers consisted entirely of users of the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) online work platform, a selected group whose behaviors and survey responses with respect to informal work may not be indicative of patterns in the general population. Instead, our survey covers a broad set of informal workers and also allows us to isolate the distortions to employment statistics contributed by online gig work in particular.Based on our survey, we estimate that as of 2015 roughly 32.5 percent of U.S. household heads qualify as gig workers according to our broadest criteria (described below),2very close to other comparable measures in the literature. Considering only labor-intensive informal activities, we find that 18.5 percent of household heads are classified as gig economy workers, performing an average of 26 h per month of such work and earning an average of $413 per month. Combining our estimates of participation and hours, among household heads the aggregate amount of gig work completed per month is roughly equivalent to the monthly work of 3.77 million full-time employees. The latter figure amounts to 4.9 percent of the total number of employed household heads in the U.S. as of 2015.3While the labor-intensive online gig workers represent 30.5 percent of all labor-intensive gig workers, they contribute just 20.5 percent of the FTEs.The responses to our survey also indicate that the CPS most likely fails to fully capture nonstandard work. Among non-retired respondents who classify as unemployed based on their responses to questions taken from the CPS, about 29 percent report engaging in labor-intensive gig work, as do 16 percent of those who classify as not in the labor force (NILF) under the CPS. As argued below, most or even all of these individuals should qualify as employed under the CPS. Treating all labor-intensive gig workers as employed (except those who say they are retired), the U.S. employment rate in 2015 would have been 4 percentage points higher than the rate indicated by the CPS, and the labor force participation rate would have been 3 points higher.Isolating the contribution of online (labor-intensive) gig workers to the simulated changes in the participation and unemployment rates, we find that the changes are much smaller—about 1 percentage point in either one of these rates. These smaller discrepancies indicate that online gig workers are less likely to be misclassified as non-employed under the CPS questions. This is consistent with evidence from our survey suggesting that online gig workers are more likely to have a traditional job: a greater share of them report being employed full-time, they report higher average hours in their main job, and they are more likely to cite “earning extra money on top of regular pay” as a reason for engaging in informal work.4We also find evidence suggesting that the CPS understates the full-time employment rate by a significant margin, due to missed informal work hours. These findings may arise because gig work is performed sporadically, and/or because individuals may not think of it as work. To capture such work arrangements, the CPS might add questions designed specifically to determine whether individuals engage in gig work, either as a primary or secondary income source, and/or to ask about work done in the previous month (rather than week) that is expected to continue.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: the SIWP is described in detail inSection 2, the main results are inSection 3,Section 4discuss robustness checks, andSection 5concludes.",Anat,Mary,None
"1. IntroductionLabor market policiesaround the world attempt to remove barriers for workers with low earnings potential to join the labor market. In the US and UK, the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Working Family Tax Credit have been prominent programs (seeMeyer and Rosenbaum (2001),Blundell (2000)andBargain and Orsini (2006)). These programs reduce the cost of labor for low incomes by reducingtaxesand other compulsory contributions. The expansion of suchtaxexemptions has come with increasing awareness of potential negative side effects (e.g.Bargain et al. (2010)). In Germany, jobs with earnings below a certain threshold, so-called minijobs, are exempt from both income tax and compulsorysocial security contributions(SSC). Side effects of tax exemptions can be split into two types. First, firms and workers might decide to reduce hours of work and/or wages for workers eligible to benefit from the policy. Second, if there are equilibrium effects, individuals beyond those directly targeted by the policy are also affected.Chetty et al. (2011)show that if firms cannot easily change the number of hours of a posted job offer, they have an incentive to package their hours-wage bundles according to average preferences of job-seeking workers. Since the same jobs were eligible for tax reduction for one group but not another in the German system of minijob tax exemption we study here, identification of the role of firm responses is particularly intuitive. This paper sets up and empirically estimates a simple equilibrium job search model with a discontinuous tax schedule in order to evaluate wage, hours and participation effects and study welfare consequences of the German minijob policy for different workers.The German setting is well-suited for an empirical application of our equilibrium job search model: Throughout the period of analysis (1999–2002), tax exemptions in Germany were awarded to workers in minijobs only if workers did not hold asecond job. Employees who held a minijob as a second job were not covered by the policy at all. While the impact of the policy on the earnings distribution of small jobs (defined throughout as a job with earnings up to €800) is less marked for them than for directly affected workers, we find indisputable bunching at the tax exemption threshold for both groups. Studying workers whose budget set is not directly affected by the tax policy allows us to identify the equilibrium effects of tax subsidies: For workers not subject to the minijob tax exemption, changes in hours and wages result only due to equilibrium effects. We estimate our model using a combination of German administrative and household survey data. We find that the minijob tax exemption provokes significant firm reactions. With our estimated structural model we then simulate different counterfactual policies. We quantify the effect of the tax exemption by comparing the situation with a labor market with a smooth tax schedule. These simulations confirm the costs of discontinuous tax policies but also highlight how firm reactions interact with search frictions to influence different workers differentially. We make three main contributions.First, our unique institutional setting allows for a particularly convincing identification of equilibrium effects. Tax subsidies offered to certain workers with low earnings end up affecting many other workers in the labor market. We estimate our equilibrium job search model and quantify these distorting effects. We thereby complement work discussing unintended equilibrium consequences of making work pay policies (Kolm, Tonin, 2011,Leigh, 2010,Rothstein, 2010) as well as firms’ role in responses to tax reforms in general (Kopczuk and Slemrod, 2006), and bunching in particular (Best, 2014,Chetty, Friedman, Olsen, Pistaferri, 2011,Gudgeon, Trenkle, 2019).Tazhitdinova (2020)also analyzes the German minijob policy. She proposes using the observed bunching to estimate labor supply elasticities. This approach focuses on hours responses of individuals whoreducetheir earnings due to the tax exemption. It does not allow for an estimation of the increase in employment due to the minijob tax exemption - this participation margin appears to be an important policy objective however.1We structurally estimate the relative importance of participation and hours margins, and find participation effects to be large, with over one third of minijobs held by individuals who would have zero earnings (rather than higher earnings) without the tax exemption.Second, we include discontinuous taxes into a standard equilibrium job search model (Shephard (2017)includes continuous taxes). In line with the bunching literature (Saez, 2010), we find important additional welfare costs caused by the discontinuous nature of taxes. We show that these are further increased by firm responses and moderated by search frictions. In contrast to previous equilibrium job search models, we are able to rationalize discontinuous bunching at tax thresholds in the interior of the earnings distribution. We are thus able to analyze counterfactualpolicy reformsthat aim at removing the welfare costs induced by tax non-linearities.Third, we empirically analyze gains and losses of a tax exemption directly affecting millions of German workers. We show how alternative tax policies could increase different groups’ - and overall - welfare. Search frictions are found to be an important determinant of welfare effects across different groups of workers.Our model is related to evaluations of tax policies based on analyses of labor supply as a discrete choice (specifically for minijobs, seeArntz et al. (2003)andBargain et al. (2010)). Given that they lack an equilibrium framework, the wage distribution is typically taken as given. The evidence of equilibrium responses is a strong indication that individuals cannot freely choose hours, however. The models most similar to ours thus include restrictions on the free choice of hours (e.g.Van Soest et al. (1990),Bloemen (2008),Beffy et al. (2018)). Job search models provide a way of explaining some of these constraints on hours without resorting to ad-hoc restrictions on the set of labor supply choices available to individuals. A different strand of the literature has investigated the reason for the divergence between labor supply elasticities based on individual-level data from that based on more aggregate data.Chetty et al. (2011)present a simple model of firms reacting to workers’ tax incentives and argue that firm responses may be a key to explaining “micro versus macro elasticities”,2but refrain from estimating a structural search model. Their model would also be difficult to fit to the data as it generates no wage dispersion and only focuses on the intensive margin. The German tax exemption importantly affects the extensive margin however - a margin policy-makers are very often concerned with when implementing labor market policies for low-earnings groups. We here present a model that rationalizes the same mechanism in a way that allows estimation andwelfare analysisof an important policy for promoting low-wage workers.Section 2characterizes the market for small jobs in Germany.Section 3presents our model and simulation results.Section 4outlines our data and showsdescriptive statistics.Section 5discusses identification and estimation.Section 6presents estimation results and counterfactual policy evaluations.Section 7concludes.",Luke,Michael,None
"1. IntroductionThe relationship between fertility and partnership has changed significantly over the past sixty years in the United States. The percentage of births to unmarried women increased from 5.3 percent in 1960 to 39.7 percent in 2007 and has remained steady at roughly 40 percent through the present (Martin, Hamilton, Osterman, Curtin, Mathews, 2013,Martin, Hamilton, Osterman, Driscoll, 2019). Declines in marriage rates, increases in nonmarital childbearing, and increases in divorce rates have led to roughly one-third of children not living with two married parents.2Taking note of these changes in family structure, social scientists have documented that single-parent homes and family disruption are associated with lower education, income, and health for both children and parents.3Given the significant associations between family structure and economic outcomes, it is important to understand how family structure comes about and the degree to which public policies might affect family structure. Abortion policy has been theorized to impact the key decisions and outcomes that determine family structure: sexual behavior and pregnancy, partnership, and childbearing. Abortion policy has also changed significantly over time. Elective abortion, while legal in a handful of states prior to 1973, became legal at a national level in 1973 following the Supreme Court caseRoe v. Wade. States have since passed a variety of restrictions that increase the cost of obtaining an abortion. Changes in these state-level restrictions could affect a large number of women given that 45 percent of pregnancies in the United States are unplanned and 42 percent of these pregnancies are aborted (Finer and Zolna, 2016).The existing empirical research on abortion policy has tended to estimate its effects on the decisions and outcomes that contribute to family structure in isolation rather than using a framework that explicitly models the interrelated nature of these decisions and outcomes.4In this paper, I develop and estimate a structural model of cohabitation, marriage, sexual and contraceptive behavior, abortion, and school attendance to shed light on the various ways in which abortion policy might impact family structure and women’s human capital accumulation. The model is designed to nest four distinct mechanisms that the theoretical literature on abortion has discussed but which have never been empirically distinguished.Economic theoryhas viewed abortion as a decision that women make while weighing contemporaneous costs, personal preferences, and the impacts of having a child on lifetime utility. In this framework, a decrease in the cost of abortion could cause some pregnant women on the margin to switch from giving birth to aborting. If this is the only channel through which abortion costs impact behavior, then a decrease in the cost of abortion necessarily increases abortions and decreases births. I refer to this mechanism as theprice effect. However, a decrease in the cost of abortion also decreases the cost of pregnancy for women who would choose abortion. If individuals are forward-looking when making sexual and contraceptive decisions and avoiding pregnancy is costly, then these women will choose a higher probability of becoming pregnant.5I refer to this mechanism as theinsurance effect. If there is no uncertainty in the (dis)utility associated with abortion and birth, then any new pregnancies stemming from the insurance effect are aborted. Taken together, the price effect and insurance effect imply that a decrease in the cost of abortion will lead to an increase in pregnancies, an increase in abortions, and a decrease in births.The implications of a model that includes only a price effect and an insurance effect are consistent with results from the empirical literature on the 1973 legalization of abortion. A number of papers use variation in the timing of legalization across states to show that legalization increased pregnancy rates and decreased birth rates (Ananat, Gruber, Levine, 2007,Ananat, Gruber, Levine, Staiger, 2009,Gruber, Levine, Staiger, 1999,Levine, Staiger, Kane, Zimmerman, 1999). However, a handful of papers that have estimated the causal effect of state-level abortion policies on births have found that decreases in abortion costs eitherincreasethe birth rate or do not have a significant effect (Kane, Staiger, 1996,Levine, Staiger, 2004,Levine, Trainor, Zimmerman, 1996).6To explain these findings,Kane and Staiger (1996)propose a model in which some uncertainty about a partner’s commitment is resolved between conception and the abortion decision. A choice between abortion and birth may be uncertain, ex-ante, if the relative cost depends on some information revealed post-conception. Among women facing this uncertainty, a decrease in the cost of abortion decreases theexpectedcost of pregnancy, which leads to a higher pregnancy rate. For some of these pregnancies, a revelation of positive information results in birth being optimal. I refer to this mechanism as theinformation effect. The information effect will increase births when the cost of abortion falls, which means that the price effect and information effect impact births in opposite directions.Akerlof et al. (1996)argue that it is also important to consider how contraception and abortion relate to competition in the market for partners. They use correlational evidence fromtime seriesdata to link a decline in “shotgun marriages” to the legalization of birth control and abortion.7To explain this link, they develop a model with two types of women: those who are willing to abort a pregnancy and those who are not. They argue that prior to the legalization of abortion both types would be unlikely to engage in extramarital sex without a promise of marriage should a pregnancy occur, which makes it more likely that men give and keep such promises. Once abortion is legalized, those women who are willing to abort a pregnancy become more willing to have extramarital sex without a promise of marriage should a pregnancy occur. Per Akerlof, Yellen, and Katz, this shift will affect competition in the market for partners and could lead to an equilibrium where promises of marriage become rare. Effects on competition in the market for partners could also have an impact on sexual and contraceptive behavior that is distinct from the insurance effect. I refer to any impact of abortion policy on partnership markets ascompetitive effects.Based on the existing literature, there are at least four distinct channels through which a change in the cost of abortion can impact behavior and outcomes, which I formally define as follows:Definition 1Price EffectTheprice effectis the impact of abortion cost on the probability of abortion should a pregnancy occur.Definition 2Insurance EffectTheinsurance effectis the impact of abortion cost on the chosen probability of pregnancy that results because the abortion cost is the cost of ending an unplanned pregnancy.Definition 3Information EffectWhen the abortion cost falls, the insurance effect can lead to pregnancies that would not have otherwise occurred. If there is no ex-ante uncertainty in the (dis)utility from abortion or birth at the time the pregnancy decision is made, then all pregnancies stemming from the insurance effect would be aborted. Aninformation effectoccurs when a pregnancy stemming from the insurance effect ends in birth as a result of a woman realizing information post-conception that is favorable to birth.Definition 4Competitive EffectAcompetitive effectis the impact of abortion cost on the availability of partnership opportunities for pregnant women and/or on sexual behavior that results from the effects of the abortion cost on competition in the market for partners.While the possibility of each of these mechanisms has been discussed, their significance and magnitude have not been separated. The external appendix uses simple models to show exactly how each mechanism operates and summarizes the potential impacts of each mechanism on pregnancies, abortions, births, single births, and single births as a proportion of all births. Importantly, multiple mechanisms could contribute to the impact of abortion policy on any of these outcomes, sometimes having effects in opposite directions.Separately identifying these mechanisms is of theoretical interest, but is also of practical importance as the significance of each mechanism could vary by policy type anddemographicgroup. Hence, considering the impacts of new or changing abortion policies on the population requires an understanding of the potential magnitude of these mechanisms. Further, the welfare implications of abortion policy depend on which mechanisms are relevant; only the competitive effect suggests that a decrease in the cost of abortion could result in welfare losses for some women.8In direct contrast to the predictions ofAkerlof et al. (1996)of such an effect,Chiappori and Oreffice (2008)develop a static, frictionless matching model of the marriage market that implies legalization of abortion increases welfare for all women. A primary difference is thatChiappori and Oreffice (2008)do not model preferences for sex and assume that unintended pregnancy is exogenous with respect to a change in the availability of abortion. They write that, “Our approach views fertility mostly as the intended consequence of a well-informed decision, whereas [Akerlof et al.’s] emphasizes children as involuntary by-products of sex.” I model individuals as deciding an amount of sexual activity and contraceptive use while taking into consideration the impact of these decisions on the probability of becoming pregnant, which allows for both “intended” and “unintended” pregnancy.To begin my analysis, I use longitudinal data that follows over 3,000 women for fifteen years, from 1997 through 2011, to examine the effects of within-state variation in parental consent laws for abortion and Medicaid funding restrictions.9Regression models with state and year effects, as well as state-specific time trends, suggest that parental consent laws significantly reduce the probability of aborting a pregnancy among women subject to the restrictions, but have insignificant effects on the probability of pregnancy. The effect of parental consent laws on abortion given pregnancy supports the existence of price effects for these laws. Medicaid funding restrictions are estimated to have insignificant effects on both abortion and pregnancy. I also estimate the effects of each of these policies on the probability of marriage and cohabitation following a pregnancy to provide preliminary evidence for competitive effects. The results suggest that parental consent laws significantly increase the probability that a minor who becomes pregnant is married in the year following the pregnancy. This result supports the existence of a competitive effect for these laws. Similar to the other regression models, Medicaid funding restrictions have statistically insignificant effects in the models for marriage and cohabitation. As I describe in more detail below, the within-state variation in Medicaid funding restrictions during the years that my sample covers is very limited. Further, for those states that do experience a change in Medicaid funding restrictions, the change may have had limited or no impact on the extent to which the Medicaid system paid for abortion in practice. These realities coupled with the results from the reduced-form exercises leads me to focus on the impacts of parental consent laws.I next design and estimate a life-cycle model that contributes to a group of papers that estimate structural models of fertility and partnership decisions (Brien, Lillard, Stern, 2006,Eckstein, Wolpin, 1989,Francesconi, 2002,Keane, Wolpin, 2010,van der Klaauw, 1996,Sheran, 2007). Most of these papers treat pregnancy as the decision variable rather than sexual behavior, ignoring abortion and assuming that pregnancy is timed perfectly.10Further, many papers that model fertility restrict the sample to married women and those that model partnership leave fertility as an exogenous process. The model presented in this paper allows for endogenous pregnancy probabilities, abortion, and partnership. Marriage and cohabitation markets are modeled in a search context, with partnership offers arriving with a probability that depends on a woman’s history of choices, outcomes, andpolicy environments. The competitive effect enters the structural model in a reduced-form way, whereby abortion policy can have direct effects on the probability of partnership offers and can shift preferences for sex outside of the insurance effect channel.Amador (2014)is the first paper to estimate a structural model that includes the abortion decision, but the relationship between partnership markets and abortion policy and that a woman may have more information about partnerships post-conception are not modeled, and sexual activity is treated as exogenous.Amador (2014)develops a method for correcting for underreporting of abortion in survey data, which I apply a variant of in my estimation procedure, and also includes alabor supply decision, which I do not.Simulations from the structural model allow me to decompose the total effects of parental consent laws on fertility and partnership into the impacts from each of the theoretical mechanisms. When parental consent laws are removed, the price effect leads to an increase in abortions among pregnant minors and the insurance effect leads to a small increase in pregnancies. A portion of the additional pregnancies result in births via information effects, however this increase in births pales in comparison to the decrease in births that stems from the price effect. Further, the portion of new pregnancies that end in birth are not primarily being shifted from abortion to birth as a result ofpartnershipinformation, which suggests that it may be profitable for future research to consider the other forms of uncertainty that play a role in abortion decisions. Finally, removing parental consent laws decreases partnership opportunities for pregnant minors through the competitive effect. This decrease in partnership opportunities for pregnant minors creates an incentive to avoid pregnancy, which works against the insurance effect and ultimately leads to a prediction that removing parental consent laws could decrease pregnancies overall. The decrease in partnership opportunities for pregnant minors also slightly increases the probability that a pregnancy is aborted and increases the percent of births that are to single and cohabiting women. Taken together, the effects of removing parental consent laws on behavior lead to a decrease in pregnancies, an increase in abortions, and a decrease in births, especially to single women. The price effect and competitive effect together result in the percent of births to single women decreasing, the percent of births to cohabiting women increasing, and the percent of births to married women decreasing.Simulations also allow me to consider the life-cycle effects of parental consent laws, as well as a counterfactual scenario where abortion is banned. Parental consent laws are shown to have economically meaningful effects on total fertility, the probability of being a single or unwed mother, marriage rates, and school attendance over the life-cycle. For women who experience a pregnancy as a teenager, removing parental consent requirements would reduce the average number of children by roughly 10 percent and increase average years of school by roughly 1.2 percent by age 28. I also use the model to consider the most extreme form of cost change: an abortion ban that removes abortion from the choice set for all pregnant women at all ages. Importantly, because competitive effects are modeled in a reduced-form way, the results from the counterfactual abortion ban simulation must be interpreted as the effects of a ban assuming no effects on competition in the market for partners. Another caveat to the abortion ban simulation is that many argue that the legalization of abortion led to a shift in social or cultural norms surrounding sex and partnership, which a model that assumes policy-invariant preference parameters is ill-equipped to capture. However, given those caveats, the results from the counterfactual abortion ban simulation suggest that a ban on abortion would reduce pregnancies by 7 percent, while having large impacts on birth rates and total fertility. By age 28, the model predicts that an abortion ban would increase average number of children by 0.266 or 28 percent. Among those women who would abort a pregnancy in the baseline, an abortion ban decrease average schooling by 0.4 years or 2.6 percent.It is important to recognize that this research focuses on a more recent time period than the period in which abortion was legalized. Many things, including social perceptions of single motherhood and sex outside of partnership, could be vastly different during the 1997 to 2011 period than during the early 1970s. Further, the change in the cost of abortion that came with legalization was presumably much greater than the costs that state-level restrictions create. Therefore, while the results in this paper can teach us about the role of abortion policy in the decision-making environment for more recent cohorts of women, one should be very cautious in using these results to make inferences about the impacts of abortion legalization on family structure in the decades following legalization.The paper proceeds as follows.Section 2discusses the estimation sample and presents motivating evidence from reduced-form models.Section 3presents the structural model.Section 4discusses identification and estimation of the structural model.Section 5presents the model fit and simulation results.Section 6gives concluding remarks.",Matthew,None,None
"1. IntroductionThe last 40 years have seen dramatic shifts in the wage distributions of many countries. It is now well-accepted that much of this is due to the impacts of computer technology. Computers specialize in performing repetitive, routine tasks (Autor, Levy, and Murnane, 2003), which have traditionally been concentrated in middle-wage jobs (Goos and Manning, 2007). As a result, increased computer availability has “hollowed out” the wage distribution (Autor, Dorn, 2013,Goos, Manning, Salomons, 2014,Michaels, Natraj, Van Reenen, 2014). The core idea is that increasingly affordable computers perform routine tasks, reducing the need for the medium-skilled workers traditionally specialized in these jobs. In this paper, I argue for a modest reformulation of the “computerization” of the labor market (to use Autor, Levy, and Murnane’s terminology). I then test its most direct policy implication, which differs from the traditional theory.My hypothesis builds on the observation that many (not all) transformative technologies still require some level of human oversight. Computers handle complex calculations, but can rarely perform work tasks completely independently. Humans are often still needed to enter inputs (e.g., enter a customer’s information so that a computer can look up relevant records or make calculations), read the outputs (e.g., tell customers about the results), and physically do what the computer says (e.g., actually getting the product from the warehouse location identified by the computer). Even in the extreme case of industrial robots, humans often must still be ready to hit the emergency stop button and make sure small machine errors do not compound during production. Instead of completely replacing workers, technologies often reduce the skills required of workers to perform these tasks. Machines may simplify a job but typically they still needsomeoneto operate them.Consider, for example, material recording and production clerks, who work in warehouses to “keep track of information in order to keep businesses andsupply chainson schedule. They ensure proper scheduling, recordkeeping, and inventory control.” (All descriptions come from the Department of Labor Occupation Outlook Handbook [OOH].) Thirty years ago, this required a well-organized individual to manage complex filing systems and coordinate dozens of incoming and outgoing shipments each day. Today, software handles these complexities, and the OOH notes that materials recording clerks “increasingly use tablets and other handheld computers.” Modern clerks scan incoming shipments and read out the tablet output directing workers where to move the contents. Still, someone needs to do this task. As another example, statistical clerks “compile data and tabulate statistics for use in statistical studies... [and] tabulate statistics using adding machine and calculator.” Certainly Microsoft Excel has simplified these tasks so that a much wider range of workers can perform them. Alternatively, consider the thousands of photographic process workers in the economy over the 1990’s and 2000’s. These workers develop, process, and print photographs, and many are employed in pharmacies (a very different occupation from photographer). In the days of darkrooms, this required careful light restrictions, chemical blends, and complicated projection equipment. Compared to this, printing digital photography is simple. Although technology has simplified these jobs, they have not disappeared. In fact, during the rapid periods of technological transformation during the 1980’s and 1990’s, they showed virtually no change in employment, although they increasingly employed less-skilled workers. One explanation is that fully-automated robots are not yet available to do these jobs, but technological simplification allows less-skilled workers to do them, which I call technology-enabled deskilling.If computers need an operator then the cost of technology adoption is not simply the cost of the equipment itself but also the cost of less-skilled labor to operate it. While the declining price of computer equipment has received considerable attention (Nordhaus, 2007), I focus on how the price of low-wage labor affects technology adoption decisions. Because low-skilled workers are an input into computerized production, I show that a high minimum wage canslowthe automation of routine, middle-wage jobs.I begin by formalizing these ideas in a simple nested ConstantElasticity of Substitutionmodel. Because low-skilled computer users are a complement to computer capital (with the composite being a substitute for medium-skilled routine workers), I show that raising the minimum wage can reduce technology adoption and raise medium-skilled workers’ employment. I then test the predictions of the model in the United States for the period 1980-2005. To measure firms’ shift towards more technology-based production of routine tasks (rather than the traditional approach using medium-skilled workers), I follow my model and use the employment of high-skilled IT workers. Below I discuss several advantages of this approach relative to using measures of computer capital, and one of them is that it allows me to characterize production among thousands of industry-state cells. This facilitates an identification strategy that exploits state variation in the minimum wage andindustryvariation. The core idea behind identification is to recognize that not all industries have equal need for low-skilled computer users as they shift towards technology-based production. I treat industries where such computer users are unnecessary as control industries, and use this to estimate the effects of the minimum wage.For cross-state variation I derive novel, useful variation in the minimum wage induced by state price differences. For cross-industry variation, I measure the share of low-skilled workers (defined by education and wages) who directly use a computer at work (based on the Current Population Survey Computer Use Supplement) and the share in an occupation where tasks would benefit from a computer (based on the Dictionary of Occupational Titles). As I show below, industries differ dramatically in the extent to which low-skilled workers are employed in these “computer user” type positions, and I call this the degree oflabor-dependenceof technology in the industry.With both cross-state and cross-industry variation, I employ an identification strategy that explicitly estimates the differential effect of the minimum wage in industries with highly labor-dependent technology, essentially using industries where low-skilled labor is irrelevant for computers as control industries. By focusing on the interaction between the minimum wage and industry level labor-dependency, this strategy allows me to include state-yearfixed effects, substantially alleviating controversial identification assumptions in past minimum wage research. I discuss the advantages of my strategy below, as well as keymeasurement issues.I find that industries that often use low-skilled computer attendants tend to hire fewer information and technology (IT) workers when the real minimum wage is high (compared to other industries). I interpret this as suggesting that the labor-dependence of computer technology leads to slower technology adoption in these industries when the minimum wage is high. I estimate that a $1 decrease in the minimum wage causes a 30% increase in employment of very high-skilled IT workers and a .9 percentage point decline in the routine share of the wage bill, both relative to a counterfactual where low-skilled workers do not use computers. Both conclusions are based on specifications using state-year fixed effects to account for time-varying state-specific confounds affecting all industries equally. Though these results are based on cross-industry comparisons, I discuss the assumptions under which they apply to the aggregate economy.The structure of the paper is as follows.Section 2reviews the most relevant literature.Section 3provides descriptive evidence to support my argument, andSection 4develops a simple conceptual framework.Section 5describes myeconometricstrategy andSection 6discusses data and measurement.Section 7presents the results andSection 8concludes.",Mitch,None,None
"1. IntroductionThe reality of ‘getting old before getting rich’ and large amount outflow of rural middle-aged labor of China make rural old-age security be the focus of recent policy. By the end of 2017, there were 241 million elderly people aged 60 or above in China, including over 100 million in rural areas, and the number of left-behind elderly people is increasing year by year17. The village retirement problem relates directly to the stability of Chinese village order and the continuous development of agriculture. In recent years, the government has raised spending on health and education in the countryside, and is starting to introduce rural pensions, that is the New Rural Pension Scheme (NRPS). The Chinese government expects that villagers can be active participants in the pension plan, instead of relying onoffspring. This makes it very important to understand how pension participation decisions are made.In cities, the vast majority of the elderly have pension insurance, while most of the rural elderly in China mainly rely on traditionalfamily careand land, obtaining pension security through the “feedback mode” of generation care and support (Jiang, 1995);Xu, 2001;Shen et al., 2012;Chang et al., 2014). This is because China has not included rural pension into the scope of public finance coverage before the implementation of the new rural insurance. With the establishment of the socialist market economic system, China's rural old-age system is experiencing a great change from family support to social support.Many financial decisions are usually complicated and difficult considering the complexity of financial instruments, limited cognitive ability and experience (Agarwal et al., 2009;Bertrand and Morse, 2011;Agarwal and Mazumder, 2013), the high costs of thinking through many financial decisions (Madrian and Shea, 2001), the uncertainty about future earnings, and social norms (Lieber and William, 2018). It is much more convenient to learn from peers when they make these decisions.Bursztyn et al., (2014)find that one's peers tend to make similar financial decisions with him, both because they learn from his choice (“social learning”) and because his decision directly affects others’ utility of making the same decision (“social utility”). Peer influence could reinforce or offset the direct impact of a program's parameters on take-up (Dahl et al., 2014), therefore, the long-run equilibrium enrollment rate may be substantially lower or higher than otherwise expected.There is abundant literature on the influence factors and what roles do peers play in retirement savings (e.g.Duflo and Saez, 2002;Duflo and Saez, 2003;Mugerman et al., 2014;Beshears et al., 2015;Lieber and William, 2018). However, their research subjects are people who have a regular job and fixed income, and little empirical evidence has shown whether or not the conclusion is also suitable for groups with low and unstable income. In a society based on agriculture, people will continue working in their field as long as they could to earn a living. In other words, individuals would not stop working in most cases just because of reaching a certain age, let alone retirement. In contrast with the widely investigated financial plans in the existing literature, the NRPS program we studied is rather unique and has been implemented in China for almost ten years. NRPS provides a choice and plays an assistant and supplemental role in the pension system in China, particularly to village residents and low-income residents1. According to the important role of establishing a social security system for the aged in rural areas on social development and harmony, it is extremely meaningful for us to study influencing factors of endowment insurance participation rate in such an under-developed area.Second, we consider whetherpeer effectsare evident in the propensity to make a participation strategy change in pension contributions. Beyond studying whether there are direct influences of peer effects on the participation decisions, we also consider the roles of peers in contribution amounts, decision to interrupt and to start enrollment, and true intention. Policy makers pay attention not only to whether people choose to participate, but also to whether they will continue staying in the program and not interrupt the premium payment disbursements after the participation, and how they choose the contribution level.Third, this paper assumes that individual form heterogeneous expectations regarding peers’ decisions. For example, an individual may form different expectations regarding the participation probabilities of his or her young and old neighbors. Homogeneous rational expectations may not appropriate if people take peers’ characteristics into account when they form the rational expectations and if these characteristics vary across peers (Binder and Pesaran, 1998;Lee et al., 2014;Yang and Lee, 2017).Building on the binary choice model with social interactions, we find strong evidence for substantial peer effects in program participation. Individuals are 16.15 percentage points more likely to participate in NRPS if the average expected peer participation choice increases by 1 (e.g. moving an individual from a group where none of his or her peers are expected to participate to a group where half of the peers are expected to participate). Characteristics of peers and unobserved factors shared by individuals within the same village, such as local customs or values and local policy advocacy, also have a significant influence on participation decisions. In contrast, there is no evidence of statistically significant peer effects in the participation intention, suggesting that the willingness to participate is not influenced by peers’ willingness.For the change of decisions, we use a linear probability model to measure the effect of peers’ status on an individual's decision to interrupt or to start to enroll. FollowingBisztray et al. (2018), we consider three types of peers: individuals living in the same village, and two placebo peer groups including individuals living in the same city but different villages, and individuals living in the same province but different cities. Results show significant peer effects only in the village network.To further understand the source of peer effects, we explore several possible mechanisms. We find suggestive evidence for the sharing of information about costs, benefits, and risks. We find that smaller effects when residents pay higher attention to economic and financial information or are more willing to take risks. Policy implications drawn from these findings are giving more attention to the education of the consequences of enrollment and reducing uncertainty in the program. This paper also adds to peer effects literature by measuring the income equivalence of the peer effect on pension insurance take-up. We find that one more peer choosing to participate is equivalent to around a 0.57 percent increase in the average household income.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section Two describes the background and major policies of the NRPS program. Section Three discusses the correlation of behavior within groups. Section Four introduces the data and relative variables. Section Five provides the empirical strategy. Section Six presents the estimation results and robustness tests. Section Seven presents extensions and Section Eight gives conclusions and recommendations.",Chuanmin,Xi,None

"1. IntroductionGovernments in many Western countries devote taxpayer funded resources to supporting self-employed entrepreneurs on the grounds that new start-up businesses are critical for the creation of new jobs. Yet most self-employed workers do not hire anyone. Data available from the International Labour Organization (ILO) website (ilostat.ilo.org/data), for example, indicate that, among developed nations, the percentage of self-employed workers who employ others ranged, in 2018, from just 14% in the UK to 44% in Germany, with the multi-country average being around 31% (and with Australia being above average, at around 35%).1Policies that incentivize transitions out of unemployment into self-employment, while obviously reducing unemployment in the short run, may thus have little additional job creation impacts. Indeed, and as noted byCongregado, Golpe and Carmona (2010), such measures, by attracting persons who are not well suited to self-employment, may have employment effects that are only temporary.For entrepreneurship policies to be successful, in the sense of creating firms that generate new jobs, requires targeting those entrepreneurs who are most likely to transition from working alone (i.e., the solo self-employed, often also referred to as own-account workers) to employing others (i.e., employers). Somewhat surprisingly, however, especially given the many studies seeking to unpack the mechanisms that encourage individuals to enter self-employment (for reviews seeParker, 2009;Simoes et al., 2016;van Praag and Versloot, 2007), there has been relatively little research on the factors influencing transitions out of solo self-employment into employer status.2Notable exceptions here are a series of studies involving analysis of data from theEuropean CommunityHousehold Panel (ECHP) by Millán and colleagues (Congregado, Millán and Román, 2010;Millán et al., 2013,2014,2015) – though only one (Millán et al., 2014) provides a direct test of whether solo self-employment has any effect on the probability of becoming an employer in the future – and analyses of household panel data from both the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) (Lechmann and Wunder, 2017) and the UK HouseholdLongitudinal Study(Henley, 2019).Millán et al. (2014)estimate discrete-time models of the hazard of exit out of both solo self-employment and employership within a competing risks framework.Prior experienceis represented by a simple dummy variable indicating whether the respondent reported ever previously working as an own-account worker (i.e., solo self-employed worker), an employer or a paid employee. To the authors’ surprise, prior experience as a solo self-employed worker is not found to influence the probability of transitioning from solo self-employment to employership. At the same time, the estimated probability of switching from solo self-employed to employer is found to be markedly higher than the probability of exiting to other states, which the authors take as a “sign of success” and so conclude that the results are consistent with the notion that there is persistence in entrepreneurship and hence provide support for public investments in new start-ups. We suggest such a conclusion is not warranted. First, it is inconsistent with their finding that previous experience in self-employment is irrelevant, and second, their estimation method does not allow the “true” effect of solo self-employment on employership in the future (true state dependence) to be isolated from the effects of other factors that influence both solo self-employment in the past and employership in the future (spurious state dependence).Henley (2019)too estimates a discrete-time model of the hazard of exiting solo self-employment into employership, but with the sample restricted to those observed in self-employment.3Furthermore, he includes a person-specific random error component as a way of controlling for unobserved heterogeneity. In addition, prior self-employment experience is captured with a cumulative measure of years of experience rather than a dummy. In contrast toMillán et al. (2014), a positive relationship between transition into employer status and elapsed duration in self-employment is found, providing arguably stronger evidence for the hypothesis that prior experiences of self-employment have a causal effect on the probability of employing workers in the future. Nevertheless, the methods applied are still problematic. LikeMillán et al (2014), the data are censored for cases where the self-employed are never observed becoming employers over the (6-year) data period, and the use of random effects imposes the unlikely assumption that the explanatory variables are uncorrelated with the unobserved error component.Far more convincing is the estimation strategy employed byLechmann and Wunder (2017). They employ a very broad sample, which is not just restricted to persons observed entering self-employment, and estimate a dynamic multinomial logit model that controls for both the previously observed employment state and initial conditions as well as unobserved heterogeneity, but this time using correlated random effects. They find that the “genuine effect” of experiencing solo self-employment (relative to wage employment or non-employment) on future employership is both small (about a 5 percentage point increase for men and a little over just 2 percentage points for women) and not long-lasting. As such, these results are discouraging for proponents of subsidies and policy measures designed to encourage individuals to enter self-employment. Of course, this is only one study utilising data from one country, and thus replication both in Germany and in other institutional settings is required before it can be confidently concluded that such measures will typically have little lasting effect on employment.Providing such a replication is the aim of this study. More specifically, we utilise a similar household panel survey data set to that used by bothLechmann and Wunder (2017)andHenley (2019), but from Australia (a country where self-employment rates have tended to be higher than the average across other industrial nations, and certainly much higher than in Germany), and apply the same estimation strategy used by Lechmann and Wunder. We obtain estimates of true cross-state dependence that are strikingly similar in size to those found in the German study.",Michael,Mark,None
"1. IntroductionEuropean Union priorities for 2020 include fostering education andlabor mobilityto stimulate youth employment at home and abroad (European Commission, 2011). Yet, while the link between studying abroad and international labor mobility is widely recognized (González, Mesanza, Mariel, 2011,Oosterbeek, Webbink, 2011,Parey, Waldinger, 2011), the effect of studying in English in a non-English speaking country on graduates' migration decisions is still unexplored. Understanding the labor market outcomes of graduates in English-taught programs is central to analyzing the increasing investments that European universities have made in these degrees over the last decade. Moreover, it is important to determine whether these programs contribute to the European labor mobility goal.From a theoretical perspective, an increase in the supply of English-taught programs might have two opposite effects. On the one hand, it might enhance international work opportunities. On the other hand, a degree taught in English may make graduates more competitive in the national labor market, resulting in better labor outcomes that may reduce the comparative benefits ofinternational migration. While both outcomes are plausible, many potential confounding factors make it difficult to study the effect of English-taught programs on labor mobility. Ideally, one would observe the labor market outcomes of students who were randomly assigned to university programs held in English compared to those assigned to programs taught in their native language. In the absence of such a randomized experiment, establishing a causal link between attaining a degree in English and working abroad aftergraduationis challenging. Students who decide to attend a program taught in English are in many ways different from students who choose a degree in their mother tongue. Specifically, the intention to move abroad may induce students to study in English.I provide causal evidence of the effect of studying in English on labor mobility through a novel instrument for enrollment in master's programs taught in English. Specifically, I exploit the introduction of a master's degree taught in English in a given university at the same time as a student is pursuing a bachelor's degree at the same university.1The instrument takes a value of one for students exposed to the introduction of an MA in English in their university and discipline while they are enrolled in their BA. This avoids that students self-select into programs offering MA in English according to their future migration intentions. Critically, students are unlikely to predict when programs taught in English will be introduced (Card, 1993,Card, 2001,Parey, Waldinger, 2011).Italy is an ideal country to investigate this question, as different Italian universities have been introducing the possibility to study in English since 2008. Moreover, different departments within the same universities began offering degrees in English in different academic years during this time period.2I use a survey of Italian graduates provided by the AlmaLaurea consortium of Italian universities. I merge these data with a complete list of MA programs taught in English launched each year since 2008 in each Italian university and for every discipline, provided by the Italian National Ministry of Education (MIUR). The resulting sample includes more than 240,000 MA graduates from 2010 to 2015.I find that studying in English has a strong causal effect on graduates' labor market mobility. In particular, I find that attaining an MA degree taught in English increases an individual's probability of working abroad one year after graduation by 11.3 percentage points, or almost five times the sample average.I present several robustness checks for this result. First, I estimate the model on groups of cohorts of graduates to test the power of the instrument over different time periods. Second, I remove fields of study one at a time to check whether fields for which there is no MA taught in English inflate standard errors. Third, I also run my regressions by removing regions of study one at a time to assess migration heterogeneity toborderproximity. Finally, to avoid endogeneity issues, the instrument does not consider the fact that students may switch universities and/or fields of study from the BA to the MA. For this reason, I remove different groups of “switchers” from the sample to test the coefficient response. My results are not restricted to particular fields of study, regions, or changes in universities and fields of study from the BA to the MA, and they are highly robust for all these sensitivity analyses.Furthermore, I investigate whether the results are somehow driven by graduates belonging to specific groups of disciplines, universities, or geographical areas. For this reason, I initially divide the sample into graduates in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and those not in STEM fields. Second, I use the Quacquarelli Symonds World University Ranking (QS-Ranking),3and I split the sample into graduates of top-10 universities and those who did not graduate from these universities. Third, I divide the sample into graduates from northern, central, and southern Italy. I find a positive and statistically significant result exclusively for graduates in STEM fields,4for students who did not graduate from a top-10 university, and for students who did graduate in the south.Finally, to provide evidence that the results are externally valid, I implement the test on the conditional independence assumption proposed byBlack et al. (2017)that allows for measuring selection bias. Essentially, the test involves estimating a reduced form model on the sample of treated, comparing the so-calledCompliersandAlways Takers, and on the sample of the untreated to compareCompliersandNever Takers. I find no evidence of a strong selection bias. However, the test provides only noisy evidence of no selection due to the small size of the treatment sample and this also justifies the use of aninstrumental variableapproach. For this reason, it seems more prudent to generalize the local averagetreatment effectonCompliersto only the subpopulation ofNever Takers.1.1. Related literatureThis paper relates to three different strands of the literature: the effectof college educationdecisions on labor mobility, the roleof language knowledgein migration and labor outcomes, and, finally, the effect of studying abroad on labor mobility.Kodrzycki et al. (2001)find strong evidence that US college graduates are more likely to migrate than those without a college degree.Groen (2004)documents that the choice of studying in a particular state positively affects the probability of working in that state once the studies have ended; he solves for selection bias by treating endogeneity as an omitted variable, so he uses the set of colleges students apply to as a way to control for heterogeneous location preferences before students started college.5Moreover,Malamud and Wozniak (2010)study how college completion and attendance in the US affect the probability of a long-distance move from an individual's birthplace. They adopt an instrumental variable approach based onCard and Lemieux (2001), using variation in college attainment induced by draft-avoidance behavior during the Vietnam War. They find that attending college increases the probability that an individual will live out-of-state by 35 percentage points.Adsera and Pytlikova (2015)use a classical gravity model to study migration adding linguistic distances. They find that migration rates increase with linguistic proximity.Aparicio Fenoll and Kuehn (2016)study the effect of introducing foreign language classes into compulsory school on subsequent migration across European countries, finding that it increases the total number of emigrants by 20 percent. Furthermore, knowledge of the host country language has a positive effect on migrants' employment and wage outcomes (Bleakley, Chin, 2004,Chiswick, Miller, 2010,Chiswick, Miller, 2014,Dustmann, Fabbri, 2003).6To the best of my knowledge, this paper is the first to analyze the link between the completion of an MA degree taught in English in a non-English speaking country and international labor mobility, possibly because most surveys do not specify the language degrees are taught in and the fact that in Italy the sharp increase in MA programs taught in English is quite recent.The strand of the literature more closely related to this paper looks at the link between studying abroad and labor mobility.Oosterbeek and Webbink (2011)investigate whether studying abroad increases the probability that an individual will live abroad later in life. Using an instrumental variable approach based on cutoffs in the Dutch ranking for a scholarship program to study abroad, they find that the number of months spent studying abroad strongly and positively affects the likelihood of living abroad. Furthermore, the work ofParey and Waldinger (2011)is particularly relevant to this work. The authors use the introduction of the ERASMUS program as an instrument to estimate the causal effect of studying abroad on labor market mobility. They find an increase of 15 percentage points in the probability of working abroad for German graduates.In the following section I describe the institutional structure of the Italian highereducation system, the evolution of the supply of degrees taught in English, and the data.Section 3explains the identification strategy.Section 4reportsdescriptive statisticsand balance tests.Section 5shows and discusses the results on an individual's probability of working abroad and presents both the sensitivity and the heterogeneity analyses.Section 6describes several tests for selection bias, providing evidence that results are externally valid.Section 7concludes.",Samuel,None,None
"1. IntroductionThe nineteenth and twentieth century in the U.S. saw two nationwide waves of state-level schooling requirements. The first wave generally focused on the educational attainment of children up to age 14, and the second wave focused on high school attendance. The second wave has been the focus of a substantial literature, which has both examined the causal effects of the laws on years of schooling and the returns to these additional years (Lleras-Muney, 2002;Goldin and Katz, 2011;Stephens and Yang, 2014). The first wave has received considerably less attention, even though it laid the foundation for the second wave. Further, individuals subject to first wave laws were prime age workers during 1910-1940, a period of rapid transition in the American economy.Did the implementation and expansion of this first wave of schooling laws increase educational attainment? If so, what were the returns associated with the additional years of schooling? These questions matter not only for historical analysis, but for other developing nations seeking to draw on the historical experience of the United States.1Drawing on the full count 1940 census and a new detailed coding of state compulsory attendance, continuation school, and child labor laws, this paper provides new estimates of the effects of laws on the number of years of schooling and the returns to schooling. As with prior work that exploits variation in state schooling requirements based on state and year of birth (e.g,Angrist and Krueger, 1991;Acemoglu and Angrist, 2000;Lleras-Muney, 2002;Oreopoulos, 2006;Stephens and Yang, 2014), the analysis is limited to native-born individuals. Both for comparability with much of the prior literature and in recognition of the fact that many institutional factors (e.g., Jim Crow laws, lagging school quality for blacks, Rosenwald schools, and differing employment opportunities across gender and racial lines for teenagers, such as cultural norms against work outside of the home for women) must be carefully addressed to accurately assess the impact of schooling and child labor laws on the economic outcomes of blacks and women, the sample is further restricted to white males.2Thus, the analysis focuses on native-born white men from the 1885-1912 birth cohorts who are age 27 to 54 when the 1940 Census was enumerated.The key source of identifying variation in this paper is the number of years of schooling a child is required to attend. This schooling requirement is calculated for an individual from a given state born in a specific year based on the prevailing compulsory schooling, child labor, and continuation schooling laws throughout their schooling years. The information on schooling laws builds on work by previous authors (Lleras-Muney, 2002andGoldin and Katz, 2011) by extending the coding of laws back to earlier time periods (pre-1910). For the post-1910 period, the coding of the laws builds on the work ofStephens and Yang (2014)by revisiting original session laws and reconciling differences between these sources and the coding of the schooling and child labor laws found in prior studies.The 2SLS estimates of the returns to schooling found here range from 0.067 to 0.077. Excluding Southern born men for whom the trend in schooling laws and educational attainment was growing most rapidly (Stephens and Yang, 2014), the IV estimate is only slightly smaller, at 0.064. Unlike the prior literature, this paper also presents quantile IV estimates to examine the impact of additional schooling across the earnings distribution. The results show that the returns to schooling are largest for the lower quantiles with estimates of 0.14 and 0.11 at the 25thand 50thquantiles, respectively. However, the estimated returns generally decrease monotonically for higher quantiles, e.g., falling to -0.00 for the 75thquantile.The paper contributes to multiple literatures. The first is the literature on the returns to schooling. A number of papers includingAngrist and Krueger (1991);Oreopoulos and Salvanes (2011);Stephens and Yang (2014)have primarily used second wave schooling laws to estimate returns to schooling. For example,Oreopoulos and Salvanes (2011)estimate effects for the 1899-1982 cohorts andStephens and Yang (2014)estimate effects for the 1905-1954 cohorts. This paper provides new estimates for the 1885-1912 cohorts which were primarily affected by the first wave of schooling laws.The second is the literature on the effects of schooling laws on years of schooling. This paper is closest toLleras-Muney (2002);Goldin and Katz (2011), andLleras-Muney and Shertzer (2015)although it is distinct from these papers in important ways: i) a focus on earlier birth cohorts, ii) use of the full count 1940 census instead of the much smaller IPUMS samples; iii) use of a new detailed coding of state compulsory attendance, continuation school, and child labor laws which builds on and extends prior datasets; and iv) use of a more flexible specification for estimating the effects of the laws. Even with these differences, this paper finds small but significant effects of schooling laws on years of schooling as have been found in the prior literature.The paper is set out as follows. The next section provides background on the development of compulsory attendance, continuation schooling, and child labor laws in the United States. The following two sections discuss the data and the empirical methodology, respectively. The paper then turns to the empirical findings before concluding.",Karen,Jeff,Melvin
"1. IntroductionFor the first time in U.S. history, the federal Census in 1920 reported more than 50% of residents living in urban areas, marking a turning point in a long movement off farms and towards cities, with the accompanying transition to urban occupations andindustries.Fig. 1illustrates a massive labor reallocation over the period 1910–1940, from agricultural occupations toward ones more concentrated in sectors such as manufacturing, retail, and wholesale trade. This structural transformation was achieved relatively late in the U.S., due to its status as a young, land-rich nation. The backdrop was an equally dramatic transformation of infrastructure, involving the move from steam to electric power in cities and from horse to electric power on farms. While this kind of structural transformation is one of the most salient featuresof economic development(Herrendorf et al., 2014)—identified as one of Kuznets’ stylized facts of development (Kuznets, 1966)—there is still considerable debate about its underlying causes. This paper focuses on the specific role played by electrification in this transition from an agriculture intensive to a manufacturing intensive economy.1As electricity is a general-purpose technology that drove the second industrial revolution in the developed world (Gordon, 2017) and still plays a crucial role for economic development today (Fried and Lagakos, 2017), this question is not only of interest to economic historians but is also of first order importance for development economists and policymakers. For example, many developing countries are currently witnessing unprecedented investment in electrification as a vehicle for development, in the hope that it will stimulate structural transformation, pushing more workers into modern, higher valued-added sectors. In fact, the World Bank argues that “infrastructure has a central role in the development agenda and is a major contributor to growth” (World Bank, 2005) and it has helped 45 million people to gain access to electricity from 2014 to 2018 and spent over $5 billion on energy programs.2Ethiopia is a leading example of a developing nation recently investing heavily in electricity, as its production has increased seven-fold in the 16 years since 2000 (Fried and Lagakos, 2017, 1). Despite these massive investments in electrification, there is still considerable debate on what exactly these economies should expect in response.Download :Download high-res image (416KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. Approximate contribution of electrification to structural transformation, 1910–1940.Notes:The figure depicts overall changes in the occupational structure over the period 1910–1940 as displayed inFig. 3and contrasts them with the structural changes due to electrification as implied by our IV estimates (Tables C.22andC.30) scaled by the average increase in transmission lines within a county (Fig. 4). Panel A focuses on occupations while panel B reports results for industries. Bars are sorted from top to bottom by employment share in 1910 and the underlying population are working age men (16–65) with a reported occupation. We only report implied IV estimates for statistically significant coefficients (at least 10% significance level). The underlying data on the occupational and industrial structure are the full count U.S. Censuses. The impact of electrification is estimated using historical maps of the U.S. electricity grid and hydroelectric potential as an instrument. Details are provided inSections 3and4.We contribute to this debate by exploring the causal effect of electrification on U.S. structural change from 1910 to 1940. Looking at this historical episode allows us to analyze the long run impacts of electrification over three decades, which is generally not possible in the modern development literature but is important given the lengthy time general-purpose technologies need to unfold their full potential through complementary innovations.3The primary challenge in estimating the impact of electrification is that adoption was endogenous to existing levels of development, skill and industrial composition. We address this concern by appealing to two related observations: first, while coal-powered electricity was widely available in urban areas by 1910,hydroelectric powerwas limited. The primary benefit of hydroelectric power generation is its low variable cost, while the main downsides are sizable fixed costs (e.g., building a dam in a remote location) and the remoteness of the most suitable sites for power generation. We argue that the latter was the main reason for thedominanceof coal before 1920.4Second, the high-voltage power grid was nonexistent in 1910, and greatly expanded after 1920 (seeFigs. 2and4), due to technological innovations in power transmission.5Since coal could be transported to any given location, this new technology was not particularly useful for coal generated power. In stark contrast, this technology allowed hydroelectric power to be transported to end users from remote locations, making massive construction projects such as the Hoover Dam viable. The low variable cost of hydroelectric power combined with high-voltage transmission lines imply that the expansion of the grid led to a significant reduction in the price of electricity in serviced locations and increased adoption in such areas.Download :Download high-res image (4MB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 2. Hydroelectric potential & high-voltage transmission lines in 1940.Notes:Panel A shows total kilometers of high-voltage transmission lines within the county in 1940. Panel B shows total hydroelectric potential in Mega Watts within a 50 mile radius of the county centroid.Our strategy to estimate the causal impact of electrification exploits the geographic variation in this price shock. While the eventual path of the distribution lines that connected individual places to the grid was almost certainly driven primarily by electricity demand, we argue that places close to highly suitable locations for hydroelectric power generation were effectively exogenously “treated” with high-voltage power lines. To implement this idea, we use geographic variation in “hydroelectric potential”—a measure governed by fixed, exogenous topographic characteristics of a place, inversely related to the cost of building and operating ahydroelectric power stationin any given location—to instrument for the observed geographic expansion of the high-voltage power grid. We find that this variation provides a strong and relevant instrument.Other studies have used similar instruments. For example,Dinkelman (2011)used land gradient—a fixed topographic feature that is inversely related to the cost of building transmission lines—as an instrument for the South African electric grid to analyze the effect of grid expansion to more remote areas.Lipscomb et al. (2013)simulate a hypothetical electricity grid expansion for the period 1960–2000 in Brazil, to capture how the grid would have evolved had infrastructure investments been based solely on geography-based cost considerations. They use this as an instrument for the actual grid and analyze the impact on growth through various channels including agricultural productivity.Lewis and Severnini (2020)use the distance to new power plants for counties in the U.S., from 1930 to 1960, to identify exogenous variation in electricity cost, which works because rural customers were too small a fraction of the overall customer base to determine plant location. In our study, more rural counties are most affected by our instrument, and farm service made up only 2.6% of nationwide electricity customers in 1932, implying that these counties are very unlikely to have driven transmission line or power plant placement (Kitchens and Fishback, 2015, 1163).Using this empirical strategy, we investigate the impact of 1910–1940 electrification on the occupational and industrial structure of male county employment in 1940, given initial 1910 conditions.6We find that 100 extra kilometers of high-voltage power lines significantly decreased the share of farmers among American men, and significantly increased the share of operatives, a mid-level blue-collar job, usually associated with manufacturing work. In parallel, electrification significantly decreased the share of farming in male employment and increased the share of manufacturing. Given that most of the structural change occurred within regions rather than through migration across regions (Eckert and Peters, 2018), we can use our county-level estimates to project the aggregate effect of electrification on the occupational and industrial structure.7The size of our estimates suggests that electrification can account for approximately 54% of the aggregate increase in the share of operatives, and 26% of the aggregate decline in the share of farmers between 1910 and 1940, while at the same time accounting for 24% of the aggregate decline in agriculture and 36% of the aggregate increase in manufacturing.Fig. 1illustrates these results for estimates significant at least at the 10% confidence level, suggesting that electrification was a key driver of structural transformation in the U.S.Our analysis makes three key contributions to the literature. First, we construct a credible instrument for the expansion of the high-voltage power grid, based on hydroelectric potential. Second, we study the impact of electrification on the entire continental U.S., examining its effects on the structure of employment. To do so, we digitized historical maps from the U.S.ArmyCorps of Engineers to document the expansion of the high-voltage electricity grid, providing a more accurate picture of electrification than previously available. Earlier studies analyze either themanufacturing sector, using the Census of Manufacturers (Gray, 2013), or theagricultural sector(Census of Agriculture) in isolation (Kitchens and Fishback, 2015), and some focus on programs that were only applicable in a few states (Kline and Moretti, 2013). Ours is the first to use detailed exogenous variation in electricity adoption to study potential labor reallocationbetween, rather thanwithinsectors. Furthermore, because we use full count Census data, we are able to go beyond agriculture and manufacturing and analyze the impact of electrification on the full occupational and industrial structure. We thus complement the work byKatz and Margo (2014), which identified, in a descriptive manner, the degree of skill bias in the aggregate economy over the longer run from the mid-nineteenth century to 2010.Third, the extant literature on structural transformation offers a variety of theoretical explanations for its ultimate causes.Gollin et al. (2013)provide a summary, from theories that focus on the increased productivity of manufacturing and services, which creates a “pull” force for labor to exit agriculture, and the “push” theories which investigate the price and income effects influencing the move away from the primary sector.8One class of models draws on dominant income effects (through non-homothetic preferences) while another class of models draws on a production structure in which general-purpose technology shocks—through a reduction in the relative price—have differential effects in different sectors (Herrendorf et al., 2014). Our analysis provides evidence that the invention of high-voltage electrical power transmission—a general-purpose technology—directly caused structural transformation of rural America during the period 1910–1940, consistent with the theory of technology-driven structural transformation.InSection 2, we discuss the role electricity could play in the structure of employment. InSection 3, we describe the data andeconometricapproach.Section 4presents the results.Section 5concludes.",Paul,Rowena,Ioana
"1. IntroductionIn the canonical search and matching model (Mortensen and Pissarides, 1994), firms exclusively rely on the number of posted vacancies to adjust the number of hires. Through the aggregate matching function, the search and matching model contains a tight link between the number of posted vacancies and the number of hires.Davis et al. (2013, p. 590) argue that standard theory misses important other channels: In addition to the vacancy margin, firms may also vary their recruiting intensity, i.e. “(...) employers rely on a mix of recruiting and hiring practices that differ in propensity to involve a measured vacancy and in vacancy duration.” In a similar vein, based on a structural model,Gavazza et al. (2018)show that firms’ recruiting intensity is strongly procyclical over the business cycle. Both articles document that recruiting intensity is very important for explaining cross-sectional and time-series patterns in the United States (e.g., the collapse of hiring during the Great Recession).WhileDavis et al. (2013)andGavazza et al. (2018)quantify the role of recruiting intensity for job-filling rates from the residual of a generalized matching function, there is no direct evidence for the behavior of different hiring margins in the United States. The behavior of vacancy yields over the employment distribution and over time are known.1By contrast, the exact drivers for these vacancy yields remain a black box. What are the instruments —other than vacancies— that firms use? How strongly do firms vary these instruments in the cross section (e.g., along the employment growth distribution) and over time (i.e., along the business cycle)? Answers to these questions are important for economic modelers, both to get the micro-foundations and the transmission mechanisms right. These are crucial prerequisites for meaningful counterfactual policy exercises and welfare statements.Our paper starts by presenting a simple multi-worker firm optimization problem where firms can use three hiring margins. Although we do not solve for the full heterogeneous agent equilibrium, firms’ optimality conditions are a useful tool for measuring different recruiting channels in the data and for hypothesizing how firms should respond to different shocks. In our model, firms post vacancies in order to attract applicants and they choose an effort level at which they want to advertise these vacancies. FollowingGavazza et al. (2018), we assume that both vacancies and effort are subject to a convex cost function. In addition, firms choose the fraction of applicants they want to hire. FollowingChugh and Merkl (2016), applicants draw from an idiosyncratic training cost distribution.2Firms choose an endogenous training cost cutoff and thereby endogenously determine their selectivity. We derive three hypotheses from our model. First, firms that are hit by a positive firm-specific productivity shock post more vacancies, increase their search effort, and are less selective. Second, as we assume a decreasing returns to labor production function, firms that (unexpectedly) lose a fraction of workers face an increase of their marginal product and thereby increase their hiring activity in all three dimensions. Third, we expect all three hiring margins to be procyclical over the business cycle. In a boom, firms’ profits and their incentive to hire more workers increase. Thereby, they use all three margins more intensively. These three hypotheses guide our data analysis.Given the lack of suitable survey data for the United States,3our paper uses the German IAB-Stellenerhebung (IAB Job Vacancy Survey, JVS henceforth) to look into the black box of recruiting intensity and hiring practices. The JVS is a representative annual cross-sectional survey of up to 14,000 establishments4(Moczall et al., 2015). These establishments are asked about the number of hires, separations, and vacancies in a particular year. In addition, they provide detailed information on their most recent hire (such as the used search channels or the number of suitable applicants). From the JVS, we construct empirical indicators for establishments’ recruiting intensity and for their selectivity. For recruiting intensity, we use a normalized measure for the number of search channels that establishments used for their most recent hire. For selectivity, we utilize information on the number of suitable applicants for an establishment’s most recent hire. An establishment that hires a large fraction of suitable applicants is considered to be less selective than an establishment that hires a small fraction of suitable applicants. As inHochmuth et al. (2019), we thus use the inverse of the number of suitable applicants for the most recent hire.Furthermore, we are the first to complement the data from the JVS with administrative information from the Administrative Wage and Labor Market Flow Panel (AWFP) which contains job flows, worker flows, and wage information for the universe of establishments in Germany (Stüber and Seth, 2018).Carrillo-Tudela et al. (2020)recently linked the JVS with the Integrated Employment Biographies of the IAB at the establishment level. Using the variation across local labor markets, they analyze vacancy yields, recruiting intensity, and matching efficiency. Among other things, they show that the recruiting intensity matters for matching efficiency. Later, we argue that their paper is complementary to ours in various dimensions.Our paper documents the following three important facts: First, we show that the number of search channels is upward sloping in the positive part of the employment growth distribution. By contrast, it is relatively flat in the negative part of the employment growth distribution. These cross-sectional facts for search channels can be explained by establishment-specific productivity shocks. Larger positive productivity shock stimulate establishments’ employment growth and thereby give an incentive to establishments to increase their recruiting intensity.Second, both the vacancy rate and the selection rate show a U-shape over the employment growth distribution. Through the lens of our model, the upward sloping path in the positive part of the employment growth distribution can again be explained by positive firm-specific productivity shocks. But why do (faster) shrinking firms post more vacancies and are less selective than firms with a constant workforce?Bachmann et al. (2020)show that faster shrinking establishments are subject to more worker churn than establishments with a constant workforce. Intuitively, establishments in the negative part of the employment growth distribution lose more workers than expected and thereby have to hire new workers to adjust to their desired size. In different words, they lose workers and hire workers within the same period (within a given skill group and more so, the more they shrink). Therefore, our paper establishes a link between worker churn and hiring margins. We show that faster shrinking establishments post on average more vacancies and select a larger fraction of workers than establishments with a constant workforce in order to accomplish their necessary replacement hirings.5AsBachmann et al. (2020)show a strong comovement between churn and employment-to-employment transitions, we link the three hiring margins to employment-to-employment transitions, showing a positive connection. From a theoretical perspective this can be rationalized by firms with a decreasing returns to labor production function that increase their marginal product when they lose workers (on an involuntary basis).Third, in line with our theoretical predictions, the vacancy rate, the selection rate, and the number of search channels all move procyclically over the business cycle. In a slack labor market establishments post fewer vacancies, use fewer search channels, and are less selective than in a tight labor market. The development of the used number of search channels over time is in line with procyclical recruiting intensity, as argued byDavis et al. (2013)andGavazza et al. (2018).",Benjamin,Christian,Heiko
"1. IntroductionWith the parallel rise in part-time jobs, temporary contracts, and agency work, there is considerable interest in understanding how such atypical work arrangements affect the careers of workers seeking regular, full-time work. After ample research, the question remains open, partly because of varying methodologies, contexts and data quality. This paper innovates by estimating the causal impact of atypical work on the transition to regular, full-time work using a novel French administrative dataset describing in detail the timing of workers’ employment and unemployment history. We are able to restrict our analysis to individuals who explicitly declare seeking a permanent position, to focus on specific subgroups and to disentangle between lock-in effects, stepping-stone effects and wage growth effects. We define atypical work as a less desirable and hopefully temporary work situation such as part-time or temporary work with fewer monthly hours than full-time work. We use the exact timing and duration of labor contracts to identify when an individual returns to full-time, durable work.For job seekers lacking the right skill set or experience, atypical work may help develop expertise, meet potential new employers, and eventually succeed in having a temporary position converted into a permanent contract. Agency work can also play a similar role (seeNeugart and Storrie (2006)andHouseman et al. (2003)), as well as subsidized jobs (seeGerfin et al. (2005)). This is often referred to as the “stepping stone” effect of atypical work. However, atypical work may reduce the time available or the incentive to search for a more desirable job, the so-called “lock-in” effect. In many countries, the possibility of combining atypical work with partial unemployment benefits also raises the same moral hazard concerns as regular unemployment benefits do (seeMcCall (1996)andEk and Holmlund (2011), for instance). Over time, these effects could trap workers in a string of atypical jobs and repeated unemployment spells and worsen labor market dualism.All of these channels can exist simultaneously, but it is unlikely that they would impact all workers uniformly. Workers with lower job prospects are probably the ones most likely to benefit from stepping stones while for more skilled or experienced workers, atypical work could provide little benefits, or even prove detrimental. Little attention has been paid to this potential heterogeneity in previous works, a neglect which could lead to poorly targeted labor policies.A final source of ambiguity is the variety of reservation wages which directly affects the length of unemployment spells. To shed light on the potential trade-off between speed and wage gain and capture the total utility gain from doing atypical work, we jointly model the impact of atypical work on the log hourly wage gain from one regular job to the next.Our empirical approach is based on the well-known timing-of-events (TOE) approach (Abbring and Van Den Berg, 2003) which captures the causal impact of atypical work by exploiting the randomness in the arrival of job offers. We were able to obtain privileged access to an administrative dataset of 1/25thof the French population covering a 7-year period. This data contains detailed information on the duration and motives for which workers registered atPôle emploi, the French employment agency, administrative records used to compute unemployment benefits, and detailed information on all their employers, including their working hours, annual earnings, and firm-specific identifiers. This allowed us to define unemployment spells with great precision and identify when workers returned to stable full-time work without suffering from the censoring bias often encountered in the empirical literature.We find a surprisingly strong stepping stone effect, and no evidence of lock-in effects. Having done atypical work previously in an unemployment spell raises the monthly probability of finding regular work by 87% on average. We find larger effects for long-term unemployed workers, older workers, and those who work fewer hours in the year prior to the start of the spell. We find no effect of atypical work on subsequent hourly wages, suggesting that the benefits to workers may accrue entirely from reduced unemployed time.The rest of the paper is organized as follows.Section 2presents the empirical model and its assumptions and is followed bySection 3which discusses several studies that have used similar approaches.Section 4, presents the data and details the construction of our variables of interest.Section 5presents the results andSection 6concludes.",Stéphane,Nicolas,None
"1. Introduction and backgroundTechnological progress has often been a source of concerns about potentially negative effects on employment. On the one hand, these concerns refer to the general level of employment, which are commonly discussed under the label of ‘technological unemployment’ (the term is often attributed toKeynes (1932), though it is much older). On the other hand, certain groups of workers appear to be at a larger risk of job loss than others. As modern computer-controlled technology is particularly suited to executing algorithms, i.e. repeatedly following a fixed set of rules, it is potentially able to substitute workers whose jobs primarily consist of performing routine tasks (Autor, et al. (2003),Spitz‐Oener (2006)). ‘Routine-replacing technological change’ has since been established as a well-documented stylized fact (Autor and Salomons (2018);Biagi, et al. (2018)). From an aggregate perspective, this form of technological progress is often associated with a polarisation of the labour market since routine-intensive occupations are mostly located in the middle of the wage distribution in many countries (e.g.Autor and Dorn (2013);Goos, et al. (2014);Fonseca, et al. (2018)).Recent papers have focused on outcomes at the individual level, thereby addressing the question how technological progress has affected the biographies of routine workers, who represent an especiallyvulnerable groupwithin the labour market. We extend this research agenda by examining whether the declining demand for routine work hampers their recovery from negative shocks. Specifically, we focus on the population of workers displaced during mass layoffs and compare the costs of job loss across workers with different degrees of routine intensity. The main hypothesis of this paper is that workers in more routine-intensive occupations face greater difficulties to recover from losing their jobs during a mass layoff because technological change erodes their employment perspectives outside of their original occupation. Our empirical analysis provides support for this hypothesis. While we find that experiencing a mass layoff leads to a persistent reduction in earnings for all workers, this decrease is larger among routine-intensive workers. Moreover, we can show that the additional earnings losses associated with a larger degree of routine intensity are channelled through extended periods of non-employment rather than through reductions in wages.A large and growing literature in the wake of the seminal paper byJacobson, et al. (1993)examines the earnings losses of workers who are displaced during a mass layoff. Those losses vary substantially with thelabour demanddisplaced workers face outside of their original workplaces.Davis and von Wachter (2011)andSchmieder, et al. (2020)find that earnings losses are larger during recessions, whileDauth, et al. (2020)show that they are larger for workers inindustriesthat decline because of import competition from low-wage countries. Our hypothesis is that routine-replacing technological change, used by profit-oriented firms, creates a similar heterogeneity for laid-off workers depending on the routine intensity of their previous jobs. We analyse if the magnitude of this loss is systematically related to the routine intensity of the occupation performed before the layoff.One concern is that workers may have selected into occupations for reasons that are potentially correlated with subsequent labour market outcomes. If routine-intensive jobs require fewer formal skills and offer smaller wages than non-routine jobs, workers with lower (observed and unobserved) skills select into those jobs. It is therefore not clear how much of the difference in labour market outcomes between routine and non-routine workers can actually be attributed to routine-replacing technological change and how much to selection on observable or unobservable skills.To address those concerns, we modify anevent studydesign in the spirit ofJacobson, LaLonde and Sullivan (1993)andDavis and von Wachter (2011)to analyse if the routine intensity of a worker's previous job affects the chances to subsequently return to the previous earnings level.Fig. 1provides a preview of the idea underlying our empirical approach. We estimate the effect that a mass layoff has on a worker's earnings that are measured as a fraction of the worker's average earnings between the 12thand the 8thquarter before the mass layoff. This allows for an interpretation in relative terms but, unlike taking logs, is also defined for quarters with zero-earnings. To assess how the impact of the mass layoff differs with the degree of routine intensity, we estimate this effect separately for workers in the top and in the bottom quartile of the routine intensity distribution. It can be seen that both groups of workers experience earnings losses as a result of the mass layoff but that this effect is more pronounced among more routine-intensive workers. The initial impact of a mass layoff is a reduction in earnings of approximately 25% for workers in the bottom quartile of the routine intensity distribution compared to a 45% reduction for workers in the top quartile. In the longer run, the effect of the mass layoff diminishes but remains persistently negative. The effect of the mass layoff is larger for the high routine intensity group throughout the period of observation. However, while the difference between the two groups is especially large directly after the layoff, it reduces to approximately 5.5 percentage points after ten quarters and remains at that level. A remarkable finding ofFig. 1is that the earnings profiles prior to displacement are moving in parallel for workers in both groups, despite the arguably different nature of their occupations.Download :Download high-res image (304KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. The impact of mass layoffs on earnings by routine intensity (βk).Notes:The figure shows the effects of displacement in a mass layoff over the 24 quarters after the event. The dependent variable is quarterly earnings as a percentage of the worker's average earnings twelve to eight quarters before the event. The dots are estimates of quarters-to-event dummies interacted with a displacement indicator from a regression including individual and year-by-quarterfixed effects. The omitted reference category is eight quarters prior to displacement. The sample consists of workers displaced in a mass layoff between 1980 and 2010 and a matched control group. Vertical bars indicate the estimated 95% confidence interval based on standard errors that are clustered at the level of 83 occupations. ‘Low (High) routine intensity’ refers to 41,953 (42,246) displaced individuals who were employed in occupations in the bottom (top) quartile of the distribution of routine intensity and 98,319 (37,113) workers in the matched control groups. Sources: IEB, BIBB-IAB employee survey.In the empirical analysis, we do not restrict ourselves to a comparison of workers with a high and a low degree of routine intensity. Instead we estimate the baseline effect of a mass layoff on different outcomes for a worker with a median degree of routine intensity. In addition, we use the variation in the routine intensity variable to assess how this effect varies with the degree of routine intensity. This allows us to estimate a differential effect, i.e. the amount by which the effect of the mass layoff differs for workers who used to be employed in a marginally more routine-intensive occupation. Furthermore, we restrict the identifying variation in the routine intensity variable to come from occupations that belong to the sameoccupational group. Finally, we employ a matching procedure involving exact matching on key variables in order to avoid that the identified effects reflect differences in trends between workers in more and less routine-intensive occupations.Our paper is most closely related to other studies that assess the consequences of technical progress for individual workers.Cortes (2016)shows that there is selective mobility out of declining routine occupations with regard to skills: High-skilled routine workers move to non-routine cognitive jobs and low-skilled routine workers move to non-routine manual jobs.Cortes, et al. (2017)develop a model similar to the one byAutor and Dorn (2013), where workers decide between employment and non-employment and between routine and manual work. With higher levels of automation, the demand for routine workers decreases and so does their wage. In the end, workers switch to manual jobs or drop out of employment.Bachmann, et al. (2019)study the adjustment of German workers to routine‐biased technological change and find that workers in more routine-intensive jobs are more likely to lose their jobs. We add to this literature by examining in detail the recovery of workers with different degrees of routine intensity after a shock in their employment biographies. Our event-study regressions reveal that routine intensity is associated with larger adjustment costs.A related literature studies the cost ofoccupational mobility. While changing jobs is generally assumed to entail the loss of specific human capital,Gathmann and Schönberg (2010)argue that human capital is in fact task-specific. This implies that job mobility to an occupation that requires a similar set of tasks does not necessarily lead to wage losses. This is corroborated by recent findings byRobinson (2018), who shows that displaced workers are particularly at risk of losing this specific human capital because they are often forced to switch to occupations that either use different skills compared to the previous occupation or the same skills but at a lower intensity. In the context of our paper, this means that workers in routine-intensive occupations face a twofold problem: They are exogenously forced to find a new job while their old occupation is eroding due to routine-replacing technological change. We therefore expect the costs of displacement to increase with an occupation's routine intensity.Cortes and Gallipoli (2018)show that task-specific costs that arise, for example, when switching out of routine-intensive jobs, account for around 15% of the totalswitching costs. This is also in line with the recent work byEdin, et al. (2019), who find that workers in declining occupations face severe income and employment losses, which they explain by an increased need for retraining as well as increased probability of unemployment. The magnitude of these effects does not appear to depend on the specific cause of the occupational decline. We, by contrast, focus on technological change as, arguably, the most important systematic driver of occupational decline.While we emphasise the role of technological progress as the driving force behind the developments described in this paper, we acknowledge that other factors may also be relevant in explaining the fact that the costs of job loss are larger among routine-intensive workers.Autor, et al. (2015)assess the relative importance of technological progress andinternational tradeand find that those sectors that are most affected by imports also employ a relatively high share of routine labour. Moreover, if routine tasks can also be performed abroad, firms may have an incentive to off-shore parts of their employment (Hummels, et al. (2018),Oldenski (2014)).We find that workers displaced from more routine-intensive occupations experience higher earnings losses both in the short run and persistently. This may stem from two different frictions to adjustment: First, they might take longer to find a new job in the first place and second, they might not find a job that is as well paid as their previous job. Our results imply that the former is the major problem in the differential consequences of job loss. The higher the initial occupation's routine intensity, the longer it takes displaced workers to find a new job. Moreover, the likelihood that this new job is in a different occupation than the previous one increases with the initial degree of routine intensity. This is in line with the hypothesis that firms use technological change to reduce demand for routine work and that the human capital routine workers have acquired on-the-job has depreciated. Our results complement other papers, which assume that workers can move easily into non-routine occupations. Like those papers, we also look at the wage reaction associated with the external shock. While displacement leads to a wage decline in general, we do not find that this effect varies by routine intensity. We also find that the heterogeneity of displacement costs with respect to routine intensity increased over time, which is consistent with the hypothesis that ongoing technical change has increasingly eroded the perspectives of routine-intensive workers.The structure of the remainder of the paper is as follows. InSection 2, we discuss our measure of occupational routine intensity. In this section, we also introduce the dataset, explain how we identify workers who experienced mass layoff, and compare the characteristics of these workers with a control group of workers who did not experience a mass layoff. The empirical model and the identification of the additional costs associated with differences in routine intensity are the topics ofSection 3. The results of our analysis are presented inSection 4. After showing the estimated average impact of mass layoffs on earnings, we discuss how these effects differ depending on the initial degree of routine intensity and decompose these effects to identify the underlying mechanisms. We then look at differences across variouspopulation groupsand also assess the transitions into different forms of employment after the mass layoff.Section 5concludes.",Uwe,Wolfgang,Duncan
"1. IntroductionPost World War II, many European countries implemented comprehensive school reforms to increase the number of years of compulsory education, introduce national curricula, and/or abolish or delay tracking. Previous studies have found that comprehensive school reforms increase educational attainment and earnings, on average, as well asintergenerational mobility(Aakvik, Salvanes, Vaage, 2010,Meghir, Palme, 2005,Pekkarinen, Uusitalo, Kerr, 2009). Little is known about how these reforms affect labor market outcomes over the lifecycle.The main contribution of this paper is to provide one of the first estimates—to the best of my knowledge—of the effects of a comprehensive school reform on lifecycle employment and earnings patterns by studying the Finnish comprehensive school reform of 1972–1977.1The reform increased the age at which students are separated into general and vocational tracks from 11 to 16. The reform also updated the curriculum to include more general content instead of vocational, keeping the number of years of compulsory schooling constant. An attractive feature of the reform is that it was gradually implemented across municipalities. The implementation scheme gave rise to a natural experiment utilized in this paper to compare outcomes across birth cohorts and municipalities using a difference-in-differences approach. The implementation scheme, together with extensive administrative register data on the labor market and educational outcomes, means that the causal effects of the reform may be studied through a nearly 30-year period.Although studies on the reform have been conducted earlier, its effects on labor market outcomes over the lifecycle remain unknown. Previous studies show that the reform did have an impact on several outcomes. First, the reform increased women’s probability of enrolling in academic secondary and tertiary education and decreased the gender wage gap (Pekkarinen, 2008). Second, the reform decreased the intergenerational income elasticity by 23% (Pekkarinen et al., 2009). It also had a slight positive impact on verbal test scores measured by the FinnishArmyBasic Skills Test. Among students whose parents had less than a high school education, arithmetic and logical reasoning test scores along with verbal test scores saw an increase as a result of the reform (Pekkala Kerr et al., 2013).The reform effectively reduced the weight ofvocational educationin the Finnish school system by increasing the age of tracking into vocational and academic tracks and reducing the amount of vocational education in the curriculum of compulsory schooling. Thus, the present paper’s hypothesis of the effects of the reform across the lifecycle is based on the literature on the labor market effects of vocational and general education. First, it has been argued that vocational education offers youths an easier transition from school to work and, thus, may be an effective policy in combating youth unemployment (Ryan, 2001,Wolter, Ryan, 2011,Zimmermann, Biavaschi, Eichhorst, Giulietti, Kendzia, Muravyev, Pieters, Rodríguez-Planas, Schmidl, et al., 2013). However, due to technological advancements and structural changes in labor markets, the skills provided by vocational education may become obsolete faster than those provided by general education. Due to this skill depreciation, vocational education may lead to relatively high unemployment rates in later career stages.Krueger and Kumar (2004)claim that the slower adaptation of technology caused by skill-specific education may even help explain the difference in the growth rates of Europe and the US.The existing empirical literature on the labor market effects of vocational and general education mostly supports a trade-off between early and late labor market advantages. The most notable study in this literature isHanushek et al. (2017). Using microdata from the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS), it was found that vocational education indeed leads to better school-to-work transition, but it also becomes a disadvantage in terms of employment as early as the age of 50. Further, they found that the magnitude of the effect depends on the intensity of the treatment i.e., the degree of vocationalization of the country’seducation system. For example, in Germany, where vocational education is strongly based onapprenticeshipprograms, the trade-off between early and late labor market advantages is starker than in countries such as Finland, which have school-based vocational programs.Hampf and Woessmann (2017)andForster et al. (2016)identified similar effects asHanushek et al. (2017)using the more recent and richer PIAAC survey.Cörvers et al. (2011)estimated age-earnings patterns consistent with a trade-off between early and late labor market advantages for Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. In addition, there are also recent country-specific studies with similar results, such asBrunello and Rocco (2017)for Great Britain,Weber (2014)for Switzerland, andGolsteyn and Stenberg (2017)andStenberg and Westerlund (2015)for Sweden. A contrasting result from Sweden is byHall (2016), who found no significant effect on risk of unemployment from apilotscheme of a reform from 1988 to 1993, which lengthened upper secondary vocational education by an additional year of general education.Silliman and Virtanen (2019)exploited aregression discontinuity designcreated by a centralized admission system in Finland to show that upper secondary vocational education increases annual income by 7 percent. They found no evidence of the effects diminishing with time. However, their data allows the individuals to be followed only until the age of 31, making it impossible to estimate the effects in late career stages.The present paper also makes a secondary contribution to this literature by examining the causal effects of reducing the vocationalization of a school system over the lifecycle. Many previous papers comparing the lifecycle effects of vocational and general education either don’t establish causality or base it on rather strong assumptions. For example, as a result of using cross-sectional data, the identification of causal effects inHanushek et al. (2017)was based on the assumption that the selection of the type of education does not vary over time. Another possible source of bias in their model was that the test scores from IALS used as control variables could have very well been affected by the person’s education before taking the test (treatment), resulting in a “bad control” situation (seeAngrist and Pischke, 2009).The results of this paper support the hypothesis of a trade-off between employment early and late in the lifecycle. The results show that the reform harmed employment in the early career but that this gap reduced with age and finally turned into a positive effect from the mid-30s onward. Results for labor earnings are more imprecise and sensitive to different model specifications but a positive effect was found from late 30s onward. Changes in educational outcomes are a likely mediator of the effects of the reform. An analysis of the reform’s effect on completed degrees at age 30 showed that the reform increases educational attainment and the probability of choosing the academic track instead of the vocational track. Further, the results related to the labor market and educational outcomes are similar for men and women.",Jani-Petteri,None,None
"1. IntroductionUnderstanding the influence of school composition on individual outcomes is crucial for the evaluation of manyeducation policies, such as school choice, subsidies, tracking, and policies to assimilate immigrant students. Recent evidence suggests that inclusion of disadvantaged children in classrooms has negative effects on other learners (e.g.,Aizer, 2008;Carrell and Hoekstra, 2010;Cho, 2012;Diette and Oyelere, 2014;Figlio, 2007;Hill, 2014;Horoi and Ost, 2015;Kristoffersen et al., 2015;Lavy et al., 2012a,2012b;Neidell and Waldfogel, 2010).1Specifically,these studies focus on the effects of students with high potential for being disruptive, on the outcomes of their classmates, for example, students withattention deficit disorder(Aizer, 2008), immigrant students (Gould et al., 2009), student exposed to domestic violence (Carrell et al., 2018;Carrell and Hoekstra, 2010), repeaters (Huang and Zhu, 2020;Lavy et al., 2012a;Xu et al., 2020), students in the bottom 5% of the ability distribution (Lavy et al., 2012b), course repeaters (Hill, 2014), children with a psychiatric diagnosis or divorced or criminal parents (Kristoffersen et al., 2015), delinquent students (Ahn and Trogdon, 2017), and, even, boys with female sounding names (Figlio, 2007). This paper investigates the negativespilloversof troubled children exposed to alcoholic fathers (hereafter, “disruptive” peers) on students’academic performance. We also identify some of the potential mechanisms and channels through which these effects operate.The harmful use of alcohol is a worldwide problem resulting in an estimated 3 million deaths (5.3% of all deaths) globally in 2016 (World Health Organization, 2018).2In China, approximately 709,000 deaths were attributed to alcohol in 2016. Although per capita alcohol consumption in the world has remained stable recently, per capita alcohol consumption in China rose remarkably by approximately 76% over the last decade, from 4.1 liters in 2005 to 7.2 liters in 2016. The harmful use of alcohol has become an emerging problem in China. Moreover, alcohol is not only a causal factor in many diseases, but is also a precursor to injury and violence. Families with alcoholic fathers have been shown to experience various problems, such as lack of communication, increased conflict, and subpar parenting. Children of alcoholic fathers are at increased risk of various childhood stressors, such as physical and sexual abuse, neglect, witnessing domestic violence, or growing up with other forms of household dysfunction (Dube et al., 2001;Windle et al., 1995).3As a result, children of alcoholic fathers have a higher risk of behavioral, social, and emotional problems at school.Using data from the China Education Panel Survey (CEPS), we show that students from troubled families linked to alcoholic fathers have substantially lower academic achievements than students with non-alcoholic fathers.4Moreover, exposure to an alcoholic father in one's own family is associated with high levels of misbehavior, for example, being late for school and skipping classes. Furthermore, students exposed to alcoholic fathers feel that the learning environment is less friendly and the classroom atmosphere is less satisfying than do those not exposed to alcoholic fathers. In this study, students from troubled families linked to alcoholic fathers are referred to as “disruptive students.” As suggested by the “bad apple”peer effectsmodel, the presence of a single disruptive student can negatively affect the outcomes of all other students in the classroom.5We then assess how the proportion of disruptive peers in the classroom affects the academic achievement of juniorsecondary school students.Based on randomized student assignments, our results show that increased exposure to children linked to alcoholic fathers leads to a statistically significant reduction in average test scores, which is consistent with the “bad apple” model. Specifically, adding 1 more troubled child to a classroom of 40 students (2.5-percentage point increase) causes the average test score of the other students to fall by 0.016standard deviations. The externalities from having more disruptive peers is mostly driven by the presence of a very high proportion of disruptive peers. We further show that girls, students from educated families, and high ability students, are most affected by exposure to disruptive peers in the classroom. Nevertheless, femalehead teacherstend to mitigate the negative externalities caused by disruptive students. An examination of the underlying mechanisms suggests that disruptive peers cause more disciplinary problems in the classroom, resulting in lower academic performance. Moreover, because students from troubled families learn more slowly, the teacher may need to adapt her pace to suit the troubled students, which slows down the learning of their peers. We find that when there are more disruptive peers in the class, students in the 9th grade or students in classes with male head teachers spend less time on the homework assigned by teachers.It is difficult to identify the causal effect of troubled children on peers. First, it is difficult to determine the direction of causality: whether a disruptive child causes his or her classmates to misbehave or whether the misbehaving classmates cause the child to be disruptive. In addition, troubled children are likely to self-select into the same classroom as other disadvantaged children. Finally, the poor academic performance of disruptive students and their classmates may be due to common unobserved factors.We overcome these problems by using the presence of alcoholic fathers as an exogenous source of variation in peer quality in a setting of random classroom assignment. First, this enables us to identify the group of troubled children in a more precise way than by usingdemographicmeasures, such as gender or race (Carrell and Hoekstra, 2010). An additional advantage of this measure is that we can identify students who are troubled for family reasons exogenous to their peers (i.e., the child's peers are not the cause of the alcoholic father in the household). Thus, applying the presence of alcoholic fathers overcomes the reflection problem.In addition, this unique dataset allows us to exploit the random assignment of students to classrooms and to include school-gradefixed effectsto control for the selection of students into schools. Thus, the identification assumption is that, given the sample of randomized classrooms, all other determinants of students’ academic performance are orthogonal to the within school-grade variation in peer alcoholic fathers. Empirical evidence in this study shows that the within school-grade variation in disruptive peers is uncorrelated with pre-determined student characteristics, including own alcoholic father, age, gender, ethnicity, number of siblings,hukoustatus, mother's and father's years of schooling, low-income household indicator, and baseline cognitive and non-cognitive measures. This evidence verifies the randomness of classroom assignment for our sample. Furthermore, there is no evidence that children exit the class after being exposed to a particularly high proportion of troubled peers. Finally, we show that the effects of disruptive peers on students’ academic achievement are robust to the inclusion of teacher controls and average peer characteristics. Thus, our identification overcomes the usual problems of selection and reflection, as well as the correlated effects problem in the estimation of peer effects.Our study contributes to the literature in several ways. The first is that our unique dataset enables us to exploit the random assignment of students into classrooms to identify the causal effects of disruptive peers using a large, nationally representative sample of junior high schools. Most existing studies exploit the natural variation in cohort composition across time within a given school (Bifulco et al., 2011;Carrell et al., 2018;Carrell and Hoekstra, 2010;Lavy et al., 2012a;Lavy and Schlosser, 2011); thus, the peer group in these studies is defined as students in the same grade level (within the same school and year). Students in the same classroom are a much more relevant peer group for studying social spillovers than are the broader group of students in the same grade (Burke and Sass, 2013;Lazear, 2001).6In addition, our study enables us to draw more general conclusions than do studies based on experimental designs which focus on one school or district.Second, this study detects heterogeneous peer effects by the gender of the disruptive children and their peers. We show that troubled children primarily impact the academic achievement of girls, which implies that the academic performance of girls may be more sensitive to the misbehavior of disruptive peers. We further show that boys from troubled families linked to alcoholic fathers primarily cause the negative effects on the academic achievement of girls. Interestingly, we demonstrate that the presence of female head teachers can mitigate the negative externalities of disruptive students on girls. These findings imply that to compensate for a high share of students exposed to alcoholic fathers in classes, schools could allocate female head teachers to these classes to mitigate the negative externalities imposed by disruptive peers on girls.Our study also contributes to the literature by shedding light on potential mechanisms through which peer effects operate. As inAizer (2008),Carrell and Hoekstra (2010), andImberman et al. (2012), we show that the misbehavior of disruptive peers in the classroom is an important mechanism. In addition, teachers’ responses to changes in the student composition may be another important channel.Finally, this study provides evidence of the existence of spillovers in the classroom caused by alcoholism, which have not yet been explored in the literature. Previous studies have demonstrated that parentalalcohol abuseplays a crucial role in a child's social, emotional, and cognitive development (Conner et al., 2020). Our results suggest that alcoholic fathers impact human capital development not only through the effect on human capital accumulation of their own children, but also through externalities imposed on others. Our findings offer a compelling justification for policymakers to be concerned about the harmful use of alcohol, which is an important public health problem.The remainder of this article is organized as follows.Section 2gives a brief overview of the institutional background with regard to juniorsecondary educationin China. InSection 3, we introduce the data and variables. InSection 4, we outline the empirical specification and discuss the validity of the underlying assumptions required for identification.Section 5describes the study's results and presents evidence on the possible mechanisms driving the negative peer effects of troubled students on the academic achievement of their peers.Section 6presents the conclusions.",Liqiu,Zhong,None
"1. IntroductionThe size of theshadow economyis large across the world.Medina and Schneider (2018)estimate that more than one-third of world GDP is produced in the underground economy.1In developing regions such as Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa, over 40% of the economic activities take place informally, and in some countries two-thirds of the economy is underground.Distinguishing between formality and informality is important in analyzing policies in such an economy. An informal sector, by definition, is characterized by lack of compliance with government regulations. Individuals pay notaxesand make nosocial security contributionon income earned informally. They are, however, disconnected from public provision of social insurance, despite the fact that workers in the informal sector face higherlabor mobilityand earnings volatilities and are in need of more insurance.2Mexico is a prime example of such issues, with a history of attempts to curb informality. Using the data of the Mexican Statistics and Geography National Institute (INEGI), we estimate that 43% percent of the working population is employed in the underground sector.3Workers in the shadow economy face not onlylower wages, but also higher risks of job loss and little protection from job dismissals. Policy makers are debating the implementation of an unemployment insurance system, which is far from comprehensive at present. Also debated is a reform of thetaxsystem on consumption and labor income, two major sources of revenues besides oil in Mexico (OECD, 2019). Such changes in labor market and fiscal policies are likely to induce mobility of workers across sectors.This paper builds a structural life-cycle model of heterogeneous agents in a dual-sector economy, in which workers move between formal and informal sectors and in and out of unemployment. Individuals are heterogeneous in the stage of life-cycle, human capital,wealth, uninsurable idiosyncratic labor productivity and the sector where they currently work. They face uncertainty in employment and productivity, but the market is incomplete and risk-averse individuals engage in life-cycle as well asprecautionary savingsof riskless assets to smooth consumption. The model is calibrated using various micro data, including the National Urban Employment Survey (ENEU) and the National Employment and Occupational Survey (ENOE) for wage and employment data and the National HouseholdIncome and Expenditure Survey(ENIGH) for asset profile.We then use the calibrated model to simulate debatedlabor market policiesto quantify effects on wages, employment, savings, and welfare, as well as the reallocation of labor across sectors. We simulate two labor market policies: an introduction of unemployment insurance and the provision of more generous employment protection through higherseverance payment.We allow laid-off workers in the formal sector to collect unemployment benefits for a limited duration. The policy increases the unemployment rate, although the effects are quantitatively small. Hazard rates, however, into formality among insurance recipients decline and the unemployed are more likely to accept offers for informal jobs. Given the lack of monitoring of employment in the informal sector, unemployed individuals who accept a job in the informal sector can keep collecting benefits until the receiving period ends.A higher severance payment reduces the likelihood of layoffs in the formal sector. The policy, however, also depresses equilibrium formal wages, leaving the unemployment rate and the share of formality almost unchanged. Hazard rates, both into formality and informality, decrease with more severance payments due to wealth effects through larger transfers.To quantify fiscal costs of alternative policies, we simulate a model implementing the policies under alternative tax regimes, by shifting sources of taxation between labor income and consumption. While consumption taxes are less distortionary than labor income taxes, the change in employment due to higher labor taxes turns out to be surprisingly small. In our dual-sector economy, workers move from formal jobs to informal jobs that remain free of taxes. Such a sectoral reallocation involves a decline in overall productivity and average earnings as well as a sizeable welfare loss of individuals.Our paper attempts to contribute to different lines of literature. Our model follows the tradition of dynamic structural models populated by heterogenous agents, who optimally choose consumption, saving and labor supply in an incomplete market.4The model is also a version of the life-cycle framework developed byAuerbach and Kotlikoff (1987), where individuals accumulate wealth for precautionary and retirement reasons. Using a life-cycle rather than an infinitely-lived agent model helps us approximate the earnings-wealth ratio that is consistent with data of a typicaldual economyand the process of accumulating physical and human capital at stages of the life-cycle. We introduce stochastic aging, a modeling device developed byBlanchard (1985), which allows us to reduce the size of individual state space.The literature has been also merged with and extended to incorporate labor market frictions and to study unemployment dynamics and various labor market policies. The search-island model ofLucas and Prescott (1974)captures search frictions to account for short-run unemployment, which is adopted by papers such asAlvarez and Veracierto (2001)andKitao et al. (2017). They assume that a worker who finds an island will be randomly matched with a firm and receives a job offer at the equilibrium wage in the island.Alvarez and Veracierto (2001)use the model to study effects of severance payments andKitao et al. (2017)the roles of transfer policies that interact with decisions ofhuman capital investmentand career length in a life-cycle model. Our model also includes frictions in the labor market, as inMortensen and Pissarides (1994). We let each firm create one job, while being subject to idiosyncratic productivity shocks and endogenous job destruction.The papers mentioned above focus on a single sector of the economy and one of our major contributions is to extend it to a dual-sector economy in a tractable way. We analyze effects of labor market and fiscal policies in an economy where a large informal sector plays an important role in accounting for dynamics of the labor market, individuals’ welfare and the aggregate economy.Alcaraz et al. (2015)show that although there exists some segmentation in the Mexican labor market, a large number of workers self-select into a particular sector, implying that a structural model needs to capture endogenous mobility of workers across sectors and analysis ofpolicy reformsshould take into account their effects on these margins.Therefore our paper builds on another growing body of literature comprising theoretical and empirical studies on labor market dynamics and policies in an economy with dual sectors. In terms of more theoretical papers,Álvarez-Parra and Sánchez (2009)study the design of unemployment insurance when workers can participate in a hidden labor market and show that the optimal scheme differs significantly from the one prescribed in a market without dual sectors.Cirelli et al. (2019)study optimal design of an unemployment insurance saving accounts (UISA) system in a model with two sectors with savings and their model is perhaps closest to ours among models with informality.5They find that the optimal UISAs increase welfare, and reduce unemployment and informality due to the incentives for keeping jobs in the formal sector. Both of these papers study optimal design of an unemployment system in more detail than ours, while our analysis has the advantage of incorporatinggeneral equilibriumeffects.Levy (2008)studies informality in Mexico and different policy reforms that took place to curb it. The author’s proposal is to eliminate wage-based social security contributions and impose a progressive consumption tax. The results of our paper that lower income taxes and higher consumption taxes reduce informality are broadly consistent with Levy’s proposal, although our experiments are not a perfect mapping to his proposal and therefore not directly comparable. Other authors at the Inter-American Development Bank have also done various empirical research on the effects of tax reforms in countries with high informally.Bernal et al. (2017)study the effect on employment and wages of the switch from payroll taxes tocorporate income taxesin Colombia.Lora and Fajardo (2012)analyze the effects of payroll, corporate income and value-added taxes on the labor market for 15 Latin American countries.Alonso Ortiz and Leal Ordonez (2018)construct a search model of two sectors calibrated to the Mexican data and show that tax and transfer policies have a large impact on the size of the informal sector.Antón (2014)builds a model with endogenous choice of sectors calibrated to the data of Colombia and studies effects of tax reduction on the size of the formal sector.Bobba et al. (2018)estimate a search and matching model of formal and informal labor markets using Mexican data and show that raising taxes may or may not decrease the formal sector and that a comprehensive social security system will reduce the size of the informal sector and raise productivity.Leyva and Urrutia (2019)build a model with business cycles calibrated to the Mexican economy and study effects of informality and labor market regulations on volatility ofmacroeconomicvariables.6Our innovation in this context is first to allow individuals to accumulate physical and human capital over their life-cycle, which interacts with an individual’s decision about which sectors to work in. Savings of risk-averse individuals adds another key ingredient in evaluating the roles of government-provided insurance through unemployment benefits and severance payments. Second, we consider effects of alternative fiscal policies tofinancepolicy expenditures on labor market dynamics and individuals’ welfare.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.Section 2presents the model andsection 3describes the data and calibration of the model parameters.Section 4presents the results of the different policy experiments andsection 5concludes.",Julen,Sagiri,None

"1. IntroductionThe goals of physical education (PE) are manyfold.UNESCO (2014)analyses PE curricula worldwide. It documents that most PE curricula intend to provide beneficial effects along five domains: (i) support academic achievements, (ii) foster personal and social development (non-cognitive skills), (iii) improve basic motor skills, (iv) encouragephysical activityin and out of school, and (v) improve health. This means PE's goal is to improve human capital accumulation. Especially the development of the first two domains are essential determinants of future labour market outcomes (see, e.g.,Kautz et al., 2014). However, also the other three targeted domains might play an important role given the evidence that a physically active lifestyle (e.g.,Lechner, 2009) and health (e.g.,Cawley and Ruhm, 2011) are drivers of labour market success.Thus, it is not surprising that politicians and health organisations, among others, frequently promote increasing PE. The US Surgeon General recommends 150-225 min per week of PE (Benjamin, 2010), while the average time of PE in the US is less than 90 min per week (Cawley et al., 2013).1In Europe, several countries discuss minimumPE levelsof one PE lesson per school day, which would lead to a considerable increase compared to current levels. For example, Austria introduced daily PE lessons for all-day schools in 2015 and plans to extend it for all schools.2However, the empirical evidence about the effects of PE at school is scarce and inconclusive. This is unfortunate because increasing time in PE requires substantial investments in new facilities and teachers as well as rearrangements of the curricula. Furthermore, there may be implicit costs in terms of children's human capital, as the additional time in PE has to come either from reducing hours of other subjects or a reduction in the children's leisure time. Consequently, policymakers, parents, and children need reliable evidence regarding the effects of different numbers of PE lessons to be able to judge whether the potential benefits of a future policy change outweigh its costs.A large body of evidence documents the (short-term) effectiveness of school-based interventions on specific domains.3However, these kinds of interventions are usually not permanent and taught by specially trained staff. Thus, it is not clear whether their results carry over to standard PE taught by regular teachers in regular schools. While the studies of temporary interventions are mostly experimental, the identification of the effects of regular PE is complicated by potential selection into schools providing more or less PE. Parents and children might have preferences for more or less PE and choose schools accordingly. Further, the amount of PE could vary with the quality of schools. On the one hand, high quality schools could offer less PE and devote more time to academic subjects. On the other hand, high quality schools could provide more PE because of their better infrastructure. Controlling for all these factors would be challenging and requires very detailed information about parents and schools. We are aware of three studies that address the selection into PE by usinginstrumental variables(Cawley et al., 2013;Cawley et al., 2007;Dills et al., 2011) and one that uses a difference-in-differences approach (Sabia et al., 2016). We discuss these papers in the next section.Our study contributes to the limited literature about the effects of regular PE in two ways. (i) The unique German Motorik-Modul dataset enables a comprehensive analysis of all five domains of intended PE effects. (ii) We exploit differences in PE requirements across and within German federal states to identify the causal effects of PE. This provides a stronger instrument compared to the previous literature and is exploited in a semi-parametric instrumental variable (IV) estimator to relax functional form assumptions. Most importantly, the data allow us to run a placebo test with pre-school children to address remaining endogeneity concerns. The placebo test shows no systematic differences for pre-school children before they are exposed to PE, which raises confidence in our empirical findings.Our results show improved school grades, but adverse effects on non-cognitive skills, measured as increasing behavioural problems. The adverse effects are observed only for boys, while girls benefit even in terms of lower emotional symptoms. This suggestsgender differencesin the effectiveness of PE. In addition, we find improved motor skills and increased extra-curricular physical activities for girls. Effects on motor skills and extra-curricular physical activities seem to be much smaller, if not absent, for boys. Regardless of gender, we find no statistically significant effects on any health parameter.The paper is structured as follows. The next section provides a brief literature review of the effects of regular PE.Section 3describes the institutional setting generating the exogenous variation that we exploit.Section 4describes the data.Section 5explains the empirical strategy.Section 6showsdescriptive statisticsof the relevant variables.Section 7presents the results, some heterogeneity analysis, and investigates the sensitivity of the results.Section 8discusses the results in light of the existing literature and offers potential explanations for the findings.Section 9concludes.

"1. IntroductionRecent decades have seen the active labour market programme (ALMP) evaluation literature expand substantially (for a recent review seeFilges et al., 2016). The increased availability of rich datasets has allowed studies to utilise extensive time periods, both before and after treatment (Sianesi, 2004;Lechner et al., 2007;Biewen et al., 2014); there has been some improved ability to identify detail of the training undertaken (Frölich, 2004;Sianesi, 2008;Lechner et al., 2011); and studies have been able to give more explicit consideration to the issue of `dropouts’ in experimental (Heckman et al., 1998a) and non-experimental settings (Paul, 2015;Choe et al., 2015).This has led to an increase in the variety of methods used by researchers; characteristics of the programmes studied, and richness, or otherwise, of data used to capture differences between programmes (Biewen et al., 2014). Drawing on findings from across studies, there is some consensus that in the short run, programmes exhibit negative employment impacts due to lock-in effects; the duration and size of any such lock-in effects vary across programmes, but generally it takes two to three years for `meaningful' impacts to arise; and the extent to which training is mandated within a programme seems negatively related to estimated impacts (see for instance,Card et al., 2018). These studies also identify some consistent messaging on effect heterogeneity, with on-the-job training seen as more effective than classroom-based training.Despite these important insights, many questions remain.McCall et al. (2016)note the lack of explicit consideration across studies of what constitutes training; they argue that researchers should focus on estimating separate impacts for different training types, in contexts where programmes cannot be `killed' for political reasons; and, noting `the strong evidence of heterogeneity in treatment effects' (page 480), underline the need for insights that inform the matching of subgroups of unemployed to different interventions. A strong argument is made for future research that identifies effect heterogeneity below programme level. As more data becomes available to researchers, there are greater opportunities for such insights.However, as this paper shows, richer data brings its own challenges. We analyse information from an exceptionally rich dataset, containing detailed information on training interventions, allowing us to contribute to the development of this evidence base. More specifically, the administrative data used in this study contain information for an English population of 2.3 million individuals with an unemployment benefits claim start date between 6th April 2006 and 5th April 2008. This has been linked to detailed information on all registered learning aims at English further education (FE) institutions between the 2002/2003 and 2012/2013 academic years. English FE Institutions are broadly equivalent to US Community Colleges,1and most training for the unemployed is undertaken in these FE Institutions.2We focus on training for the unemployed undertaken during the first 18 months of an unemployment spell, when training treatments are predominantly voluntary in nature: estimating effects for three categories of training, and focusing analysis on unemployed individuals aged between 25 and 55.Relatively large numbers in both treatment and comparison groups allow us to use Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) (seeIacus et al., 2011), to create month-by-month estimates of employment effects, up to 5 years on from training start. We match [via CEM] on a variety of characteristics, including socio-demographic variables, prior qualifications3, a flag of basic skill need from a caseworker and up to 8 years of labour market and learning histories. Studies suggest that matching on such histories, better ensures the Conditional Independence Assumption (CIA) is met (Heckman and Smith, 1999;Lechner and Wunsch, 2013; andCaliendo et al., 2017), when considering selection into treatment start. The fact that we observe all training spells undertaken in FE during the period under analysis, allows us to counter many of the concerns around substitution (seeFay, 1996;Heckman et al., 1998a;Heckman et al., 2000).Our focus is on training interventions taken up voluntarily that can occur at different points in each individual's unemployment spell. This potential for variation across individuals in the timing of treatment, raises similar concerns to those flagged in studies bySianesi (2004;2008),Fitzenberger et al. (2006),Fredriksson and Johansson (2008)andBiewen et al. (2014)concerning dynamic selection into treatment. Therefore, in each of our analyses we separately estimate employment impacts for (a) those who initiate training in the first two months of their unemployment spell; (b) those who first initiate training in the third or fourth months of unemployment; (c) those who first initiate training in the fifth or sixth months, and so on; up to the ninth analysis that considers those initiating training for the first time in the seventeenth and eighteenth months from claim start. In the following analysis, when comparing outcomes for these individuals with those of the `untreated', the latter group is made up of individuals who have not initiated training up to the specified point in time from claim start, but who may do so in future months. From here we therefore refer to this group as thecurrently untreated. FollowingSianesi (2008), we present figures that are aggregates of thesetreatment effectsestimated by time of initiation, weighted according to the observed distribution of initiation across the nine separate periods.This approach allows us to tackle concerns over selection into treatment start. However, the more substantive contribution of this paper arises from (i) our ability to identify amongst the treated those who do, and those who do not, achieve the learning outcomes of training (according to the trainer's assessment, which may involve some form of examination); and (ii) our investigation of the challenge of selection into full and partial treatment, following training initiation, that incorporation of this information presents. As richer sub-programme data become available, it is possible to investigate the challenges posed byMcCall et al. (2016), but identification of the drivers of effect heterogeneity below programme level brings us to a perspective more often associated with theeducation economicsliterature. Our investigation highlights one of the key points of possible convergence between an ALMP evaluation literature where intention to treat approaches dominate; and an education economics literature, where achievers are often the central focus of attention in terms of estimated impacts4.To investigate, we present estimated month-by-month employment effects following treatment start, using a variety of pair-wise comparisons; for each of our three categories of learning. First, we present the estimated employment impacts that arise from (A) comparison of all those who start a training treatment at a point in time [all starters], and those whom we do not observe initiating a treatment [currently untreated] up to that specified point in time, but who may do so in the future, up to 18 months from claim start date. Matching on lengthy employment histories and adopting the approach ofSianesi (2008), we invoke the Conditional Independence Assumption [CIA]. When comparingall starterswith thecurrently untreated, the main concern is selection into treatment start, and in this respect the existing literature provides support for this invocation of the CIA (Caliendo et al., 2017).However, we then present estimated employment impacts that arise from pairwise comparisons which utilise the information we have on achievement (or otherwise) of learning outcomes (i.e. splitting the group ofall startersintofullyandpartiallytreated). Specifically, we present estimated impacts associated with comparisons between (B) thefully treated(who are recorded as achieving the learning aims of a training scheme) and thecurrently untreated; and (C) thepartially treated(who enrol for this training, but are not recorded as achieving the learning outcomes) and thecurrently untreated. Estimands from analysis under (B) and (C) are obtained using a similar approach to those under (A), as the causal contrast is between `training now' (whether this is forall starters, thefully treatedorpartially treatedat a point in time) versus `waiting' (i.e. those who at the same point in time are `currently untreated').Finally, we present estimated impacts from comparison between (D) thefully treatedand thepartially treated. Estimands obtained from this comparison differ to those under (A), (B) and (C) as unemployed individuals who start training during a given sub-interval and achieve [fully treated], are compared to the unemployed who start training during the same sub-interval, but do not subsequently achieve the learning outcomes [partially treated]. As a result, estimates obtained from (D) are closer to those used in standard cost-benefit frameworks, whilst this is not true of those under (A), (B) and (C).McCall et al. (2016)suggest that these estimated impacts, `represent the impact of completing the training and, hopefully, now possessing the set of skills the training aims to provide'. Completion is a proxy for the securing of human capital, and it would seem important to attempt to utilise indicators of achievement where we have them. Comparisons (B), (C) and (D) allow us to utilise the information on achievement, but also introduce the potential for bias associated with selection following training start.It is likely that selection into full treatment and partial treatment is non-random, and there are differences between the two groups that are correlated with outcomes. Because selection into full or partial treatment occurs after treatment start, our identification strategy will only remain valid under certain assumptions. Namely, that matching up to the point of training start captures all relevant information driving subsequent selection into partial or full treatment. For this to be valid, any unobserved factors driving selection into these two groups, must be uncorrelated with potential outcomes, having conditioned on observed learning and employment histories prior to treatment start. However, if there are unobserved factors that drive selection into partial/full treatment, and this information only arises following treatment start, we are at risk of bias in our comparison of effects fromfullandpartialtreatment.Section 5.1shows how our findings change when using distance to nearest FE training provider to instrument for selection into partial and full treatment – investigating the validity of estimates obtained under (B) to (D).To ensure our distinction between partial and full treatment is located within the existing literatures,Section 2.1considers the partial treatment framework ofHeckman et al. (1998a); the literature on dropouts in ALMP studies (Kluve et al., 2012;Choe et al., 2015;Paul, 2015) and links this to the education economics literature that estimates impacts from vocational learning (Patrignani and Conlon, 2011;Buscha and Urwin, 2013;Jepsen et al., 2014;Bibby et al. 2014;Hedges et al., 2018).Section 2.2provides additional context, detailing the New Deal programme that was in operation during the period of this study.Section 3describes the data and methodological approach, whileSection 4presents the results.Section 5checks for the robustness and sensitivity of the estimates with a particular focus on the issue of dynamic selection following programme start (Section 5.1) andSection 6summarises findings and implications for future research.",Augusto,Peter,Dave
"1. IntroductionPrivate prisons proliferated in the U.S. since the mid-1980s.1In 1984, Corrections Corporation of America (CCA, now CoreCivic) established the first privately-owned and -operated incarceration facility in Hamilton County, Tennessee (Mattera et al., 2001). The private prisonindustryexperienced substantial growth through the late-1980s and early-1990s where annual industry revenues rose from $14 million in 1984 to $120 million in 1994(Mattera et al., 2001). The capacity of private incarceration facilities increased from 3000 beds in 1984 to 20,000 beds in 1990, followed by annual increases of 50% until 1994 where it slowed to an annual increase of 25% for the latter half of the decade (Mattera et al., 2001).2One hypothesis raised concerns the impact of private prisons on incarceration rates in the U.S., which is highest in the world (Walmsley, 2018). The American Civil Liberties Union asserts private prisons significantly increased the incarceration rate in the U.S. since the mid-1980s (Shapiro, 2011). Stringent crime laws along with the private prisons may have contributed to the rise in incarceration rates. For example, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (""1994 Crime Bill"") increased funding for law enforcement and expanded punishments for a variety of offenses including weapons crimes, immigration violations, hate crimes, sex crimes, and gang-related crime. Such laws can facilitate underlying mechanisms which causally relate the increase in private prisons to incarceration rates.One potential mechanism is through lobbying and direct contributions to politicians and officials in exchange for favorable policies which increase incarceration rates (Ashton and Petteruti, 2011). Two prominent examples illustrate the plausibility of this mechanism. First, in the “Kids for Cash” scandal in Luzerne, Pennsylvania, two judges received money from two private juvenile detention centers in exchange for harsh judgements on juvenile offenders to increase the number of residents in the centers (May, 2014). The judges sentenced minors convicted of misdemeanors to internment in private youth correctional facilities in exchange for $2.6 million in kickbacks. Second, lobby groups for private prisons supported California's three-strikes rule and Arizona's anti-illegal immigration law for harsher penalties on crimes and longer sentences (Cohen, 2015). CoreCivic lobbied for increased appropriation measures from the Office of Federal Detention Trustee and for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to maintain or increase the “bed quota,” a policy mandating a minimum of 34,000 inmates at any given time regardless of illegal immigration levels (Ashton and Petteruti, 2011).Another mechanism isovercrowdingin public prisons (Wilson, 2014), which might dissuade judges from assigning marginal convicts to prison. Private prisons may reduce this capacity constraint, leading to more incarcerations. The role of these mechanisms remains unstudied. There is also gap in the literature in understanding the channels by which private prisons influence incarceration levels such as incentivizing arrest rates leading to more trials, influencing guilty verdicts, or changing the individual likelihood of incarceration overprobation.This article explores the effect of establishing private prisons on incarceration rates in the United States. First, we build a model on sentencing to illustrate howsanctionsare skewed in favor of owners of private prisons to increase incarceration rates at the extensive margin (aggregate number of prisoners) and the intensive margin (sanction level per prisoner). Next, we empirically estimate the effect of the number of private prisons on incarceration rates for different types of crimes and across time before and after the 1994 Crime Bill. We examine two mechanisms to test our theoretical prediction: capacity constraints of public prisons andcorruptionof enforcement authorities.3Finally, we decompose the impact of these mechanisms through their effect on three channels: number of trials, guilty sentences, and the likelihood of receiving a prison sentence conditional on conviction. This is the first study which provides a theoretical mechanism by which private prisons influence incarceration rates and empirically tests the theoretical results.We contribute to thepublic lawenforcement and sentencing literature in three ways. Our main contribution is in the empirical literature on private prisons. There is very little empirical evidence related to the determinants and effects of private prisons. Most empirical work on private prisons compares the public and private prison cost differential to see if savings exist in the latter compared to the former. Private prisons have lower construction and operating costs but there is poormanagement qualitybecause of moral hazard, asymmetric information or incomplete contracting issues (Kish and Lipton 2013).Mukherjee (2019)showed sentences of inmates in private prisons in Mississippi were significantly larger than their public prison counterparts for the same crime. We have not come across any empirical estimation which analyzes the impact of private prisons on aggregate incarceration rates.Next, we contribute to the relatively small literature which analyzes the determinants of incarceration rates. Incarceration rates across U.S. states depend on a variety of socioeconomic, legal and political factors. Race andincome inequalityare significant indirect factors which affect incarceration rates (Arvanites and Asher, 1998;Yates, 1997). Political factors such as partisan control of the legislature, voting cycles and partisan control of the executive office contribute significantly to incarceration rates (Smith, 2004). Ideological orientations of enforcement authorities (Percival, 2010) and a country's legal origin (D'Amico and Williamson, 2015) also affect incarceration rates. None of these studies consider the role of private prisons.4Finally, we contribute to the theoretical literature on public law enforcement choice and sentencing.5Polinsky and Shavell (1982,1984) show the optimal sanction which maximizes welfare is equal to the harm caused by the individual.Andreoni (1991)found equilibrium-derived penalties are superior to uniform penalties, which could encourage crime due to interdependence between penalties and conviction probabilities.Daugherty and Reinganum (2000)model sentencing decisions by a court whichBayesianupdates its priors based on appeal decisions and their expectations about higher court interpretations to minimize the chances of overrules.Lundberg (2016)findsjuriesand judges issue “compromise verdicts” with a guilty verdict and relatively light sentence when confronted with uncertainty. These models do not incorporate bribes to enforcement authority and there are no prison capacity constraints.We model how capacity constraints and lobbying affect sentencing lengths of an enforcement authority. We adaptPolinsky and Shavell (1984)by incorporating prison capacity constraints and use a common agency model to illustrate how owners of private prisons influence the sanction levels imposed by the enforcement authority. We find enforcement authorities which are more susceptible to corruption or face capacity constraints set non-optimal sanctions leading to higher incarceration rates at the extensive and intensive margins.We collect data on individual-level trial outcomes from the United States Sentencing Commission which we aggregate by state to form incarceration rate data. We match this data with private prison numbers across states,demographicvariables, measures of capacity constraints and a proxy for lobbying susceptibility. We use aninstrumental variableregression to estimate the effect of private prisons on incarceration rates.Simultaneity bias is likely where higher incarceration rates leads to more demand for private prisons. The proliferation of private prisons started in 1984 during the Reagan administration. The Reagan administration embraced privatization as a “strategy for minimalist government and deficit reduction” (Tingle, 1988). Studies from think tanks and academic institutions were significant factors in influencing policies which led to smaller governments, free market and trade and deregulation (Hacker and Pierson, 2017;Ravitch, 2017;Komlos, 2018). We proxy the rise in the privatization ideology by compiling the number ofeconomic studieson pro-privatization by state and using the data to construct a knowledge stock index similar toPopp (2002)as an instrument for the number of private prisons. This instrument is likely to influence a state policymaker's decision to allow private prisons but it has no direct effect on incarceration rates. Our Stock-Yogo test results show that our instrument is not weak.We show that private prisons have a significant effect on aggregate state incarceration levels. Furthermore, the incarceration rate at the extensive margin increases with more private prisons for some crimes such as fraud, drug offenses, property crimes and weapons crimes. Private prisons also have an effect on incarceration at the intensive margin on sentencing length for fraud, drug offenses, regulatory and weapons crimes. The 1994 Crime Bill led to private prisons increasing weapons crimes incarcerations, which was one of its intended target, but it also increased other non-violent incarcerations such as fraud, public order and regulatory crimes. This may have been due to the three-strikes law. The corruption and capacity constraint mechanisms yield mixed results. Finally, the likely channel of increased incarceration rates is from more guilty verdicts and an increase in incarceration likelihood in corrupt states.",Gregmar,Ryne,None
"1. IntroductionThe relationship between family structure and child outcomes has been widely discussed in the literature. For example, beginning withBecker and Lewis (1973), there has been a rich body of literature examining the quantity-quality trade-off, with many empirical studies finding a negative correlation between family size and child outcomes (such asCáceres-Delpiano (2006);Downey (1995);Hanushek (1992)in developed countries,Li et al. (2008);Patrinos and Psacharopoulos (1997);Rosenzweig and Zhang (2009)in developing countries) but some suggesting negligible or even positive effects (Angrist, Lavy, Schlosser, 2010,Black, Devereux, Salvanes, 2005,Millimet, Wang, 2011). Another widely discussed topic is the effect of birth order, with studies uniformly finding a negative effect on the older children (Behrman, Taubman, 1986,Black, Devereux, Salvanes, 2005,Booth, Kee, 2009), and a third topic of interest is the role of sibship gender composition that has generated mixed results (Butcher, Case, 1994,Conley, 2000,Hauser, Kuo, 1998).Compared with other aspects of family structure mentioned above, birth interval has received much less attention but may play an important role in child outcomes as well, withSteelman et al. (2002)noting that ”the effects [of sex composition] are smaller than those of sibship size or spacing, at least in the United States” andWineberg and McCarthy (1989)stating that ”the timing of births may well be the most important aspect of fertility differentials”. The relevance of the birth interval is likely to grow, with the timing of births becoming a more important aspect of family choice as thefertility ratecontinues to decline in most parts of the world1Subsequent birth interval, in contrast to preceding birth interval, denotes the age difference between the individual of interest and the next younger sibling. With a focus on the older sibling in a pair, researchers have discussed potential mechanisms from three different perspectives. First, from the physiological perspective, numerous studies indicate that short intervals harm the first child due to a higher probability of early weaning (Bohler, Bergstrom, 1996,Retherford, Choe, Thapa, Gubhaju, 1993) or increased exposure, higher transmission risk or growing severeness of infectious diseases (Aaby, Bukh, Maria Lisse, Smits, 1983,Swenson, 1978). Second, from the psychological perspective, there is evidence that in a widely spaced pair of siblings, the older sibling tends to provide more caregiving and teaching to the younger one (Cicirelli, 1973), which potentially could result in both positive and negative effects on theelderchild2Third, the economic perspective also suggests that a child’s development may be affected by subsequent birth interval. In particular, there are two major economic channels for this relationship: resource dilution and scale effect. The resource dilution hypothesis (Blake, 1989) is based on the notion that a household dispenses valuable resources such as goods and parental time to all the children in the household. A longer birth interval implies that the older child benefits from a longer time living in a smaller-sized family in early childhood, and so this hypothesis indicates a positive effect on the older sibling of a longer subsequent birth interval. This hypothesis, though seldom tested empirically (Buckles and Munnich (2012)is an exception), has found support in the literature on family size (seeSteelman et al. (2002)for a review). In contrast, the second potential economic channel, the scale effect, which is the change in per child cost as family size changes, predicts the opposite relationship. According to the scale effect, a household benefits from having children closer together because it decreases the per child cost in several ways. Similarly aged children may share toys and clothes, and parents with closely spaced children may also be able to focus their time at home, thus reducing interruptions to their supply of labor in the workplace and allowing them to grow their household economic resources more rapidly.(Steelman et al., 2002) The scale effect thus suggests that the shorter the interval, the better the outcome for both children. In sum, taking the two potential economic channels into considertion, the effects of a longer subsequent birth interval are ambiguous.Within the limited literature on birth interval, many studies focus on theprecedingbirth interval, the effect on the younger sibling, due to the physiological concern about a pregnancy too close to the one before. This literature tends to focus on short intervals (less than 24 months) and early outcomes such as neonatal and infant mortality. Among the relatively few studies on the causal effect of subsequent birth interval, most look at educational outcomes, finding evidence of a positive effect of long subsequent interval (Buckles, Munnich, 2012,Karwath, Relikowski, Schmitt, 2014,Pettersson-Lidbom, Thoursie). As studies on family size and birth order have shown, however, scale and even the existence of effects can be sensitive to the child outcome indicators. Hence, it is important to investigate other aspects of children development such as physical growth and nutrition status. Finally, while some physiologists have discussed the relationship between birth interval and the anthropometric outcomes of older siblings, there is no attention to exogenous sources of variation and so the conclusions are based on correlation, not causality. Moreover, the results are mixed and inconclusive,3so additional evidence to understand how the subsequent birth interval causally affects child outcomes is clearly needed.This paper begins with a theoretical discussion of how the subsequent birth interval affects the first child’s access to resources and thus nutrition status in economic terms. As for the direction of the total effect of the birth interval, a theoretical analysis predicts that resource dilution and scale effect give converse predictions. It is further proposed that a longer interval benefits first children who are worse off and who are less preferred by parents more as long as the resource dilution hypothesis is true.It then turns to the empirical analysis. A main challenge to obtaining the causal effect comes from the potential endogeneity of the birth interval length, and an important source of endogeneity is unobserved parental characteristics that are related to both interval length and child outcomes. For instance, parents with strong concerns about child outcomes might consider family planning more and decide to have a second birth after a longer interval, which will lead to a positively biased OLS estimator. Conversely, there is evidence that a higher quality first-born tends to bring the subsequent birth decision timing forward (Rosenzweig, 1986), resulting in a negatively biased OLS estimator. Previous studies exploit the variations in birth interval brought about by exogenous sources as solutions to this problem, such as miscarriages (Buckles and Munnich, 2012). However, miscarriages as household-level physiological events still inevitably suffer from endogenous determination to some degree. To mention another example, Sweden introduced a ”speed premium rule” to the parental leave system and started to offer benefit for short birth intervals less than two years in 1970s. It provides an exogenous resource shock as well as an incentive for short intervals and the effects on children’s outcomes are examined byGinja et al. (2020);Pettersson-Lidbom and Thoursie (2009).In this study, a natural experiment resulting from an exogenous Chinese regulation that forced long birth intervals between the first two births (usually over 4 years) or due to the maternal age at birth is considered. The variations in policy content and timing across provinces are exploited to construct an instrument for birth interval length. There are several benefits of the Chinese data for this study. First, as part of Chinese policy to curb fertility, the regulation on birth interval was one of the strictest and most straightforward policies worldwide, influencing a large population. Moreover, given that China remains a developing country fighting to alleviatepoverty, it is a suitable context for studying effects on children’s nutrition status, which corresponds to basic needs but is of great importance to future outcomes as well.When adopting aninstrumental variable(IV) strategy, asample selectiontype problem arises from the nature of interval data. Specifically, when birth interval is considered, it is assumed that at least a pair of children is already in the household. However, the decision to have a second child is a part of householdself selection, as only among those households who choose to have a second child can birth interval be observed. If the parents’ decision on family size is highly correlated with their preference over birth interval, and meanwhile related to their children’s development, estimates on the effect of birth interval may be biased when the only-child households are ruled out. To address this incidental truncation problem, a Heckman selection model is combined with the IV regression to correct the self-selected number of children. Specifically, aprobit regressionon whether the household has a second child is first performed, taking the first child’s age in month at the survey date as an exogenous variable for exclusion restriction. The fitted inverse Mills ratio from the probit regression is then included in the main IV regression. Another related problem, which is less relevant to the second-stage estimate but still important, comes from a right-censoring issue caused by potentially uncompleted families. In other words, some households that have one child at the time of the survey but plan to have a second child in the future, would also be dropped from the sample. In such a case, among those households with a recently born first child, only short intervals can be observed. This right-censoring nature of fertility data would exaggerate the estimated effect of regulations on birth intervals because time variation in deregulation is one source of interval variation. Existing studies address this issue by using sufficiently old data or by setting a lower bound for the mother’s age to permit a robust assumption that no child will be born afterwards in the sample. Here, including the first child’s age (in months) in theprobit modelhelps accommodate uncompleted families, allowing me to use more recent data. Asurvival analysisis further conducted as supplementary evidence of the effectiveness of birth interval regulation.Height is taken as the main proxy for the first child’s nutrition status, considering that it can be a direct reflection of the child’s access to resources. The IV first stage regression shows that households being regulated prolong the birth interval, consistent with the policy expectation. This conclusion is also drawn from a survival analysis. Next, the 2SLS results provide evidence of a positive effect of subsequent birth interval on the first child’s height, with a one-year increase in birth interval increasing the height-for-age score by 0.323standard deviations, which is equivalent to 2.11 cm taller for adult female or 2.36 cm taller for adult male. The OLS estimate is shown to be downward biased. Similarly, a one-year increase in birth interval is also shown to eliminate the probability of stunting by 7.3%.Next, aquantile regressionmodel is employed to examine the heterogeneous effects over the height distribution. Results show that the effect of birth interval is the largest at the second decile in the sample, where the height-for-age score is a bit lower than the threshold of stunting. The significant positive effect can be observed up to the third decile. These findings are in line with the expectation from resource dilution hypothesis.Following a theoretical discussion accommodating the resource dilution hypothesis, I conduct a further heterogeneity analysis by gender composition to explore the potential mechanisms. Results suggest that a first child benefits more from a longer subsequent birth interval when the first child is female or the second child is male. This pattern is further confirmed by the results from a detailed gender composition division. The heterogeneity analysis results are consistent with predictions from the theoretical prediction, leading to the conclusion that resource dilution is a key driver of subsequent birth interval positively affecting children’s physical development.This study contributes to the literature in the following ways. First, this study provides additional evidence on the determinants of birth interval length in the first step of the analysis. Second, I address the issue of possible endogeneity caused by potential correlations between birth interval length and unobserved household characteristics by using a direct policy regulation on birth interval as a natural experiment, enabling me to construct an instrument to estimate the causal effect. Third, as testing results may be sensitive to different measurements for child outcomes, to fill the gap in the literature, the focus in this study is on children’s height, which is an important indicator of child nutrition and development status at a broad age range. Fourth, by conducting heterogeneous analysis following a theoretical discussion, I look into potential mechanisms, testing the resource dilution hypothesis in the birth interval context. Fifth, this study examines the important but rarely analysed subsequent birth interval and investigate a broader range of interval lengths and not only the short intervals in the literature. Finally, to my knowledge, this study is among the first to study birth interval policy in China.This paper is organized as follows.Section 2describes the theoretical analysis and predicts the empirical results.Section 3introduces the family planning policies and children’s height in China, whileSection 4discusses the data and identification strategy.Section 5presents the empirical results and further analysis, andSection 6offers a final discussion and conclusion.",Xinwei,None,None
"1. IntroductionThe debate over the effects of migration on the wages and employment of native workers is a long standing one in thelabor economicsliterature. Several studies exploit the heterogeneous distribution of immigrants across local labor markets to derive causal estimates of these effects. Many of these studies find little or no impact of migration on wages or employment.1To explain the lack of effects, the literature has documented different channels through which either native workers or firms respond to migration over time, equalizing wages and employment opportunities across local labor markets (e.g.,Borjas, 2006,Lewis, 2011,Peri, Sparber, 2009).2The existence of these channels suggests that the short-run effects of migration on labor market outcomes may differ from the medium- or long-run effects.This study provides new estimates of the impact of migration on the employment and wages of natives in the very short run. This is accomplished using quarterly data while exploiting the unique characteristics of the migration to Italy resulting from theArab Spring.There are multiple reasons why the migration that followed the Arab Spring is particularly suitable for this analysis. First, the political instability in North Africa was likely exogenous to the dynamics prevailing in Italian labor markets at the time of the uprisings. Second, the Arab Spring caused a large spike in immigrants to Italy within a relatively brief period. In the first 6 months of 2011, the share of immigrants residing in Italy and originating from the Arab Spring countries of Egypt, Libya, Tunisia and Yemen increased by 23%. Finally, the Arab Spring induced only temporary migration to Italy, as the stock of Arab Spring immigrants residing in Italy returned to levels close to those of the pre-Arab Spring period by the end of 2011. The temporary nature of this migration event is consistent with the argument, often mentioned in the media, that once in Italy, immigrants may attempt to move towards other European countries that offer better opportunities.3The temporary, unanticipated and exogenous nature of the Arab Spring migration combined with the use of quarterly data makes it possible to isolate the immediate effects of migration from the longer-run adjustments that it induced.Our estimation strategy exploits the heterogeneous distribution of immigrants across Italian regions. As in many studies that exploit the geographical variation in migration flows, we account for endogenous settlements by using the share of immigrants from the Arab Spring countries previously living in each Italian region as an instrument for the distribution of immigrants across regions during the Arab Spring. We combine this static measure of migration intensity with the change in the flow of illegal entries into Italy over the same period to form a dynamic instrument.Three general findings emerge from this analysis. First, while the short-run effect of migration on overall native employment is insignificant, we find significant and offsetting effects acrossindustries. In particular, we find that the Arab Spring migration had a positive effect on the employment of natives in construction and educational services and a negative effect in wholesale trade, hotels and restaurants. In the industries in which employment was negatively affected, temporary migration had significant and sizable immediate effects, with an estimated displacement of 4 natives per 100 additional immigrants residing in a region. In the sectors in which employment was positively affected, we estimate that, on average, 6 natives found a job per 100 additional immigrants residing in a region. To explain these positive employment effects, we discuss the possibility that employment in educational services and construction increased as an effect of the contemporaneous increase in economic activity andlabor demandinduced by the Arab Spring migration.Second, both the positive and negative employment effects tend to dissipate over time. As immigrants leave Italy, we find that native employment gradually converges back to the pre-Arab Spring level in most sectors. While the temporary nature of the Arab Spring migration makes comparisons with other studies difficult, these findings are generally in line with the literature on the dynamic adjustments of labor markets to migration. This literature, based on more permanent migration events, also finds effects that decline over time (Cohen-Goldner, Paserman, 2011,Monras, 2019).Third, we find no evidence of statistically significant effects of migration on the wages of natives, which suggests that wages are rigid in the very short run. This is consistent with the institutionalized nature of the wage-setting mechanism in Italy and with the predictions from the literature suggesting that reduced flexibility in the labor market can amplify the negative effects of migration on employment while reducing the impact on wages (e.g.,Angrist and Kugler, 2003).Estimating the short-term effects of temporary migration is relevant for multiple reasons. First, our analysis provides a way of understanding what happens soon after immigrants enter a labor market. A finer assessment of those mechanisms may better inform the political debate on migration and help to reconcile the empirical evidence of little or no effect of migration with the fact that migration remains at the core of the political debate in many countries. Second, while the literature has extensively focused on the effects of migration on final destination regions, to date, there is less evidence on the labor market effects of migration in states that are located between the origin and final destination countries (i.e., intermediary regions). The results of this study could thus be relevant to intermediary regions that experience temporary migration events. In Europe, for example, the Balkan states and the Southern European countries may serve as a bridge between the Middle East or Africa and Northern European countries. In Central America, Mexico is known to channel immigrants from Central and South America to the United States and Canada (García, 2006,Hamilton, Chinchilla, 1991). In the United States,borderstates such as Arizona or New Mexico may be subject to the temporary migration across the Mexican border.4Several existing studies analyze migration events that last for years or decades. In doing so, they estimate the long-run effects of migration. Fewer studies focus on short-lived migration waves triggered by exogenous factors, and those that do use data at annual or lower frequencies (e.g.,Card, 1990,Carrington, De Lima, 1996,Hunt, 1992). While the short-lived migration events previously studied are usually associated with a permanent increase in the number of immigrants residing in the destination regions, the increase due to the Arab Spring in Italy was only temporary. The use of higher frequency data combined with the temporary nature of the increase in residing immigrants results in a greater possibility of capturing the most immediate effects of migration.Our study relates to the recent literature on the effects of Syrian refugees on the local labor markets of host countries (e.g.,Ceritoglu, Yunculer, Torun, Tumen, 2017,Del Carpio, Wagner, 2015,Tumen, 2016). Our setting, however, differs from those of these studies in two important respects. First, Syrian refugees generally stayed in the host country for longer than the Arab Spring immigrants did in Italy. Second, unlike the Syrian refugees in Turkey, for instance, most of the Arab Spring immigrants received a permit to work soon after arrival. This allowed them to take jobs in the formal sector, which likely resulted in easier and more rapid access to the labor market. Both of these aspects explain our greater focus on the short-term effects of migration and the use of higher frequency data. Our study also complements the work ofDustmann et al. (2017)that analyzes the effects of the temporary migration of Czech workers to Germany. In contrast to their work, we analyze the effects of a migration event that was forced by civil unrest rather than voluntary migration. As highlighted in recent work, forced and voluntary migration can have different consequences on labor markets (Becker and Ferrara, 2019).The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.Section 2describes the migration through Italy resulting from the Arab Spring.Section 3discusses the data.Section 4introduces the empirical methodology.Sections 5and6present the main results and the robustness checks, respectively.

"1. IntroductionSchool closures are an increasingly common reform strategy for school districts in Western countries facing declining enrollments, constricting budgets, or lowacademic performance. In the US, 1 537 schools (1.5%) were closed from 2014 to 2015 alone (NCES), and the Obama administration even provided federal grants for the closing of low-performing schools (Engberg et al., 2012). European countries such as Sweden and Denmark have closed an even larger percentage of schools in the last decade (Beuchert, Humlum, Nielsen, Smith, 2018,Taghizadeh, 2016). Given the prevalence of school closures in Western countries, understanding their effects on student achievement is crucial for policymakers. However, the effects of school closures have primarily been studied among students whose education was interrupted and who were displaced to other schools (referred to asdisplaced studentsin the paper). Much less is known about effects on subsequent cohorts of students who would have attended the closed schools had they remained open (referred to asfuture cohortsin the paper). Furthermore, almost all previous studies have focused on the US, and whether their results are generalizable to school systems with nationwide voucher systems, such as the Swedish school system, is unknown.The aim of this article is therefore to investigate the effects of school closures on student achievement among both displaced students and future cohorts in Sweden. The effects are investigated through a quasiexperimental study of all public middle schools that were closed in Sweden in the period 2000–2012 based on registry data. The study utilizes a novel design in the school closure literature that addresses selection problems while simultaneously allowing the study of the effects of closures on future cohorts. The performance of students who graduated from closed Swedish middle schools is compared with the performance of their treated younger siblings who were expected to graduate from the same schools but, as a result of the closures, attended other schools. By including control pairs not affected by closures in the model and sibling order controls as well as cohort yearfixed effects, I then condition out differences in achievement between the treated students and their siblings that are not due to the closures. In effect, the model tests whether the treated students performed significantly better or worse than their older siblings and compares these differentials with those of sibling pairs from nonclosed schools at the time ofgraduation. This method relies on the assumption that the student achievement and school quality differentials between older and younger siblings from the closed schools are the same as those for sibling pairs from nonclosed schools in the absence of a closure. This assumption is tested using preclosure placebo tests, focusing on sibling pairs who graduated from the closed schools before the closures. This quasiexperimental setup increases the possibility of capturing the causal effect of the closures. The study is the first to use this family fixed effects-based identification strategy in the school closure literature, at least in regard to peer-reviewed, published studies.1By studying the effects of school closures also on future cohorts and by studying a country with a nationwide and highly liberal school voucher system, the study contributes to a more comprehensive picture of the consequences of school closures to the school research literature. More specifically, the analyses of both the effects on displaced students and effects on future cohorts facilitate the differentiation of school quality effects from disruption effects and compare the importance of these two mechanisms. The study also contributes to the literature by utilizing detailed registry data on teacher quality for the first time, making it possible to study school quality effects in greater depth. The study is of substantial societal value to policymakers in Western countries since more school closures may be expected in the future as a result of increased urbanization and low birth rates. Furthermore, the closure of low-performing schools is an increasingly common reform strategy among countries facing low academic performance and growinginequalitiesin learning outcomes. These issues are now leading items on the political agenda in European countries such as Sweden.",Jonas,None,None
"1. IntroductionPhilando Castile was stopped by police at least 46 times in 14 years. He paid a heavy economic cost of thousands of dollars in fines and auto repairs, hours spent in court, reduced opportunity from having his driver’s license suspended, and higher insurance costs that may explain why he lost his insurance, which led to additional stops and citations. During yet another routine traffic stop he was killed by an officer who mistakenly thought Castile was reaching for a gun (Peralta and Corley, 2016).Castile’s prior pattern of stops for common offenses such as “impeding traffic,” “not wearing a seat belt,” “failure to slow down,” and “running a stop sign” invites two main conjectures: 1) almost everyone on the road is committing some form of minor infraction for which an officercouldpull them over, and 2) when someone is repeatedly stopped for minor infractions, the real reason may be something other than what is written on his traffic tickets. The question of interest here is whether that reason is his race. Are drivers like Castile profiled by the police? Does “drivers like Castile” mean “drivers of color?” If so, how can we detect “profiling,” and whom do we mean by “the police?”These are the questions this paper addresses. It builds on a growing literature that examines how to detect race-based differences in policing and how to assess the degree of heterogeneity in that regard across individual officers. The first direction in which it advances the literature is with respect to the margin of interest. Instead of focusing on a rare secondary decision within an encounter, such as vehicle searches oruse of force, the paper considers the primary decision to initiate a traffic stop. Consideration of this primary decision is important because it more closely aligns with the general understanding of racial profiling whereby African-Americans experience more frequent interactions with the police. Examining the decision to initiate a traffic stop is also important for a statistical reason: studies of secondary decisions typically take the set of stopped drivers to be random as far as race is concerned. If instead that is a selected sample, as this paper demonstrates, then such assumptions might be called into question.To circumvent the “denominator” problem that one cannot observe which drivers each officer could potentially choose to stop, the paper combines a behavioral theoretical model with alatent classestimation approach to tractably identify heterogeneity among officers. The model compares officers working in the same geographic area and time period to group them based on how frequently they stop black drivers relative to white drivers. Although the theoretical concept of bias ranges across a spectrum, it turns out that average officer behavior is actually explained well by dividing officers into two discrete groups. Across the eight states analyzed, the model consistently estimates that 30–40% of officers fall into the “high frequency” group, which given certain assumptions can be interpreted as the share who exhibit racial bias. Such an interpretation implies that race-influenced policing is fairly prevalent, in contrast with the “rotten apples” theory that attributes the preponderance of such behavior to a small number of outliers.The paper proceeds as follows.Section 2places the current work within the context of the literature. It first reviews the aforementioned denominator problem and methods the racial profiling literature has developed for addressing it. It then details related work that analyzes decision making at the individual officer level.Section 3develops the theoretical model for officer decision making that motivates the empirical analysis and provides a framework for interpretation of the results.Section 4details the finite mixture model used to conduct the estimation.Section 5describes the traffic stop data used in the estimation and presents an empirical descriptive overview.Section 6discusses the main estimation results.Section 7demonstrates the robustness of those results to the various modeling assumptions made. Finally,Section 8concludes the paper and considers the practical implications of the findings.",Scott,None,None
"1. IntroductionPaid family leave (PFL), the program by which parents receive paid time off from work to care for a new child, has been suggested as a policy tool for addressing numerous areas of concern, including lowfertility rates,intergenerational mobility, gender pay disparities, and various health opportunities. Although the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) guarantees 12 weeks of unpaid leave for qualifying parents, the United States does not have a federal paid leave program. The existing research on parental leave policies, paid and unpaid, can be organized into two areas. First, these policies have been shown to affect leave lengths and labor market outcomes of mothers. The result that parental leave expansions lead to mothers taking more time off from work after giving birth may be unsurprising (Han, Ruhm, Waldfogel, 2009,Lalive, Schlosser, Steinhauer, iZweimüller, 2014,Ruhm, 1998,Waldfogel, 1999), but there is also evidence that such policies can increase the labor force attachment and wage growth of mothers (Baum, Ruhm, 2016,Rossin-Slater, Ruhm, Waldfogel, 2013). The second area of research has focused on child outcomes where there is some consensus that parental leave improves short run health outcomes (Rossin, 2011,Ruhm, 2000,Sayour, 2018,Stearns, 2015,Tanaka, 2005), but mixed evidence on longer run outcomes such as education and wages (Baker, Milligan, 2010,Baker, Milligan, 2015,Carneiro, Løken, Salvanes, 2015,Dahl, Løken, Mogstad, Salvanes, 2016,Danzer, Lavy, 2017,Dustmann, Schönberg, 2012,Rasmussen, 2010).1Despite this growing literature on parental leave, an important question appears to have been overlooked: how does the wage replacement benefit of PFL affect household savings? If a family alters their private assets in response to PFL, then the size of the benefit transfer does not represent the total change in resources available to the family during the newborn period. Understanding the size and direction of this response is crucial for evaluating the full impact of PFL and how it compares to other family-friendly policy options.There are multiple economic arguments that are typically made for mandating PFL, many of which relate to potential market failures. First, private employers or insurers may not offer wage insurance due to adverse selection, although paid parental leave by private employers has doubled over the last decade (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2018) and restrictions such as exclusion periods have made private temporary disability insurance (TDI) markets feasible. Second, wage replacement during leave may be welfare-enhancing if families are liquidity constrained and cannot adequately smooth consumption, thereby affecting their decision of how much time to take off from work. In addition to concerns over a recovering mother’s health, prematurely returning to work limits the potential benefits of more consistent breastfeeding (Huang and Yang, 2015) and bonding time during the newborn period. The critical first few months of child development, which can impose long run externalities on society, combined with worries of individual optimization failures (e.g., myopic or misinformed parents) provide additional motivation for programs such as PFL. As is always the case, the economic arguments for mandating PFL, or unpaid leave for that matter, rest on a set of assumptions that may be more or less accurate depending on the family, cultural norms, and surrounding institutions.2Economists have long been interested in how social insurance programs alter incentives to privately save. The welfare gains from risk-pooling may be limited if participants respond by reducing their private actions to avoid, mitigate, or weather adverse events. Understanding how PFL can affect household savings is partially dependent on what type of saving motive dominates. Life-cycle models of saving focus on anticipated changes in earnings and expenses, the impact of social security on private savings serving as the prime policy example. (Browning, Crossley, 2001,Feldstein, 1974,Feldstein, 1977). The life-cycle model predicts that parents plan for reduced earnings after the birth of a child and save accordingly.3Fertility, like consumption and earnings, has a general pattern which makes some degree of planning possible.Precautionary saving, on the other hand, is motivated by uncertainty in future earnings or expenses (Leland, 1968,Sandmo, 1970), arguably making this “buffer stock” of savings more important for liquidity constrained households (Carroll, 1997,Deaton, 1991).4Where life-cycle saving is intended to navigate changes that occur with some degree of certainty, precautionary saving is intended to weather a low-probability, unpredictable event. The precautionary motive may be relevant because, despite modern birth control methods, nearly half of pregnancies in the United States are unintended.5Even so, unique aspects of pregnancy set it apart from other shocks often covered by social insurance programs, including job loss and even other health-related shocks.6It is therefore plausible that the precautionary savings response to the reduction in income-uncertainty provided by PFL would be small and negative.7The life-cycle response to PFL, outlined inSection 3, is less clear. PFL may crowd out private savings but it may also lead to increased savings due to parents planning for longer leave periods. Furthermore, the life-cycle and precautionary motives can co-exist simultaneously (Hubbard et al., 1995), making the net effect of PFL on savings a function of the relative importance of each motive.This paper uses a quasi-experimental research design to measure the impact of California’s PFL program (CA-PFL) on household savings. The Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) collects information on household financial assets held before giving birth, making it possible to estimate the impact of CA-PFL by comparing expectant mothers’ savings across time and states. Additional analysis uses mothers with slightly older children as a comparison group in order to net out California-specific changes which may coincide with the introduction of CA-PFL. The results consistently indicate that CA-PFL reduced savings held before giving birth, though the magnitude of the response is sensitive to specification choice. The sign of the response combined with evidence that CA-PFL induced longer leave periods implies that the crowd out effect is the dominant component of the life-cycle response. A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that an extra dollar of PFL benefits increases available household resources by less than $0.50. Yet even with substantial savings crowd out and a balanced-budget requirement, the net welfare impact of PFL could be positive. There are multiple arguments for PFL and, by focusing on savings, this paper only explores the consumption smoothing argument. The heterogeneity analysis presented in this paper has limited precision due to the small sample size but suggests that the negative response was concentrated in higher-income families. This pattern may be useful for guiding future research related to optimal parental leave policy design, namely the trade-offs between universal and targeted coverage. A key takeaway of this paper is that the unintended consequences present in other social insurance settings should not be overlooked when evaluating PFL.",Luke,None,None
"IntroductionWe study the consequences of job loss for parents, families, and children. Firm start-ups and closures are an integral part of the process of economic growth and restructuring, generating overall gains. Jobs are also lost in economic crises. Workers who lose their jobs pay a price, suffering long-term negative consequences on future employment, earnings, health, and marriage stability.1Because these factors are likely to affect the family environment in which children grow up and parental investments in child human capital, some of the burden of this restructuring process may be transmitted to the children of affected workers. Understanding this transmission is important since childhood human capital development has consequences for childhoodwellbeingand long-run socio-economic status.2While a number of studies show negative effects ofpaternaljob loss on child health, schooling and labour market outcomes, other studies find only limited or negligible effects.3Maternaljob loss has been found to have both positive and negative effects on child human capital.4Our reading of the literature is that findings depend on the outcomes studied, the institutional context, such as access to unemployment insurance and other welfare institutions, which parent is exposed to job loss, and the extent to which maternal job loss implies withdrawal from the labour market and a reallocation of time towards child related activities. Furthermore, the empirical methodology, i.e., how job loss is defined and how well selection is accounted for, can influence and possibly bias results (Page et al., 2009;Hilger, 2016). We have summarized findings, methods and contexts of earlier studies in detail inTable A 1in the Appendix A.The main contribution of this paper is to provide a comprehensive analysis in a unified framework of the consequences of both maternal and paternal job loss due to workplace closures on parents, families and children. We study a broad set of factors that matter for the family environment and for children'shuman capital formationi.e., the economic situation of parents and families, family separations and parental health. We capture the consequences on several aspects of children's human capital by studying effects on health, educational outcomes and outcomes in early adulthood. Our study thus complements the earlier studies of the consequences of job loss for adults and children, which have typically focused on either adults or children and on either health, educational or labour market outcomes, and where a majority of the studies of consequences for children have focused on paternal job loss. It also contributes to the growing literature on how family environments and parents influence the human capital formation of children and young adults, reviewed inFrancesconi and Heckman (2016).Our focus on the Nordic context is of particular relevance since, on the one hand, the financial consequences of job loss may be less severe due to the developed welfare state with generous unemployment insurance,universal health care, high quality childcare free tuition and less dependence on a single breadwinner, but on the other hand, a strong dual-earner norm which together with individual taxation and high marginaltaxrates may put greater stress on displaced mothers to regain employment, thus leading to less reallocation on time towards investments in children, compared to other settings.Page et al. (2019)andSchaller and Zerpa (2019)discuss maternal reallocation of time as a mechanism for positive effects of maternal job loss in the US setting.We use population-wide Swedish administrative data, which has several advantages. A long data panel for the years 1987–2010 makes it possible to follow children's human capital development in childhood and early adulthood and their family environments up to 5 years before and 10 years after a parent's workplace closes. Population, tax and longitudinal labour market registers contain information on family links, earnings, unemployment, disposable income and social assistance receipts, allowing us to assess the consequences of job loss for family financial resources and stability and labour market outcomes in early adulthood. Registers of deaths and hospital discharges are used to analyse the consequences for the health of children and parents, the latter which may affect the home environment and parenting quality. The register-based health measures are objective in the sense that they are a result of a professional assessment by a medical doctor.5Hospitalization discharges capture relatively severe negative health conditions, which are likely to have long-run consequences for children (Currie, 2009). Education registers include both compulsory school GPA and information on high school completion, allowing us to study educational performance at different margins. Matched workplace-employee data are used to identify all workplace closures during the period 1995–2000, avoiding reporting errors and selection problems that are likely when relying on self-reported reasons for job loss.6We can thus study a comparatively large population of families of which some 1.5 percent (130,770) of the children aged 2–18 experience maternal or paternal job loss due to workplace closure.7Following earlier Nordic studies analysing the effects of plant closures (e.g.,Browning et al., 2006;Eliason and Storrie, 2009a,Eliason and Storrie, 2009b), we usepropensity score matchingto account for the non-random selection of workers to closing workplaces. We match on a broad set of conditioning variables, including firm-level characteristics, pre-displacement labour market histories, earnings and education, as well as pre-displacement health outcomes of both children and parents. Access to a long panel of data allows us to estimate pre-treatment effects and assess remaining selection problems. This is of particular importance when it is not possible to match on pre-displacement outcomes like is the case for outcomes that are only observed once, e.g. high school completion (Hilger, 2016).Similar to earlier studies, including those in Sweden and other Nordic countries, we find that job loss leads to lower future earnings and higher unemployment rates for both mothers and fathers and that these effects are persistent for at least 10 years. The effects on disposable income are, however, much smaller than those found in US studies. Yet, we find somewhat larger and more persistent negative effects on household disposable income of paternal job loss than of maternal job loss. Family separations, however, increase when mothers experience job loss. Our analysis of parental health outcomes shows increased mortality for displaced fathers and increased hospitalizations due to alcohol-related diagnoses for displaced mothers. Parental job loss thus negatively affects several important aspects of the childhood environment, with possible consequences for parenting quality, childhood resources and human capital formation.Despite these negative effects on the family environment, our main finding is that job loss has limited effects on child outcomes. Parental job loss does not increase the likelihood of child hospitalization over a ten-year follow-up period. When studying educational and early adulthood outcomes, we find small negative effects of maternal job loss but no indications of effects of paternal job loss.These findings are at odds with the earlier evidence on job loss on child health and schooling outcomes, but in line with some of the previous findings in early adulthood. Despite large sample sizes, we do not find negative effects of paternal job loss. Nor do we find positive effects of maternal job loss, instead we find small negative effects. Limited effects on disposable income suggest that welfare state institutions are able to insure families against negative income shocks. We show that low income families are more severely affected by job loss in terms of earnings and unemployment, but that the effects on disposable income are similar or of smaller magnitude compared to other families. A strong dual-earner norm also insures against the loss of one income and works against finding positive effects of maternal job loss by limiting the reallocation of time toward parenting. We find that mothers regain employment to the same extent as fathers. In addition, welfare state services provided to all children, regardless of parental employment and income are likely to shield children from the negative consequences of parental job loss.8The rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, we provide a short description of the Swedish institutional setting. Thereafter, we present the data and empirical strategy. Next, we present the results and explore some mechanisms before we summarize and discuss our findings.",Eva,Anna,Helena
"1. IntroductionSince the first definition in 1973, the concepts of informal sector and informal economy have been a research concern inlabour economics(Hart, 1973). However, only in the late 1980s these concepts took central stage in the debate around policymaking. The renewed attention to the informal economy led policymakers to implement policies that aim at tackling the two main components of the informal economy, i.e. informal employment and informal firms. Governments and policymakers started including the informal economy in their agenda culminating in the explicit inclusion of informal economy and work as part of theSustainable Development Goals. To date, there is a large variety of policies and interventions targeting the informal economy. The most common approach in policymaking is formalization (Williams and Round, 2007). Formalization policies range from improving access to credit to providing training and other business development services to informal business. Other interventions aim at strengthening the linkages between informal and formal economy.Formalization is considered to have a positive effect on economic growth, employment creation, labour productivity, labour conditions, and social protection (International Labour Organization, 2015;Tijdens et al., 2015;Gatti et al., 2014,Fajnzylber et al., 2011). In contrast, informal economy is associated with low quality institutions (Loyaza et al., 2005). Informal enterprises are perceived as deleterious for the economy since they often underreport employment, avoidtaxes, threaten formal firms by bypassing costs of regulation and infringing copyrights (Schneider et al., 2011; Farrell 2008 and2004;Baily et al., 2006;USAID, 2005). Consequently, formalizing informal firms is considered a strategic step necessary to unlock potential economic growth, increase competitiveness, create jobs and government revenues from taxation.Governments and policymakers promote formalization through various interventions ranging from the simplification of registration procedures to increased law enforcement. These interventions can be categorized into three main policy approaches: (i) cutting costs and simplifying procedures, (ii) increasing benefits, and (iii) increasing the level of enforcement and visits by officers. In addition, some interventions are accompanied by information and awareness campaigns.Notwithstanding the manifold efforts by policymakers to formalize the informal economy, there is still a knowledge gap concerning systematic evidence about the effects of these formalization interventions. Little is known concerning firm responses to formalization policies and interventions and the literature presents contrasting evidence about their success. While meta-regression analysis (MRA) has been applied in various fields in economics, for instance in labour economics (Grimm and Paffhausen, 2015;Cho and Honorati, 2014;Doucouliagos and Laroche, 2009),international economics(Demena and Bergeijk, 2017;Demena, 2015;Iršová and Havránek, 2013) and development economics (Havránek et al., 2016; Askarov and Doucouliagos, 2005), there is no meta-analysis covering the outcomes of private sector policies on the formalization of firms. There are two reviews focusing on policies that promote formalization (Grimm and Paffhausen, 2015;Bruhn and Mc Kenzie, 2014).Bruhn and McKenzie (2014)reviewed evidence about the effect of entry reforms on firms’ formalization selecting nine primary studies without imposing a systematic literature search and not carrying out a meta-analysis. The authors showed that based on their selection of studies there is only a modest increase in formalization. They suggest that increased enforcement efforts could result in higher formalization rates and that there might be a fiscal benefit to formalizing large informal firms. The second study provides asystematic reviewthat analyses the outcomes of private sector interventions on employment generation without an exclusive focus on informality (Grimm and Paffhausen, 2015); the part of the review that zooms in on the link between formalization and employment creation includes five studies about interventions that promote formalization. Our focus is not on formalization and employment generation as in the study byGrimm and Paffhausen (2015), but on formalization of previously informal operations as inBruhn and McKenzie (2014). Compared toBruhn and McKenzie (2014), the paper at hand expands in terms of scope and rigor of the analysis. Our study rigorously synthesizes and systematizes the existing literature adding the most recent primary studies to the analysis. The evidence base has considerably broadened since the review byBruhn and Mc Kenzie (2014), not least as a consequence of the limited impact reported by previous studies. Furthermore, our study contrasts the main theoretical views on informality to assess whether the theories are empirically relevant and the employed meta-regression analysis techniques allow us to give a quantitative appraisal of the policies promoting formalization (Stanley and Doucouliagos, 2012). Additionally, we exploit the heterogeneity of the existing primary studies to assess the extent to which the impact of a considered formalization policy varies depending on the chosen formality indicator, the estimation method adopted, the characteristics of the population benefitting from the intervention, country differences, and other potential sources of bias. Unlike the existing qualitative reviews, our meta-analysis enables us to estimate the underlying impact of interventions on formalization after quantitatively accounting for study heterogeneities and potential publication bias. With the meta-regression analysis, we can rigorously disentangle the factors driving the reported impacts. To that end, we include all accessible studies available until June 2019. Our analysis rests on 842 estimates (representing the population of our analysis) from 27econometricstudies conducted by 49 researchers.We jointly meta-analyse the impact of (i) costs reducing, (ii) benefit increasing, and (iii) enforcement increasing interventions that promote the formalization of informal firms. We consider it high time to produce systematic evidence across interventions to guide policymakers towards the most effective policies.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.Section 2contains a review of the literature and a brief introduction to the main theories about informality.Section 3explains the data and empirical approach.

"1. IntroductionThe global economic downturn due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is projected to be worse than theGreat Recession, has reignited a discussion on the aftermath of a deep recession on first-time labor market entrants. Despite well-documented evidence on the substantial loss of income among recession graduates, little is known about how this labor market shock will extend to other aspects of personal welfare, such as family formation and financial decisions. Research shows that the earnings penalty disappears after about 10 years for a typical college graduate, but it is unclear whether this catch-up would also occur outside the labor market. In addition, since most previous research has focused on modest recessions and regular business cycles, the consequences of a large-scale recession have not been fully explored. Evidence from the Great Recession suggests that the disadvantages of graduating during this severe economic downturn may have been more serious than earlier recessions in the 1970s–2000s; however, because this major event occurred only about a decade ago, the scope of research has been limited to short- and medium-term labor market outcomes.1This study examines the long-term consequences of labor market entry during a deep recession on career trajectory, family formation, and householdfinances, by studying the 1997–1998 Asian financial crisis, which created a historic economic meltdown in much of East and Southeast Asia. In particular, we focus on South Korea, which was unexpectedly hit by the financial crisis in the last quarter of 1997 and experienced the worst economic contraction since the 1950–1953 Korean War. Themacroeconomicindicators inFig. 1show that the South Korean economy deteriorated rapidly within a few months from the onset of the crisis. The real GDP growth rate plummeted from 4.4% in the fourth quarter of 1997 to −3.4% in the first quarter of 1998, and further to −7.3% in the second quarter of 1998. The unemployment rate more than doubled from 2.7% to 6.1% between November 1997 and February 1998. The economy started to pick up from the first quarter of 1999, and it took about three years until full recovery.Download :Download high-res image (365KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. Macroeconomic statistics.Notes.Monthly unemployment rates are from Statistics Korea. Quarterly real GDP growth rate is from the Bank of Korea, and measures the growth rate compared to the same quarter of the previous year.We use data from the Korean Labor and Income Panel Study (KLIPS), an annuallongitudinal studyof a representative sample of South Korean households (and individuals therein) in urban areas. Pooling the first 20 waves of the KLIPS spanning the period from 1998 to 2017, we construct our analysis sample of men and women who graduated from college between 1989 and 2010. We analyze a comprehensive set of outcomes regarding work, family, household finances, and living arrangements. By tracking the crisis cohorts and their luckier counterparts up to their mid-40s, we can focus on longer-term outcomes beyond early career status. In particular, as more than 20 years have lapsed since the Asian financial crisis, we can distinguish permanent changes from temporary adjustments in marriage, fertility, and asset building.We estimate a regression model exploiting across-cohort variation in the national unemployment rate at collegegraduation. Due to the unexpected timing and the historically large magnitude of the shock, the Asian financial crisis induced sharp deviations of the unemployment rate from its smooth national trend, as shown inFig. 1. As the main source of identification, we focus on nation-wide variation in the unemployment rate rather than region-specific changes because of the almost parallel movement ofregional unemploymentrates in South Korea. Accordingly, we use a polynomial function of graduation year instead of cohortfixed effectsto control for a national cohort trend. The key assumption is that the temporal variation in the unemployment rate at labor market entry is not systematically related to background characteristics of each graduation cohort once the smooth trend is removed. This assumption would be violated if individuals endogenously select the timing of college graduation. To address this concern, we conduct balance checks on background characteristics andinstrumental variablesregressions using the predicted year of graduation. These exercises confirm that our recession effect estimates are unlikely to be driven by selection. We also show that the estimates are robust to using alternative measures of unemployment conditions, various specifications of the cohort trend, and different sample restrictions.Our results show that adverseeconomic conditionsat graduation have far-reaching consequences beyond the labor market dimension. In addition, the effects of a recession are heterogeneous by gender, because men and women face different choice sets and constraints when making decisions related to work, family, and household finances. We find that male recession cohorts experience a large and persistent reduction in employment and earnings for up to 12 years after graduation. A 1 percentage point higher unemployment rate at graduation results in a 1.9% lower employment probability and 2.5% lower earnings during the first 10 years of potential experience. This deterioration in career outcomes leads to a permanent decline in the marriage and childbearing rates. While consumption is insulated from reduced earnings, men who graduate during a recession hold lower levels of financial assets, are less likely to be homeowners, and are more likely to live with parents.For women, the recession penalty in the labor market is more subtle than that for men, because even those graduating in a good economy have weak labor force attachment owing to family considerations. Female recession cohorts suffer from sizable reductions in employment and earnings immediately after graduation, but the negative recession effect disappears within 2 years. The limited job opportunities in their early career lead to accelerated childbirth and higher fertility. While there is a delay in financial asset building, it is not as substantial as that of their male counterparts. As a coping mechanism, female recession cohorts tend to find a spouse from a more advantaged economic background, as opposed to remaining unmarried or living with parents.This study is related to three strands of literature. First, a large body of literature seeks to identify labor market penalties for young workers who graduate in adverse economic conditions (e.g.,Kahn, 2010,Oreopoulos, von Wachter, Heisz, 2012).2The consequences of such adverse conditions are known as the “scarring effect,” owing to the long-lasting damage on the careers of affected individuals. We add to the literature on scarring effects by showing that a large-scale recession leads to a substantially large and persistent reduction in employment probability especially among male college graduates.Altonji et al. (2016)andRothstein (2020)also observe a large decline in employment among college graduates affected by the Great Recession. However, the extensive margin effect on earnings is mostly absent from high-skilled labor in other studies, which focus on more modest variations in regular business cycles. In addition, this study is one of very few works that analyzes men and women separately. We show that the effect of initial labor market conditions on career outcomes lasts much longer for men than that for women, in line withKondo (2015)andSchwandt and von Wachter (2020).Second, we add to a small but growing literature on the long-term effects of initial labor market conditions on family formation. Prior results are mixed in terms of the sign and magnitude of the effect (Currie, Schwandt, 2014,Hashimoto, Kondo, 2012,Hershbein, 2012,Hofmann, Hohmeyer, 2016,Kondo, 2012,Maclean, Covington, Sikora Kessler, 2016,Schwandt, von Wachter, 2020). Our study contributes to the literature by showing that reduced labor market opportunities early in a career can lead to a permanent change in marriage probability and fertility, especially in the case of a large-scale recession. Furthermore, we find that labor market entry conditions may affect women’s choice of spouse. This result fills a gap in the literature, where previous studies have noted a sizable response in fertility, despite the short-lived reduction in own earnings among female recession cohorts (Kondo, 2015,Maclean, Covington, Sikora Kessler, 2016,Schwandt, von Wachter, 2020).Lastly, our results on the financial outcomes of scarred cohorts are closely related toKawaguchi and Kondo (2020), the only existing study, to our knowledge, on the effects of labor market entry conditions on asset holdings and living arrangements.3Kawaguchi and Kondo (2020)suggest that migration of recession graduates to areas with low cost-of-living limits the effect of initial labor market conditions on family net worth. We show that recession graduates’ asset accumulation is substantially delayed in our case, in which such a migration pattern is absent. Our result complements evidence in the unemployment insurance and the development literature that asset holdings buffer consumption decline when a negative income shock occurs (e.g.,Fafchamps, Udry, Czukas, 1998,Frankenberg, Smith, Thomas, 2003,Ganong, Noel, 2019,Kolsrud, Landais, Nilsson, Spinnewijn, 2018,Rosenzweig, Wolpin, 1993). In addition, we provide evidence that recession cohorts also rely on parents or spouses to protect their living conditions against the initial negative shock.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.Section 2presents an overview of the 1997–1998 Asian financial crisis and its impacts on the South Korean economy.Section 3describes the KLIPS data and the analysis sample.Section 4explains the empirical strategy used to measure the recession effects and examines the internal validity of the identification assumption.Section 5presents the estimation results on labor market, family, and financial outcomes.Section 6discusses the mechanisms and implications of our findings.Section 7concludes.",Eleanor,Jaewoo,Hyelim
"1. IntroductionEmployee referrals are a common source of recruitment – employees within a firm recommend workers for a job in the firm. Indeed, 50% of workers report having obtained their jobs via referral by a friend or family member (Topa, 2011). Many firms have started formal employee referral programmes (ERP).2LinkedIn now provides a tool to improve these ERPs for firms. But why does such referral based recruitment take place in preference to anonymousadvertisementbased search?The literature has differentiated between four ways in which employee referrals can help employers: (1) Reducing the cost of search; (2) Screening for productive employees (e.g.Beaman and Magruder (2012);Fafchamps and Moradi (2015);Montgomery (1991)); (3) Improving match quality (e.g.Burks et al. (2015);Simon and Warner (1992)); (4) Reducing moral hazard on the job (e.g.Dhillon et al. (2019);Heath (2018);Kugler (2003)). While reason (1) may not necessarily lead to hiring more productive employees, theoretically at least, reasons (2)–(4) imply that referred workers will be more productive. Empirically, however, the literature is still divided on whether (a) referred workers are more productive and (b) what is the channel by which this happens if so.3Among some important factors, the type of job (e.g. ability vs. effort, the employer ’s cost from worker opportunism) and incentives of the referring employee (see e.g.Dhillon et al. (2019)) seem to be driving a lot of the differences in results.We contribute to this literature by using a laboratory experiment to show that worker moral hazard can be mitigated by referrals (reason (4)) in a setting of jobs whichpay lowfixed wages, where the costs of providing financial incentives are too high, and workers cannot be disciplined by the threat of firing. Among the various channels for mitigating moral hazard discussed in the literature – better monitoring of workers who are referred (Kugler, 2003) or referrers acting as guarantors for their referred worker (Heath, 2018) – we focus onsocial preferencesof the worker towards the referrer as inDhillon et al. (2019). We build on the key ideas inDhillon et al. (2019)) that the social proximity of the worker towards her referrer helps to solve worker moral hazard problems facing the employer. We design an experiment that is specifically designed to measure the effect of social proximity between referred worker and referring worker on effort provision while using the framing of the workplace. In our controlled setting, we can rule out other reasons for employers to choose referral than worker moral hazard.The key feature in our experiment is that the referring (referred) worker does not know (by name)whois being referred (referring) but does know whether they are (real) friends on Facebook and also knows the number of common friends. This rules out any possibility of screening for productivity as the referring worker does not see the person he is referring. Assuming that the group of friends is large enough, as is the case with undergraduate students in general, it would be difficult to infer which friend is being referred.4In observational studies, to the contrary, it is harder to sift screening from moral hazard – any task involves some dimension of ability or intrinsic motivation/reliability that referrers may screen on.5Our experimental design rules out other possible reasons for referrals – e.g. screening as discussed above, match quality – we do not allow communication between referrers and potential workers or reducing the cost of search – the employer is presented with a choice between two workers or the use of an employee to hire a worker. Moreover, in observational studies, only the productivity of workers who are hired is observed, so if employers incorporate the (unobserved) information on workers contained in referrals, they may have higher standards for hiring non-referred workers. This may imply that there is no significant difference in the productivity of referred vs. non-referred workers in the firm. In our experimental setting, first workers in the spot market are chosen randomly, and second, there is no hidden information on productivity of workers available to referrers, due to the anonymous design.According to our theoretical framework, referrals reduce worker moral hazard through ‘directed’ altruism’ (Leider et al., 2009). Referred workers will expend more effort when a friend refers them, and when the friend stands to lose if the worker does not perform, relative to being hired anonymously or relative to a referral from a stranger. Our experiment tests whether directedaltruismcan explain higher effort in a workplace framing.6Our main results are that referrals can significantly reduce moral hazard. Our setting captures certain types of jobs, such as low skill jobs at minimum wages, mostly done by temporary migrant labour where the threat of firing is not sufficient to induce the worker to work hard as in garment factories in developing countries7, or jobs where ability is easily tested but the wages required to prevent opportunistic behaviour would be prohibitively high due to problems of contract enforcement or limited liability as in the case of diamond merchants.8In such situations it is well known thatsocial networkscan take on the task of informal contract enforcement (Chandrasekhar et al., 2018). However, when the worker has directed altruism towards the referrer, then the employer can exploit these social preferences to induce worker effort. The employer designs a contract which conditions referrer rewards/punishments to the referrer on worker effort. Such a contract is cheaper for the employer (but worse for the referrer) when the worker is highly altruistic towards the referrer, as in that case, the employer needs to commit to pay less in monetary terms to the referrer. The twist is that the referrer hasprivate informationon the degree of social proximity of the worker. The referrer will therefore have incentives to choose a worker who has lower social proximity. However, when the referrer has a high degree of altruism towards the worker, the non-monetary incentives to hire a socially proximate worker dominate any monetary incentives and incentives are aligned with the employer. Under these conditions, referrers will choose socially proximate workers and such workers will put in higher effort. Our experiment therefore validates the observational studies on the use of referrals to curb moral hazard, and contributes by showing a specific mechanism, i.e. social proximity of workers towards referrers.There are several novel features of our experimental design. First, we use thesocial relationshipsbetween participants as they are in real-life, thereby incorporating a feature that is typical to field experiments.9Our experiment can be considered in between a conventional lab experiment and a framed field experiment as it incorporates field context information with a standard subject pool of students (seeHarrison and List (2004)). Second, the use of Facebook information allows us to separate out the effects of knowing other things about the worker than just the social proximity: referrers cannot distinguish between two workers except on the basis of social proximity. This together with the fact that the task of returning money does not require much by way of ability rules out the role of other characteristics like ability of the worker. Finally, we have one-shot anonymous interactions between players, ruling out repeat interactions rather than social preferences as a possible channel for higher returns to referrers relative to the spot market.",Amrita,Ronald,Oliver
"1. IntroductionThe total number of international migrants in the world reached 272 million in 2019 (3.4% of the global population), an increase of 51 million since 2010. About half of the migrants reside in just 10 countries, and one third of them come from only 10 countries of origin. The United States alone host almost 19% percent of the total migrant population (roughly 51 million individuals in 2019), and the Mexico-U.S. corridor – with nearly 12 million Mexican migrants residing in the U.S. – is the largest one in the world. The number of immigrants residing in Europe is about 82 million, approximately 30% of the world migrant population, with the majority of them (about 50 million) living in the EU14+UK area (seeUnited Nations, 2019). While declining fertility in Mexico and other Latin American countries, coupled with a relative improvement in their political and economic situation, is expected to gradually ease the migratory pressure towards the United States, the opposite is true for European countries, which are closely exposed to countries in Africa and the Middle East, which still display high levels of both fertility and instability (Hanson and McIntosh, 2016).These expected upward trends in international migration clash with widespread hostility towards further increases of the immigrant population in major receiving countries (Pew Research Centre, 2018). Not only citizens in host societies systematically exaggerate the share of foreign-born individuals among the total resident population, but they also tend to underestimate migrants’ educational levels and socio-economic integration, while amplifying their cultural and religious differences (Alesina, Miano, and Stancheva, 2019). These biased perceptions suggests that providing more accurate information may possibly reduce hostility towards migrants (Grigorieff, Roth, and Ubfal, 2020). These tensions are at the very core of the present migration policy-making.Receiving countries typically aim at regulating migrant flows through their migration policies. They intend to control both the size of the inflow and its characteristics, trying to select the best talents as well as catering to the needs of their labour markets. In recent years, an increasing number of countries (e.g. Canada, Australia, the U.S., and the U.K.) have implemented selective policies, whichseek to encourage immigration of specific workers, mostly highly qualified, to cover the high demand of specialists in certain occupations, which is driven by skill-biased technological change. The outcome of these selective policies – and their overall effectiveness in screening migrants– crucially depends on their design and on their interplay with the spontaneous selection of individuals into migration from origin countries.Migration flows are also driven by supply shifts. Phenomena like refugee and undocumented migrations emphasize that migratory movements can happen despite the efforts of destination countries to influence them through their migration policies. Between 2015 and 2016, for instance, Europe experienced a “refugee crisis”, with hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, and other countries, reaching European countries to seek humanitarian protection from political persecution, war, and violence. As a result, a number of European countries have experienced yearly increases of their immigrant shares in the range of one percentage point. The ongoing refugee crisis in Venezuela, with over 5.2 million Venezuelan citizens having fled to neighbouring countries, has further contributed to the increase of the global population of forcibly displaced people, which reached a record number of 79.5 million in 2019. Undocumented migration is also a sizeable phenomenon, with the most recent estimates pointing at 4-5 million undocumented immigrants living in Europe (12-16% of the total Extra-EU immigrant population) and 10.5 million in the U.S. (23% of the foreign born population) (Pew Research Centre, 2019a,Pew Research Centre 2019b). Overall, the sizeable increases in economic and refugee migrants over the past decade seem to have generated a rise in xenophobic movements and nationalism around the world. These movements have been fuelled by aggressive political campaigns – such as those that led to the Brexit referendum in the UK or to the election of Donald Trump to the Presidency of the U.S. – that openly appealed to anti-immigration sentiments.These facts highlight the importance of having a good understanding of the causes and consequences of international migration, and of the effects of different migration policies. A large literature has analysed many of these issues (seeHanson, 2009;Kerr and Kerr, 2011;Nathan, 2014;Dustmann, Schönberg, and Stuhler, 2016;Peri, 2016; andBlau and Hunt, 2019for recent surveys). In many instances, however, the literature has failed to reach a clear consensus. The contradicting nature of many of the findings in these studies reflects the intrinsic difficulties in implementing rigorous evaluations of the impact of migration. The main difficulties reside in the aggregate nature of migrant shocks, which prevents a straightforward identification of affected and unaffected individuals, and in the endogenous selection of migrants into countries, regions, sectors, etc., which complicates the estimation of their causal impact on receiving societies. Economists have tried to overcome these difficulties by implementing a large variety of approaches, ranging from natural experiments and instrumental variables to structural models. While allowing to gain a better understanding of the phenomenon, the heterogeneity in approaches has also raised issues of comparability of alternative findings. The literature on the economics of migration is rich and booming, but it is not settled yet. There are still important advances to be made and this Special Issue illustrates some of them.The Special Issue includes thirteen articles that tackle some of the most important topics in this literature. They analyse different countries, environments and episodes, using a wide variety of methods and providing novel answers to many policy-relevant questions. The first set of papers provides new evidence on migrant selection. The following group of articles delves into the core literature of the labour market impacts of immigration, with a particular focus on high-skilled immigration and selective immigration policies. A final group of papers deals with more specific - and often controversial – topics such as refugee migration, undocumented migration, and the political consequences of migrant flows. In this introduction, we first provide a summary of the different articles and of their findings in a unified context (Section 2), and we then highlight what, in our view, are the most important takeaways for migration policy (Section 3).",Francesco,Joan,Cristina
"1. IntroductionDecomposition analyses beyond pure comparison of means have become increasingly popular in applied economic research (for an overview, seeFortin et al. (2011)). One particularly popular approach proposed byMachado and Mata (2005)andMelly (2005)uses conditionalquantile regressionto estimate marginal wage distributions for different counterfactual scenarios. Building on the control function approach ofBuchinsky, 1998,Buchinsky, 2001, this technique was extended byAlbrecht et al. (2009)to account for selection on unobservables. An important application of theAlbrecht et al. (2009)method is the gender wage gap for which a number of authors have assessed the impact of female selection into the labor market (e.g.,Albrecht et al., 2009,Chzhen and Mumford, 2011).1However, the use of this method has been called into question byHuber and Melly (2015)who pointed to the fact thatBuchinsky’s (Buchinsky, 1998,Buchinsky, 2001) control function approach is only valid if regressors and error terms are independent conditional on selection probabilities. This rules out heterogenous slope coefficients, which are often the motivation for using quantile regression approaches. Based on this idea,Huber and Melly (2015)develop a test of the conditional independence assumption which should be carried out before applyingBuchinsky(Buchinsky, 1998,Buchinsky, 2001) selection corrections. If theHuber and Melly (2015)test passes, then the results of an analysis as inAlbrecht et al. (2009)can be trusted. If the test rejects, however, users of this method are in the uncomfortable position of applying a method whose assumptions are likely to be violated.The aim of this paper is to propose a monotonic transformation of the original quantile regression model aimed at eliminating a violation of the conditional independence assumption.2For this transformation, we draw onChen and Khan (2003)who used a similar transformation for the analysis of asample selectionmodel for the mean in the presence of heteroscedasticity. Our approach can be seen as a way to eliminate conditional heteroscedasticity which results in heterogeneous slope coefficients. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that such a transformation may be successful in arriving at a model in which conditional independence holds and theHuber and Melly (2015)test passes. Our application of this approach to the gender wage gap in Germany provides a real data case in which the Huber/Melly test passes in the transformed model but rejects in the untransformed model.3This paper makes two contributions. First, we offer users of theAlbrecht et al. (2009)method a way to circumvent theHuber and Melly (2015)critique. Second, we present new results on the gender wage gap in Germany taking into account selection on unobservables. AsAlbrecht et al. (2009)for the Netherlands andChzhen and Mumford, 2011for the UK, we find positive selection on unobservables leading to an underestimation of the gender gap. Our results also suggest that this underestimation may be more pronounced compared to using an untransformed model that is susceptible to theHuber and Melly (2015)critique.The rest of the paper is structured as follows.Section 2discusses the related literature.Section 3describes the data used in our empirical analysis, which were taken from the German Socio-Economic Panel.

"1. IntroductionFirms are heterogeneous in the distributions of the wages they offer and they compete to hire workers. In the same labour market, we observe variations in average wages and wage dispersion across firms. Such heterogeneity is accounted for only partially by the human capital composition of a firm's workforce. The conditional (on a worker's observable characteristics) component of average wages and within-firm wage dispersion has been extensively investigated empirically as well as theoretically. Market imperfections are called upon to explain it. Search frictions account for the wage dispersion across workers, meaning that otherwise identical workers receive different wages in identical firms (e.g.Mortensen, 1990;Burdett and Mortensen, 1998). Job mobility, inter-firm competition, and human capital accumulation all generate heterogeneity in within-firm wage dispersion (Postel-Visnay and Robin, 2002;Burdett et al., 2011).Theories ofknowledge spilloversrely on inter-firm worker mobility as the mechanism facilitating the knowledge flows between firms (Song et al., 2003;Stoyanov and Zubanov, 2012; Parotta and Pozzoli, 2012;Serafinelli, 2019). In this study, we highlight knowledge transfer as specific channel through whichlabour mobilityaffects conditional within-firm wage dispersion and offer new empirical evidence consistent with this channel. Specifically, we present a model in which knowledge is an essential input of production and a by-product of production activity at the same time. Knowledge as a by-product of production activity is rarely codified. It takes the form of tacit knowledge: information and best-practices that workers acquire on the job and they can take to any new job within the firm or any new firm they join. It follows that firms hiring workers from other firms can access knowledge otherwise not available. This induces firms to pursue a strategy of learning-by-hiring. Moreover, combining tacit knowledge from a variety of sources, firms can improve their productivity (Vilalta-Bufi, 2010). This provides firms with an incentive to hire workers from a wide array of other firms.However, firms have different abilities to take advantage of the tacit knowledge carried by workers trained by other firms.Cohen and Levinthal (1989, 1990) refer to the latter as a firm's absorptive capacity. We assume firms differ in the complexity of the tacit knowledge they produce and model absorptive capacity as their ability to use tacit knowledge of increasing complexity. The more complex is the knowledge a firm can digest, the greater is the number of firms from which it can hire workers. This in turn improves its absorptive capacity, asprior knowledgefavours the assimilation of new knowledge (Cohen and Levinthal, 1989, 1990). In brief, the adoption of learning-by-hiring policies generates worker flows that connect the firms in a network. Connecting to a greater number of other firms, those firms able to digest complex knowledge are central to the network and thus experience enhanced absorptive capacity. As long as workers carrying complex tacit knowledge command higher wages, firms central to the network also have the highest wage dispersion.Using employer–employee matched data from a highly industrialized Italian region, we find a positive correlation between conditional within-firm wage dispersion and a firm's position in the network. Our data provide us with an individual worker's employment history and thus information about the worker flows connecting firms. To take advantage of the information in our data, we apply network theory. We map the worker flows between firms and build the network formed by these firms. For each firm, we then assess its network centrality, a measure based on the idea that a firm hiring workers from a greater number of firms obtains more knowledge and thus is located in a more central position than others. Acquiring more knowledge, the firm develops better absorptive capacity. Thus, the firm's position in the network is informative of its absorptive capacity. In our data, conditional within-firm wage dispersion turns out to be increasing in network centrality. That is, the more central is a firm in the network, the more absorptive capacity it develops and the greater is its conditional wage dispersion.The contribution of our study to the literature is twofold. First, we contribute to the literature on wage dispersion, providing evidence of the conditional within-firm wage dispersion in a market at almost full employment and explaining it by the role played by workers as carriers of tacit knowledge. Second, we contribute to the literature on knowledge transfer, which usually identifies knowledge carriers by means of the wage premium firms pay to attract them (Parrotta and Pozzoli, 2012). We endogenize the wage premium and relate this to a firm's absorptive capacity, finding in the data a correlation between that and within-firm wage dispersion.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. InSection 2, we review the literature. InSection 3, we present the model. InSection 4, we introduce the dataset and present the measure of network centrality. InSection 5, we present our empirical strategy and discuss the results.Section 6concludes.",Ambra,Piergiovanna,None
"1. IntroductionThere have been substantial changes in the structure of employment over recent decades in most developed countries. Most economies are undergoing structural change, whereby labor reallocates across sectors, while at the occupational level labor markets have been polarizing, with employment shifting out of middle-earning routine jobs to low-earning manual and high-earning abstract jobs. There is a wide consensus in the literature that one of the main drivers of each of these patterns separately is biased technological change. Technological change biased across sectors is a key mechanism for structural change, technological change biased across production factors (occupations/tasks) is a prominent explanation for job polarization.1The benefits of such non-neutral technological progress are not equally distributed, with some workers displaced or their skills becoming less valuable in the labor market. These distributional impacts have generated an interest in policies to counteract the adverse effects of technological change. To devise and implement such policies, the biases of technological change and their implications for the labor market needs to be understood.Fig. 1shows that the evolution of sectoral and of occupational employment shares are closely connected. Virtually all of the decline in the goods-producing sector’s employment share is due to a decline in routine employment in this sector. Conversely, most of the increase in high-skilled service employment is a rise in employment in abstract occupations in that sector.2Because of this tight connection between employment reallocations across sectors and across occupations, models that do well in matching sectoral outcomes do also quite well in replicating certain aspects of occupational outcomes, and vice versa. However, this also poses a challenge for establishing what the true drivers of these phenomena are; is it technological change biased across industrial sectors or across tasks/occupations? Sector-specific technological change can reflect, for example,product innovations, and occupation-specific technological change can capture innovations in processes, i.e. in how tasks are completed. We believe that the technology used by workers depends on both their sector and their occupation. Hence we allow for technologies to evolve at the sector-and-occupation level.3Next we identify patterns common to sectors and to occupations. With this at hand we can study which type of technological biases are responsible for the observed changes in market outcomes. We view our model as an important and useful first step towards evaluating policies responding to the rapid changes in the labor market.Download :Download high-res image (386KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1.Sector-occupation hours worked shares 1960–2017. Notes: The data is taken from IPUMS US Census data for 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000 and the AmericanCommunitySurvey (ACS) for 2010 and 2017. For three broad sectors, low-skilled services (L), goods (G) and high-skilled services (H) and three occupational categories (manual, routine, abstract), this figure plots the evolution of the share of hours supplied in sector-occupation cells, as well as in sectors in the US between 1960 and 2017. The dark grey lines show the share of hours supplied in each sector, which are broken down into occupations within the sector in each panel. SeeAppendix A.1for the classification of occupations and industries.In this paper we shed light on the types of technological change that drive the observed changes in (labor) market outcomes, without imposing any restrictions a priori on how technological change is biased. Specifically, we take a simplified version of the model in our previous work,Bárány and Siegel (2020), and use the same methodology as there to identify technologies. As in that paper, we decompose the changes in these technologies into occupation- and sector-specific components using a factor model. The novelty of this paper is that we study the contribution of these components to labor market outcomes. To do this, we specify ageneral equilibriummodel, where individuals’occupational choiceand the demand for sectoral output responds endogenously to changing technologies. We use this general equilibrium model to quantify the role of the various components via counterfactual simulations in the re-allocation of employment across sectors and occupations, as well as in the evolution of occupational wages and of sectoral prices.We assume aCES production functionin manual, routine, and abstract labor in each sector. This is a simplified version of the sectoral production function we use inBárány and Siegel (2020). As in that paper, we draw on key equations of the production side of the model together with data from the US Census and from theU.S. Bureau of Economic Analysisbetween 1960 and 2017 to extract sector-and-occupation specific technologies. We decompose the changes in the inferred sector-occupation cell technologies using a factor model into neutral, sector- and occupation-specific components.4We find that these components jointly explain around 90 percent of the variation in cell technology growth. We then construct the following counterfactual cell technology series: a sector-only path where technology is allowed to be biased only across sectors, an occupation-only path allowing for a bias only across occupations, and a neutral technology path that shuts down all biases of technological change. This approach is more rigorous than calibrating sector- and occupation-specific growth rates, as those would depend on the normalizations implemented.5The goal of this paper is to evaluate the role of neutral, sector- and occupation-specific components of technological change in labor market outcomes. In order to conduct counterfactual exercises we specify a general equilibrium model. We assume that a representative household chooses sectoral consumption in order to maximize a non-homothetic CES utility and that individuals optimally choose their occupation subject to idiosyncratic entry costs. We feed the counterfactual technology paths into the model to determine how important each component of technological change is in explaining various outcomes of interest. We find that qualitatively all counterfactual technology series generate employment and wage paths in line with the data. Quantitatively however, the occupation-specific component is needed to get close to the data. To explain the evolution of sectoral prices, all components are needed. For occupational income shares within sectors and employment shares at the cell level, the neutral and the sector-specific component have almost no effect, whereas the technology component idiosyncratic to the sector-occupation cell has a significant role.There are many papers on the impact of technological change biased across tasks (occupations) or across sectors, but there is no consensus in the literature about the true nature of technological biases, potentially due to the trends shown inFig. 1. InBárány and Siegel (2018)we show that differences in productivity growth across sectors lead to polarization of wages and employment at the sectoral level, which in turn imply polarization in occupational outcomes because of differences in occupation intensities across sectors.Goos et al. (2014)argue conversely that differences in productivity growth across occupations together with differences in occupation intensity across sectors can lead to employment reallocation across sectors. In a similar vein,Duernecker and Herrendorf (2016),Lee and Shin (2017)andAum et al. (2018)show that differences in occupational productivity growth can generate both structural transformation and changes in occupational employment consistent with the data.6In contrast, we take a fully flexible approach to technological change, where it is sector-and-occupation specific. This is what allows us to evaluate the role of sector- and occupation-biases in technological change on an equal footing. An overarching conclusion of our analysis is that occupation-biases in technological change are quantitatively more important. One implication of this finding is that if one wants to introduce biases in technological change into models, the most important bias to introduce is across occupations. Another implication is that policies targeting workers’ occupational choice might be better at improving labor market outcomes than industrial policies.7The paper proceeds as follows:Section 2introduces the model.Section 3presents the data and the model parameterization. InSection 4we first identify neutral, sector- and occupation-specific components of technological change, and then analyze the role that each of these components play in our general equilibrium model.

"1. IntroductionProviding basic health care services to every citizen of China is one of the important responsibilities of the central government (Wang, 2009). In 2003, the central government initiated a new ruralhealth insurancescheme to meet the health needs of the rural population, replacing an old policy which was largely ineffective. This scheme, the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS), provides coverage for catastrophic illnesses among the rural population and aims to prevent “poverty caused by illness” (Wagstaff et al., 2009) However, the policy puts a major geographical restriction on the reimbursement rate for medical expenses. The reimbursement rates for medical expenses vary according to the administrative region of the hospital(s) visited. Rural residents in China are eligible for high reimbursement rates only when they visit hospitals in the administrative region of their place of residence, as entered under the household registration system.2How might this policy restriction on health insurance distort the migrant labour market in China? This paper finds that the implementation of the NCMS hinders the number of rural residents who are rural-to-urban migrants and work in urban areas away from their hometown. However, from a first glance at the general statistics, the trend seems to be the opposite. During the implementation period of the NCMS (from 2003 to 2008), the number of migrants increased dramatically due to China’s rapid urbanization process and the increasing income differences between rural and urban workers. Despite the rapideconomic development ofurban areas in China, the social security system for rural-to-urban migrants was greatly underdeveloped during the 2000s and early 2010s. More than 70% of migrants in 2012 were still not enrolled in health or work injury insurance schemes within employment-based health insurance in the urban areas (Giles, Park, Wang, 2013,NBS, 2012). Rural-to-urban migrants are particularly vulnerable to health problems that might hinder their earning ability (Barber and Yao, 2010). Providing health insurance in rural areas fulfils rural-to-urban migrants’ need for a social safety net. But the geographical restriction brought by the health insurance might encourage these migrants to benefit from high reimbursement rates by staying close to their hometown, which is usually their place of residence in the household registration system.This paper studies the unintended consequences of the implementation of the NCMS on the rural-to-urban migrant labour market in China. I provide new county-level evidence of the effects of implementing the NCMS on the rural-to-urban migration labour market in China. By collecting raw data of the rural-to-urban migrants from each county for 14 years from five provincial statistical yearbooks and the county implementation date of the NCMS from the newspapers, I use an event-study approach to test whether the gradual roll-out of the NCMS reduces the percentage of rural-to-urban migrants from different counties. Rural-to-urban migrants from a county are the county’s rural residents who are working in urban areas outside their home county. I call this percentage of rural-to-urban migrants at county level the ‘migration propensity’. The results show that implementing the NCMS reduces the migration propensity and its growth rate at the county-level. The negative effects on the migration propensity get larger with a longer NCMS implementation period, usually taking effect in and after the first year of the implementation.As the results from county-level data, with their limited geographical coverage, might suffer from misreporting, I use a survey dataset, the ChinaNutrition and HealthSurvey (CHNS), to conduct an individual-level analysis. In this analysis, I examine the effects of the individual NCMS enrolment on the probability of being a rural-to-urban migrant. Theinstrumental variablemethod is my identification strategy for tackling the possible endogeneities between individual-level health insurance enrolment and the decision to migrate. I use the difference in the “pilot” timing for different counties as an IV for the individual-level enrolment. The results show that individual enrolment in the scheme reduces the probability of being a rural-to-urban migrant. Furthermore, I use the CHNS to construct a county-level dataset, and the results from this dataset provide comparable evidence for the results from the self-collected county dataset.Similar effects of health insurance schemes on labour market distortion at the individual level have been noted in the U.S. context.Gruber and Madrian (1993)discuss the “job-lock” effect of employer-sponsored health insurance portability; other papers examine the effects of health insurance, mainly Medicare, on retirement decisions (Fairlie, Kapur, Gates, 2016,Gruber, Madrian, 1995). Results from the U.S. show that health insurance affects job-related decisions at the individual level. Some studies in the U.S. investigate the effect of health insurance ongeographical mobility, but the effects found are small or insignificant.Chatterji and Li (2016)find that Medicaid expansion states attract the migration of low-income, childless adults, but the effects last only for one year.Goodman (2017)rules out the significance of health insurance effects on inter-state migration. This paper also links to the literature on welfare-induced migration.Borjas (1999)has found that immigrant welfare recipients in the U.S. are more likely to end up in high-benefit states. Others have also contributed to the literature by providing empirical evidence for similar conclusions, but mostly in developed countries (Blank, 1988,Gelbach, 2004,Giorgi, Pellizzari, 2009,McKinnish, 2005,McKinnish, 2007).Munshi and Rosenzweig (2016)conducted a study on migration in India; their structural model estimates whether the improvement of formal insurance on migrations, such as government safety nets and private credit, will double the migration rate.Barham and Kuhn (2014)also explore the negative effects of local health and family planning benefit programs on the flow of out-migration in local areas in Bangladash. However, given the growing number of internal migrants in developing countries, especially in China, whether health insurance schemes have similar effects on the labour markets in China is still an under-studied topic.This paper addresses an important question: the unintended misallocation effects on the labour market from place-based policies. Focusing on China is highly relevant, given that the studied migrant group is one of the main and largest labour forces contributing to China’s recent development. To date, there has been almost no discussion of possible labour-market distortions caused by the NCMS.Qin and Zheng (2011)mention this issue, but the results are limited to an individual-level dataset with a restricted period and an identification strategy that does not fully identify possible individual endogeneities.3This paper supplies this missing piece in the literature by providing both robust individual and county-level evidence from China, with clearer identification strategies, a longer time-span, and a newly-collected county dataset. The paper also finds that the distorted migration behaviours in China are on a larger scale than the similar behaviours in the U.S., which is likely due to higher average risk aversion level possessed by Asian people (Weber and Hsee, 1998). The results imply that the unintended consequences of health insurance policies for labour markets in developing countries may be greater than the literature on developed countries has envisaged. Second, the paper extends the welfare immigrant literature by documenting both the aggregated and individual-level changes in migration behaviours caused by a place-based welfare scheme. Most previous research provides merely individual-level evidence or aggregate-level evidence. Another contribution of this paper is the new county-level dataset cleaned and digitised from various statistical yearbooks and details of the NCMS county-level implementation from the newspapers and government announcements.The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.Section 2provides background on different types of health insurance, in particular the NCMS, and rural-to-urban migrants in China.Section 3mainly focuses on the county-level results, andSection 4discusses the individual-level evidence.

"1. IntroductionNon-cognitive skills, such aspersonality traitsand preferences, play an important role in occupational outcomes.1While existing studies mainly focus on western, educated, industrialised, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) populations,2evidence from non-“WEIRD” populations is lacking. Labour markets in emerging and developing countries differ substantially from labour markets in industrialised countries. They are characterised as labour intensive, credit constrained, and prone to greater earnings instability and misallocation of labour in theagricultural sector(Banerjee, Duflo, 2007,Campbell, 2011,Campbell, Ahmed, 2012,Gollin, Lagakos, Waugh, 2014). It is therefore unclear how far the results from existing studies hold for non-“WEIRD” populations. Sincejob creationhas been identified as the key to alleviating extremepovertyand improvingliving standards(Van Trotsenburg, 2018), it is vital to understand individual labour market decisions and productivity determinants in these countries.Until now, only a few studies on non-cognitive skills have utilised data from developing regions. For instance,Laajaj and Macours (2017)suggest that the selection of higher skilled individuals into non-agricultural jobs could lead to lower agricultural productivity and technology adoption.Glewwe et al. (2017)stress the importance of both cognitive and non-cognitive skills as key determinants of whether children remain in school longer. Using data from rural India,Helmers and Patnam (2011)show that cognitive and non-cognitive skills are self- and cross-productive. BothGertler et al. (2014)andAttanasio et al. (2015)use experiments to find that early childhood interventions focused on non-cognitive skills can lead to higher labour market earnings and increased parental investments. Increased parental education, especially that of the mother, also aids the development of non-cognitive skills of their children (Leight and Liu, 2016). Furthermore, even though non-farming households tend to be better off than farming-only households (Sharma, Nguyen, Grote, Nguyen, 2016,Sohns, Revilla Diez, 2016), a majority of households in developing countries rely on income from agriculture andenvironmental resourceextraction (Parvathi and Nguyen, 2018). Since the skill set and the labour market opportunities in these settings are rather homogeneous, non-cognitive skills might explain why some individuals pursue a career other than farming and earn higher wages than those of their counterparts engaged in similar occupations.Heckman et al. (2006)find that non-cognitive skills are particularly important for those with lower levels of education. This argument is supported byLaajaj et al. (2019), who hypothesise that non-cognitive skills are even more important than cognitive skills for labour market outcomes in developing countries.Against this backdrop, we shed light on the relationship between non-cognitive skills and occupational outcomes using a sample of rural households in two emerging economies. In particular, we first analyse the role of non-cognitive skills in occupational attainment; second, we examine how non-cognitive skills affect earnings within different occupation types, since identical skills can be valued differently across occupations. In this regard, we follow the argumentation ofJohn and Thomsen (2014), who study the relationship between personality traits and occupational attainment and earnings for a sample in Germany. Additionally, we test whether the effects of non-cognitive skills are homogeneous across the earnings distribution. Finally, we compare our results with those of existing studies of industrialised countries. Since labour market characteristics differ between developed and developing countries, we expect at least some variation.Our study contributes to the literature in four ways. First, we provide insights into the relationship between non-cognitive skills and occupational attainment as well as earnings for individuals in rural Southeast Asia. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to do so using a comprehensive range of measures for rural Thailand and Vietnam. Second, we complement existing studies from industrialised populations by providing evidence for occupations that are specifically important inrural labour markets, such as farming or small-scale businesses. Third, we advance the proposition put forth byLaajaj et al. (2019)that the role of non-cognitive skills is context-specific. Last, our research adds to recent studies using developing country data suggesting that not only cognitive but also non-cognitive skills entail earning differentials. Therefore, we highlight the importance of building and supporting structures for the development of non-cognitive skills.We use a data set for Thailand and Vietnam collected under the Thailand Vietnam Socio Economic Panel (TVSEP) in 2017. The survey provides information on approximately 4,000 individuals. A section on the measurement of non-cognitive skills was included for the first time in 2017. We can therefore include a range of nine measures that capture an individual’s non-cognitive skills: theBig Fivemodel consisting of the factors openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, andneuroticismas well aslocus of control, risk, trust and patience. The Big Five model and the locus of control thereby capture personality traits, while risk, trust and patience are considered preferences (Falk et al., 2018). In addition to our measures on personality and preferences, we categorise individual occupations based on the International Classification of Occupation (ISCO-08) from the International Labour Organization. These occupations are used in our analysis to examine the impact of personality on occupational outcomes. We further add a host of control variables to the analysis and perform a series of robustness checks.Our results suggest that non-cognitive skills are important predictors of both the occupational attainment and earnings of individuals in our rural sample. In particular, conscientiousness is the most decisive factor for occupational attainment, which is in line with the literature utilising developed country data sets (e.g.,Barrick, Mount, 1991,John, Thomsen, 2014). Specifically, higher levels of conscientiousness are associated with a higher likelihood of pursuing a job outside of farming. For example, a onestandard deviationincrease in conscientiousness raises the probability of being self-employed by 1.46 percentage points while it decreases the likelihood of being a commercial farmer by 2.73 percentage points. With respect to individual earnings, we find that neuroticism is a key determinant, which is in line with a recent study byLaajaj et al. (2019). This differs from findings in WEIRD populations, where conscientiousness and locus of control have been found to be predictors of individual earnings (Mueller, Plug, 2006,Nyhus, Pons, 2005,Stuetzer, Audretsch, Obschonka, Gosling, Rentfrow, Potter, 2018). Individuals who score one standard deviation higher than the average in neuroticism earn at least 46% (Government Worker) less compared to the average in their occupation group. Amongst preferences, trust is an important determinant of individual earnings for most occupation types. In addition, we observe a decreasing effect of non-cognitive skills across the earnings distribution, which broadly aligns with findings fromEren and Ozbeklik (2013)andNandi and Nicoletti (2014).The remainder of the paper is organised as follows:Section 2provides the theoretical framework for our paper as well as a review of the important literature.Section 3introduces thestudy designand illustrates the data collection, measurement of the traits andeconometricmodels used in our paper.Section 4presents the results.

"1. IntroductionMacroeconomicresearch shows that the introduction of wage rigidity to a search model greatly improves the model’s ability to generate quantitative features of the aggregate labor market (Hall, 2005,Shimer, 2005). However, evidence from micro-level data offers more nuanced insights with respect to the cyclicality of individual wages.Bils (1985)shows that wages of new hires are more cyclical than wages of job stayers.Beaudry and DiNardo (1991)(henceforth BD) find evidence for long-lasting wage contracts which shield workers from adverse conditions.Pissarides (2009)takes these findings as evidence for relatively flexible wages for new hires and less flexible wages thereafter.Kudlyak (2014)formulates a framework for measuring the wage component of the marginal cost of labor, which is found to be highly cyclical. These conclusions serve to invalidate many successful resolutions of the unemployment volatility puzzle, as many imply some sort of inertia in wages (Gertler, Trigari, 2009,Hagedorn, Manovskii, 2008,Hall, 2005). However, recent literature challenges these conclusions, highlighting the lack of proper correction for the composition bias in many empirical models.1Hagedorn and Manovskii (2013)(henceforth HM) argue that past aggregate conditions appear to be important predictors of wages, while these variables actually proxy for unmeasured procyclical match quality. In a similar vein,Gertler et al. (2020)(henceforth GHT) argue that higher wage cyclicality of new hires reflects cyclical composition in match quality among job changers.Against this background, we use comprehensive administrative matched employer-employee data to establish that both contractual wage arrangements and cyclical match quality seem to be a key feature of the German labor market. On the one hand, we find evidence for history dependent wages, supporting wage settings with contractual arrangements rather than models of pure spot wages. This finding is consistent with the institutional wage formation setting in Germany which is characterized by a highcollective bargainingcoverage. On the other hand, we find that wages of new hires from unemployment are not more cyclical, but those of job changers are more cyclical than those of existing workers once we account for composition effects as proposed by the literature. We argue that much, but not all of the excess wage cyclicality of new hires discussed by the literature can be explained by cyclical job ladder movements in match quality of new hires from employment. A key innovation of this paper is that we derive a novel measure of match quality within an employer-employee match (a generalization to HM’s approach), where we utilize detailed information on workers’ occupations. Within this framework, we find that much of the excess wage cyclicality for new hires can be explained by the occupational specifity, which is consistent with cyclical job-specific contractual arrangements within firms. If job ladder movements accompany a simultaneous change of a worker’s occupation, either across or at the same employers, the resulting wages are particularly cyclical sensitive.We base our analysis on replications of the typical regressions in BD andBils (1985). We confirm a significant procyclical relationship between past labor market conditions and contemporaneous wages — an indication for wage contracts. However, unlike BD, none of these indicators of past conditions outperform contemporaneous conditions. Furthermore, we confirm relatively cyclical entry wages of new hires as compared to the wages of existing workers.2Next, we turn towards the critique that the evidence for history dependence could reflect unobserved, cyclical match-specific productivity. We focus on two important approaches from the literature — HM and GHT. HM derive an approximation of the job match quality from an on-the-job-search model. Using the NLSY in the typical BD regressions, they indeed reject contract models in favor of spot wages. In a similar vein, GHT make the point that pooling all sorts of new hires conflates the wage flexibility of new hires from unemployment with procyclical improvements of match quality of new hires from employment in Bils-type regressions.First, we use our administrative data for Germany to construct the indirect match quality controls as in HM. In contrast to HM, we still find an economically and statistically significant relation between past labor market conditions and contemporaneous wages, even after controlling for match quality. This finding is per se at odds with the spot wage assumption in HM. We argue that part of the impact of the history of labor market conditions on wages works indeed through the selection of better match qualities as the inclusion of the selection controls decreases the magnitude of the coefficients on the indicators for past labor market conditions. However, our results show that past labor market conditions carry independent information for current wages and hence deliver empirical support for models with history dependence in wages — an observation that might be driven by institutional country-specific settings.Second, we follow GHT’s approach to directly disentangle the relative contribution of cyclical composition and wage cyclicality to estimates of excess wage cyclicality of new hires. In line with GHT, we find that wages of new hires from unemployment and those of workers in ongoing jobs are equally responsive to the cycle, while those of job changers are significantly more responsive. While the large confidence intervals in GHT’s point estimates leave some room for excess cyclicality of wages of new hires from unemployment, ours are much tighter, providing an important confirmation of GHT.Third, to test by how much the greater cyclicality of wages for new hires reflects cyclicality in the composition of match quality across new hires from employment, we add the HM selection controls in the GHT regressions. We apply them separately to job stayers, new hires from unemployment, and job changers to measure how our previous estimates are affected by potential composition effects. We find that all our previous GHT estimates appear to be biased procyclically, with the largest selection effects for job changers. Interestingly, controlling for cyclical match quality makes the observation that wages of new hires from unemployment are not more cyclical than those of stayers even clearer. These results are aligned with the recent evidence that wages are more sensitive to changes in new job opportunities for employed workers than they are for unemployed workers (Karahan et al., 2017). However, these results appear to be in contrast toHaefke et al. (2013)who show that wages of new hires out of non-employment behave similarly to wages of job-to-job movers.3While our findings are hard to square with the period-by-period Nash bargaining assumption of the canonical search and matching model, they are more consistent with a variety of search models which incorporate OJS in the spirit ofBurdett and Mortensen (1998). These models often assume that the wage rate is set at the time of hiring, and firms and workers commit to this wage in the future. Other search models (e.g.Cahuc, Postel-Vinay, Robin, 2006,Postel-Vinay, Robin, 2002) assume that firms can counter the offers received by their employees from competing firms. Hence, wages might increase in ongoing jobs due to incoming outside offers. We discuss our results in the light of the high degree of collective bargaining in Germany. We argue that these arrangements resemble particularly contracts with one-sided commitment. These results match previous evidence for contractual agreements found byBellou and Kaymak (2012)andGrant (2003).Guided by the literature of cyclical job reassignments and our previous findings, we then formulate a novel empirical framework that allows for job-specific contracts (as compared to employer-specific contracts). The general idea is that firms adjust theirlabor costsover the cycle not by altering wages for particular jobs, but rather by changing the assignment of workers to those jobs (see among othersHall, 1974,Reder, 1955,van Rens, 2005,Reynolds, 1951).4To test whether job-specific arrangements matter for our results, we provide a generalization of HM’s match quality measures. The argument is that even within employer-employee matches, workers might select into better matches during good times through internal job reassignments (e.g., promotions), which we proxy by occupation changes. This refinement is important because the cyclical implications of implicit contracts, especially those of models with worker mobility, are observationally equivalent to the implications of cyclical intrafirm up- and downgrading. With our refinement, we clean the reference group of job stayers and exploit an additional source of cyclical variation that might confound previous results. Interestingly, our novel empirical framework shows that much of the excess cyclicality is driven by occupation switches. The largest selection effects go along the occupational dimension as workers who change occupations at the same employers are responsible for the largest portion of the procyclical bias in the estimated wage cyclicality. These results are consistent withCarrillo-Tudela et al. (2016)who find that procyclical wage improvements are larger for workers whochange careers(e.g., occupation changes) than for workers who do not. Furthermore, they are aligned withKambourov and Manovskii (2009)who show that occupation switching workers are particularly cyclically sensitive.The plan of the paper proceeds as follows:Section 2describes the data sources and preparation.Section 3investigates thecyclical behaviorof individual wages. In Subsections, we explore the role of composition bias and discuss our result in the light of the institutional wage settings in Germany.Section 4explores the role of job reassignments.

"1. IntroductionThere is widespread evidence that the return to education for employees has increased over recent decades in most industrialized countries (see for exampleCard (1999)for a review), while we know very little—if anything—on the evolution of the return to education for entrepreneurs. The anecdotal evidence is somewhat mixed. On the one hand, some of the most successful new US companies, such as Microsoft, Facebook, and Apple, have been founded by college drop-outs: Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs. This could indicate that higher education has become less useful to entrepreneurship, possibly because of its high opportunity cost in terms of time. On the other hand, successful entrepreneurs with little or no formal education have been common throughout the history ofcapitalism.1And in more recent years, the US has also experienced a boom in the number of successful high-tech firms created by entrepreneurs withpostgraduate education, which might rather suggest an increase in its return for entrepreneurs.2In this paper we use the Survey of ConsumerFinances(SCF) to supply evidence on the evolution of the return to education of US entrepreneurs over the period 1989–2013. The SCF is best suited for the purpose because it is fully representative of thewealthdistribution of US households, including at the very top; it measures accurately the educational level of individuals; and it contains detailed information of the businesses they run.3We identify entrepreneurs as individuals whose primary job consists of actively managing one or more privately-held businesses, which they own in part or in full. We also consider more restrictive definitions of entrepreneur based on the number of workers in the business and its legal form (incorporated versus unincorporated). In measuring the return to entrepreneurship, we consider that an important part of entrepreneurs’ income comes from capital gains realized upon selling the business. An entrepreneur also immobilizes part of his wealth as well as his human capital in his business. Upon exit (due to failure or sale), the entrepreneur recovers some wealth that can be re-invested elsewhere or consumed, while the human capital can be re-employed in the labor market. Based on this insight, we construct a simple measure ofreturn to entrepreneurshipand implement it using the SCF, which consists of repeated cross-sectional surveys with information on the date of start-up, current income from the entrepreneurial venture (in the form of either labor income or dividend payments), its current market valuation and the investment made to acquire or start the business. We group entrepreneurs by education, distinguishing between: (i) post-graduate degree, (ii) college degree, (iii) high school degree, and (iv) less than high school degree. We find that the premium of having a college degree relative to a high school degree has increased, but only by about as much as the analogous premium for employees. Instead, the premium for postgraduate education has increased substantially more for entrepreneurs than for employees. On average, entrepreneurs with a post-graduate degree nowadays earn more than twice as much as in the early 1990s. The analogous percentage increase for entrepreneurs with a college degree is around 50%, while for entrepreneurs with less than a college degree the increase is small or negligible. Today an entrepreneur with a postgraduate degree earns on average $100,000 per year more (at 2010 prices) than one with only a college degree. This difference more than doubles at the higher quantiles of the entrepreneurs’ income distribution. In the late 1980s, these differences were close to zero. The sharp increase in the skill premium for entrepreneurs with postgraduate education is partly due to the higher dividends paid by the firms they ran and partly due to the higher capital gains realized upon sale of the business. The premium for postgraduate education holds both for entrepreneurs with an M.A. or an MBA degree and for those with a Ph.D; it has remained high during theGreat Recession(despite a drop in absolute returns); and it is robust to accounting for changes in how individuals self-select into higher education and/or entrepreneurship. All this suggests that the experience of “Bill, Mark and Steve” has been the exception rather than the rule and that higher education has become increasingly important for entrepreneurial success.An increase in the return to skill for entrepreneurs can be the result of an increase in the return to education, in the return to labor market experience and in the complementarity between the two (EE-complementarity). We find that the complementarity between higher education and labor market experience has increased substantially. The increase is specific to entrepreneurship and accounts almost fully for the rise in the premium to postgraduate education. This holds true after controlling for several alternative explanations for the rise in the premium, including changes in (i) the sectoral specialization of businesses; (ii) their access to internal or external finance; (iii) the importance of vintage technology effects; (iv) the intergenerational transmission of wealth; (v) compensating differentials—due to greater business risk or lower possibilities of recycling entrepreneurial skills into new ventures; and (vi) the scale of business. The rising importance of EE-complementarity is consistent with a recent literature which, followingLazear, 2004,Lazear, 2005, has emphasized that entrepreneurs need a balanced mix of skills to succeed and with the findings byAzoulay et al. (2018)that highly successful start-ups tend to be founded by middle-aged entrepreneurs with some previous labor market experience.There is cross-sectional evidence on the return to education for entrepreneurs and how it compares with the analogous return for employees, seeVan der Sluis et al. (2008)for a review of the literature andQueiro (2016)for a more recent analysis which focuses on firm dynamics. Yet little is known about the time-series evolution of the skill premium for entrepreneurs. Some existing evidence is consistent with our findings that the return to education has increased.Kaplan and Rauh (2013)study the characteristics of the 400 wealthiest individuals in the US over the past three decades according to the Forbes 400 list and document that the share of college graduates has increased from 77 to 87%.Smith et al. (2019)provide evidence consistent with an increased return to skill for entrepreneurs, but they do not focus on education, which is a variable not available in the administrative data that they use.There is debate on how to accurately identify entrepreneurship in the data, which according toSchumpeter, 1947,Schumpeter, 1949is associated withjob creation, innovation, and risk taking.Levine and Rubinstein (2017)use the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79) to argue that self-employed individuals who run incorporated businesses closer approximates the Schumpeterian definition of entrepreneur. Here we focus on the return to education in entrepreneurship, study its evolution over time and find that the return to postgraduate education has increased also when focusing on the preferred definition of entrepreneurs byLevine and Rubinstein (2017).Hall and Woodward (2010)study the risk-adjusted return to entrepreneurship and conclude that it is only slightly above zero. Our measure of entrepreneurial return does not control for risk, but we think that risk aversion alone cannot explain the rising premium to higher education observed in the data, because the entire distribution of returns has generally become more favorable to highly educated entrepreneurs: failure rates have evolved similarly across educational groups, while the skill premium to entrepreneurship has increased in all the higher quantiles of the income distribution. Further, our results are robust to controlling for a measure of income uncertainty in the business.Several other papers have used the SCF to study features of US entrepreneurs.De Nardi et al. (2007)investigate the role ofliquidity constraintsand personal wealth for business development.Moskowitz and Vissing-Jorgensen (2002)andKartashova (2014)estimate the aggregate return to private equity, which accrues mainly to entrepreneurs, and compare it to the return from investing in public equity. None of these papers has analyzed differences in individual entrepreneurial returns and the evolution over time of the return to education for entrepreneurs.The rest of the paper is organized as follows.Section 2discusses how to measure the return to entrepreneurship in the SCF.Section 3describes the data.Section 4characterizes the evolution of average returns and deal with selection issues into both higher education and entrepreneurship.Section 5focuses on different quantiles of the entrepreneurs’ return distribution.Section 6show the robustness of the results to possible biases in the measure of returns and the use of the March Current Population Survey (CPS) as an alterative source of information on entrepreneurial income.Section 7provides evidence of increased complementarity between education and labor market experience and tests for alternative explanations of the rise in the premium for postgraduate education.Section 8concludes.",Claudio,Fabiano,None
"1. IntroductionThere is an important literature inlabour economicsthat looks at the effects of unions on firm performance (see the recent contribution byDoucouliagos et al. (2017)). This body of research emphasises the role of the wage bargaining environment in which unions operate as a potential key determinant of firm behaviour and labour market outcomes.Indeed, the role of unions is likely to be different in centralised versus decentralised bargaining systems, in coordinated versus non-coordinated environments or when bargaining takes place both at the sector (centralised) and firm (decentralised) level, the so-called two-tier bargaining system (Boeri, 2014), which grants some degree of flexibility to firms and unions to deviate from terms decided at higher level agreements (Garnero, 2020). Interestingly, despite the increasing importance over time of multi-level (two-tier) bargaining arrangements in a number of European countries, their economic effects on employment, productivity and investment are still poorly understood, as highlighted byAddison (2016);Boeri (2014);Hijzen et al. (2019). Survey data for a representative sample of Italian firms, which we discuss in more detail inSection 3, reveal the existence of a negative correlation between the level of investment per worker and the presence of unions within the firm, which is however fully offset by the presence of a two-tier wage bargaining agreement.1To address these issues, in this paper we build up a model in which there are unions and labour markets present frictions. Firms, that differ in terms oftotal factor productivity, choose the amount of investment in capital equipment before a job vacancy is filled and the wage negotiation occurs. So an hold-up problem arises, whose effects on firms’ investment decision are compounded by the presence of labour market frictions. Indeed, the longer the expected duration of a job vacancy, the larger is the opportunity cost of unused capital, and the lower the incentive to invest in the first place.We compare the effects on capital investment of two different wage mechanisms: a one-tier bargaining system, fully centralised, and a two-tier scenario, in which a fraction of thesalaryis negotiated at firm level.2We show that, if some conditions are fulfilled, the two-tier wage negotiation raises the level of investment per worker in the economy. The reason goes as follows. While under one-tier bargaining wages are affected by the average labour productivity in the sector, in a two-tier bargaining scenario the salary partially depends on the productivity of the single firm. More capital intensive firms, that pay higher wages, face a lower expected duration for a vacancy, as better earnings attract more job seekers. In turn, if job positions get filled more rapidly capital remains unused for less time. The hold up problem is less severe and investment increases. Of course, the same chain of effects, but with opposite sign, occurs for less capital intensive firms, that may decide to invest less under a two-tier bargaining scheme. However, we show that when the real interest rate is close to zero, the higher opportunity cost of capital for this type of firms is never strong enough to outweigh the increase in investment for capital intensive firms. In the end, the amount of capital equipment per worker in the economy goes up.We contribute to the literature, which is surveyed in detail in the next section, in two main directions. First, we propose a theoretical model with unions and two-tier bargaining that is able to deliver general empirical predictions on capital investment. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the very few attempts to model two-tier bargaining structures available in the literature. Second, we provide descriptive evidence on the effects of unions and two-tier wage bargaining on investment for the case of a country, Italy, traditionally characterized by high union power and highly centralised wage bargaining, while most of the available evidence is for the US or for a very limited number of EU countries, as the UK and Germany.The remainder of the study is organized as follows. InSection 2we discuss the relation of our paper to the previous literature, inSection 3we provide motivating evidence, inSections 4and5we present the theoretical model, whileSection 6concludes.

"1. IntroductionLife (policies) can put some children at a disadvantage. In such cases, parents can react to those disadvantages by changing their investments in their children. However, parents’ reactions might depend on their resources, which involves important implications in terms ofinequality, social mobility, and policy impacts. Our understanding of such responses is limited, however, because a proper empirical analysis requires both exogenous variation in exposure to disadvantages and the availability of detailed data on parental investments.In this paper, we get around these limitations by looking at a variation in exposure to school disadvantage that is both well documented as potentially exogenous and easy to observe across datasets, including those with information on parental investments. Specifically, we use time-use surveys and school-based questionnaires to study how parents from different socioeconomic statuses (SES) in Spain react to a widely-usedschool policythat puts some children at a learning disadvantage: age at school entry.Most countries dictate that children born during a given one-year period should start school at the same time. This (up-to-one-year) difference in the age of students in the same classroom may be reflected instudent performance. For instance, younger children might be less ready to acquire knowledge and deal overall with the experience of formal schooling. If initial outcomes shape future outcomes, the age at school entry can have long-term consequences for schooling and labor market trajectories (seeSection 2.1).A large body of literature shows that starting school at an earlier age is indeed related to worse student performance, labor market outcomes, and criminal behavior.1Furthermore, this negative effect might be greater among people from disadvantaged backgrounds, at least in some contexts (seeMichael and Bernardi, 2017on England,Fredriksson and Öckert, 2014on Sweden, andMcEwan and Shapiro, 2008on Chile).2Before looking at potential differences in parental investments, we first document that the children who were younger at school entry tend to perform worse in school than the children who were older at school entry. Using Spanish data from four waves of theProgramme for International Student Assessment(PISA) survey from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), we find that students who started school at a younger age are more likely to have repeated a grade and have lower test scores in mathematics and reading at age 15 than older children. For example, students born in December (the youngest age in their cohort) are 10 percentage points more likely to have repeated a grade by age 15 than those born in January (the oldest age).3We go further and explore how this pattern translates into long-term outcomes, using information from the population census. We find that adults who were younger at school entry have less schooling and less-educated partners.A causal interpretation of the documented age effect requires that 1) parents do not postpone the timing at which their child’s entry school, and 2) there is no connection between the characteristics of newborns and their month of birth. Some parents might be willing to enroll their children in school beyond the typical age of entry if they are sufficiently concerned about any negative effects associated with children’s age at school entry. Spain enforces a strict birthday cutoff for school entry, so even if they wish to, parents cannot easily postpone the year when their child starts school (seeSection 2.2). Alternatively, there could be a connection between a newborn’s characteristics and birth month if parental characteristics or relevant environmental (institutional) conditions that shape fetal (newborn) health vary during the year. To study this potential seasonality in births we analyze both the population census and birth certificate data. Using census-type data of the Spanish population allows us to detect birth patterns that could go unnoticed in survey data because of a smaller sample size. Indeed, we find that there is some seasonality in births. However, we do not find systematic differences in the parental and newborn characteristics of babies born in December and January (just before and after the birthday cutoff for entry to school, which is January 1st). We confirm this pattern by looking at differences in parental characteristics between people born in December and January in the datasets used in our main analysis.We therefore focus our analysis on people born in January (the oldest age at school entry) and December (the youngest).4Using data from PISA, we show that the effect of the age at school entry is significantly larger among children from disadvantaged families. For instance, young students from low-SES families are 12.7 percentage points more likely to have repeated a grade by age 15 than older students from the same socioeconomic background. This gap is only 4 percentage points among students from high-SES families.5To analyze whether this difference is related to parental investments according to family background, we assemble two different datasets with detailed information about parental investments: the two waves of the Spanish Time Use Survey (STUS; 2003 and 2009) and the General Diagnostic Assessment (GDA,orEvaluación General de Diagnósticoin Spanish, is a 2009 national evaluation of fourth grade students with information onparental involvementand school characteristics). Our focus on parental time investments in child development is grounded in the child development literature, which shows that the time parents spend with children is an important input for the children’s cognitive development, particularly for young children (Del Boca et al., 2014).We find that college-educated parents increase the amount of time they spend helping their children with school activities and that they choose schools with better inputs when their children are the youngest at school entry, whereas parents without a college education do not do any of both. Specifically, we find that college-educated parents spend an average of five more minutes per day helping their children with school activities when their children are the youngest at school entry, a result that is statistically significant at the 5% level. This is a large effect, considering that parents in our sample spend on average 7.5 minutes per day helping their children with school activities. This effect increases to 10 minutes per day when we focus on children who are 6 to 12 years old, the age window in which parental help with school tasks is concentrated (averaging 12.5 minutes per day), and to 15 minutes per day when we exclude the summer months (when children are out of school). Supporting the idea that these differences in parental help are related to what happens at school, we do not observe a similar pattern among parents of preschool-age children.6Finally, we find suggestive evidence of different gender patterns among children from high-SES families. On one hand, younger boys from high-SES families do not seem to be able to overcome the school entry age disadvantage by the age of 15. Probably because they face a larger disadvantage, they receive more help from their parents with their homework and other academic activities, and they are more likely to attend schools with better inputs. On the other hand, younger girls from high-SES families do not have different achievement levels at age 15 relative to older girls from high-SES families. Probably because they face a smaller disadvantage, parents do not seem to invest more on them. We find no such gender-specific effect among children from low-SES families.Our results highlight the importance of considering behavioral responses to policy in the impact evaluation literature based on reduced-form estimates. The reduced-form effects of a policy include both a direct (policy) effect and an indirect effect consisting of endogenous responses to the policy—in our case, parental responses to the school entry age (Todd and Wolpin, 2003). To disentangle policy effects and production function parameters, we need to understand behavioral responses to policies.The main contribution of this paper is to the emerging literature on parental reactions toeducation policies. In seminal papers,Pop-Eleches and Urquiola (2013)show that parents in Romania are less likely to help their children with homework when they are admitted to more effective schools, whileDas et al. (2013)find that parents in India decrease their education spending when their children are enrolled in schools that receive grants that can be spent on educational materials.7We contribute to this literature by highlighting how these reactions might vary according to the family’s SES and the student’s gender, and by providing more detailed evidence on parental responses. In the closest study to ours,Fredriksson et al. (2016)show that larger class sizes in Sweden increase the likelihood that high-income parents help their children with their homework and low-income parents move their children to a different school. Relative to this paper, we make two contributions. First, we use richer measures of parental investments, which allows us to quantify the magnitude of changes in parental time investments and analyze how these responses evolve over their children’s lifecycle. Second, we look at whether parental responses depend on the interaction between parental SES and children’s gender.8We also contribute to the ample literature on the effects of age at school entry. A strand of papers has documented that these effects are heterogeneous by SES in several contexts. Our contribution is to provide novel evidence on a plausible mechanism behind this heterogeneity—differences in parental investments in terms of time and school choice. In a contemporaneous work,Dhuey et al. (2019)use data from the state of Florida in the United States to show that high-SES parents are more likely than low-SES parents to postpone the enrollment of their children in school by one year (which is allowed in the United States). Their results support our findings that high-SES parents are more likely to help their children when they are among the youngest at school entry.The rest of the paper is organized as follows.Section 2elaborates on the relationship between age at school entry and student outcomes and describes the institutional framework.Section 3presents the data, andSection 4the identification strategy.Section 5describes the results for age at school entry, andSection 6presents the analyses of parental responses and the differences in these responses according to the child’s age and gender.Section 7concludes.",Inés,Ricardo,None
"1. IntroductionDisability insurance (DI) is intended to compensate for lost earnings capacity. The difficulty lies in determining how much has been lost. Overly stringent assessment leaves people underinsured. Overly lax assessment encourages moral hazard. Evidence on the earnings response to reduced DI entitlement resulting from stricter assessment of the earnings capacity of benefit recipients can help determine whether the right balance has been struck.This paper uses administrative data on the universe of Dutch DI recipients to estimate the impact on earnings, and employment, of reassessment of their earnings capacity under more stringent criteria that could result in benefits being terminated or cut substantially. If the reassessments were effective in identifying recipients with untapped earnings potential, then reduced benefits should have raised earnings. If, on the other hand, the reassessments were overly aggressive or poorly targeted, then the earnings response would be muted. We estimate the average effect of reassessment on earnings and scale this by the average reduction in benefits to assess the effectiveness and targeting of the upward revisions made to earnings capacity. In doing so, we extend the evidence base on thelabor supply effectsof DI — the second largest item of social insurance expenditure in many countries — by adding to only a handful of studies that estimate effects of cutting the entitlement of current benefit recipients (Borghans, Gielen, Luttmer, 2014,Deshpande, 2016,Deuchert, Eugster, 2019,Moore, 2015).We identify the effect of a 2004 reform by comparing the change in earnings (and other outcomes) of DI recipients aged 30–44, whose entitlement was reassessed under stricter criteria, with the respective change among older recipients, who were not reassessed. Unlike studies that rely on difference-in-differences (DID) between age groups to identify effects of more stringent criteria atapplicationfor DI (Karlström, Palme, Svensson, 2008,Staubli, 2011), we adjust for the age difference in the outcome trend over a period prior to the reform. This trend-adjusted DID (Bell et al., 1999) eliminates age-specific trends, as well as period effects. Identification rests on the assumption that, in the absence of the reform, the difference between age groups in the outcome trends would have been the age group difference in the trends observed in the earlier period. Consistent with this, we demonstrate that the age differential in the trends is similar over multiple periods prior to the reform. A placebo test also lends credibility to the identification: implementing the empirical strategy with data on individuals who are not DI recipients, we find no “effect” of a pseudo reform on earnings.We estimate that, on average over all DI recipients aged 30–44 targeted for reassessment, application of the more stringent rules reduced the amount of DI income received by 20 percent relative to what it would have been if there were no reform, raised employment by 20 percent and increased earnings by 18 percent; implying high elasticities of employment and earnings with respect to benefits. Receiving € 1000 less from DI was compensated by earning € 636 more in the labor market, on average. Apparently, some younger Dutch DI recipients had considerable untapped earnings potential that more stringent assessment of their benefit entitlement induced them to utilize.The Netherlands provides an interesting context in which to assess the earnings potential of DI recipients. It is known for high DI dependency that reached 12% of the insured population at the beginning of the 1990s but also for a series of reforms, such as the one we examine, that are claimed to have contributed to a two-fifths reduction in this dependency (Koning and Lindeboom, 2015). Countries, such as the US, looking for ways to manage the escalating fiscal burden of DI can potentially learn from the Dutch experience (Autor, 2015,Burkhauser, Daly, McVicar, Wilkins, 2014). By examining a reform that occurred a decade into the paring back of an initially generous program, we deliver evidence that is more relevant to the situation prevailing in other countries than the evaluation byBorghans et al. (2014)of an earlier Dutch reform that took effect when DI dependency was substantially higher than elsewhere.1Our estimate of the rate at which earnings replaced lost DI income is actually very close to that obtained byBorghans et al., indicating that even after a decade ofretrenchmentsome DI recipients still had considerable unused earnings potential they could call on to replace around two thirds of substantial reductions in benefits. However, it is important to emphasize that these were a minority of the stock of DI recipients. Most did not have their benefits reduced despite being subjected to reassessment of their earning capacity under more stringent criteria.Much of the evidence on the earnings crowd-out from DI comes from studies that followBound (1989)in using the earnings of rejected applicants to place an upper bound on the earnings potential of successful applicants (Chen, Van der Klaauw, 2008,Von Wachter, Song, Manchester, 2011).2Exploitation of plausibly exogenous variation in the award or appeal probability can eliminate upward bias in the estimated earnings potentialat the time of application(Autor, Kostol, Mogstad, Setzler, 2017,French, Song, 2014,Maestas, Mullen, Strand, 2013). But this quasi-experimental strategy will still overestimate the average earnings potential of the stock of beneficiaries if skills and preferences for work deteriorate while on DI (Bryngelson, 2009,Svensson, Müssener, Alexanderson, 2010,Vingård, Alexanderson, Norlund, 2004). Evidence obtained from comparison of accepted and rejected applicants is pertinent to the impact of policies that tighten entry to DI. It is less relevant to assessing the potential of reforms, such as the one we examine, that aim to release any earnings potential of benefit recipients.There are only a few studies that, like this one and Borghans et al (2014), estimate labor supply responses of DI recipients to cuts made to their benefits.Moore (2015)finds that 22 percent of US Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) recipients entered employment after being removed from the program because they had (partly) qualified through an addictive disorder.Deshpande (2016)estimates that 18-year-olds removed from another US DI program following stricter medical review were able to increase earnings to an extent sufficient to replace only one third of the benefit income lost. Relative to the cuts made to benefits, these labor supply responses in the US are smaller than those of Dutch DI recipients that we and Borghans et al. estimate. This may be due to differences in the DI programs, but it could also reflect differences in the DI recipients studied. Those qualifying through an addiction were only two percent of the stock of SSDI recipients, and their work preferences and capacities may have been quite distinct. At the age of 18, the DI recipients studied by Deshpande lacked the labor market experience that may have conditioned their labor supply response to benefit cuts. We estimate responses of all recipients aged 30–44, who comprise more than a third of the stock of DI recipients in the Netherlands, where, as in other countries, the DI roll is becoming younger.Besides being one of the few studies to estimate earnings responses to targeted reductions in the benefit entitlement of DI recipients, this paper adds to the meager evidence on whether and how these responses vary with time spent on DI (Autor, Maestas, Mullen, Strand, 2015,Gelber, Moore, Strand, 2017,Moore, 2015). Using claim durations of up to 15 years, which is substantially longer than other studies, we find that reassessment induced a smaller earnings response from those who had been claiming for longer. Interestingly, the earnings response of partially disabled recipients who were working at the time of reassessment did not decline with claim duration.We find that DI recipients who qualified through more subjectively defined health problems — mental health and musculoskeletal conditions — experienced the most aggressive cuts in benefits, indicating the greatest upward revisions in assessed earnings capacity, and were able to increase earnings to replace larger fractions of these cuts. This is consistent with the argument that loosening of the criteria for DI entitlement from precisely defined medical diagnoses to the more nebulous concept ofwork capacitylengthened DI rolls by opening the door to claims based on difficult-to-verify health problems (Autor, 2015,Autor, Duggan, 2006).3The paper proceeds as follows.Section 2outlines key features of the Dutch DI program and the reform we evaluate.Section 3sets out our identification strategy.Section 4describes the data and examines trends in the outcomes.Section 5presents the results starting with full sample estimates, then a placebo test and robustness analysis, followed by examination of the relationship between earnings responses and claim duration, and then heterogeneity analyses.

"1. IntroductionEquality of opportunity is central to many conceptions of a just society, and a perennial touchstone in public policy debates. Accordingly, there is a vast related literature in economics onintergenerational mobility— the extent to which economic outcomes persist from one generation to the next (Black, Devereux, 2011,Solon, 1999). Increasingly studies explore regional differences in intergenerational mobility within countries.2These differences are of interest in their own right, but may also shed light on the mechanisms that drive differences in outcomes (for example, seeChetty and Hendren (2018)andDeutscher (2020)).We provide the first national and regional estimates of intergenerational income mobility using Australian administrative data. Australia emerges as among the more mobile advanced economies – and hence a potentially informative example of high mobility outside the Nordic countries. While mobility is rapid across most of Australia, there are meaningful differences within the country, and its states,territoriesand cities. These regional measures correlate with a variety of potential mechanisms for mobility, from good school attendance to strong local labour markets. In the final section of the paper we explore the stability over time, in theory and in practice, of this “geography of mobility” that is an increasingly common feature of the literature.Data constraints have limited the quantity and quality of Australian evidence on intergenerational income mobility to date. Most existing studies lack data on income for long periods in both generations, often leading researchers to impute parental income using methods that have required strong assumptions.3There is also no evidence on geographic differences in intergenerational mobility within the country. National estimates for Australia are interesting in their own right and, when compared with other countries, may also shed light on the value of certain institutional features of the country and how these may enhance or impede mobility. Regional differences within Australia may also provide insights as to how differences inindustrycomposition, economic growth or other unique aspects of different regions may matter for mobility. A key obstacle to producing definitive mobility estimates for Australia has been the lack of the kind of large, long and representative panel dataset that administrative data can provide. Large panels enable researchers to produce more precise national estimates as well as estimates for smaller geographic regions. Long panels hold promise for more effectively addressing the variety of measurement challenges that is endemic to the intergenerational mobility literature (e.g.Haider and Solon (2006);Mazumder (2005);Solon (1992)).We address these challenges by producing the first estimates of intergenerational mobility based on Australiantaxdata. We find that intergenerational persistence in income is quite low and that intergenerational mobility is consequently quite high. We estimate the intergenerational elasticity of income (IGE) for Australia to be 0.185 and the Spearman correlation (or rank-rank slope) to be 0.215. By way of contrast, (Chetty et al., 2014) estimate an IGE and rank-rank slope of around 0.34 for the United States; while more recent estimates addressing limitations in their data put the IGE at 0.5 or higher and the rank-rank slope at 0.4 or higher (Mazumder, 2016). Our estimates for Australia are more comparable to recent Canadian estimates of an IGE of 0.20 and a rank-rank slope of 0.24 (Corak, 2019). The estimates are also close to Nordic countries such as Denmark and Norway where estimates of these parameters are typically around 0.2 or lower. While precise rankings of countries are fraught given differences in data sources, definitions and panel lengths, these findings nonetheless suggest Australia is among the more mobile countries in the world.4We also estimate other rank-based measures of intergenerational mobility, such as conditional expected ranks. We find that the expected rank of individuals whose parents were at the 25th percentile is the 45th percentile. Those who started at the 75th percentile could expect to land at the 56th percentile.5This illustrates substantial upward and downward mobility. In the United States there are only 53 cities out of 381 that have higher rates of upward mobility than Australia taken as a whole.Our qualitative results do not change when adjusting for potential sources of bias, including measurement of income over too short a period or too early or late in life, nonlinearities in intergenerational relationships, missing income observations, and missing or incorrect parent-child links. Consistent with recent research abroad and in Australia, rank-based measures appear less sensitive to many of these concerns (Mazumder, 2016,Murray, Clark, Mendolia, Siminski, 2018,Nybom, Stuhler, 2017). Our most conservative estimates using our baseline sample lift our estimated IGE to 0.210 (from 0.185) and our rank-rank slope to 0.232 (from 0.215).6We also present the first regional estimates of intergenerational mobility across Australia. While there is significantly less dispersion in mobility across Australian regions relative to the United States, meaningful differences nonetheless emerge — both within the country and within individual cities such as Sydney and Melbourne. Perhaps most notable is the influence of the mining boom, which appears to have lifted the expected ranks (in the national income distribution) of children raised in resource-rich regions. The boom appears to have ‘lifted all boats’, as although upward mobility was higher in the mining regions, the rank-rank slope was no lower than that experienced by other regions. We explore a range of correlates of intergenerational mobility, finding that regions with higher incomes and lower unemployment rates tend to have higher conditional expected ranks for those raised there; while regions with less segregation and higher school attendance rates have lower rank-rank slopes.Given the recent proliferation of regional estimates of intergenerational mobility, we end with an exploration of the stability of regional estimates of intergenerational mobility. To provide a framework for this, we extend a generalised error-in-variables model to the setting of regional rank-based estimates of mobility. The model highlights the potential sensitivity of regional estimates to local income shocks. These shocks flow directly through to conditional expected ranks but only influence the rank-rank slope to the extent they are correlated with parental income. This suggests regional estimates of conditional expected ranks may be more volatile than regional estimates of the rank-rank slope – a possibility that is borne out in the Australian experience. To illustrate this, we produce regional estimates of intergenerational income mobility from 2000 onwards. National estimates are significantly attenuated (show more mobility) towards the start of this period, but stabilise towards the end of our panel in 2015. Regional rank-rank slopes follow a relatively similar pattern, and most of their variation over time is well explained by a common attenuation process. However, conditional expected ranks are much more volatile, and move in ways that can be at least partly explained by fluctuations in the local labour market.Regional estimates of intergenerational mobility – at times referred to as the “geography of mobility” (Chetty, Hendren, Kline, Saez, 2014,Corak, 2019) – are of significant public interest, and can help shed light on the mechanisms underlying intergenerational mobility (Chetty, Hendren, 2018,Deutscher, 2020). Regional estimates are also increasingly produced using rank-based measures, which have been shown to stabilise more quickly at anationallevel with the respect to the ages and lengths of time over which incomes are observed. We provide an important caveat to this growing literature in highlighting that stable national estimates may mask underlying volatility in regional estimates, particularly conditional expected ranks, potentially driven by local economic fluctuations. Future studies may benefit from keeping this in mind in interpreting and exploiting the geography of mobility.",Nathan,Bhashkar,None
"1. IntroductionPeople prefer high rank to low rank. Even when rank is independent from monetary outcomes, people are willing to take costly actions in order to climb the ladder. “….rank among our equals, is, perhaps, the strongest of all our desires” wrote Adam Smith in 1759. Modern organizations utilize this basic human insight by providing employees with feedback on their relative performance in order to motivate them to work harder.However, although rank and relative performance feedback (RPF) is such a basic ingredient in competitive environments, it is only recently that scholars within economics have systematically studied how people respond to RPF. The early literature on relative performance evaluation studied the effect of connecting rank to monetary incentives (seeLazear and Rosen (1981)seminal contribution on rank order tournaments). More recent theories on competitive preferences and status concerns (Frank, 1985;Clark and Oswald, 1996;Auriol and Renault, 2008) suggest, however, that rankper semotivates effort.1It has now been demonstrated, through controlled experiments in the lab and in the field, that RPF indeed affects individual behavior, even when relative performance does not affect pay. For example, Blanes iVidal and Nossol (2011),Kuhnen and Tymula (2012),Tafkov (2013),Charness et al. (2014), andKramer et al. (2016)find performance improvements in situations where RPF is provided, whileHannan et al. (2008),Hannan et al. (2013),Azmat and Iriberri (2016), andGjedrem (2018)find significant context specific effects of RPF. There are also studies that do not find any positive effects of RPF.Guryan et al. (2009),Eriksson et al. (2009)andBellemare et al. (2010)find no significant effects, whileBarankay (2012)find that removing RPF positively affected productivity.Relative performance feedback is also provided to groups of individuals, like firms, or teams within firms, who compete against each other and receive feedback about their relative performance. Sales teams or R&D teams, for instance, are benchmarked against similar teams in other firms. Moreover, firms often set up internal competitions between teams in order to sell more or innovate more (Birkinshaw, 2001;Marino and Zábojnik, 2004;Baer et al., 2010). Successful teams are typically compensated by some monetary rewards, but team competitionsper semay also be motivating. There are only a few studies on the effects of team RPF with real-effort task, see e.g.Delfgaauw et al. (2013).2However there is a larger literature on behavior in group contests using other types of tasks, see a recent survey bySheremeta (2018)for details on this.We contribute to the existing literature by investigating how teams respond to relative performance feedback while working on a real-effort task. We first build a model, considering how people's utility is affected by feedback on rank and peer pressure. In particular, people may experience utility from being ranked against others, and from peer pressure of observing others’ performance. From a theoretical perspective, one may think of at least two reasons why people might respond differently to team feedback compared to individual feedback. The first relates to status concerns and competitive preferences: The utility from winning together with a team might potentially be different from the utility of winning alone, since one then share the pleasure with other team members. Similarly, the costs of losing as a team might be different from the costs of losing alone, as one can find common support and comfort. The second relates to peer pressure and ""team spirit"". As demonstrated theoretically (Kandel and Lazear, 1992) and empirically (e.g.,Babcock et al., 2015;Corgnet et al., 2015), peer pressure can motivate workers to exert effort in teams. Team-based incentive schemes may create peer pressure since low (high) effort has a negative (positive) externality on peers’ pay. If peers also care about team rank, then team RPF may create additional peer pressure within the team.We investigate RPF to teams by conducting a controlled laboratory experiment consisting of eight treatments. In each treatment, subjects work on a real-effort task for six periods. We primarily vary treatments along two dimensions: team or individual incentives, and team or individual feedback. However, to establish a “baseline” of performance, we also have treatments in which subjects only receive absolute performance feedback. Under RPF, individuals (teams) are always compared with two other individuals (teams), i.e. after each period, each individual or team is ranked as either number 1, 2 or 3. Each team consists of three subjects, so each subject earns one third of total team output when provided with team incentives. The monetary outcomes are independent from feedback rankings.While our main objective is to investigate the effect of team RPF, our secondary objective is to understand when and why team RPF has an effect. It is difficult to disentangle between the two main mechanisms that could make people respond differently to team RPF compared to individual RPF (status concerns and peer pressure). Our approach is to remove (or at least reduce) peer pressure by letting people workon behalf ofteams, where the others in the team do not work. We thus also ran two “team leader” treatments, where workers acted as team leaders and worked on behalf of their team.In sum, these eight treatments can provide answers to our two main questions: How and why do individuals’ performances in teams respond to relative performance feedback? The main results is that RPF to teams indeed increase performance, and that competitive preferences, rather than peer pressure or “team spirit”, seem to drive the results. More specifically,our results can be summarized as follows: We find that when subjects are exposed to team incentives, then RPF on how their team is doing compared to two other teams increases the team's average performance by almost 10%. Thetreatment effectis driven by higher top performances.3The best performance within each team is on average almost 20% higher when teams receive team RPF comparted to when teams only receive team APF. These effects more or less disappear under individual incentives and individual RPF. Our experiment thus suggests that some subjects are particularly motivated by the combination of team incentives and team RPF. The strong effect on top performers, and the insignificant effect on other team members, indicates that team spirit is not a main explanation of our results. Our results from the team leader treatments support this conjecture. We find that team leaders receiving RPF perform significantly better than team leaders who only receive absolute performance feedback, indicating that status concerns or competitive preferences better explain our results than peer pressure or team spirit.The positive effect of team RPF complementsDelfgaauw et al. (2013)who in a field experiment find positive effects of team RPF under weak team incentives. In contrast to us, they do not compare with individual RPF, nor do they study interaction effects between team RPF and team incentives. Our results also complementvan Dijk, Sonnemans, and van Winden (2001)findings that team incentives lead to higher top performances. In our experiment, team RPF is needed in addition to team incentives in order to improve top performance and thereby compensate for the drop in performance observed when simply moving to team incentives.However, our results contrast with a field study byBandiera et al. (2013). They find that ranking teams reduces overall performance, as lower ranked teams decreased their productivity. Our experiment has important differences though, asBandiera et al. (2013)study this in a within-subject experimental design with endogenously formed teams, whereas we use a between-subject design with exogenously formed teams. They argue that the reduction in productivity is due to subjects starting to sort into teams based on ability rather than social ties, which leads to more free-riding in low productive teams with weaker social ties.4Hence, the reduction in performance in their study is likely to be driven by a factor not present in our study. Moreover, in a recent field experiment byChen and Gong (2018), it has been shown that teams formed endogenously exerted higher effort than exogenously formed teams. This supports the idea that social ties within an endogenously formed team affect effort per se.We alsostudy gendereffects. Previous literature has shown that gender is an important variable in order to understand competitive preferences (for an overview seeCroson and Gneezy, 2009;Bertrand, 2011). In particular, females tend to shy away from competitive settings and they are more risk averse than males (see e.g.,Niederle and Vesterlund, 2007;Charness and Gneezy, 2012). When faced with a competitive environment, males tend to respond positively, while females do not (Gneezy et al., 2003;Gneezy and Rustichini, 2004).Azmat and Iriberri (2016)also find that females are less responsive to individual RPF than males.Gender differencesin response to team RPF have not been studied, but it has been found that women are less averse to competition if they compete as teams rather than as individuals (Healy and Pate, 2011;Dargnies, 2012;Flory et al., 2015). Moreover, a recent experiment byKuhn and Villeval (2015)show that women are more likely than men to enter team-based environments. Our results complement this literature. . Indeed, we find that females respond negatively to individual RPF also in our study, but even more positively than males to team RPF. For males, team incentives have a strong negative effect compared to individual incentives, unless accompanied by team RPF. For females, incentives do not matter to the same degree. Team RPF has a strong positive effect regardless of the incentive system.On a more general level, our results can contribute to explaining why team incentives are so common, despite the well-known free-rider problem. A majority of firms in the US and UK report some use of teamwork in which groups of employees share the same goals or objectives, and the incidence of team work and team incentives has been increasing over time (see e.g.,Lazear and Shaw, 2007;Bandiera et al., 2013, and the references therein). Team incentives are puzzling because the individual incentive effect is quite small, and the temptation to free-ride on peers’ effort is high (Holmstrom, 1982). Empirical research shows, however, that team incentives do surprisingly well, and it has been hard to actually identify strong free-rider effects.5Peer pressure and team spirit is a common explanation for why team incentives work better than standard theory predicts.6AsAlchian and Demsetz (1972)notes “If one could enhance a common interest in non-shirking in the guise of team loyalty or team spirit, the team would be more efficient. The difficulty, of course, is to create economically that team spirit and loyalty”. Theorists have also investigated more formally how firms can create the kind of team spirit that Alchain and Demsetz call for.Kandel and Lazear (1992)introduce a peer pressure function and discusses how firms can manipulate peer pressure by e.g. investing in team spirit building activities.Akerlof and Kranton (2000,2005)incorporate identity into an otherwise standard utility function. They discuss how teams or firms can transform the workers’ identity from “outsiders” to “insiders” by creating common goals that each individual shares with their team or firm.Relative performance feedback to teams can be seen as a means of creating the kind of team spirit or identity discussed by these theorists. However, our results points to a different mechanism. Top performers respond strongly to relative performance feedback in our experiment, while the effect is insignificant for the other team members. Moreover, team leaders respond even when their peers do nothing. The theoretical framework we present indicate that our results are mainly driven by status concerns and/or competitive preferences rather than team spirit and peer pressure.To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the effect of relative performance feedback to teams in a laboratory experiment using a real effort task. However, our paper relates to a larger literature studying how intergroup competitions or comparisons affect intra group behavior. Social psychologists have argued that intergroup comparisons can motivate group members to increase the contribution to their own group (Turner, 1975). A number of experiments have supported this conjecture. Group competition can induce more cooperation (Bornstein and Ben-Yossef, 1994), less free-riding (Bornstein et al., 1990;Erev et al., 1993;Bornstein and Ben-Yossef, 1994), and better coordination (Bornstein et al., 2002). See also a recent survey bySheremeta (2018)on behavior in group contests and the references therein. Notably,Erev et al. (1993)find, using a field experiment, that prize competition between teams eliminates the free-rider effects of team incentives. We find a similar result, but with the important difference that our subjects compete without monetary prizes.Some recent papers find that intergroup comparisons can improve intragroup contributions even without monetary prizes.Tan and Bolle (2007),Burton-Chellew and West (2012), andBöhm and Rockenbach (2013)find that subjects contribute more to a public good if their group's contribution is compared to another group.7This clearly resembles and supports our findings on team RPF, but there are significant differences. Importantly, we conduct a real effort experiment where subjects have to work on a specific task, in contrast to the public goods experiments (PGEs) where “effort” is a simple decision variable. Moreover, the experiments citied above do not study the interaction effects between different incentive regimes and different feedback systems, which is our focus.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. InSection 2we present our experimental design. InSection 3we present a theoretical framework and provide some behavioral predictions.

"1. IntroductionUnderstanding what driveslabour force participationis of prime importance for policy makers and economists. Labour force participation measures the amount of labour available for production in a country. As it directly influences the potential growth of the economy, it is a key indicator of the health of the labour market.Labour force participation received renewed attention during theGreat Recession, when participation rates varied widely acrossOECDcountries.1Interestingly, while the unemployment rate increased almost everywhere, the evolution of participation rates diverged widely between Europe and the US. In the US, the labour force participation rate of prime-age adults declined by 2 p.p. between 2007 and 2013. In contrast, in the EU15, participation increased by 2 p.p. over the same period despite growing unemployment.2This increase in participation in Europe was almost entirely concentrated among females. Whereas in the US, the participation rate of prime age women decreased by 1.4 p.p. from 2007–2013, it increased by 8 p.p. in Spain, by 5 p.p. in Greece and by between 4 and 2 p.p. in Portugal, Austria, Italy and the UK, despite these economies plunging into a severe recession.We investigate in this paper what explains this rapid and spectacular evolution of participation rates in Europe during the Great Recession. While many studies document how changes in social norms and attitudes starting long before the Great Recession contributed to increasing the participation of women (see e.g.Bertrand et al., 2020, orFernández, 2013), our paper highlights the contribution of gender-specific shifts inlabour demandduring the Great Recession. We report that the decline in labour demand during the Great Recession appears to have been much more unfavourable to men relative to women in Europe compared with the US. As a consequence, we document that changes in relative labour demand can explain a large share of the increase in participation of women during that period, in particular in the countries most affected by the recession.Using individual-level data from ten European countries, we first document that as in the US (Foote and Ryan, 2015;Jaimovich and Siu, 2012), job polarization (which denotes the reallocation of employment towards the lowest- and highest-paying occupations) continued to increase during the Great Recession in Europe as the share of jobs in middle-paid occupations in total employment declined rapidly in the most affected countries. However, a key difference from the US is that even today men and women remain much more segregated by gender across occupations in Europe and that these higher segregation levels declined neither in recent decades nor during the Great Recession. In particular, as of 2013, middle-paid routine jobs, which were strongly affected by the recession, remained 20% more likely to employ male workers in Europe than in the US. In contrast, low- and high-paid occupations, which were much less affected by the recession, employed a much larger share of female workers. Thus, these figures suggest that the large destruction of middle-skill jobs produced a much more dramatic decline in the labour market opportunities of men in Europe than those in the US, whereas the fact that the lowest- and highest-paying occupations were less affected was more favourable to women.To quantify how much these differences in labour demand shocks by gender influenced the decision of women to join the labour market and explain their increase in participation during the Great Recession, we follow recent work and adopt a local labour market strategy.3Specifically, we relate regional changes in labour force participation by gender to local changes in male and female employment. However, changes in employment by gender are endogenous, as they are influenced not only by labour demand shocks but also by labour supply and participation decisions. To isolate labour demand shocks, we construct two shift-share or Bartikinstrumental variablesspecific to each gender. The logic of these widely used instruments is that, to some extent, the shock of the Great Recession varied by gender across regions because of the initial gendered differences in the composition of employment across occupations. These instruments are valid if the predicted labour demand shocks are unrelated to local unobserved factors influencing labour supply.An important but often neglected issue is that these large demand shocks should also influence the mobility of households across regions (Amior and Manning, 2018;Blanchard and Katz, 1992). Using a simple Roy model with endogenous location choice and participation decisions, we highlight that the mobility responses of households to gender-specific demand shocks should bias upward the coefficients capturing the effects on participation of female labour demand shocks.To address these issues, our main estimates exploit within-individual changes in participation during the Great Recession from panel data that we aggregate at the regional level. This implies that in contrast to estimates that use data from repeated cross-sections as in most of the literature, our estimates are not affected by endogenous changes in the observed or unobserved characteristics of the population across regions in response to labour demand shocks. The fact that regional changes in participation are obtained from within-individual variation also implies that our results are not explained by cross-cohort differences in attitudes towards the participation of women in the labour market.The empirical results confirm that it is important to distinguish demand shocks by gender to understand the increase in participation of women during the Great Recession. First, we find that during the Great Recession, the participation of married women countercyclically increased in response to the decline in labour demand for occupations more likely to employ men. Second, the participation of women also responded to local demand shocks to female labour demand. Women were much more likely to participate in the labour market in regions that experienced less decline in demand for jobs more likely to employ women.Across countries, the fit of the model is rather good because these regional-level shocks can account for most of the aggregate increase in participation of prime age married women during the Great Recession in France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, the UK and Finland in our sample. An important exception is Austria, where the model does not predict the observed increase in participation.When estimating similar models for men, we find that although negative demand shocks to occupations dominated by men are strong predictors of increases in their unemployment rates, these shocks explain little of the decline in male participation during the Great Recession.Adjusting for changes in the composition of the population across regions over this period also appears important, as we estimate that the population changes rapidly in response to labour demand shocks. In particular, the share of women with highereducation levelsincreased rapidly in regions that experienced positive demand shocks for jobs more likely to employ women. Consistent with our theoretical predictions, these changes in the composition of the regional population tend to bias cross-sectional estimates that use observed changes in participation. In particular, we obtain a much lower coefficient for the effect of male labour demand shocks and a coefficient that is twice as large for female labour demand shocks when we do not use within-individual variation to calculate aggregate changes in regional participation rates.One concern with empirical work based on shift-share or Bartik instruments is that the results might be driven by persistent trends across regions (Jaeger et al., 2018). To assess the relevance of this concern, we perform placebo regressions that test whether the demand shocks of the Great Recession from 2007 to 2013 that we use to estimate our model can explain earlier changes in participation from 2000 to 2006. We find little correlation between future shocks to labour demand for women and previous changes in female participation. We also show that our main results are robust to including past shocks in our baseline regression. In addition, when we extend the sample to include the decade before the Great Recession, our main results are robust to controlling for country- or region-specific trends.This paper builds on and contributes to several strands of literature. First, we extend and update the literature on gender segregation in the labour market in Europe by examining its recent evolution in the context of job polarization and the Great Recession.4We underline the persistence over that period of high levels of segregation relative to the US despite the important reallocations of employment across occupations.Second, we highlight that taking into account these higher levels of gender segregation across occupations in Europe helps to explain the evolution of labour force participation of women in Europe during the Great Recession. While some country-specific studies have emphasized the large countercyclical increase of the labour force participation of women in Europe during the Great Recession5, our study offers evidence from harmonized European panel data that allows for clear cross-country comparisons. Using harmonized cross-country data allows us to quantify the importance of labour demand shocks in the evolution of participation by gender across countries during the Great Recession, complementing existing studies, which have mostly focused on the US.6Third, our paper emphasizes the importance of the response of the population to large labour market shocks. Our estimates indicate substantial changes in the composition of the population in response to local demand shocks; it appears important to adjust for these changes when the estimates exploit differences across local labour markets.",Gregory,Guillaume,None
"1. IntroductionIt is well known that price is an important determinant of an individual's demand for higher education. Due to the ever-increasing costs of acquiring a traditional bachelor's degree, attending a state community college either to complete a terminal postsecondary degree or to later transfer to a four-year institution remains an attractive and popular route for many high school graduates in the United States. For most, however, community college education is not free. At present, most students, except those in the lowest income percentiles, are expected to incur some out-of-pocket college expenses.1The escalation of tuition and fees in recent decades has encouraged Tennessee, Oregon, and Minnesota to initiate plans to reverse this trend and provide free community college education across the board. Statewide tuition assistance policies have been designed to mitigate the cost pressures, increase college-going rates, and, ultimately, foster futureregional economicactivity.Tennessee, in particular, instituted the “Drive to 55” campaign in 2013 under Governor Haslam with an ambitious mission of bringing the share of Tennesseans possessing a college degree or certificate up to 55% by 2025. One prominent piece of “Drive to 55” is the Tennessee Promise program, which entails the coverage of tuitionandfees for high school graduates attending the state's two-year colleges. Conditional on several eligibility criteria, none of which is related to need or merit, high school students beginning with the graduating class of 2015 can now attend the state's two-year colleges at no cost via the ""last-dollar"" scholarship formula, whereby the parts of tuition fees not met by other federal and state aid programs are covered.In this study, we examine the enrollment impacts of Tennessee's novel program. FollowingCornwell et al. (2006), we shift the focus away from individual student outcomes and instead look at enrollment changes at the institution level. This analysis warrants attention, since statewide free-college programs like Tennessee Promise are large, and given that they target the entire population of high school students in the state as opposed to the marginal, highest-performing, or lowest-performing students, the intended effects of these programs are expected to be more general than what local estimates would indicate. In addition to appealing to state committees, our study is of interest to both researchers and college-level policymakers.While our main focus is on two-year institutions, we also conduct an auxiliary analysis on enrollment substitutability. The motivation is that if publicly funded programs like Tennessee Promise provide a truly credible signal, then we might expect a change in college preferences among high school seniors, which in turn might alter enrollment patterns at the state's four-year institutions, at least in the short run. This conjecture is at least descriptively corroborated by a notable fall in enrollment at branch campuses of the University of Tennessee, including the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga and the University of Tennessee at Martin, which was observed immediately following the inception of the Tennessee Promise program.Exploiting the timing of Tennessee's policy action, we employ quasi-experimental designs with the classic difference-in-differences (DID henceforth) estimator and the new generalized synthetic control (GSC henceforth) estimator to quantify thetreatment effects, with the latter approach being robust to a potential violation of the common-trends assumption. Our results indicate that the Tennessee Promise program has had a notable enrollment impact on the state's two-year institutions since its enactment. The analysis also reveals a significant increase in attendance among black and Hispanic students and some degree of enrollment substitutability across colleges in the short run.Our study contributes to both academic and policy discourse in meaningful ways. Whereas community colleges play a significant role in the US postsecondaryeducation system, previous research has largely focused on the impact of financial support on college outcomes among four-year institutions. By investigating a recent universal tuition-free policy within the two-year sector, we add new results to the expansive higher education funding literature and the modest yet fast-growing literature on college promise programs.Given the ongoing discussions on the concept of “free college” at the national level, our results for a statewide program like Tennessee Promise are timely and policy-relevant. As of March 2018, 16 states had at least one statewide free-college variant. Among these 16, 10 states had executed both enactment and funding, with eight enacting the program in 2017 alone.2It is predicted that Tennessee's action will provide lessons for other states to follow in the future. To this end, we highlight the most important similarities and differences between Tennessee Promise and other aid programs, including smaller-scale, residency-based projects as well as HOPE-style initiatives, to shed light on the future design of statewide free-college policies.3",Hieu,None,None
"1. IntroductionA tertiary-level education expansion creates a supply shock of graduates with R&D-specific skills in the labor market, giving firms easier and more opportunities to hire graduates for their R&D departments. Therefore, governments often expand tertiary-level education institutions to increase innovation and competitiveness through providing more future workers with the skills necessary for R&D activities (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, 2010,Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD, 2017). However, causal empirical evidence on the employment effects of tertiary education expansions is rare, particularly on how firms respond in terms of employing R&D personnel. Thus investigating whether and, if so, to what extent firms make use of workers with new R&D skills is very important. More specifically, analyzing whether firms employ more R&D personnel and increase overall spending on R&D personnel (as wages) is crucial.This paper analyzes how the educational supply shock resulting from the introduction of a particular type of tertiary education institution—University of Applied Sciences (UASs), which recruit their students from vocationalapprenticeshipgraduates and which both teach and conduct applied research—has affected firms’ employment in R&D in Switzerland. The government introduced UASs to provide graduates from dual apprenticeship programs (i.e., upper-secondary-level vocational education) with an educational upgrade to the tertiary level (Swiss Coordination Centre for Research in Education, SCCRE, 2018). Therefore, students at UASs are not comparable to students at other tertiary education institutions, because UAS students already have a sound vocational knowledge base through their secondary-levelvocational education. By obtaining a UAS degree, these students attain more advanced vocational and professional knowledge combined with applied research skills, often using them for, and in close cooperation with, local firms. Therefore, we expect the introduction of UASs to have different effects on firms’ R&D than the introduction of academic universities, which generally recruit their students from high school graduates. Due to the UASs’ close combination of a strong practical vocational knowledge base with applied research skills, we expect substantial effects on R&D and innovation, particularly in firms or regions that did not previously have a strong tradition of innovation.To identify the causal effect of the introduction of UASs, we exploit a quasi-random variation in the location and timing of the openings of UAS campuses in Switzerland in the 1990s. In so doing, we follow a growing literature that uses the openings of new tertiary education institutions as an identification strategy (e.g.,Jäger,Kamhfer, Schmitz, Westphal, 2019,Kyui, 2016,Pfister, Rinawi, Harhoff, Backes-Gellner, 2018,Toivanen, Väänänen, 2016). We apply a difference-in-differences (DiD) design to compare the employment of R&D personnel in treated firms (i.e., firms in labor market regions where a UAS campus has opened) to the employment of R&D personnel in untreated firms (i.e., firms in labor market regions where no UAS campus has opened).For our analysis, we draw on repeated cross-sectional data from the Swiss Earnings Structure Survey (ESS). This data allows us (a) to observe firms at the establishment level (i.e., at their different locations), which we need to identify treated and untreated locations, and (b) to precisely measure firms’ R&D personnel by providing information on the job tasks of individual workers and, in turn, on firms’ direct labor input dedicated to innovation activities. Through these unique ESS data features, we can investigate how the labor supply shock resulting from the introduction of UASs affects the employment of R&D personnel (measured as the percentage of a firm’s personnel with R&D tasks as their main job activity). Moreover, we can also investigate the effect on wages paid to R&D employees (measured as the percentage of the total wage sum paid to personnel with R&D tasks as their main job activity) in treated establishments in comparison to untreated establishments.Our analysis shows that firms affected by the opening of a UAS campus employ more R&D personnel and spend more money on R&D personnel, clearly engaging more intensively in R&D. This finding implies that firms located near a UAS campus use the R&D skills available in the labor market after the opening of the campus. Furthermore, we study whether these effects are heterogeneous across different types of firms and find that bothvery small firms(with 5–9 employees—and thus possibly start-ups) and very large firms (with 5,000 or more employees) profit from the introduction of UASs. These results show that an education expansion providing individuals with relevant practical skills in applied R&D can stimulate firms’ innovation activities. Particularly for small firms, the skills of UAS graduates constitute a valuable resource, enabling these firms to engage in or intensify their R&D activities.This paper contributes to three strands of the literature on how the skills available in local labor markets influence firms’ innovation activities. First, we contribute to the literature on the innovation effects of tertiary education institutions (which produce skills for local labor markets) by providing evidence on the innovation effect of introducing a new tertiary education institution that—compared to an academic university—teaches different types of skills to graduates of different types ofsecondary education. Despite numerous studies on the effect of academic universities on innovation (e.g.,Audretsch, Feldman, 1996,Cowan, Zinovyeva, 2013,Jaffe, 1989), no evidence exists on the effect of the structurally very different UASs—tertiary education institutions teaching graduates from dual apprenticeship programs and focusing on vocational and applied research knowledge—on innovation activities.Studies investigating the innovation effect of traditional academic universities, which teach high school graduates and focus on theoretical knowledge and basic research, confirm that firms gain from academic universities and that thesespilloversare concentrated in firms close to an academic university (e.g.,Andersson, Quigley, Wilhelmsson, 2009,Anselin, Varga, Acs, 1997,Autant-Bernard, 2001). Moreover, studies examining the innovation effect of academic universities focusing on technical knowledge in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)—universities that still teach graduates from high-school programs and that do not focus on vocational and applied research knowledge—show that these institutions raise, for example, the propensity for graduates to become inventors (Bianchi, Giorcelli, 2019,Toivanen, Väänänen, 2016). In addition, studies on the openings of U.S. colleges, some of which teach and conduct applied research but primarily to high school graduates, also show positive innovation effects (Andrews,Moretti, 2004).Nonetheless, all these tertiary education institutions structurally differ from the UASs we analyze in this paper. Although some of these institutions teach a certain amount of applied or STEM-related skills, they do not focus on students who are graduates from dual apprenticeship programs and who already have a solid practical vocational knowledge base from their three- to four-year education, which includes an apprenticeship in firms. Thus we specifically analyze the effects of the close combination of solid practical vocational skills from a dual apprenticeship program with applied research skills. Such a combination might have particularly sizable effects on R&D intensity and innovation in firms or regions that did not previously have a strong tradition of innovation.Second, we add to the literature that examines the importance of vocational skills for innovation activities by demonstrating that augmenting the skill base of vocationally trained workers with applied research skills contributes to innovation activities in firms that have access to the new type of graduates. Only few studies show that secondary-level vocational skills (i.e., those of graduates from dual apprenticeship programs) positively affect innovation in firms (e.g.,Meuer, Rupietta, Backes-Gellner, 2015,Rupietta, Backes-Gellner, 2019,Toner, 2010). Moreover,Cinnirella and Streb (2017), who study 19th-century Prussia, identify the knowledge of “master craftsmen” (a form of advanced skills in a specific occupation) as an important driver of technological development in that century. Our paper extends these findings by providing first evidence that augmenting secondary-level vocational skills (which UAS students alreay have from their dual apprenticeship training) with tertiary-level applied research skills has additional effects on firms’ innovation activities, as measured by an increase in R&D employment and intensity.Third, we extend the literature that assesses the innovation effect of tertiary education expansions (e.g.,Cowan, Zinovyeva, 2013,Leten, Landoni, Van Looy, 2014,Toivanen, Väänänen, 2016) by directly showing that firms’ use of the newly available skills for their R&D activities constitutes one mechanism underlying the innovation effect of tertiary education expansions. WhilePfister et al. (2018)find that the introduction of UASs in Switzerland increases innovation outcomes (as measured by patenting activities), we show that firms’ employing UAS graduates as an input for their R&D activities is a potential driver of the increase in innovation outcomes. Moreover, our results show that the particular skill combination of UAS graduates (sound practical vocational knowledge and applied research skills) forms an important missing link between vocationally trained middle-skilled workers in production and academically trained workers in R&D. Their presence helps increase innovation capabilities through a more effective combination of different types of knowledge and, consequently, more creative solutions to innovation problems (Backes-Gellner, Pfister, 2019,Schultheiss, Pfister, Backes-Gellner, Gnehm, 2019).The paper proceeds as follows:Section 2explains the institutional background of the introduction of UASs in Switzerland and hypothesizes how the resulting supply shock of skilled labor may influence firms’ R&D.Section 3describes our ESS data and our measures of R&D personnel.Section 4presents and discusses our DiD approach to identify thetreatment effect.Section 5reports the main results and further assesses whether the treatment effect is heterogeneous across different types of firms.Section 6concludes.",Patrick,Curdin,Uschi
"1. IntroductionRapid improvements in robot capabilities have fuelled concerns about the implications of robot adoption for jobs. While the creation of autonomous robots with flexible 3D movement continues to be a major challenge to engineers, rapid progress is being made. Robots can now perform a variety of tasks, such as sealing, assembling, and handling tools. As robot capabilities continue to expand and unit prices fall, firms are intensifying investment in robots (Frey and Osborne, 2017;Graetz and Michaels, 2018;Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2020). What is the impact of robot adoption onlabour demand? Do robots substitute for tasks previously performed by workers?The main contribution of this paper is to empirically study the impact of industrial robots on the occupational structure of the workforce acrossindustriesin a set of high-income as well as Emerging Market and Transition Economies (EMTEs). We combine a large and detailed occupations database with data on industrial robot deliveries from the International Federation of Robotics. The database on occupational employment fromReijnders and de Vries (2018)allows us to examine the share of employment in occupations with a high content of routine tasks – i.e. tasks that can be performed by following a well-defined set of procedures. We delineate occupations along two dimensions of the characteristics of tasks performed, namely ‘analytic’ versus ‘manual’, and ‘routine’ versus ‘non-routine’.1We thus distinguish four key occupational groupings, namely routine manual, routine analytic, non-routine manual, and non-routine analytic task-intensive occupations (as inAutor et al. 2003;Reijnders and de Vries 2018;Cortes et al. 2020). We followGraetz and Michaels (2018)in constructing measures of robot adoption by country-industry pairs and relate these to changes in occupational employment shares. Our sample covers 19 industries for 37 countries at varying levels of development from 2005 to 2015, and includes major users of industrial robots, such as the Peoples Republic of China (PRC), Japan, South Korea, Germany, and the United States. Our main finding is that country-industry pairs that saw a more rapid increase in robot adoption experienced larger reductions in the employment share of routine manual jobs.Our approach is motivated by the following economic considerations. Firms produce a variety of products using a continuum of tasks (Acemoglu and Autor, 2011), and these products differ in the number of tasks that can be performed by robots (Graetz and Michaels, 2018). For example, the share of replaceable tasks by robots differs between apparel and automotive and appears larger in the latter.2This gives rise to differences across industries in thetechnical feasibilityof robots substituting tasks previously performed by humans. Advances in machine capabilities expand the set of tasks carried out by machines (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2018). Firms will adopt robots if it is technically feasible and the profit gains exceed the costs of purchasing and installing robots. Given higher wages in advanced countries, the technical constraints to robots replacing tasks are more likely to bind for firms in these countries. Hence, improvements in robot capabilities would result in a larger employment response in advanced countries compared to developing countries.We use these economic insights in our analysis. In particular, the technical feasibility of adopting robots guides ourinstrumental variables(IV) strategy to identify the causal relation between robots and labour demand. Economic feasibility motivates our distinction of the impact of robot adoption between advanced and developing countries. Using two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimation, we find that robot adoption lowers the employment share of routine manual occupations. This relation is observed in high-income countries, but not in emerging market and transition economies.This paper relates to recent studies that examine the impact of robot adoption on socio-economic outcomes.Graetz and Michaels (2018)find that robot adoption contributed to anincrease in productivitygrowth across industries in high-income countries between 1993 and 2007. Their findings suggest that robot adoption did not reduce employment, which is corroborated in this paper. This is also observed byDauth et al. (2019), but not byAcemoglu and Restrepo (2020), who examine geographic variation in robot adoption across the United States and find that robots are labour replacing.Dauth et al. (2019)use detailed linked employer-employee data for Germany to show that displacement effects are cancelled out by reallocation effects, such that in the aggregate no employment effects from robot adoption are observed. Data availability did not allowGraetz and Michaels (2018)to examine the impact of robots on workers that perform different tasks. Yet,Autor (2015)emphasizes that workers with routine task-intensive occupations are most likely to be affected by automation. This paper aims to contribute to our understanding of the impact of robots on such occupational shifts.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.Section 2reviews the key theoretical mechanisms between automation and labour demand.Section 3describes the methodology and instrumental variables.Section 4documents patterns in the occupational structure of the workforce and robot adoption.Section 5empirically studies the impact of robot adoption on the task content of labour demand.Section 6concludes.",Gaaitzen,Elisabetta,Sébastien
"1. IntroductionAcross most developed economies, the occupational structure has shifted substantially over at least the last 30 years. This shift has typically seen employment decline in middle-earning occupations, and grow in jobs at the top of the wage distribution. Employment has also grown, to a lesser extent, in low-paying jobs, giving rise to a pattern of ‘polarization’.1This noticeable polarization has been attributed to a number of causes, such as changes to patterns of trade or to the task requirements in production. Testing the causes of polarization at even the most basic level requires examining the equilibrium movement across sectors of both employment and labour returns. Yet, although the patterns ofemployment changesare clear, the evidence on wages is harder to interpret. Exactly because of the large changes to employment, average wages observed across sectors are likely driven by composition effects. Intuitively, if employment in a sector grows, it is likely that new entrants are of different average quality to the incumbents. It is therefore important to look beyond average wages, and to identify the pure (selection- or composition-free) prices on labour. This distinction between average wages and the price on labour has long been made by labour economists. Within the polarization literature this distinction has recently been emphasized byAcemoglu and Autor (2011)andGottschalk et al. (2016)among others.In this paper we make two contributions. First we estimate underlying prices of broadoccupational groupsusing panel data for two important economies: the UK and Germany. In both countries we find that these prices deviate significantly from observed average wages. Importantly, in both countries, we find that price changes are noticeably positively associated with employment growth across sectors. Meanwhile if we compare employment changes not with prices but with changes to average wages, this association disappears. Overall, our evidence is consistent with occupational shifts being caused by changes in the demand for different types of labour, such as by changes to technology. Our evidence also therefore highlights the importance of identifying underlying prices when considering hypotheses about the labour market. Ours is the first paper to provide consistent evidence across countries on these task price movements.A corollary of these results is that the average quality of workers across different sectors has changed substantially over time. Our second contribution, therefore, is to demonstrate these changes by providing additional evidence that goes beyond wage data. Specifically we examine two markers of individual productivity: cognitive ability scores and height. Both these markers are strongly correlated with labour market outcomes. While cognitive ability is possibly a closer and more obvious indicator of productive skills, height is extremely useful for the present application: it is highly stable within individuals over time; comparable across surveys, and, compared to cognitive scores, less sector-specific. Using both measures, and consistent with the evidence from wage data, we find evidence of changes in composition. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first paper to provide explicit evidence of changing sorting over time based on individual measures of worker quality in this context.2In common with much of the literature, we group broad occupations according to their predominant task. Specifically we divide jobs into four categories, depending on whether or not the occupation is predominantly intensive in cognitive versus manual tasks along one axis, and whether or not it is highly routine along the other. In both countries, we see most prominently a rapid increase in cognitive and non-routine (‘abstract’) employment. We also see a decline in middle-earning routine-manual occupations among males. Correspondingly, in both countries we see a striking increase in the relative price on abstract labour, not matched by changes in observed wages. An implication of these results from wage data is that it is the average quality of workers in abstract occupations that has declined most strongly over time. Our results are robust to allocating jobs to tasks not by broad occupation but at a finer level of detail.3To study wages, we use data from the British Household Panel Survey over 1991–2008, and from the German Socio-Economic Panel over 1985–2013. These periods are noteworthy because they feature particularly large changes in occupational composition. To estimate the task prices we use a standard wage model, in which a worker is endowed with differing productivities across sectors, and therefore makesoccupational choicesgiven aggregate prices and unobservable individual-specific returns. The model nests, and follows the logic of, a standard Roy framework. The model also allows for frictions, such as costs of switching occupations or jobs. As is standard, by using the panel data structure we net out the time-invariant unobservable components and provide estimates of the prices that are free of selection effects. Our approach follows that used byCortes (2016)to study task prices in the US, as well as other studies in related settings.4Our analysis of price changes has three main strengths. First, we go beyondCortes (2016)in providing robust support for the empirical evidence, by introducing extensive controls for observable characteristics. Second, we extend the analysis to look at prices at a finer level of occupational aggregation. We find that patterns of employment and prices at this finer detail can be easily reconciled. Finally, by using a consistent occupational classification, we provide coherent evidence across countries. As is shown later, the UK and Germany experienced job polarization to differing degrees: our evidence provides a unified and coherent explanation of the movements of task prices and employment across both countries combined.We supplement our results with direct evidence of changes in worker quality in both countries across sectors. For the UK we augment our data with especially rich information on personal characteristics available in around 2010 from the Understanding Society survey. Despite the rich information available in both countries, data limitations require us to adapt our framework somewhat. To use the data to their fullest, we focus our analysis not on occupation but on education. Our favoured analysis shows that the average height of males with a degree has declined relative to those without a degree. To support this analysis, we show that in both countries degree holding has been a stable proxy for working in the abstract sector. Overall, we infer from our results that the quality of ‘knowledge workers’ has declined over time.Using the UK’s rich data, we validate this result in several ways. First we use the cognitive ability test scores, also collected in 2010. In a related way to heights, we argue that the average cognitive score of degree holders has declined, relative to non-degree holders, over time. However, although cognitive ability is arguably a more direct measure of worker skills than height, it is sector-specific, less stable over time and less easy to compare across surveys. For these reasons, and because appropriate comparable data for Germany are sparse, we use the analysis of cognitive ability as supportive evidence. Second, we combine our main data source on heights, which was collected around 2005 and 2010, with an additional set of measures taken in 1991, from the UK’s National Child Development Survey, to provide a repeated cross-section. Our results using education are confirmed. Most importantly, we show that height patterns are similar when we define sectors by occupation, although the sample sizes used here are smaller, and consequently estimates are less precise. Overall, we provide evidence of changes in quality compositions that is strong and robust.Our paper relates most closely to recent papers which estimate prices on tasks using panel data. BesidesCortes (2016),Yamaguchi (2018)also uses data from the PSID and controls for unobserved skills by conditioning on full labour market histories. In ongoing work,Böhm et al. (2019)use administrative panel data from Germany, and build a rich structural framework with which they identify not only task price movements but also life-cycleskill formation. They identify both components simultaneously by partitioning their long panel and exploiting time variation in the underlying changes tolabour demand. Relative to their work, our work provides cross-country evidence and explores individual characteristics. In terms of substantive results, it is reassuring thatBöhm et al.’s findings on task price movements are similar to ours and also show a substantial divergence from observed average wages.In addition to the papers using panel data, further papers employ contrasting approaches using repeated cross-sections. Of these,Gottschalk et al. (2016)use data on new entrants to the labour market from the US Current Population Survey. They estimate bounds on prices, taking into account selection effects, by trimming the observed wage distributions. Second,Böhm (2020)addresses selection into sectors using a ‘propensity index’ method. He uses data on ability scores in the US National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to model occupational choice. The main problem with both approaches is that it is difficult to control successfully for changing characteristics of successive cohorts. In particular, not only has the employment structure in the US shifted, but so has the composition of educational attainment. In our context, and as discussed in both countries, degree holding and occupational attainment have increased in parallel. By tracking the same workers over time, the panel-data approach used here by-passes issues surrounding educational composition completely.5More generally, our paper relates to the large literature on job polarization, recently discussed inAutor (2015). Of particular relevance isSalvatori (2015), who examines the UK,Dustmann et al. (2009)andAntonczyk et al. (2009), who discuss Germany, whileBeaudry et al. (2016)address somewhat contrasting patterns in the US in the 2000s. Our paper also relates to important literatures on the evolution ofinequalityin the UK, and particularly in Germany. In addition toDustmann et al. (2009),Card et al. (2013)emphasize the increased sorting of workers in Germany across establishments. Finally, our paper relates to the literature on labour market returns to individual characteristics. Perhaps most notable areHeckman et al. (2006)on cognitive and other abilities, andCase and Paxson (2008)andPersico et al. (2004)on height.The rest of the paper is organized as follows.Section 2describes the wage model and places it in the context of wider theoretical debates.Section 3describes the labour market data and shows patterns of wages and employment across the UK and Germany.Section 4presents the main results on task prices.Section 5shows results using individual measures of quality before the final section,6, concludes. Extensive appendices provide further details, results, tests and robustness exercises for various features of our analysis. In particular in Appendix A.3 we show some comparable results for the US.",Chiara,Ben,None
"I. IntroductionThe extensive literature on the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in the United States – a program that substantially subsidizes earnings in low-income families with children – has focused nearly exclusively on short-term effects. This literature establishes that a more generous EITC increases employment for less-educated, single mothers (e.g.,Meyer, 2010), who are important target recipients of the program. Other research shows that these work incentives lead topovertyreductions even without taking account of the income from the credit (Neumark and Wascher, 2011). Both types of effects are important and establish a strong case for the EITC as a pro-work, anti-poverty policy.1The presence of such short-run labor market effects suggests the EITC could also affect outcomes in the longer run. Specifically, the positive employment effects for low-skill, single mothers could increase labor market experience in the longer-run, boosting earnings via greater human capital accumulation; other types of investment, including more intensive search for better paying jobs with stronger prospects for earnings growth, could also be spurred by a more generous EITC that has positive short-term effects on employment. Such long-run increases in earnings would provide an additional policy rationale for the EITC: early expenditures raise short-term employment, and higher earnings in the long-run increase economic self-sufficiency, likely coupled with higher income tax receipts and reduced dependence on the EITC or other government assistance, helping to offset the earlier expenditures.The predicted short-run effects of the EITC on married (or higher-earning) women are in the opposite direction.2The evidence ranges from no or modest negativelabor supply effectsto more sizable labor supply reductions (e.g.,Eissa and Liebman, 1996;Hoffman and Seidman, 2003). Of course, even small short-run effects could potentially accumulate into larger effects over the longer run.We test for evidence of longer-run effects of the EITC, adopting a very long-run perspective. Given that EITC payments depend on number of children (directly) and marital status (indirectly, via the spouse's income), we must be able to observe a woman's childbearing and marital history in order to capture the long-run effects of the EITC. The need to capture this history, combined with the requirement to capture state variation in the EITC based on state of residence, dictates our use of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). Specifically, we use longitudinal data on marriage and children from the PSID to characterize women's exposure to the federal and state Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) from ages 22-39 – corresponding roughly to their first two decades of adulthood when women bear children as well as a large share of the period when they raise children. We then use measures of this exposure to estimate the long-run effects of the EITC on women's earnings and related labor market outcomes as mature adults, defined here as age 40.Although the small sample size in the PSID leads to some imprecision in estimates that makes drawing firm conclusions a challenge, we find evidence suggesting that exposure to a more generous EITC when women were unmarried and had older (school-age) children leads to higher earnings in the longer-run. We also find corresponding evidence suggesting that longer-run exposure of unmarried mothers to a more generous EITC increases cumulative labor market experience (using a subset of our primary sample for which we can measure this). Finally, we find evidence to suggest that exposure to a more generous EITC when women had children while married leads to lower earnings and hours in the longer-run.3We base our analyses on a difference-in-difference-in-differences specification measuring the presence of children and marital status across ages 22-39 and exposure to the EITC. From this simple specification, we add two elements: one better captures the labor market incentives of the EITC (age of a woman's youngest child); and the second may more cleanly identify policy effects (separate federal and state maximum credits). We subject this preferred specification to a number of checks meant to account for endogenous behavior or policy, a placebo test, and a number of robustness/sensitivity analyses. Among these checks, we include alternative parameterizations of EITC generosity and checking whether the results reflect changes in other anti-poverty policies. These analyses show that the findings are robust, and bolster a causal interpretation of the evidence, although there are some limitations to how rigorously we can establish causal effects, which could be addressed in future research.",David,Peter,None
"1. IntroductionMonopsonypower of employers in labor markets is not a new subject for labor economists, but prior work has generally focused on specific occupational markets thought to be specialized and therefore prone to employer power over a captive or semi-captive workforce (e.g.Matsudaira, 2013,Staiger, Spetz, Phibbs, 2010, andRansom and Sims, 2010), or it has focused specifically on the low-wage labor market in the context of changes to the legislated minimum wage (e.g.Dube et al., 2010). In this article, we quantify the level of labor market concentration across nearly all occupations and for every commuting zone in the US, using the near-universe of online job vacancies for 2016 from Burning Glass Technologies (BGT). Based on findings in this and other work, we argue that concentration measured this way is a useful index of employers’ market power.Calculating concentration in labor markets presupposes a market definition. In order to ascertain a rule of thumb for market definition in the labor context, we perform a hypothetical monopsonist test, analogous to the hypothetical monopolist test used for product market definition in the antitrust literature. The essence of such a test is to ask whether, for a given market definition, significant wage suppression would be profitable for an employer monopsonizing that market. The profitability of wage suppression depends on how many workers will leave in the face of wage suppression, i.e. the labor supply elasticity to the candidate market. In other words, conditional on other parameters oflabor demand(firm productivity, output price, etc.), variation in the firm-level labor supply elasticity will generate variation in the monopsonistic wage markdown. Thus, we can make use of estimates of the labor supply elasticity corresponding to various market definitions to determine the right definition for our concentration calculations. Ultimately, we utilize as our main market definition a commuting zone-by 6-digit SOC occupation-by quarter market definition. We also present results for alternative market definitions.The relationship between market definition, labor supply elasticity, and measured concentration of employers suggests that there is more than one way to measure employer market power.Azar et al. (2019b)show that higher market concentration is correlated with lower firm-specific labor supply elasticity, which is consistent with a theory of oligopsonistic labor markets in which employers compete for workers a laCournot. It is intuitive that markets with fewer employers would result in fewer outside options for existing workers, and hence greater wage-setting power for incumbent firms. While in some models, firm-specific labor supply elasticity may be a more primitive parameter and market concentration of employers an equilibrium outcome, their close association in the data, in addition to the fact that concentration may be more readily measurable, creates a justification for both measuring concentration and using it as an index of market power.Using the vacancy data from BGT, we calculate Herfindahl Hirschman Indices (HHIs) for labor markets at the occupation (6-digit SOC), commuting zone, and quarterly level. The average market has an HHI of 4378, which is the equivalent of 2.3 recruiting firms with equal shares of the total vacancy pool. 60% of markets have concentration greater than 2500. Note that a market with four firms and equal market shares has an HHI of 2,500, so an HHI of 2500 is the equivalent of 4 recruiting firms with equal shares of the total vacancy pool. Another 11% of markets have an HHI between 1500 and 2,500. Inantitrust law, a market above 2500 HHI is highly concentrated and it is moderately concentrated between 1500 and 2500 HHI (Department ofJustice/ Federal Trade Commission 2010 horizontal merger guidelines). Under that definition, 60% of US markets are thus highly concentrated.When we weight markets by BLS total employment, we find that 16 percent of workers work in highly concentrated labor markets, and a further 7 percent work in moderately concentrated markets. Concentration is lower in large commuting zones, which explains why weighting by employment lowers the prevalence of high concentration.We also calculate concentration for a number of alternative market definitions in terms of occupation, location, and time. According to several plausible alternative market definitions, we find that at least 40% of markets are highly concentrated. We then perform several descriptive regressions of measured concentration on wages (using both BGT and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Occupational Employment Statistics data). We show a robust negative association between concentration and wages, using both occupation and commuting zonefixed effectsand controlling for the demand state of the labor market. The negative association between concentration and wages is a sign that concentration is at least an indicator of employer market power.Finally, we show that there is no robust relationship between concentration and several measures of occupational skill, signifying that labor markets are not more or less concentrated (given our market definition) for lower- or higher-skill jobs. From this work, at least, there’s no reason to believe that lower skill workers are any less subject to employers’ monopsony power, or vice versa.Our measure of concentration is distinct from theindustryconcentration measures used byAutor et al. (2020),Barkai (2019), and other work purporting to show declining competition in themacroeconomyand sector-by-sector. Our measure is based on concentration in the labor market rather than concentration in the product market, and we make no claim about its long-term time trend given the available data. Our contribution is the first economy-wide measure of labor market concentration to have been made in many decades.1The papers that come closest to our approach includeAzar et al. (2020),Benmelech et al. (2020),Qiu and Sojourner (2019), andRinz (2018).Azar et al. (2020)examine the impact of concentration on wages but rely on only 17 occupations from one single job board, CareerBuilder.com. Due to these data limitations, that paper could not discuss and measure the sensitivity of concentration to alternative market definitions, or assess the overall level of concentration in the US.Benmelech et al. (2020)use Census data formanufacturing industriesto measure employment concentration (as opposed to vacancy concentration) and its negative effect on wages.Rinz (2018)calculates labor market concentration by commuting zone and industry for the whole economy and investigates its impact on wageinequality.Benmelech et al. (2020)andRinz (2018)focus on industries for defining labor markets, whereas we use six-digit SOC occupations.2In contrast toBenmelech et al. (2020),Qiu and Sojourner (2019)andRinz (2018), we measure concentration using job openings rather than employment because we view vacancies as a better gauge of how likely searching workers (whether employed or unemployed) are to receive a job offer. Recent studies show that workers remain in jobs for longer.3The corollary is that jobs are vacated less frequently, and so the concentration of employment may be a less relevant gauge of available work and employer market power than is the concentration of vacancies among the relatively few firms who are likely to be hiring at any given time. We further discuss this issue inSection 2.1. In theory, the wages for new hires are likely to be more flexible and sensitive to market conditions, be theymacroeconomicfluctuations or changes in the degree of employer power, and so they offer a more variable indicator of the outcome of interest for tests of employer power. However, if vacancy-based concentration is a measure of employer power, it should also affect the wages of currently-employed workers. We use earnings from the Occupational Employment Statistics and show that our vacancy-based measure of concentration has essentially the same effect on the earnings of all workers as on the earnings posted by vacancies on BGT.The previously-mentioned papers estimating a relationship between labor market concentration and wages or earnings may all suffer from identification problems (seeBerry et al., 2019), althoughBenmelech et al. (2020)are able to control for employer characteristics that are usually considered to be the threats to identification in concentration-outcome regressions using market-level variation. But two recent papers,Arnold (2019)andPrager and Schmitt (2019), use observedmergersas plausibly exogenous variation in concentration unrelated to firm-specific characteristics or market demand parameters to identify a wage effect.Arnold (2019)does so for what is essentially the universe of mergers in the Longitudinal Business Database, whilePrager and Schmitt (2019)focus on hospital mergers and workers in occupations employed by hospitals. Both find a significant negative effect of merger-induced concentration on wages, showing that increases in concentration are relevant to merger assessment, as discussed byMarinescu and Hovenkamp (2019).Section 2describes the Burning Glass data,Section 3addresses market definition for labor markets, andSection 4gives our estimates of labor market concentration.Section 4.1correlates our labor market concentration estimates with vacancy- and market-level wages.Section 4.2relates those concentration estimates to other occupation-level variables, to ascertain whether employer market power differs systematically across observable characteristics of occupations.Section 5places our results in the larger debate over inter-firm inequality and employer power in labor markets, andSection 6concludes.",José,Ioana,Marshall
"1. IntroductionThe choice of how long and what to study is among the most important investment decisions that a typical person makes during her lifetime. Thus it is not surprising that many policy makers, commentators and parents worry about students’ ability to make the ”right” choices. Indeed, there appears to be widespread concern that many students lack information about the economic consequences of their educational choices and thus do not acquire the type of skills for which there is demand in the labor market. Many governments have responded to these concerns by running schemes that aim to improve the information available to students.1In this paper, we argue that while information interventions can yield substantial belief updating—and may affect some students’ behavior—they may have a limited impact on the allocation of students into post-secondary programs. We reach this conclusion with the help of a large randomized field experiment that provided Finnish high school students accurate information about the earnings distributions, employment rates, and the most common occupations associated with detailed post-secondary educational degrees. After receiving this information, roughly a third of the treatment group students report to have updated their beliefs. Furthermore, the intervention pushed students who were the most likely to hold unrealistically positive expectations on the labor market prospects of their preferred programs to apply to programs associated with higher earnings. However, this group of affected students appears to be small. Thus we fail to find a statistically or economically significant impacts on the overall application or enrollment patterns.Our experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that the match between educational choices and the demand for skills in the labor market can be enhanced by providing information on the population outcomes associated with alternative degrees. This hypothesis is based on earlier work showing that information interventions can have large effects on the likelihood of continuing insecondary educationin developing countries (Jensen, 2010,Nguyen) and that they affect students’ beliefs and intentions in developed countries (Baker, Bettinger, Jacob, Marinescu, 2018,McGuigan, McNally, Wyness, 2016,Oreopoulos, Dunn, 2013,Peter, Zambre, 2017,Wiswall, Zafar, 2015). However, evidence on the effect of providing information on labor market prospects onactualeducational choices remains scarce.In our experiment, we contacted student guidance counselors working in 97 randomly chosen Finnish high schools and offered them an information package and related lecture materials. In the 64 high schools that chose to participate, more than 5000 students sat through an obligatory class given as a part of their standard curriculum. During the class, students listened to a student guidance counselor’s presentation on the differences in the distribution of earnings and employment rates between different post-secondary degrees. They also completed a survey where they were asked about their preferences and expectations. Along with the survey, the students were given a leaflet reporting the distribution of earnings, employment rates, and the most common occupations among the current population of 30–34-year-old persons by 104 most common post-secondary degrees. Furthermore, they were given the supplementary material at the end of the class to consult at home. The experiment was implemented 5–6 months before the students applied to post-secondary programs.The Finnish highereducation systemprovides a particularly informative setting for our experiment, because students apply directly to degree programs (including professional degrees such as medicine and law). Thus, the choices that we observe at the admission stage are closely connected with the education that the students will have when they enter the labor market. The universities choose their students based on transparent and uniform criteria based solely on the credits derived from the national final high school exam and the university’s own entrance examination. The importance of the entry exams—which are typically based on material not covered in high school—means that the students participating in our intervention have not yet critically limited their choice set of post-secondary degrees. In particular, pre-intervention grades or any other kind of assessment by their high school teachers are not used as admission criteria. Furthermore,credit constraintsare unlikely to complicate our analysis because Finnish universities do not charge tuition fees, and the government offers generous subsidies to students who gain entry to higher education. In short, we examine the impacts of the intervention on the relevant educational choices in a transparent, flexible, and simple setting.The choice of field of study is likely to have important implications for earnings and employment outcomes in the Finnish context. The differences in average earnings across graduates from different fields are nearly as large in Finland as the differences reported byAltonji et al. (2012)for the United States. Even though we are unable to provide the treatment school students with personalized estimates of their individual returns to education in different fields, we argue that providing them information on the earnings distribution by fields can help them form more accurate estimates of their potential earnings. Furthermore, our subsample and survey results suggest that the control group was unlikely to receive similar information through other channels. This interpretation is also supported by the fact that such information was not publicly available but had to be acquired from Statistics Finland with significant financial and effort costs.Another major advantage of the Finnish context is that we can use the national application registry to evaluate the intervention’s impact. These data cover all applications to Finnish universities and polytechnics over several years and allow us to study the effects separately on applications and final enrollments and to check for the robustness of our results when controlling for the baseline educational choices at the school level. Access to register data also means that we avoid attrition problems and obtain high statistical power. Furthermore, we do not need to convince the control schools to participate without receiving any of the potential benefits. However, these gains come with the inevitable cost of not obtaining survey data for the control group.Our experimental results show that, on average, the information intervention did not affect the likelihood of being enrolled in a post-secondary program or the type of programs where the students were enrolled. Furthermore, the application patterns among students graduating from the treatment and control school are indistinguishable. The point estimates are close to zero and sufficiently precise to rule out economically significant effects.To understand why the intervention had little average impact, we turn to the survey data collected as part of the experiment. The results show that while students value many dimensions of alternative degrees, four-fifths report that future earnings are an important factor in their educational choice. Importantly, these data reveal similar belief updating as has been documented in the previous literature cited above. Roughly a third of the respondents in our survey declared that they were surprised about the labor market prospects associated with the program to which they intended to apply, and approximately 19% state that these prospects were worse than they had expected. Moreover, among the students who allowed us to link their survey answers to the application register, we find that this belief updating was correlated with their later choices: those who had been negatively surprised were more likely to change the field that they actually applied to than the rest of the treatment school students. We interpret these findings as evidence of the intervention conveying information to the students.The correlation between being negatively surprised and changing plans later in our survey data also suggests that the intervention may have affected the behavior of the subgroup of students who were disappointed about the labor market prospects of their intended field. Unfortunately, we cannot directly compare surprised students in the treatment group with those in the control group who would have been surprised if they had received the information intervention. Instead, we take an indirect approach using the linked survey-register data. Using information available in the application register for the full student population—demographics, subjects taken in the nationalmatriculationexam, and school characteristics—we predict the likelihood of being negatively surprised about earnings in the first program of choice. We then estimate thetreatment effectsfor subgroups that differ in this predicted likelihood. The results suggest that the students who were most likely to be negatively surprised started to apply to programs associated with higher earnings. However, this subgroup is too small to affect the average treatment effect estimates significantly.These results add to the growing literature evaluating interventions designed to improve the efficiency of educational choice. In addition to the papers cited above, existing work closest to our own isHastings et al. (2015), who provided information about costs and returns associated with different degrees using an online tool incorporated into the student aid application procedure in Chile. They find that the intervention decreased demand for low-return degrees—typically provided by for-profit institutions—among low-SES, low-achieving students. In contrast, there appears to be little or no effect for high-SES students. This suggests that the difference in the average effect of their study, in comparison to ours, is likely driven by differences in the distribution of students background and the supply of higher education rather the specific form of the interventions.2The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the following two sections, we describe the institutional context and the information intervention. We then discuss the findings from the survey conducted among the students in our treatment schools. The fifth section discusses the applications register and our estimation methods and reports the results.Section 6concludes.",Sari,Tuomas,Matti
"1. IntroductionWe have seen considerable advances in women's education in recent years (DiPrete and Buchmann, 2013;Goldin et al., 2006).Women's earningsin the U.S. climbed from 60% of men's earnings to over 80% between 1980 and 2014 (Blau and Kahn, 2017). Despite the improvement in women's human capital, the gender wage gap remains large and has been attributed to discrimination, occupation segregation, and combination of both (Petersen and Morgan 1995;Altonji and Blank 1999;Bertrand and Hallock 2001;Bertrand et al., 2010;Cardoso et al., 2016).1Women are underrepresented inacademiaand their progress in pursuing an academic career has been slow. In 2015, 35% of new PhDs, 28% of assistant professors, 24% of associate professors, and 12% of full professors in economics in the U.S. were female (McElroy, 2016). Only 32% of entering economic Ph.D. students in the U.S. are female (Boustan and Langan, 2019). At the same time, female scientists are less likely to get tenure, are viewed as less competent, and receivelower payand research funding (Boustan and Langan, 2019;Ellemers, 2014;Van der Lee and Ellemers, 2015;Kaatz et al., 2014;Shen, 2013;Valian, 1999).Universities have increasingly relied on student evaluations of teaching (SET) as a measure of teaching performance in hiring andpromotiondecisions. However, SET reflects students' subjective assessment of teaching quality, which can potentially be influenced by prejudice, stereotypes, or misperceptions of women's ability to perform tasks, especially in male-dominated fields. Studies have shown that students characterize female instructors as being warm, nurturing, more like teachers than professors, while male instructors are perceived as more knowledgeable and being able to contribute to students' intellectual development (Bennett, 1982;Heilman and Okimoto, 2007;Young et al., 2009;Boring, 2017). Biased feedback misleads female instructors to allocate more resources toward teaching that further reduces the time for research. Gender bias in SET constitutes a form ofinequalitythat adversely affects the career advances of female instructors.The literature has shown that SET is biased against women (Bray and Howard, 1980;Basow and Silberg, 1987;Basow, 1995;Miller and Chamberlin, 2000;Potvin et al., 2009;Wagner et al., 2016;Boring, 2017;Mengel et al., 2019).Buser et al. (2019)find that gender bias in SET changes throughout the semester as students respond to feedback from male and female instructors differently. However, the mechanisms leading to the bias and shaping the dynamics of the evaluation scores remain unclear and deserve further investigation. One source of gender bias originates from taste- or prejudice-based discrimination, while the alternative mechanism is statistical discrimination that arises when female instructors are underrepresented. Students rely on stereotypes when assessing teaching effectiveness because they lack information on the actual productivity of female instructors.Studies of the role model effect show that low representation of female faculty discourages female students from pursuing a career in the field. The share of women on faculty is positively related to the share of female Ph.D. students in the department (Boustan and Langan, 2019). Female students perform better in STEM classes and are more likely to take advanced STEM courses when their introductory level professors are females (Bettinger and Long, 2005;Dee, 2005;Holmlund and Sund, 2008;Hoffmann and Oreopoulos, 2009;Porter and Serra, 2020).This paper goes beyond the findings in earlier studies to disentangle the mechanisms through which the gender bias in SET arises using administrative data from the National University of Kaohsiung (NUK). We adopt the employer learning model to test for statistical discrimination (Arrow, 1973;Lundberg and Startz, 1983;Altonji and Blank, 1999;Pinkston, 2003;Altonji and Pierret, 2001). To our knowledge, this is the first paper that attempts to present evidence of statistical discrimination in SET and address the dynamics of evaluation scores for male and female instructors.2We identify gender bias in SET by exploiting the institutional setting in which students are required to take the required courses in the department. This unique feature mitigates the problem of self-selection into classes that have plagued some earlier studies.The employer learning model predicts that the effect of instructor gender on teaching evaluations diminishes with experience, while the impact of teaching effectiveness on evaluation scores rises with experience. Students learn an instructor's teaching effectiveness over time via class participation, word of mouth, and the instructor's reputation. FollowingChetty et al. (2014)andKane and Staiger (2008), we construct time-varying VA (value-added) to thecurrent courseas the benchmark measure of teaching effectiveness. More importantly, we propose time-varying VA tofollow-on coursesto mitigate the concern over the potential endogeneity in our benchmark VA that occurs when instructors strategically inflate the current course grades to improve the evaluation SET scores (Sabot and Wakeman-Linn, 1991;Anglin and Meng, 2000;Achen and Courant, 2009;Bar et al., 2009;Li and Zafar, 2020).This study makes two key contributions to the literature. First, little is known for the role of statistical discrimination in gender bias in SET. We fill the gap by decomposing the gender bias into sources driven by taste-based and statistical discrimination when the endogeneity of VA is considered simultaneously. The results show the extent to which improvements in faculty gender ratio alleviate gender bias in teaching evaluations. The paper also investigates the dynamics of SET scores by showing that male and female instructors are evaluated differentially by students over time. The analyses shed new lights for institutions to recognize the gender gap in SET and improve teaching evaluations that have failed to reflect such differences across faculty genders.Second, although recent studies use random assignment to instructors to identify the causal effect (Kang, 2007;Carrell and West, 2010;Eisenkopf et al., 2015;MacNell et al., 2015;Boring, 2017;Mengel et al., 2019), the evidence mainly comes from the U.S. and Europe. Generalization of their results is limited because random assignments are either confined to a small number of courses or implemented in one college. Instructor backgrounds are also quite heterogeneous, including full-time and part-time professors, lecturers, professionals, Ph.D., and non-PhD students. Gender bias in SET may reflect differences in academic training across instructors. By contrast, our data consist of courses from all departments between 2002 and 2015. Moreover, all full-time instructors have a Ph.D. degree, which substantially reduces the impact of instructors' academic qualifications on SET.Table 1provides a snapshot of the relationship between the gender gap in SET and the share of male instructors (students) in the department.3The gender gap widens as the department becomes more male-dominated in both faculty and students. A ten percentage point increase in the share of male instructors (students) increases the gender gap in SET by 0.02 (0.03), a 31% (36%) jump from the sample mean. The results demonstrate that the underrepresentation of female faculty is positively related to the gender bias in SET.Table 1.

We study changes in SET scores six semesters before and after the tenure promotion by instructor gender. Zero value on the horizontal axis indicates the time of promotion. The evaluation scores of male instructors are similar throughout the period. Nonetheless, the evaluation scores received by female instructors surge right after the promotion and surpass the scores of male counterparts. Tenure promotion, an advance in academic reputation, may change how students evaluate the academic qualifications of female instructors. In other words, new information on women's productivity can lead to stereotype change.Download :Download high-res image (273KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1.

"1. IntroductionThe rise in income andwealthinequalityover the last few decades has been heavily documented —seePiketty and Saez (2003),Atkinson et al. (2011)and more recentlyAlvaredo et al. (2017). An important feature of this rise is that it has been fast, especially in the United States. In a recent contribution,Gabaix et al. (2016)show that a standard random growth model is not able to replicate such a fast increase in topincome inequality. Modifications of the random growth process to include ”superstar” effects help the model achieve a faster transition to a higher level of inequality. Another feature of the recent rise in income inequality is that it sparked an intense debate about potential ways to curb this fast rise in inequality. Most of the debates have centered around usingtaxesto achieve this goal —Piketty et al. (2014),Scheuer and Werning (2017).The question that arises naturally is the following: if such policies to curb income inequality are going to be carried out, what are going to be their effects? If we consider markets for superstars, risk taking will be a relevant margin. Take entrepreneurs for example. Starting a business is a risky venture by itself, so we want to know whether higher top income orcorporate taxrates will deter would-be entrepreneurs to take the first step.Accordingly, the goal of this paper is to estimate the causal effect of a policy that compresses earnings inequality —especially at the top —on risk taking behavior in a market for superstars. Professional athletes leagues fit the description of a market for superstars in that a few talented athletes usually end up reaping most of the pecuniary rewards. I focus here on one type of sport in particular: Mixed Martial Arts (MMA). There are two important reasons to do so. First, in contrast with sports such as football, baseball or basketball, there does not exist a particular league with an entrenchedmonopoly. In Mixed Martial Arts, there are basically twopromotionsthat compete with one another: The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) and Bellator. Second, in mid-July 2015, the UFC introduced a new earnings policy that had the effect to reduce earnings inequality, especially at the top: lower-tier fighters’ earnings increased modestly, while top earners took a heavy hit. In contrast, Bellator did not introduce any new policy during the same period.To clarify the notion of risk-taking that I recover from the data, I lay out a simple model in which agents with different risk aversion have to choose between two actions: one with a stochastic payoff and one with known payoff. The model makes clear predictions regarding the share of agents that choose the risky (i.ewith stochastic payoff) action. A decrease in incomes at the top of the distribution should decrease the average amount of risk-taking. Moreover, the effect is likely to be different across agents. In particular, agents in the bottom of the income distribution should be mostly affected by their modest increase in income and should be relatively more willing to take on risk after the policy. I then collect a unique dataset to study these effects.The dataset consists in fight outcomes over the period 2009 to early 2018. I run a standard Difference-in-Differences analysis to gauge the effects of the policy. I do not have access to data onactualrisk-taking during a given fight, so I use the way in which the fight ends (submission or (T)KO versus judges decision) as a proxy. I find that the probability that fights are finished before going to the judges decreases significantly for the treatment group after the policy. Moreover, the effect is economically significant: using my preferred specification, the 95% interval for the decrease in probability ranges from 10% to 26%. Under the hypothesis that increased risk taking most likely leads to a fight ending before going to the judgesscorecards, this shows that the policy had the causal effect to decrease risk taking in this particular setup.I also find evidence that this decrease is more pronounced for higher-earners. In particular, as predicted by the model, the effect is (i) strongest for higher-earners (ii) slightly dampened but still significant for the middle of the distribution and (iii) reversed for individuals at the low end of the distribution, although the latter is not statistically significant. Since these latter are not likely to be affected by the decrease in top income but rather by the modest increase in their (relatively low) income, the model predicts that they should be more willing to take on more risks.A potential threat to identification is that the policy might have encouraged athletes from the UFC to migrate over to the competing promotion. If there were a large number of these, then the decrease in risk-taking observed might just be the result of top-talent leaving the UFC for Bellator. I find that this is most likely not the case. In my dataset I have very few athletes leaving the UFC for Bellator. Furthermore, some of these did not leave for Bellator in search of a better opportunity but were let go by the UFC and ended up in Bellator after. Finally, only one of the athletes that did migrate to Bellator ever held a UFC championship belt.Another potential threat to identification is that the UFC introduced a new doping control policy alongside the sponsorship policy. As such, it could well be that the decrease in the probability of fights finishing before the distance is due to the fact that now fighters are more reluctant to use Performance Enhancing Drugs (PEDs) and thus have subpar performances as a result. I gather data for the number of random controls per fighter/quarter after mid-2015 to control for this. What I find is that the stricter anti-doping policy actually had theoppositeeffect: fighters that have been controlled more times tend to exhibitmorefinishes via losses. This is the exact opposite of what is needed to explain the previous results. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the decrease in the proxy for risky strategies in the treatment group is mostly due to the sponsorship policy and its effect on expected earnings.All in all, I find that this policy had a causal, overall negative effect on risk-taking. This begs for the following questions: what about external validity? Do we learn something useful from this particular setup? Since the market that I analyze is a market for superstars in which risk plays an important factor, it can be compared to entrepreneurship. Entry into entrepreneurship is a risky decision, but with potential rewards that can be very large for successful ones. In this respect, this paper provides evidence that a policy enacted which has the effect to decrease potential earnings at the top significantly decreases risk-seeking behavior. Therefore, the findings in this paper indicate that higher top income/wealth tax rates might decrease the entry into entrepreneurship.1.1. Related literatureThis paper is closely related to studies of entrepreneurship and its determinants. In particular,Olds, 2014,Olds, 2016studies the effect of more generous safety nets for entrepreneurs and finds that this has a positive effect on entry into entrepreneurship. In a related and recent contributionHombert et al. (2014)also find that a French reform to provide more generous downside insurance increased entry into entrepreneurship.Djankov et al. (2010)show that higher corporate tax rates usually correlate with lower business formation. The data that I will study in this paper allows me to go beyond and estimate the causal impact of a policy that decreases top incomes on risk taking. This paper is also closely linked toCullen and Gordon (2007), who study the impact of federal taxes on entrepreneurship in the United States using a standard Difference-in-Differences approach.Since these papers use policy changes/variation at the national level, their estimated effects will likely pick upgeneral equilibriumeffects at themacroeconomiclevel —seeHuber and Steinmayr (2019). Given the data that I use here, it is arguably much less likely that thetreatment effectfeatures general equilibrium effects at the macroeconomic level. In addition, these papers each study either a more generous safety net or taxes on high incomes. Given that policies for top-income tax rates might be implemented with complimentary measures for low-income individuals,1the results in this paper could help guide such fiscal reforms.In a series of recent contributions,Gift, 2019,Gift, 2020uses UFC data to investigate issues related to fighter pay. Using variation in the amount of post-fight bonuses,Gift (2019)shows that performance bonuses that are known to be attainable conditional on an exceptional performance during fight night do not seem to induce more risk-taking by UFC fighters. This paper does not compare UFC fighters to a control group, which might explain the absence of an effect compared to what is found in the current paper. What this difference may also suggest is that athletes are looking at earnings at the very top when considering taking on more risks rather than their possible income bump in the short run. Recently,Gift (2020)studies the marginal revenue product of UFC fighters in relation to their disclosed pay and finds that a select few UFC fighters are responsible for the bulk of UFC earnings.This paper is also related to the literature on “Personnel Economics” that studies pay structures within organizations using tournament theory —seeLazear and Shaw (2007). The main prediction of this theory is that effort usually increases with the spread between earnings at the top and the bottom. In this paper, I will study empirically what happens after a reduction in this spread. Relatedly, there is a recent stream of applied papers that analyze the drivers of risk-taking behavior. In the context of tournaments,Genakos and Pagliero (2012)find that revealing information on relative performance induces individuals trailing just behind the interim leaders to take greater risks. Using data for World War IIpilots,Ager et al. (2017)find that status competition increases risk-taking. Finally, using data from Ice HockeyChong and Restrepo (2017)find that having to wear protective gear increases risky behavior. Using data from the NFL,Lehman and Hahn (2013)look at the effect of momentum on risk taking. Papers looking at the nexus between compensation structure and risk-taking within one organization includesHu et al. (2011), whileEderer and Manso (2013)look at innovation.Finally, there is also a sizable literature that studies entrepreneurship and the access to capital —seeHoltz-Eakin et al. (1994),Buera (2009)andBianchi and Bobba (2013)among others.The paper is structured as follows. InSection 2, I develop a simple model of risk taking that will guide the empirical analysis. InSection 3, I describe the specific background surrounding the data that will be used as well as the policy change. InSection 4, I present the empirical results. InSection 5, I show that stronger drug testing cannot explain the results reported inSection 4. Finally, I conclude inSection 6.",Jordan,None,None
"1. IntroductionIncome increases people's consumption opportunities, irrespective of its source, and thus raises individual welfare. We question this implicit assumption made in economics and argue that the source of income does matter for individual well-being, at least for those employed workers who receive supplementaryincome support, i.e. in-work benefits. They may suffer from being dependent on public income support rather than being able to make their own living.Recently, the debates about winners and losers from globalization, digitalization and other economic shocks such as the one following the Coronavirus outbreak have revitalized the interest in redistribution policies and in-work benefit programs. The main instruments of these policies cushion the consequences of job loss and help the unemployed in overcoming joblessness. Previous insights on the well-being effects of unemployment shed light on the potential benefits of such measures, but likewise point to its possible drawbacks. Being jobless reduceslife satisfactionfar beyond the misery caused by the income loss (see e.g.Winkelmann and Winkelmann, 1998;Blanchflower and Oswald, 2004;Knabe and Rätzel, 2011). It worsens perceived social status, causes people to violate the social norm to work and leads to a deterioration in self-esteem, or identity utility (cf.Schöb, 2013). Even a very generous passivelabour market policythat compensated unemployed workers fully for the income loss would thus fail to restore the well-being of the unemployed.Active labour market policy aimed at fosteringreemploymenttherefore seems, at first glance, to be a more promising tool to alleviate unemployment-induced well-being losses. Employment subsidization schemes, such as the US ‘Earned Income Tax Credit’, the French `La prime pour l'emploi’, the British ‘Working Tax Credit’ and the German ‘Ergänzendes Arbeitslosengeld II’ (supplementary unemployment benefits II, UB II in the following) are prominent examples. They increase the income of low-paid workers to raise their labour supply while keeping firms’labour costslow andlabour demandhigh (Saez, 2002;Brewer et al., 2006;Chetty, Friedman and Saez, 2013). Additional jobs for unemployed workers, created in this way,inter alia, help them to restore their social identity as they allow them to comply with the norm to work. These policies should thus raise the life satisfaction of the beneficiaries. It is an unsettled question, however, whether such policy tools allow subsidized workers to fully recover from unemployment. This will only be the case if the subsidy does not affect subjective well-being beyond its income effect. When workers’ social identity not only depends on being employed, but also on adhering to the norm of making a living by one's own efforts (Elster, 1989), which we term the non-dependency norm, an employment subsidy shaped as income support will not suffice to completely remove the misery of the unemployed. Workers who receive public income support may realize that they live off public assistance instead of making their own living. As a result, they may be less satisfied with their lives than non-subsidized (in the following also ‘regularly’) employed workers.In this study, we assess the role of such a non-dependency norm for employees’ well-being by analysing the well-being effects of subsidized employment in the form of in-work benefits compared to unemployment and regular employment. We examine the well-being of working UB II recipients in Germany, using data of thePanel Arbeitsmarkt und soziale Sicherung(‘Panel Study Labour Market and Social Security’, in the following: PASS). The panel structure of PASS and its special focus on welfare recipients allow us to follow workers out of subsidized employment and into it, entering or coming from either regular employment or unemployment, and to observe the within-person changes in life satisfaction accompanying these transitions. Our identification strategy addresses selection due to both time-invariant unobservable and time-variant observable characteristics by utilizing difference-in-differences designs and constructing synthetic control groups. Multipleregression analysesenable us to disentangle the monetary effect of transitions into or out of the receipt of in-work benefits from the respective non-monetary effect. In the process, we exploit the richness of our dataset to account for reasons leading people into and out of labour market states that might have own life satisfaction effects (e.g. changes in income andwealth, health and household size). As people are not assigned exogenously to the three labour market states ‘unemployment’, ‘subsidized employment’ and ‘regular employment’, we rely on the assumption that all reasons that simultaneously explain switching labour market states and changing life satisfaction are observable and considered.We find that people become better off when they leave unemployment and start to work while continuing to receive welfare, and that this cannot be solely explained by the associated rise in available income. Employed people, however, who leave income support and become regularly employed also experience an increase in life satisfaction, even when controlling for income changes. As these people enjoy all the benefits of employment before and after the change, such as adhering to the work norm, this second finding points to a negative impact of receiving income support. This result is in line with the hypothesis that in-work benefits prevent the beneficiaries from complying with the non-dependency norm.We proceed as follows:Section 2reviews the previous literature on in-work benefits and relates our contribution to it. InSection 3, we derive hypotheses for our empirical analysis based on the notion that an individual's identity utility depends on social norms related to work and welfare dependency. Data and sampling are described inSection 4, while our empirical identification strategy is elaborated inSection 5.Section 6presents our main results. InSection 7, we conduct consistency and robustness checks before we conclude withSection 8.",Clemens,Ronnie,Tobias
"1. IntroductionCompensation arrangements influence the evolution of workers’ wages. In this paper we present evidence that employers choose different pay arrangements depending on worker-job match quality and document how these choices have implications for wage dynamics and employment durations.We begin by showing why compensation choices may depend on match quality and worker retention considerations. Within a simple stylized setting we illustrate how firms might have an incentive to retain workers in high quality matches by linking their pay to the performance (the production outcome) of the match.To examine the empirical content of this hypothesis, we use detailed information from the NLSY79, including detailed questions about the form of compensation. This information allows us to characterize individual work histories and to distinguish between jobs with and without performance pay components. Our empirical analysis highlights a positive relationship between match quality and the prevalence of jobs featuring performance pay. This robust association is apparent whether or not one accounts for alternative dimensions of heterogeneity such as occupation andindustry. We also find that match quality has a direct effect on wages after controlling for the adoption of performance pay. Thus, the quality of a match affects labor market returns above and beyond what is implied by contractual arrangements. Much ancillary evidence validates these findings and reinforces the view that job-specific productivity may play a central role for contractual choice and wage dynamics.To identify the impact of match-specific quality on compensation choices we pursue several identification approaches. We use match quality proxies that reflect impact of labor market tightness on the outside options available to workers; these measures convey valuable information about the quality of persistent job matches. To corroborate our findings we also use direct evidence about the accrual of job offers while on the job. The latter delivers a transparent way to quantify the outside options available during each recorded working history and helps validate our baseline empirical findings.1In highlighting the relationship between pay arrangements and wage dynamics, we build on existing studies on the effects of compensation mechanisms on wages.2For instance,Weitzman (1984)andOyer (2004)argue that employers tie pay to firm performance in order to closely match compensation to their employees’ outside options. Our illustration of the contractual choice problem shows that this retention motive becomes more salient in the presence of match-specific heterogeneity, leading to interesting patterns of contractual sorting. The empirical analysis documents that job durations are significantly higher when performance-based pay is adopted and that wages in performance pay jobs exhibit sensitivity to cyclical conditions, while wages in jobs with no performance pay components do not. This is consistent with establishment-level evidence from the National Compensation Survey presented inMakridis and Gittleman (2020).3Crucially, the presence of a retention motive linked to match quality is consistent with the recurrent finding that performance pay jobs are more frequent at the upper end of the earnings distribution (see the survey-based evidence inLemieux, Macleod, Parent, 2009,Lemieux, MacLeod, Parent, 2012,Makridis, 2014).Heterogeneity of compensation arrangements is also found in large administrative data sets; for example,Grigsby et al. (2019)document state dependence in payroll measures of worker wage adjustments and show that variation in compensation schemes induces different degrees of flexibility. The observation that pay arrangements differ substantially across workers underpins our examination of the motives behind alternative compensation schemes offered by employers.While existing studies do not consider the role of match quality for pay arrangements, they do suggest that provisions governing employment relationships may affect wage dynamics. Hence, in the process of examining the origins of contractual choices, our work contributes to the literature studying the impact of aggregate labor market conditions on wages. This line of research focuses on the cyclicality of workers’ pay and often uses the unemployment rate as a proxy for business cycle conditions.4The idea that contracts play a role in determining the cyclicality of wages is not a new one5and interest in these issues has been rekindled by the apparent changes, over recent decades, in the behavior of labor productivity andlabor costsover the business cycle.6Unlike previous research, we focus on the linkages between match-specific productivity and pay arrangements when considering the dynamics of wages. By explicitly studying the contract choice of a firm in the presence of heterogeneous match qualities, we follow the approach used in organization and personnel economics. This is convenient to discipline the empirical analysis and to convey a novel interpretation of the evidence.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The employer’s problem of choosing among compensation arrangements is discussed inSection 2.Section 3describes the empirical approach as well as the measurement of match quality and performance pay. Our findings on the relationship between performance pay adoption and match quality, and various robustness checks, are overviewed inSection 4.Section 5describes the empirical implications for wage cyclicality.Section 6concludes.",João,Giovanni,Yaniv
"1. IntroductionA large literature has studied the returns to education and their relationship to educational choices (Heckman and Lafontaine, 2006for an overview). In manyeducation systems, educational choices take the form of a decision about whether or not to add another year or another stage of the system to one’s educational qualification. This motivates the use of years of education as a measure of educational qualifications. However, there are a large number of education systems that do not exhibit this linear structure but are characterized by multiple tracks, different stages and potentially complex routes to final educational degrees. This is particularly true of systems with tracking structures which stream individuals into different tracks, often at an early age. Aspects that have been found to be important for education systems with a more linear structure such as dynamic ability sorting (Cameron, Heckman, 1998,Cameron, Heckman, 2001) and heterogeneous returns to individual transitions (e.g.,Heckman and Lafontaine, 2006) appear even more important in systems with multiple stages and multiple tracks. Importantly, these aspects are related to a number of features of tracked education systems that have been considered as critical, such as whether these systems are able to efficiently allocate individuals to final educational qualifications, or whether overly rigid tracking structures lock individuals into certain tracks.This paper studies heterogenous wage returns to educational decisions in the German education system. The German system is internationally known as a prototypical tracking system and “is considered today the starkest example of early tracking” (Brunello et al., 2012). It streams individuals into three different branches of secondary schooling at a very early age (typically ten years). What is less known internationally is that – despite its pronounced tracking structure – the system provides the possibility to switch tracks at many points and to take indirect routes to particular educational outcomes. The goal of this paper is to study to what extent the existence of such “second-chance” options can relax the rigid structure of an early tracking system. This is an important question as tracked education systems are very common and they often face the criticism of being too rigid and inflexible. As we show below, a remarkably high proportion of individuals takes second-chance decisions in the system studied by us. We estimate the value of such options, describe who exercises them and assess to what extent they compensate earlier inflexibilities in allocating students to tracks.Our paper appears to be the first one to evaluate the existence of second-chance options in an otherwise rigid early tracking system. To this end, we employ the state-of-the-art dynamictreatment effectsmethodology proposed byHeckman, Humphries, Veramendi, 2016,Heckman, Humphries, Veramendi, 2018in order to model the sequence of all relevant educational transitions in the education system jointly with the associated wage outcomes at the relevant final degrees. Our paper is one of the first ones to apply this framework in a decision environment that is considerably more complex than the college vs. no college decision usually considered ineducation economics. As a by-product of our analysis, we provide new results on the returns to a wide range of educational degrees in Germany. We consider degrees that have not or that have rarely been studied before such as the advanced vocational degree of a master craftsman or the choice between different types of academic education (general universities vs. more practically oriented universities of applied sciences). We explicitly allow for heterogenous returns to individual decisions depending on observed and unobserved characteristics. This allows us to address the question whether individuals sort into particular branches of the system based on their expected gains.Our results suggest that the value of the second-chance options built into the system is large but heterogenous. In particular, they are more valuable for high-ability individuals and individuals from higher parental backgrounds as these are better able to later exploit the possibilities that are opened up by switching to higher tracks at later stages of the system. We also find that, for individuals who face high expected returns to completing higher tracks but who start from a lower track, exercising second chance-options generally only partly offsets expected wage losses resulting from initially starting from a low track. Moreover, only a moderate fraction of such individuals later exercises second-chance options. Finally, we consider the role of the increasing use of second-chance options in the so-called “educational expansion” but find that initial placement to higher tracks was more important than increased flexibility in the form of second-chance options at later stages.The rest of this paper is structured as follows.Section 2discusses some related literature.Section 3describes details of the German education system.Section 4outlines oureconometricmethods.Section 5introduces the data on which our analysis is based.

"1. IntroductionHuman capital accumulation is one of the main factors contributing to economic growth (Mankiw et al., 1992). Youths, especially in developing countries, face many challenges that prevent them from obtaining an adequate level of education, and they are particularly vulnerable to changes in the labor markets conditions, both locally and abroad. The extent to which the educational choices of youths in a labor-exporting country respond to large and abrupt shocks in the destination country is an important question, and yet, it is only partially addressed.Identifying the impact of a large shock on educational choices is challenging for two main reasons. First, large labor market shifts usually happen over a long period and are usually coupled with economy-wide reforms. Second, the conventionaleconometrictechniques of causal inference might suffer fromspilloverandgeneral equilibriumeffects. This study attempts to overcome these two limitations by utilizing a natural experiment that restricted Palestinian workerss' access to the Israeli labor market during the Palestinian Second Intifada (uprising). This allows us to examine schooling choice responses in the origin country, which is characterized by isolated local labor markets, to a sudden, conflict-induced labor market closure in the top migrant-receiving country.The closure of the Israeli labor market following the Second Intifada is suitable for addressing the question at hand for three main reasons. First, the shock was abrupt, sizable, and to a certain degree, unanticipated. The share of Palestinian workers in Israel (commuters) dropped markedly from comprising 25% of total Palestinian employment before the Second Intifada to comprising below 10% in 2002.1Second, immediately after the outbreak of the Second Intifada, Israel started to implement long-term measures and policies, such as building the Separation Wall, accelerating the immigration of foreign (non-Palestinian) workers, and effecting a strict permit policy that denied young Palestinian workers access to the Israeli labor market. Many Palestinians perceived these changes as long-term structural shifts, with protracted implications for the dynamics between the two labor markets.2Finally, Israel severely restricted mobility within the West Bank (WB) during the Second Intifada, effectively turning the WB into a geographically isolated labor market.3The closure might have induced youths (aged 15–19 years old) in the WB to invest more in education by lowering the opportunity cost of attending high school and increasing returns to schooling. Low-skill jobs in Israel were largely outsourced to the Palestinian labor market before the Intifada, generating a huge demand for unskilled workers who were employed and earning relatively higher wages compared to the wages for similar jobs in the WB. Restricted access to the Israeli labor market greatly reduced the demand for unskilled workers, resulting in fewer employment prospects andlower wagesfor school dropouts. Further, for parents, the shock constituted a sharp negative income shock. Faced withliquidity constraints, parents could not afford to send their children to school, resulting in an increase in the high school dropout rate. We carry out our analysis at the local labor market level to identify the shock's overall effect on educational choices. This provided us with a unique opportunity to identify the impact of a large shock, which simultaneously affectedremittancesand the opportunity cost of schooling, onhuman capital formation.The responses of schooling choices in home to labor market shocks in foreign countries have never been more relevant in the global economy, which is characterized by a growing number of migrants, a great degree of regional market interconnectedness, constant technological change, and policy- or conflict- induced shocks. Migrants with relatively similar skills are usually concentrated in a very limited number of destinations; therefore, it is important to understand how labor market changes affect the top migrant-receiving countries in terms of the human capital consequences in the migrants' origin countries. As the overall impact of migration on human capital will be dominated by one of two opposing mechanisms (i.e., income vs. the opportunity cost of schooling), this study is relevant to designing future education-enhancing policies in developing countries, which are characterized by a large concentration of unskilled migrants who are concentrated in a very small number of destinations.Measured as the locality share of commuters in total male employment, our empirical strategy relies on the variations in exposure to the Israeli labor market across WB localities before the Second Intifada. We start with the difference-in-difference estimator (DD) to analyze the high school dropout rate among the youths in the treated localities (with a high pre-shockcommutingshare) against the comparison localities (with a low pre-shock commuting share) both before and after the closure. However, because most commuters were males (more than 98%), the shock was asymmetrical not only across localities, but also across genders. This allows us to extend our DD analysis to the triple difference framework (DDD). The DDD estimator compares the male school dropout rate to the female one within the treated localities, purging outgender differencein schooling in comparison localities both before and after the shock, while controlling for locality time-varying characteristics that could bias the DD estimator. Additionally, we show that the data support the main identifying assumption of equal high school dropout rate trajectories in the treated and comparison localities before the shock. Further, we provide evidence against the compositional effect (changes in the observable variable driving our results) and internal migration.Using PalestinianLabor Force Survey(PLFS) data from 1999 to 2006, we find that the probability of dropping out of high school declined following the closure. Importantly, the effect is driven by the responses of male, not female, students, leading to a smaller gender gap for high school dropouts. However, we did not find any significant effect of the closure on college attendance. The opportunity cost mechanism seems to dominate the income mechanism in the case of highschool enrollment(there is almost no cost for attending high school in the WB), whereas the income mechanism counterbalances the opportunity cost and the returns to education mechanisms for college education, which is relatively expensive.The closure presumably reduced the opportunity cost of schooling by lowering job employment prospects for school dropouts. We test for the opportunity cost mechanism by demonstrating that school dropouts' unemployment probability increased more in highly-exposed localities compared to low-exposure localities. If the prospect of employment is the true mechanism, one would expect to see closure exert a differential impact on unemployment across gender and skilled vs. unskilled workers within localities, with the differential effect being more salient in the treated as opposed to the control localities. We provide evidence that unemployment probability increased more for male than female dropouts as well as for males with educational degrees in hard-hit localities compared with those in low-hit localities. However, we find little evidence for the skill wage premium. We conduct several sensitivity, placebo, and heterogeneous effect analyses to test the robustness of our results and rule out alternative mechanisms. Taken together, this studys's results suggest that the closure reduced the opportunity cost of attending school for male students, thereby leading to a decline in the high school dropout rate in the WB.Our paper is related to three strands of literature. The first is broad literature on how human capital responds to economic shocks (Charles, Hurst, Notowidigdo, 2015,Shah, Steinberg, 2017), skill-biased technological changes, and labor market shocks (Black, McKinnish, Sanders, 2005,Cascio, Narayan, 2015,Emery, Ferrer, Green, 2012,Michaels, 2011,Weber, 2012,Weber, 2014), as well as topolicy reformsand new economic opportunities (Abramitzky, Lavy, 2014,Adukia, Asher, Novosad, 2019,Amuedo-Dorantes, Antman, 2017,Atkin, 2016,Kuka, Shenhave, Shih, 2018,Oster, Steinberg, 2013). Compared with the above-mentioned studies, the magnitude of shock in this study is much larger. The shock is coupled with political violence and a sharp decline in economic activities. We add to the literature by providing further evidence that in an imperfect labor market, human capital responds to a large labor shock in a manner that is consistent with previous studies, thus emphasizing the idea that in an unstable economic and political environment, the opportunity cost of attending school is still animperativedriver of educational choices.The second strand of literature concerns the multi-channel impact of migration on education in the country of origin through remittances (Cox-Edwards, Ureta, 2013,Yang, 2008), wage premiums (Batista, Lacuesta, Vicente, 2012,Shrestha, 2017), or the overall effect (McKenzie, Rapoport, 2011,Theoharides, 2018). It is important to underscore the differences between our setting and typical migration literature. First, Palestinian workers are not allowed to stay overnight in Israel; therefore, they must commute to Israel daily to work and return to the WB at night. Therefore, in our setting, the usual concerns about unobservable individual variables correlated with decisions to migrate and remit are less prevalent. Second, in our setting, we can arguably rule out migration's effect on education through other mechanisms such as parental absence and family disruptions. Third, unlike most studies on migration, instead of targeting the intergenerational transmission of education and brain drain, we focus on how unskilled-biased demand for migrants impacts prospective migrants (commuters) as human capital. Although our setting is specific, and perhaps unique, our results can be generalized to all settings in which migrants from the origin country are concentrated in jobs that require a specific skillset and particular educational qualifications.In the spirit ofTheoharides (2018), this paper identifies the overall effect of a labor market shock in the destination country on educational choices at the local labor market level. She finds that education in the Philippines responds positively to migration, driven mainly by the income effect. In contrast, our findings suggest that the opportunity cost of attending school dominates the income effect when migrants are relatively unskilled and high school education is relatively cheap. In our setting, the prospect of working abroad in relatively highly-paid low-skill jobs lowers returns to schooling and students’ incentives to invest more in education. Our results are, to some extent, in line withMcKenzie and Rapoport (2011), who find that migration from Mexico to the United States (US) led to lower rates of school completion among migrants’ children in Mexico because their return to education is higher in Mexico compared with Mexican migrants in the US. Our findings are not necessarily trivial because the importance of the counteracting mechanisms, that is, remittances (budget constraint) and incentives, might operate differently for positive and negative shocks. The size of the shock in the current study is comparable to that ofDinkelman and Mariotti (2016), who estimate the impact of large shocks in South Africa as a destination country on human capital in Malawi. They find that in Malawi, in the long run, remittances have a positive effect on children's educational outcomes.Finally, this paper contributes to three important previous studies that address the impact of the Second Intifada on Palestinians' educational attainment.Di Maio and Nistico (2019)find that among household heads working in Israel, parental job losses that were induced by the intensity of the conflict during the Second Intifada had a negative effect on the school dropout rate. By conducting their analysis at the household level, they capture the effect of income on schooling. Conversely, our study estimates the shock's overall effect at the locality level, isolating the effects of labor market changes from the violence effect.Brück et al. (2019)show that while violence lowers high schoolers' national exam scores, it does not have the same effect on the high school dropout rate at the locality school level. These findings further support our identification strategy for two reasons: (1) they show that within localities, change in violence over time is as good as random, and hence, it might not be correlated with the pre-shock share of commuters; and (2) by finding that violence had no effect on the school dropout rate, we are confident that our results are driven by changes in the labor market.4This paper is closely related toDi Maio and Nandi (2013), who find that child labor increases with conflict intensity as measured by within-year quarterly fluctuations in the number of days Israel closed itsborderwith the WB, while school attendance weakly decreases for children aged between 10 and 14 years old. However, our paper differs fromDi Maio and Nandi (2013)in an important way. InDi Maio and Nandi (2013), child labor increases as a short-term insurance strategy for coping with economic hardship caused by the temporary border closure, but children continue to attend school. The decision to work and attend school is not mutually exclusive for 10–14 year old boys because the majority of working children (mainly in unpaid and part-time jobs at family-owned businesses) also attended school. In contrast, our empirical design captures the long-run effect on the high school dropout rate of a perceived long-term decline in the opportunity cost of attending school, following the initial closure and the long-term policies Israel adopted shortly after to restrict Palestinians' access to its labor market. In addition, by comparing schooling outcomes between localities before and after the shock, our empirical strategy is more successful in controlling for unobservable economy-wide variables that might be correlated with the number of closure days and school attendance, such as violence and school closures.5In addition, by providing a cleaner identification strategy, this paper complements the literature on the Second Intifada's impact on the WB's labor market (Cali, Miaari, 2018,Fallah, 2016,Farsakh, 2002,Mansour, 2010,Miaari, Sauer, 2011,Ruppert Blumer, 2003). The DDD technique controls for unobservable locality time-varying characteristics that might bias estimates of the Second Intifada's impact on locality labor market outcomes. In line with the findings of the aforementioned studies, this study confirms the closure's adverse impact on employment and wages in the WB, especially for unskilled workers.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.Section 2provides a brief background of the labor market andeducation systemin Palestine.Section 3discusses the data and providesdescriptive statistics.

"1. IntroductionA simplelabor market modelof supply and demand implies that immigration to a local labor market will result in falling wages,ceteris paribus. Examining the implications of immigration on local labor markets has been an important topic in recent years, both within the economic literature and in the popular press. However, as recent surveys suggest (Kerr and Kerr, 2011;Dustmann, Schönberg, and Stuhler, 2016), the results are far from uniform. A difficulty in estimating the impact of immigration on earnings is identifying and isolating labor markets. It has become standard in one strand of the literature to analyze the impact of immigration on groups of similarly skilled native workers as defined by education and work experience. This approach, pioneered byBorjas (2003), implicitly assumes that these education-experience groups identify labor markets in which immigrants and natives are perfect substitutes. However, the assumption of perfect substitutability has been challenged, and estimates suggest that a degree ofimperfectsubstitutability exists between immigrants and natives within these education-experience groups (Card, 2009;Ottaviano and Peri, 2012;Dustmann and Preston, 2012;Dustmann, Frattini, and Preston, 2012;Manacorda, Manning, and Wadsworth, 2012). As pointed out byOttaviano and Peri (2012), this fact is nontrivial. If immigrants and natives are imperfect substitutes, then any wage effect of immigration would be concentrated on existing immigrants, not natives.The result that education is an imperfect proxy for overallskill level, and especially so for immigrants, is well-documented in the literature. First, there is significant wage dispersionwithineducation groups (Murnane, Willett, and Levy, 1995;Ingram and Neumann, 2006). This suggests that skills other than educational attainment are being rewarded in the labor market. Second, immigrants earn less than similarly educated natives (Bratsberg and Terrell, 2002;Bratsberg and Ragan, 2002;Ferrer and Riddell, 2008). This fact has been attributed to differing employment distributions across occupations and a lower return to education for immigrant workers. Several scenarios exist for the above differentials in returns to education. First, there may be more uncertainty about the quality of education received by immigrants abroad, leading employers to hedge against the possibility that the immigrant's education is lower quality. Second, language barriers limit the value of similarly educated immigrants. Third, immigrants face differential returns to education due to downgrading upon arrival in the US (Dustmann, Schönberg, and Stuhler, 2016;Friedberg, 2000;Mattoo Neagu, and Özden, 2008;Neagu, 2009;Sharpe, 2015).Sharpe (2015)uses O*NET data for the required level of education needed to adequately perform a job and finds that immigrants are twice as likely to be overeducated as natives for the positions they hold. The difference in over-education rates increases with the amount of schooling and is most profound for highly educated, newly arrived immigrants. We do not investigate these causes, but rather note that immigrants enter the US and are pushed toward jobs in which they possess too much education compared to the average worker.Prior studies have used several methods to account for the imperfect substitutability between immigrants and natives. Some have turned to estimating theelasticity of substitutionbetween immigrants and natives and simulating the total wage effect of immigration on native wages (Mancorda, Manning, and Wadsworth, 2012;Ottaviano and Peri, 2012;Peri and Sparber, 2009; among others). The validity of this approach, however, has been questioned, as the estimated elasticities of substitution are not robust to changes in key assumptions (Borjas, Grogger, and Hanson, 2012).Llull (2018b)improves upon this framework by allowing imperfect substitutability to enter endogenously into a structural model of the labor market that flexibly defines labor market competition based on “skill units” and occupation. Others have moved away from the education-experience group analysis altogether and analyzed varying definitions of skill groups: based on the native wage distribution (Dustmann, Frattini, and Preston, 2012) and occupation groups (Camarota, 1997;Card, 2001;Orrenius and Zavodny, 2007;Steinhardt, 2011). Other studies have focused onspecific industries(Bratsberg and Raaum, 2012) or used natural experiments where immigrants were exogenously allocated (Friedberg, 2001;Glitz, 2012).Dustmann and Glitz (2015)examine firm level adjustments, includingfactor utilizationand firm level decisions to enter or exit.Friedberg (2001)uses occupation prior to immigration as an instrument, an approach we consider below.We propose that stratifying the labor market by occupation rather than education results in an improved measure of labor market competition. Existing studies incorporating occupations as a proxy for skill are relatively sparse.Camarota (1997)uses one CPS cross-section to estimate the impact of immigration on wages within occupations and finds that a 1% increase in immigration will decrease the wages of the average native worker by 0.5%. However, the use of a single cross-section and small within-occupation sample size makes causal inference difficult.Card (2001)estimates city-specific impacts of immigration on occupational wages for 175 cities using 1990 US Census data and finds that the immigration inflows of the 1980’s decreased wages in low-skilled occupations in high-immigration cities by no more than 3%.Orrenius and Zavodny (2007)use CPS data from 1994–2000 and INS immigration data to estimate the impact of immigration on native wages in three broad occupation categories. The authors estimate that the change in immigrants over the data period decreased wages in low-skilled, manual occupations by 0.8% and had no impact for medium-skilled and high-skilled occupations. In the case of the German labor market,Steinhardt (2011)shows that the relative wage effect of immigration on native wages is larger when stratifying the labor market by occupation compared to stratifying the labor market by education. Specifically, when stratifying by occupation, the results imply a statistically significant wage elasticity of -0.134. When stratifying by education, however, the resulting estimates are statistically insignificant.To improve upon the studies using skill group methodology, we propose constructing labor markets by using occupation groups with similarskillrequirements along with experience. Whereas prior skill group studies using occupations have relied on broad Census-defined occupation groups, we construct occupation groups using skill data from the O*NET. The use of O*NET data enables us to construct occupation groups with a greater degree of homogeneity in overall skill level, regardless of nationality and citizenship status, than those using either education groups or broad occupation classifications.Section 2presents the details of our data and the methodology used to construct occupation-experience groups.Our primary result, presented inSection 3, incorporates our occupation classification to estimate the impact of immigrants on wages in the national labor market. This approach is compared to estimates obtained byBorjas (2003). As expected if grouping workers by occupational characteristics is an improvement in constructing labor markets, we find that the partial equilibrium effect of immigration on native wages is 4 -5 times larger than the effect estimated utilizing markets defined by education group. This result is robust to several different definitions of occupation groups defined on the basis of occupational skill.Two potential concerns arise from the initial analysis. First, stratifying labor markets by occupations may introduce bias, asoccupational choiceis potentially endogenous. Second, the national labor market approach identifies the partial equilibrium effect of immigration on native wages: the effect of immigration on the wages of experienced native workers relative to inexperienced native workers in the same occupation (or education) group (Dustmann, Schönberg, and Stuhler, 2016).We address the endogeneity concern in two approaches. First, inSection 3, we use a shift share instrument, similar toLlull (2018a)and others, as one specification of our main model. For our second approach, we estimate competition intensity for the usual education-experience groups by usingdemographicdata to identify native workers who are comparable to immigrants. We then estimate the impact in each of these competition groups. In both exercises, the estimates are similar or larger than our initial estimates, further supporting the importance of constructing appropriate labor market groups.InSection 4, we use our occupation classification to estimate the total wage effect of immigration along the distribution of occupational skills (Dustmann, Frattini, and Preston, 2012). This approach addresses the second concern, as it provides estimates over the distribution, allowing for significant heterogeneity. Additionally, this section adds to the literature which has shown that the effect of immigration on natives is concentrated on the least-skilled native workers who are most substitutable to immigrant labor. While the estimated wage effect is not statistically distinguishable from zero in the middle of the skill distribution, we estimate large and statistically significant effects in each tail of the distribution. Specifically, we estimate a wage elasticity of -0.5 in the bottom tail where natives are substitutable to immigrant labor and a wage elasticity of roughly 0.3-0.8 in the upper tail where natives are complementary to immigrant labor.",Jamie,Christopher,None
"1. Theoretical frameworkThe Becker model posits that offenders choose whether to engage in criminal activity by weighing the potential benefits of a crime against its costs.5For drug crimes, the benefits can be seen as the utility of consuming the drugs or the revenue from their sale. The expected cost, net of financial considerations, is an increasing function of punishment severity. For simplicity, the benefits can be represented as a continuous increasing function of the quantity, while cutoff policies introduce discontinuities in expected costs. These discontinuities give rise to dominated regions above cutoffs, in which the net expected benefit of a crime is strictly lower than at the cutoff.Fig. 1illustrates the decision of an offender optimizing the amount of contraband they carry. A cutoff atQ1creates a discontinuous increase in punishment and a discontinuous decrease in the expected value of a crime for quantities aboveQ1. Individual 2 is the individual who would have carried the lowest quantity before the introduction of the cutoff (Q1) and who now chooses to locate at the cutoff. Individual 1 is the individual who would have carried the highest quantity before the cutoff was introduced and who now chooses to locate at the cutoff. This individual chooses quantityQ3in the absence of the cutoff, but is indifferent betweenQ1andQ2, which lies strictly belowQ3, in the presence of the cutoff. Individuals between 1 and 2 should locate at the cutoff point and none should locate in the region betweenQ1andQ2.

Quantity cutoff (Q1) and the expected value of crime.One consideration is whether offenders necessarily give up excess amounts above the cutoff or partly re-organize trade into smaller transactions. Offenders may adjust the volume of transaction, the quantity traded per transaction, and the total quantity traded. For example, a cutoff at 5 g may incentivize an offender wishing to buy 10 g to conduct two transactions of 5 g rather than one larger transaction. Since increasing the frequency of transaction may increase the probability of arrest, offenders face a trade-off, suggesting that they may partially adjust the volume of transaction for larger excess quantities and give up small excess quantities. Regardless of these adjustments, bunching at cutoffs provides evidence of strategic offender adjustments to these policies, but implications regarding deterrence of drug trade and consumption depend on these considerations. SeeAppendix A.5for a more detailed discussion and test of this auxiliary hypothesis.In practice, the size and existence of dominated regions are also affected by market features and optimization frictions which could lead individuals to carry amounts betweenQ1andQ2. For example, aggravating factors such as criminal history can sometimes lead to higher charges regardless of quantity. Similarly, potential discounts or changes in substance purity for larger transactions could decrease incentives of offenders to bunch at certain cutoffs. It is therefore expected that the empirical density distribution around a cutoff exhibit partial bunching with additional mass to the left of the cutoff and missing mass beyond.",Louis-Pierre,None,None
"1. IntroductionIn the past years, the “student loan bubble” and the “student loan crisis” have captured increasing attention by the media, politicians, and economists. Student debt as share of total non-mortgage consumer debt has increased from 10.5% in 2001 to 32.2% in 2017 (Center for Microeconomic Research, 2018). There is significant international heterogeneity of public funding for tertiary education and tuition fees for both public and private education.Table 1summarises the tuition fees for national bachelor students in selected countries as well as differences in the loans after tertiary education for 2017/18. In some countries like Germany or Switzerland, tuition fees are very low or basically non-existent. In contrast, in the UK or the United States, tuition for public education is about $10000 a year, increasing to almost $30000 for private institutions in the US.Table 1.

While the different systems andmissing data(especially for countries with less expensive tertiary education) make it hard to compare particular details, the data show that significant shares of students in the more expensive countries such as Australia, Canada, England and the United States graduate with substantial debt.While rising tuition fees and declining public contributions to colleges have contributed to these loans, there is also evidence that students take on higher or more expensive loans than necessary. For the United States,Gonzalez et al. (2019)report that “more than half (53%) of undergraduates who took out private loans in 2015-16 did not use the maximum available in federal student loans” (Gonzalez et al., 2019) even though theinterest ratesfor private loans are significantly higher than the 4.53% interest rate on federal loans. A survey byWilbert and Haddad (2014)among 962 students finds that 23.1% of the students who consume “luxury items and services” such as television game systems, pedicures/manicures, going out to eat, or vacations, choose to use their loans to pay for these luxury items. One might argue that this is just irrational overspending by young adults or an attempt to intertemporarily smooth consumption. However, this paper shows that in presence of credit and labour market frictions, students can increase the net present value of their consumption by strategically overusing student loans.There is a large strand of literature discussing credit market frictions and borrowing constraints for students. While firms that invest in machines can offer this physical capital as collateral, banks cannot directly seize a student’s education, skills and knowledge. This may restrict the credit market access of potential students with few own funds and can prevent efficient investments in human capital (Galor and Zeira, 1993). Even for the high school graduates who have access to student loans, credit market imperfections distort the education decision if banks exhibit market power and extract rents.Once a worker has graduated she must apply her skills in imperfect labour markets. Informational and coordination frictions prevent the invisible hand from clearing the market and give rise to unemployment and unfilled vacancies. Amongst others,Acemoglu (1997),Albrecht and Vroman (2002)andSato and Sugiura (2003)consider the effects of these imperfections on human capital.Acemoglu and Shimer (1999)show how labour market imperfections can create hold-up problems that distort the incentives to invest in capital: the costs of investing in capital are already sunk when firms and workers later decide how to split the surplus of a worker-firm match. Therefore, these costs are not considered during the wage-bargaining process. If investors pay the entire costs but only receive a fraction of the benefits of their investment due to the market power of their counterpart, investment is inefficiently low.Acemoglu and Shimer (1999)focus on physical capital, but the same mechanism works for human capital: The worker pays for her education, but when firms and workers bargain on the wage these costs are sunk. However,Moen (1998)argues that contingent loans shift the costs of education back into the wage-bargaining process and seem to solve the hold-up problem: workers pay the credit rates for theirstudent loanonly while they are employed at a firm, but the payment is interrupted if a worker becomes unemployed. This way the credit rates are considered as opportunity costs of working during the surplus splitting and efficiency is restored. In a related study,Kaas and Zink (2011)use a model with directed search to illustrate that contingent loans provide incentives to search for jobs that offer higher wages, giving rise to higher unemployment.This paper shows how such a combination of imperfect credit and labour markets shifts some burden of the student loans from students to firms and unskilled workers. In order to model the informational frictions and the complicated procedure of finding the best way to pay for college, I do not assume an exogenous borrowing constraint, but students must firstsearchfor a bank that provides a student loan. The imperfections on the credit market are similar to the ones on the labour market, both with search frictions in the spirit ofPissarides (2000). It takes some time to obtain a loan (or respectively for banks to find a borrower), depending on the ratio of thecredit supply ofbanks to the credit demand of prospective students. This approach not only keeps the model tractable, but also accommodates the findings ofCarneiro and Heckman (2002)that directcredit constraintsprevent only a small fraction of young women and men from acquiring higher education. Thus, “softer” credit constraints, such as search frictions, are more suitable to model the credit market for student loans. Moreover, search frictions are also a natural way to model the information frictions for students and the heterogeneity of the various credit options. For instance, a student who consults the website of Wells Fargo1for current rates for student loans must first choose the school state, the particular school, and the student’s field of study. The following website (using students in economics at the UCLA as an example) then suggests 8 different loans (5 of them being consolidation loans), each of the 8 with different “lowest rates” and “highest rates”, where both categories allow to choose again between variable and fixed rates, and each interest rate is reported as “interest rate” and “APR”, including remarks regarding originating fees (or their absence). This process makes it very hard to compare different credit options at different banks.Dynarski and Scott-Clayton (2006)argue that also the federal system for student aid is too complex in order to achieve its redistributive goals. In a natural experiment,Stoddard et al. (2017)show that students who receive information on their individual student loan debt improve their academic outcomes. However, they do not adjust their borrowing.In our the model, students pay an endogenous interest rate above the risk-free rate on their debt.Wasmer and Weil (2004)use an analogous approach to show how imperfect markets for venture capital amplify the adverse effects of labour market imperfections, and how even moderate frictions on both markets are sufficient to generate substantial unemployment. The credit market for student loans differs from the credit market for venture capital in various dimensions. In particular, students usually can offer only little collateral, and in contrast to physical capital, human capital cannot be seized if the student cannot pay back his credit. While “only” 11.5% of all student loans were delinquent for at least 90 days in Q3 2018 (Center for Microeconomic Research, 2018), a significantly higher share of students with student loans go through some periods of default. According toScott-Clayton (2018), 27.2% of the students who entered college in 2004 had defaulted on a student loan at least once in the following 12 years. They project that the cumulative default rate of this cohort will rise to 38.2% within 20 years after these students had entered college. This demonstrates that a lot of students struggle to pay their credit rates for an extended amount of time, for instance during unemployment. However, in contrast to most other types of debt, it is very hard to declarebankruptcyon student loans.2This also explains why the outstanding student loan debt does not decline significantly during recessions. As soon as the borrower finds a new job, he has to continue to pay the credit rates.Table 1shows that countries use a variety of different loan types, including contingent loans where students can apply for hardship deferment if their current income is below a given threshold. I implement this observation by assuming that the credit takes the form of a contingent loan. That is, banks and students anticipate (or even explicitly write into the credit contract) that workers cannot pay full credit rates while they are unemployed, but that the credit cannot be forgiven. As soon as the worker finds a new job, the credit rates are paid again.This provides incentives for workers and banks to strategically use contingent loans to establish higher wages for well educated workers. The main mechanism works as follows: the imperfections in both markets give all participants somebargaining powerwhen they decide how to split the surplus of a bank-worker match (the bargaining on the credit contract) and a firm-worker match (the wage bargaining). As workers must only pay back the contingent loan during employment, the repayments are considered as part of the opportunity costs of working. Therefore, firms compensate skilled workers for a share of their credit costs via higher wages. Banks and workers internalise this effect when they bargain on the credit contract, giving rise to higher credit rates and a further increase in wages for skilled workers. Thus, students are willing to accept higher credit rates, anticipating that they will be at least partially compensated by higher wages.An increase in student loans can be used to pay for higher tuition fees or to finance more consumption. While in both cases some of the costs are indirectly paid by firms and low-skilled workers, they have opposing effects on credit supply and the incentives to study. If loans increase because tuition fees rise, the increase in wages for college graduates is not sufficient to compensate students for the higher costs of education. Thus, the surplus of a match between a student and a bank declines, fewer people go to college and credit supply tightens. In contrast, if loans increase to pay for consumption, the surplus between student and bank rises: The credit is a transfer between both parties, but firms increase wages to compensate workers for higher loans. Thus, if loans grow in order to pay for more consumption, the incentives to study increase and credit supply rises. Students have an incentive to take on excess student loans to pay for consumption despite significant premia on the interest rates.A numerical simulation illustrates some additional quantitative results: While both types of student loans increase unemployment as well as the college premium, and both types of loans reduce welfare, these effects are stronger if the loan is used to pay for tuition fees. An increase in student debt to pay for consumption has only marginal effects on unemployment, welfare, and the skill premium, and it has even a positive (albeit small) effect on the wages of low-skilled workers.The paper is organised as follows.Section 2introduces the economic environment,Section 3derives the equilibrium.Section 4simulates two experiments, an increase in student loans to pay for higher tuition fees and another increase to pay for higher consumption.Section 5allows for risk-averse workers and discusses the implications for the main mechanism of the model.Section 6concludes.",Christian,None,None

"1. IntroductionMany countries have implemented or tested mandatorywelfare programsfor young adults to handle moral hazard problems while also providing social insurance.1Activation programs may reduce the incidence and duration of benefit claims. However, such strategies may have negative distributional effects if individuals who are already in a difficult financial situation lose what little income they have. Recent evidence of this can be found in the case of an activation program for young welfare recipients in the Netherlands (Cammeraat et al., 2017). Negative distributional effects might be a problem even in the case of a positive average earnings response. For example,Avram et al. (2018)found that job search requirements for single parents on welfare in the UK led to more people finding work but also increased transitions to non-claimant unemployment or health-related benefits.In the 1990s and 2000s, social insurance offices in Norwegian municipalities increased the number of conditions that young welfare recipients had to comply with to receive benefits. These requirements could take many forms, but for young recipients they were primarily related to activation and work. This paper studies the distributional effects on earnings and total income of this tightening of policy, exploiting the fact that different social insurance offices changed their policies at different points in time. The paper is related to the works ofHernæs et al. (2017)andBratsberg et al. (2019), who studied the effect of the same sequence of policy changes on youths. Both these studies exploited the geographically staggered implementation of increased conditions using various double and triple differences designs.Hernæs et al. (2017)found that the increased use of conditions increased the high school completion rate for 21 year olds, whileBratsberg et al. (2019)found that it reduced crime among 18–19 year old boys. The present paper exploits the same source of variation in policy but studies labor market outcomes and people who have entered their prime working lives.Welfare policy affects both those actually receiving welfare and a wider population with only a potential connection to the welfare system, which might still be impacted through a “threat effect” (Black et al., (2003);Koning, (2015)) or a general “regime effect” (Arni et al., 2015). The main contribution of this paper is estimating quantiletreatment effectsthat cover both these groups, as well asspillover effects, by estimating unconditional effects and using data on the complete population.The paper analyzes effects on the unconditional distribution of earnings and income for men and women in a Difference-in-Differences (DiD)-related design. The estimation follows the recentered influence regression (RIF) approach ofFirpo et al. (2009)and focuses on the reduced form effects on all individuals aged 26–30 residing in the treatment areas. As in a regular DiD application, the analysis is essentially a comparison of the change in outcomes from before to after increasedconditionalitywith the change that occurred in the same period in places in which there was no change in policy. For mean effects, these pre vs. post and treatment vs. control comparisons are made once; in contrast, when the outcome of interest is the distribution, the comparisons are made several times. Following the RIF approach, this takes the form of a series of analyses of how earnings are distributed around a set of thresholds corresponding to the quantiles of the empirical earnings distribution, resulting in estimates of treatment effects along the distribution.2Other applications of the RIF method for policy evaluation using repeated cross-sectional data areHavnes and Mogstad (2015)on child care andDube (2018)on minimum wages.I find substantial positive effects of increased use of conditions in parts of the lower end of the earnings distribution for women and no or small negative effects for men. For women, earnings at the 20th percentile increase by around 25 percent, or € 2000 per year. As expected, there are no effects in the upper part of the distribution. Further, I find that although welfare payments decline, the effect on total income for women is also positive, indicating that they were able to find gainful employment that, overall, improved their financial circumstances. In addition to reducing welfare payments, the results from data on operating expenses at the office level suggest that the reduced caseload from the reform more than made up for the increased workload; thus, the reform was highly cost-effective.Since activation and requirements related to obtaining work are the main tools of social insurance offices for managing young claimants, the paper relates to the literature onactive labor market policies(for reviews, seeCard et al., 2010,2015;Kluve et al., 2016). This literature has focused on program participants and has largely analyzed mean effects.Autor et al. (2017)recently evaluated distributional effects on the earnings distribution of a welfare-to-work program in Detroit. The authors also studied program participants and analyzed effects on the conditional earnings distribution, as in traditional quantile regression. The current paper also relates to the literature on US welfare reform that evaluated distributional effects and was part of the debate about whether income and/or consumption declined for a subset of individuals targeted by the reform (Blank and Schoeni, 2003;Bitler et al., 2006;Meyer and Sullivan, 2008). As the US welfare reform mostly concerned single mothers receiving cash benefits, individuals outside the program or covered by other programs have received little attention. I find evidence that the effects on welfare recipients are driving the results, supporting the focus of this stream of literature on program participants.The rest of the paper is organized as follows.Section 2describes the institutional setting and the reform,Section 3presents the empirical strategy,Section 4contains results and discussion, andSection 5concludes the paper.",Øystein,None,None
"1. IntroductionAging populationschallenge public pension systems. Therefore, mostOECDcountries have reversed their retirement policies since the 1990s and started to encourage longer working lives, thus alleviating the decline of the working age population. Reforms include tighter qualifying conditions and increases in the early retirement age (ERA), the introduction of actuarial deductions for early retirement, increases in the normal retirement age (NRA), i.e. the age at which people can first draw full benefits without actuarial deductions,1increases in the statutory retirement age, or a combination of these policies.A large empirical literature analyzes labor market effects of various pension reforms.2Most of these studies use administrative social security data and exploit the quasi-experimental variation induced by pension reforms to estimate causal labor market effects. Administrative data have the advantage of providing accurate information about the working and earnings history of large samples or even the entire population. Yet, in general, social security data primarily include individual information and therefore, it is not possible to study effects of pension reforms at the household level. Consequently, with individual data it is not possible to analyze heterogeneous effects of pension reforms by household composition, or behavioral responses at the household level. The limitations for distributional and fiscal analyses are even more substantial. Based on individual data, distributional and fiscal analyses of pension reforms are only partially informative since other sources of income at the household level, most importantly the spousal income and household transfer income, cannot be considered.In this paper, we focus on the household level in addition to the individual level. We quantify heterogeneous labor market effects, labor market effects at the household level as well as distributional and fiscal consequences induced by a substantial increase in the ERA. For the identification of these effects, we followGeyer and Welteke (2019)and exploit exogenous variation of the 1999 pension reform in Germany, which abolished theold-age pension for women. This reform meant that women born in 1951 could still retire early at age 60, whereas women born in 1952 would not be able to retire early until 63. The reform is especially interesting due to its intensity (three years increase) and immediateness (one cutoff and no step-wise implementation). Quasi-random assignment around the cutoff allows to credibly identify causal effects using aRegression Discontinuity Design(RDD). We extend the study ofGeyer and Welteke (2019), which focuses only on individual-level employment effects, in several important dimensions. First, we examine the role of the household context for labor market effects and second, we additionally quantify the distributional and fiscal effects of the pension reform. For our empirical analysis, we use repeated cross sections of the Germanmicrocensus, which is a survey covering about 1% of all German households on an annual basis.In the first part of the empirical analysis, we use an RDD to evaluate the labor market effects. We focus on several different outcome variables, namely employment, retirement, unemployment, and inactivity. We quantify the average employment effect for the full population and focus on different subsamples to investigate effect heterogeneity of the pension reform. Moreover, we analyze the labor market effects at the household level. In the second part, we use the same empirical design and analyze the distributional implications of the pension reform, i.e. the effect on female income and on household income. Further, we quantify the fiscal effects.As mentioned above, household information is in general missing in administrative data sets which are used in numerous analyses of pension reforms (examples are given in Footnote 2). At the same time, household surveys often include too few observations for an in-depth analysis of the household level. Therefore, only few studies focus on heterogeneous employment effects of pension reforms at the household level. Notable exceptions are the studies byCribb et al. (2016)andCribb and Emmerson (2018). They focus on the gradual increase in the ERA over several cohorts of women in the UK using thelabor force survey. They find no significantly different employment effects by marital status, age of the partner, or housingwealth. Further,Cribb and Emmerson (2018)document negative income effects in particular for women inlower income households.Our paper is also related to studies that focus on retirement behavior in the household context. For exampleBlau and Gilleskie (2006);Gustman and Steinmeier (2000);Michaud and Vermeulen (2011);van der Klaauw and Wolpin (2008)estimate structural retirement models and show that complementarity in spouses’ leisure is a likely explanation for joint retirement behavior. Other studies use exogenous variation in pension age rules or incentives to identify joint retirement behavior in couples (e.g.Atalay, Barrett, Siminski, 2019,Banks, Blundell, Casanova, 2010,Lalive, Parrotta, 2017,Selin, 2017,Stancanelli, van Soest, 2012). The findings of this literature are mixed, yet most studies find larger spill-over effects for women than for men.3Finally, our study is linked to the growing literature that quantifies how economic shocks, such as unemployment or disability, can be reduced or partially insured in the household context, see e.g.Blundell et al. (2016),Autor et al. (2019)orHaan and Prowse (2015).In line withGeyer and Welteke (2019), we find that raising the ERA leads on average to a sharp reduction in retirement, to positive employment effects, and to an increase in unemployment and inactivity. In addition, we document important heterogeneity in the labor market effects. Specifically, we find highly educated women and single women to have larger employment effects. Further our results show that responses at the household level are important. On the one hand we find support for joint-retirement behavior within couples, on the other hand the employment effects at the household level are in line with financial insurance effects within the household. The distributional analysis shows that while the distribution of individual income is affected by the reform, the distribution of household income is not affected. Even for the mostvulnerable groups, such as single households or women without high education, we do not find significant reductions in household income. One reason for this result is program substitution. For women without high education we document a significant effect of the increase in the ERA on transfer receipt. Finally, we find sizable positive fiscal effects which are largely related to reducedpension paymentsto women aged 60-62.The paper is organized as follows.Section 2provides an overview of the institutional context of the German public pension system and describes the 1999 pension reform. Thereafter, we describe the data and showdescriptive statisticsof the estimation sample.Section 4explains the empirical methods and assumptions we use to identify the causal effect of an increase in the retirement age.Sections 5,6, and7show the findings of our empirical analysis of labor market outcomes, income, and fiscal implications.

"1. IntroductionRetirement is one of the main economic and social changes in the lives of most individuals and their households. Most people retire abruptly from a full-time job to a situation where they no longer take part in paid work. This not only affects their personal and household income, but also theirsocial networkand the activities on which they spend their time. For individuals in couples, retirement of husband or wife may have an important impact on the partner through household income, but also through the changes in the time spent by the retired partner on, for example, household production (e.g., errands, housework, care and support for other household members, repairs on and around the house, etc.) or (joint) leisure activities. The cross-effects of retirement on the partner have been used in the retirement literature to explain, for example, the stylized fact that many couples retire at almost the same point in time, in spite of an age difference (Hurd, 1990;Gustman and Steinmeier, 2000,2009).The economics literature has emphasized the stylized fact that household consumption expenditures drop substantially upon retirement of the main earner, known as the retirement consumption puzzle (Hamermesh, 1984;Banks et al., 1998).1Several explanations for this puzzle have been given, such as unexpected retirement (Haider and Stephens, 2007), uncertainty about the timing of retirement (Blau, 2008), a reduction in work related expenses (Battistin et al., 2009), or a fall in required consumption expenditures to achieve a given welfare level due to an increase in time spent on household production activities (Hurst, 2008).Aguiar and Hurst (2005,2007) find that after retirement, individuals in the US spend more time on shopping and preparing food, leading to a lower effective price of food consumption.Hurd and Rohwedder (2008)find that in the US, retirement increases the time men and women spend on house cleaning and the time men spend on home improvements and gardening, probably reducing the need for expenditures on outsourcing.Unlike the studies mentioned above,Stancanelli and van Soest (2012)also consider the effect of retirement of one partner on the time spent on home production by the other partner. Using cross-section data on French couples around retirement age, they find that men respond to their wives’ retirement by significantly reducing the time they allocate to home production, while there is no significant effect of men's retirement on their wives’ hours of home production.Battistin et al. (2009),Ciani (2016)andStancanelli and van Soest (2012)account for the potential endogeneity of retirement decisions by exploiting a regression discontinuity approach, based upon the minimum age for receiving retirement benefits.Aguiar and Hurst (2005)also allow for endogeneity of retirement, but make the stronger assumption that age can be used as an instrument for retirement. None of these studies used panel data.In this study, we use longitudinal data for German couples in the age group 45 – 75, followed over time from 1991 until 2016. The data set not only contains rich background information, but also has survey information on the time spent on various activities relating to home production and leisure, similar to the time use information in the HRS consumption and activities module (seeHurd and Rohwedder, 2008).This type of retrospective survey information has certain drawbacks compared to the detailed diary information typically collected in specific time use surveys. Previous studies have shown, however, that it does lead to reliable results inmultivariate analyseswhere the focus is not on the absolute amounts of time spent on certain activities but on the relations between time use and other variables (Bonke, 2005;Kitterød and Lyngstad, 2005). Moreover, an important advantage of these data is their unique longitudinal nature,We simultaneously estimate the effect of retirement and the effect of not working for other reasons of both partners on the time spent on home production of each of them. We use discontinuities in the retirement probability induced by pension eligibility ages to identify the effects of retirement, and use exogenous variation induced by plant closure to identify the effect of not working for other reasons. Since the validity of the latter instrument is more plausible if unobserved time-invariant heterogeneity is controlled for, we exploit the panel dimension of the data and includefixed effectsin all equations. We present a number of sensitivity checks in the Online Appendix. Our results are rather robust for the chosen specification and the identifying assumptions.We find that a transition from paid work into retirement significantly increases own home production. Depending on the specification, it increases home production by 8–14 h per week for men and by 7–11 h per week for women. The effects of other exits from work are similar and even somewhat larger. We find much smaller negative cross-effects of the wife's exit from work into retirement on home production done by the husband, limiting the effect on total household production in the household; the effect of the husband's retirement on the wife's home production is not statistically significant.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.Section 2presents a theoretical framework for the possible changes in home production of both partners at retirement andSection 3introduces the empirical strategy.Section 4introduces the data and the variables used in the analysis.Section 5providesdescriptive statisticsandSection 6presents the estimation results.

"1. IntroductionWhat happens to the labor-market careers of native workers after a sudden inflow of migrants into their occupations? The question is difficult to answer empirically because labor-demand changes affect migration flows, causing a simultaneity problem. In this paper, I provide an answer based on individual-level administrative register data for Norway and novel exogenous immigration variation at the occupational level. The variation arises from occupation-specific requirements for language skills combined with the enlargement of the common European labor market.The expansions of the European Union (EU) eastward in 2004 and 2007 with, in total, 12 new countries (EU121) ledto an immigration surge into Norway. Labor immigration from the new member states increased strongly and contributed to more than a quarter of the net increase in the Norwegian workforce between 2005 and 2011. Prior to the EU accession, EU12 immigration had been limited toseasonal workersand specialists with work permits via their Norwegian employers. As EU citizens, however, they were free to enter employment in Norway.The arriving EU12 migrants sorted into less language-intensive occupations because of limited Norwegian language skills. Norwegian is linguistically distant from Eastern European languages and hardly spoken or taught outside Norway. Consequently, natives and immigrants with otherwise identical formal qualifications became employed in different occupations. The left panel ofFig. 1illustrates the handicap of EU12 migrants. The vertical axis measures the percentage point change in occupations’ share of EU12 workers from 2005 to 2011, and the horizontal axis ranks all occupations by the required level of Norwegian language skills. I measure language requirements with a standardized index based on O*NET data adapted to Norwegian occupations.2Each circle represents an occupation, weighted by (total) 2005 employment.

The y-axis measures the percentage point change in occupations’ share of EU12 immigrants (left panel) and recent Scandinavian immigrants (right panel) from 2005 to 2011. The x-axes measure occupation-specific requirements for language skills, given by a standardized index retrieved from O*NET data. Each circle is an occupation, weighted by its size in 2005. The solid line is a linear fit. Scandinavian immigrants arenewlyarrived Swedes and Danes to exclude those with already acquired Norwegian language skills.Fig. 1illustrates that occupation-specific language requirements are well suited to instrument for EU12 immigration into the Norwegian labor market, but less so for immigration from countries with linguistically proximate majority languages, for instance, Scandinavia. The Scandinavian languages—Swedish, Danish, and Norwegian—are so similar that Swedes and Danes in principle can enter most Norwegian occupations. As visible in the right panel ofFig. 1, Scandinavian migrants entered occupations along the complete language-skill distribution.3In parallel, language requirements are less suited to instrument for immigration to countries with a world language as the majority language, where such requirements generally form no barriers.I exploit the relationship in the left panel ofFig. 1to estimate the causal effect of the historically large labor immigration surge to Norway on natives’ occupation-specific outcomes—that is, labor earnings, several employment outcomes, and various mobility forms. I instrument for the possibly endogenous inflow of EU12 workers into occupations with the language requirement index. The baseline model gives the effect of EU12 immigration into (unprotected) natives’ initial occupation (fixed in 2005) on the change in their cumulative labor earnings from before to after the onset of the immigration surge.The results show that a one percentage point increase in an occupation’s EU12 share reduced the earnings of natives initially employed in that occupation by 0.75 percent relative to language-protected natives. The estimate incorporates all medium-run changes in labor-market activity that possibly affect labor earnings, includingoccupational mobility. I find evidence of strong adverse impacts on wages and unemployment insurance receipt for young workers, and on work hours, full-time employment, and disability program participation for all workers, and in particular for old workers. Surprisingly, I find no effect on mobility across areas,industries, sectors, or firms for workers exposed to EU12 immigration. However, the probability of re-educating and entering occupations with higher language requirements increased, indicating skill-upgrading.To interpret the estimated earnings effect causally, I must assume parallel earnings trends in absence of migration—that is, that the earnings of workers in occupations with varying language requirements would have developed equally without increased inflow of EU12 workers, conditional on the control variables.Section 5gives credibility to the assumption both graphically and with numerous robustness checks, and shows that EU12 immigration cannot predict previous earnings. Further, estimating on sample strata and adding and altering various individual- and occupation-level controls, such as intelligence, industry, region, and requirements for several cognitive ability measures, do not change the main conclusion. Neither does the inclusion offixed effectsfor nine aggregated occupation groups, which alters the identification level from across all occupations to across occupationswithineach group. All checks prove that the estimated immigration coefficient is highly robust.This paper introduces language requirements as a novel instrument for the endogenous allocation of immigrants at the occupational level. Rather than estimating impacts on the skill content of natives’ occupations, as inFoged and Peri (2016),Peri and Sparber (2009), andPeri and Sparber (2011), I use the specific (language) skill content of each initial occupation topredictmigrant inflow and thereby the heterogeneous immigration exposure of native workers with unequal language protection. The identified effect is therelative effecton natives employed in occupations with different language requirements, and thereby with different immigrant exposure, and not thetotal effecton (all) natives. I estimate the earnings differentials resulting from increases in the supply of low-language workers.I cannot identify the underlying theoretical mechanisms, which may include high substitutability between natives and immigrants within occupations and complementarities across occupations. Increased demand for high-language workers or for language skillsper sein response to increased low-language labor supply would amplify the effect. Opposite, natives’ selective entry into more language-intensive occupations would reduce the wages in those occupations, dampening the (relative) effect. The total effect is likely to be less negative due to cross-occupational complementarities.Two related Norwegian studies byBratsberg and Raaum (2012)andFinseraas et al. (2019)exploit differential licensing requirements among occupations in the construction sector. Both estimate almost identical wage effects as my earnings estimate. To my knowledge, other occupation-level studies estimate total wage effects and therefore are not directly comparable. The comparability is also low due to the setting-specific nature of immigration impacts and because different estimation strategies identify different parameters (Dustmann et al., 2016). Nevertheless, my results align with the negative effects on manual laborers inOrrenius and Zavodny (2007); the large negative effects on service occupations inSteinhardt (2011); and the negative effects at the bottom, the insignificant at the middle, and the positive at the top of the communicative-to-manual task intensity distribution inBollinger and Sharpe (2019). Because I estimate relative effects, my results are consistent with the (insignificant) large positive total earnings effects inFriedberg (2001), as well.4The present estimation strategy falls into the broader ”skill-cell approach,” in which workers are divided into experience-education cells. Commonly, skill-cell studies estimate negative (short-run) wage effects on (low-skill) natives relative to more experienced natives (Aydemir, Borjas, 2011,Borjas, 2003,Llull, 2018). My results align with these studies, as well, although the identified effect is relative to workers in occupations with different language requirements rather than different experience levels within education cells.Exploiting occupation-level immigration variation has several advantages, including reduced bias resulting from misplacement of immigrants into skill cells (”downgrading bias”) and from low substitutability of immigrants and natives within skill cells. The substitutability is likely higher within occupations than skill cells (Card, 2001).5Further, when comparing repeated cross-sections over time—as in both skill-cell studies and ”spatial studies”—mobile workers may cause bias by altering the group compositions. I avoid potential attenuation bias arising from such endogenous mobility by following individuals and keeping their occupation fixed.6The rest of the paper is organized as follows.Section 2describes the immigration surge;Section 3explains the identification strategy and data used;Section 4presents the estimation setup and baseline results;Section 5tests for validity and robustness;Section 6examines possible mechanisms behind the estimated earnings impact; andSection 7concludes.",Maria,None,None
"1. IntroductionAt any given point in time there are roughly half a million youth in foster care with about 300,000 children entering into foster care every year (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2000–2015).2A large and growing body of research has shown that foster care leads to poorhuman capital formationand a host of undesirable outcomes (Doyle, 2007,Doyle, 2008,Surratt, Kurtz, 2012andWarburton et al., 2014). For example, in California 70% of prison inmates were foster children at some point in their lives.3Meanwhile, national estimates suggest that fully 28% of homeless individuals were once foster youth (Burt, 1999). More broadly, former foster youth have lower levels of employment and educational attainment, while having greater rates of drug use, incarceration, homelessness, unplanned fertility, and welfare recipiency (Havlicek, 2011,Font, Maguire-Jack, 2013,King, Putnam-Hornstein, Cederbaum, Needell, 2014).Given the perception of foster youth as a highly vulnerable segment of society and the enormous costs associated with crime, incarceration, welfare recipiency and homelessness, there have been movements in recent years intended to alter and improve foster care for all stakeholders. One notable trend has been increased placement of foster children with extended family members (kinship foster care) rather than placement with unrelated foster families (traditional foster care).Despite considerable usage of kinship care as a placement for foster youth, the practice still represents a minority of placements and is not without controversy.4Commonly cited benefits to kinship care include a lesser degree of home removal trauma, greater continuity in the child’s life, lower costs to the public and the argument that kinship care providers are potentially more motivated than caregivers that lack a biological bond. Alternatively, disadvantages associated with kinship care are that caregivers are generally older, poorer, less educated, less healthy and less likely to use resources and support services provided by child welfare agencies (Harden et al., 2004). Moreover, kinship providers are often reluctant to limit contact between the child and abusive or neglectful parents (Vanschoonlandt et al., 2012). Finally, many Child Protective Service agents are quick to suggest that children who are removed from their nuclear families may be ill served by being placed with extended family members who may share problematic views and practices with the child’s nuclear family (Peters, 2005). Thus, it remains unclear whether kinship care represents an improvement over traditional foster care and whether case workers and administrators should emphasize one type of labor over another.Given the theoretical ambiguity of the effects of kinship care, and the high stakes present, there has been a considerable effort to uncover the effects of different foster care placements so that child welfare agencies can make the best decisions possible. An older strand of this primarily sociological literature is ably summarized byCuddeback (2004), who notes that “the research regarding outcomes of kinship vs. non-kinship care is limited and inconclusive” and notes that future research would do well to considerlongitudinal researchdesigns and to account for selection effects.5A more recent literature in economics has sought to improve upon the research designs and data used in earlier studies.Doyle (2007a)leverages a sudden decrease in the Illinois subsidy rate for kinship care relative to non-kinship care to evaluate whether placement type affects children’s health and educational outcomes. As marginal kinship care providers are replaced,Doyle (2007a)finds no evidence that non-kinship care resulted in worse outcomes.Hayduk (2017)leverages changes in US state laws intended to give preferential consideration to kin as potential caregivers. Findings suggest that kinship care is beneficial in terms of placement stability and duration, but that these benefits do not appear to result in improved physical or mental health for children.Despite recent progress and the tremendous value in determining the true effects of different placements, the most important impacts of foster care placements are relatively understudied. This is first and foremost due to a lack of suitable data. In order to uncover long-run effects that dominate social cost considerations, panel data spanning considerable periods of time are presumably necessary, but until recently have been largely absent. We address data shortcomings through the use of newly available panel data that offers considerable detail and many years of observations for foster youth transitioning to young adulthood.A second notable difficulty is that rigorous studies of foster care must account for selection effects. Namely, children with different characteristics may systematically receive different placements types, i.e. traditional or kinship, while also being more or less likely to be removed from their homes. Given the potential for selection issues, it is exceedingly difficult to disentangle the effects of placement type from the intrinsic nature of the child and their past experiences. In order to fully account for the presence of all possible selection effects, the ideal experiment would likely need to randomize across both the removal decision and placement type. This experimental ideal would almost certainly be able to yield definitive answers about the relative merits of kinship and traditional care. Given that true randomization across both removal and placement decisions is not presently possible, a quasi-experimental approach is arguably best suited to overcome concerns about the potential for different types of children to be assigned different placement settings.We seek to address selection issues in placement type by leveraging quasi-randomization through the use of aninstrumental variables(IV) approach that has the potential to purge our study of confounding selection effects that relate to placement type. We utilize caregiver monthly compensation levels as our instrument. The core logic of the instrument is that extended family members are less sensitive to monthly caregiver payments than unrelated traditional caregivers. Hence, when compensation is low children are more likely to receive kinship care, and less likely to receive traditional care. Empirically, the instrument is highly predictive of placement as higher compensation levels are strongly correlated with traditional foster care placement, while lower compensation levels strongly predict kinship foster care placement. Our data plausibly indicate that changes in foster care provider compensation alone do not appear to lead to altered outcomes for foster care youth. That being said, it remains a possibility that additional compensation could potentially offer direct benefits to foster youth. If such selection effects indeed exist, it would attenuate, rather than inflate, our findings. Additionally, since compensation standards are determined by state governments in rigorously documented ways, it is plausible that compensation levels are uncorrelated with unobservable child characteristics.6An instrumental variable approach in conjunction with panel data allows us to generate estimates of the impact of kinship foster care relative to traditional foster care for former foster youth in the long run. We consider employment, educational enrollment, socialwelfare programparticipation, homelessness,substance abuseand incarceration. Our findings imply long run benefits to kinship foster care. The empirical analysis indicates that compared to children who were placed in traditional foster care, former foster youth that were placed in kinship care are more likely to be employed or in school, less likely to be incarcerated, less likely to be homeless and less likely to receive social welfare benefits. Our findings are both statistically and practically significant, while also being robust to multiple specifications, sensitivity analyses, and sample refinements.Our paper offers at least two contributions to the extant literature. First, we obtain plausible estimates of the effects of foster care placement types through an instrumental variables identification strategy. Secondly, by using long-term longitudinal data with considerable detail and large numbers of observations, we shed light on many of the adverse outcomes former foster youth face as they transition into adulthood. Our results should be of considerable interest to policy makers that must make important decisions about foster care placement, as well as to researchers interested in human capital formation and the relative costs and benefits of familial labor.The rest of the paper is organized as follows.Section 2discusses institutional details and findings from prior research.Section 3describes our data and reports descriptive analyses.Section 4provides the empirical framework.Section 5presents the central results, extensions and robustness checks.Section 6offers a discussion of our results.Section 7concludes.",Nicholas,Yuhan,None
"1. IntroductionIn recent decades, labor markets in the United States and other developed countries have become increasingly polarized: The share of employment in middle-wage occupations has declined, while employment in both high- and low-wage jobs has increased. This “hollowing out” of the middle of the wage distribution has been linked to the declining share of employment in occupations with a high content ofroutine tasks– those activities that can be performed by following a well-defined set of procedures (see, for instance,Autor et al. (2006),Goos and Manning (2007),Goos et al., 2009andAcemoglu and Autor (2011)). The declining employment in routine-intensive occupations has in turn been attributed to the fact that new technologies are particularly effective at performing these types of tasks (Autor et al., 2003).1In spite of the growing literature on polarization, relatively little is known about the individual-level patterns underlying the decline of routine employment. We use matched data from the monthly Current Population Survey (CPS) to analyze transitions into and out of employment in routine occupations. Our view is that characterizing the process by which routine employment is disappearing serves as an important guide in formalizing and evaluating theories of job polarization. It is equally important to the understanding of the changing labor market opportunities faced by differentdemographicgroups, which is crucial in assessing policy implications; for example, the appropriate policy response would differ if the decline is accounted for by changes in theoccupational choicesof new labor market entrants than if it is due to increasing exit rates out of the labor force of prime-aged workers from routine employment.Thus, our goal is to compare the quantitative importance of transition rates into routine occupations (inflow rates) relative to transitions rates out of routine occupations (outflow rates) in the observed decline in routine employment.2The set of inflow rates that we consider include transitions from labor force non-participation and unemployment to routine employment. The set of outflow rates that we consider are the reverse transitions, i.e. flows from routine employment to labor force non-participation and unemployment.3We begin the analysis inSection 2by describing how we use data from matched CPS files to construct nationally representative labor market flows at a monthly frequency from 1976 to 2018. We classify individuals in each month according to their labor market status (employed, unemployed, or not in the labor force) and their current or most recentoccupational group(non-routine cognitive, routine cognitive, routine manual or non-routine manual, detailed below), and track their transitions over time.In order to determine which changes in transition rates are key in accounting for the decline of routine employment, we perform a series of counterfactual exercises inSection 3. In these counterfactuals we replace different transition rates (for example, the entry rate from out of the labor force into routine manual employment), with their values observed prior to the onset of polarization. Applying a law-of-motion equation and using these counterfactual transition rates, we obtain counterfactual values of routine employment which inform us about how routine employment would have evolved had a specific transition rate not changed. By comparing these counterfactual values to those observed in the data, we can determine how much of the fall in routine employment would have been prevented if particular entry or exit rates had remained at their pre-polarization levels.Before commenting on our results, it is useful to relate our counterfactual approach to other methods in the literature. First, we note that our approach is similar in spirit to the literature analyzing the role of job finding rates and job separation rates in accounting for the dynamics of unemployment over the business cycle (e.g.Darby, Haltiwanger, Plant, 1985,Elsby, Michaels, Solon, 2009,Hall, 2006,Shimer, 2012). The key difference is that we analyze the secular decline in routine employment rather than the cyclical fluctuations in the unemployment rate. Our approach is also related to decomposition methods in economics (see e.g.Fortin et al., 2011), where the contribution of different channels to the observed change in an outcome variable of interest are quantified by counterfactually holding certain factors constant. Since in our particular setting counterfactuals need not add up to the total change (as is the case in decomposition approaches), we opt to use the term counterfactuals when referring to the experiments that we carry out, and use the term decomposition whenever we use more “common” decomposition methods in economics.4Turning to results, our key finding is that inflow rates are much more important than outflow rates in accounting for the decline of routine employment. Specifically, had the inflow rates remained at their pre-polarization levels, at least 40% of the fall in routine employment would have been prevented. In contrast, had the outflow rates not changed, less than 5% of the fall in routine employment would have been prevented.These results are performed using aggregate transition rates. However, changes in aggregate transition rates can be the result of both changes in the demographic composition of the economy (given that different demographic groups have different transition rates), and changes in transition rates for given demographic groups. As such, when we perform counterfactuals that hold aggregate transition rates constant, we effectively also remove the changes that are driven solely by demographic change. To address this shortcoming, we distinguish between the role of demographic change and changes in transition propensities within demographic groups inSection 4.We begin with a series of Oaxaca–Blinder decompositions (Blinder, 1973,Oaxaca, 1973), and show that the vast majority of the decline in the aggregate inflow rates to routine occupations are driven by propensity changes conditional on demographic characteristics. Next, we re-visit our counterfactual exercises in greater detail, allowing for transition rates to evolve heterogeneously across demographic groups, and taking into account the changing relative importance of different demographic groups in the U.S. economy.Our first exercise gauges how much of the change in routine employment is due to changes in the demographic structure of the economy. To do so we allow each demographic group’s transition rates across the different labor market statuses to evolve as they did in the data. However, we hold the size of each demographic group constant at its 1976 level. This experiment results in a counterfactual series of aggregate labor market status that differs from the empirically observed one due solely to the lack of demographic change. By comparing the resulting counterfactual and observed routineemployment changes, we can attribute a fraction of the decline to demographic change. In this experiment, we find that demographic change alone can account for less than a quarter of the total long-run decline in routine manual employment, and essentially none of the decline in routine cognitive occupations.In our second set of counterfactuals, we allow for demographic change to occur as it did in the data, but we hold group-specific inflow and outflow rates constant at their pre-polarization era levels. Once again, we find that inflow rates are quantitatively much more important than outflow rates. Moreover, we show that changes in the inflow rates to routine employment not only account for a substantial fraction of the decline in these occupations, but they also account for nearly three quarters of the rise in non-participation observed over the last two decades. This indicates that these falling inflow rates to routine employment havenotbeen matched with increasing inflow rates tonon-routineoccupations; rather, they have resulted in increased propensities to remain out of employment.We conclude our analysis by investigating which demographic groups are key in driving the changes that we have documented. Our quantitative finding is that three groups are salient in terms of their importance in driving the long-run dynamics of aggregate routine employment: males, the young, and those with intermediate levels of education.As discussed above, relatively little attention has been paid to the labor market dynamics underlying the phenomenon of job polarization.5Two recent papers are related to our analysis.Foote and Ryan (2014)analyze worker flows in the context of polarization, distinguishing between routine workers employed in differentindustries. Their paper differs from ours in that their primary goal is to study the cyclical properties of these flows, rather than their relationship with the long-term decline in routine employment.Smith (2013)describes the evolution of a number of flows into and out of routine employment and performs steady-state counterfactuals to analyze the importance of different transition rates in the decline of routine employment. As such, our papers share a number of findings, including the importance of job finding rate changes. At the same time, our analysis differs in a number of ways. First, our analysis allows us to determine not only the extent of transition rate change over time, but also how this is decomposed into composition and propensity change. Our detailed counterfactuals allow us to disentangle the role of demographic change and propensity change in accounting for the decline of routine employment. Second, whileSmith (2013)focuses primarily on transitions between unemployment and employment, we analyze transitions into and out of the labor force, which we find to be key in accounting for routine employment dynamics. Finally, by using data from the 1970s, we are able to analyze how transition rates have changed relative to their levels prior to the onset of job polarization.",Guido,Nir,Christopher
"1. IntroductionThe important role ofsocial networksin people’s lives raises the question of how these networks influence individual labor market outcomes (see e.g.,Ioannides, Loury, 2004,Jackson, 2010,Topa, Zenou, 2015). Finding a job after being laid off may not only be a function of individual characteristics and vacancies posted by firms. It may also be the result of social networks that influence job search behavior via social norms or give job seekers a competitive advantage by providing information on vacancies and referring them to firms.In this paper, we draw on a novel geo-coded data set that comprises the universe of workers in 23 self-contained labor market regions in Germany. We draw workers who lost their jobs due to plant closures. Knowing where these workers live we then try to answer two questions: First, does the employment rate in the residential neighborhood of a job seeker affect her probability of finding a job? Second, can we ascribe the neighborhood effect on job-finding probabilities to social norms or information about vacancies and referrals? To answer the second question, we analyze the effect of the neighborhood employment rate on displaced workers’ match quality once they found a new job and investigate whether they find a job at the plant of a neighbor.While, as most other studies, we do not directly observe the actual contacts an individual worker has in her social network, our approach enables us to address various other issues when it comes to identifying a social network effect. Focusing on workers who lost their job due to plant closures has several advantages: First, other types of job loss may be determined by unobserved individual characteristics, such as lack of human capital, low job performance or productivity that may affect labor market outcomes. In contrast, by focusing on separations due to plant closures, we identify workers who, for an exogenous reason from their perspective, become unemployed and start looking for a job (e.g.,Glitz, 2017). Second, workers displaced due to plant closures have little chance of being recalled to jobs with their old employer and thus the job loss is permanent (e.g.,Kletzer, 1998, for an early contribution). Third, as argued byManski (1993), common factors affecting the employment status of an individual and her social network may flaw estimates of a social network effect. By focusing on workers who lost their jobs due to plant closures we can minimize the likelihood that the job loss was due to individual specific unobservables which are correlated with our network measure and may affect post-displacement labor market outcomes.Identification for estimating a causal effect then rests on the assumption that a worker who lost her job due to a plant closure that was beyond her control is not systematically sorted into a neighborhood of one-square-kilometer size. Whether this is the case, hinges on workers not having chosen to live in a specific neighborhood before job loss. If they would self-select into a neighborhood for reasons we cannot observe, but that are related to employment-relevant characteristics of the neighborhood, estimates would be biased. We provide evidence based on the local nature of our data that sorting into neighborhoods is rather unlikely in our case. Thus, our study aims at exploiting variation that comes with displaced workers receiving “treatments” of varying degrees by living in neighborhoods with differing shares of employed workers.We expect that higher neighborhood employment rates increase the probability of finding a job all else equal. The literature suggests three mechanisms that might improve the employment probability of a worker living in a neighborhood where a high share of residents is employed. First, the network may help potential employers overcome the problem of asymmetric information (Montgomery, 1991,Simon, Warner, 1992). As firms often have difficulties assessing the true productivity of job applicants, referrals from workers who live in the neighborhood may provide valuable information and make it more likely for firms to hire workers who already know someone working in the firm. Second, the neighborhood may provide information on job vacancies that workers without these contacts may not receive (Calvó-Armengol, Jackson, 2007,Topa, 2001). Third, one may observe faster transitions back into employment, not because the social network provides information but because of a social norm effect. In this case, workers living in neighborhoods with high employment rates may derive a negative utility from not being employed, as their status is different from the socially prevalent one. Thus, being employed is regarded as the social norm (see, among others,Agell, 1999,Akerlof, 1980,Besley, Coate, 1992,Lindbeck, Nyberg, Weibull, 1999), and not obeying the norm generates negative socio-psychological costs. Therefore, job search efforts of job seekers might be higher in neighborhoods with higher employment rates. Our empirical analysis tries to shed light on which of these mechanisms is more likely to explain an effect of the neighborhood employment rate on the job-finding probability of displaced workers.In our preferred specification, we find that a 10 percentage points increase in the neighborhood employment rate increases the probability of being employed after six months by 1.9%. Furthermore, we provide evidence that employed neighbors who belong to similar socio-demographic groups make it easier to find new jobs. Regressions of daily earnings on neighborhood employment rates also reveal statistically significant positive effects. A 10 percentage points higher employment rate within a given neighborhood increases daily earnings for those who find a new job within six months by 4%. Moreover, jobs found after displacement last longer by almost two weeks and the probability to lose these jobs within the first 12 months falls by 2.8%. We argue that both, the higher earnings and the longer job stability, suggest that transmission of information or referrals rather than social norms are explaining higher job-finding rates. On top of that, we provide evidence that the probability to find a job at the plant of a neighbor increases with the neighborhood employment rate indicating that neighbors do refer job seekers to employers.The literature defines social networks in various ways.Cappellari and Tatsiramos (2015)look into friendship ties,Kramarz and Nordström Skans (2014)study familyties as the relevant social network, andDustmann et al. (2016)delineate networks in terms of ethnicity. Social networks, defined as a set of former coworkers, are the starting point for the studies byCingano and Rosolia (2012),Glitz (2017),Saygin et al. (2019), orHensvik and Nordström Skans (2016).Our contribution relates to a literature that defines the relevant social network of a worker in terms of her residential neighborhood. The effect of neighborhood networks has been examined with respect to various outcome variables including the transition from welfare to work (Hoynes, 2000,Van der Klaauw, Van Ours, 2003), social insurance take-up (Markussen and Røed, 2015), the effect on children’s cognitive skills (Helmers and Patnam, 2014), technology adoption (Conley and Udry, 2010), or crime (Katz et al., 2001).1Our contribution is most closely related to the literature exploring the effects of neighborhood networks on employment, wages, and the quality of jobs.Datcher (1982), a very early contribution to the empirical literature on neighborhood effects, shows that a substantial fraction of the racial differences in education and earnings can be attributed to the poorer neighborhoods from which blacks come. More recent studies areBayer et al. (2008),Hellerstein et al. (2011), andHawranek and Schanne (2014)providing evidence that workers coming from the same residential neighborhood tend to cluster around specific work locations which is consistent with the idea of local referral networks.Burns et al., 2010find that coming from a neighborhood with socio-economic characteristics that match the ones of the job seeker improves job-finding probabilities. Evidence that ethnic diversity has a negative effect on employment is provided byHémet and Malgouyres (2018), andDawkins et al. (2005)find that residential segregation affects racial differences in unemployment durations.Beaman (2012),Edin et al. (2003)andDamm (2009)document that the size and quality of the neighborhood affect employment and wages of refugees. That higher quality neighborhoods affect wages positively is also confirmed bySchmutte (2015).The two contributions on neighborhood networks closest to our analysis areHellerstein et al., 2019andBauer et al. (2011).Hellerstein et al., 2019use mass layoffs to identify neighborhood network effects. In contrast to our analysis, they employ U.S. census tract data and rely on two measures of labor market network strength capturing the flow of information to job seekers and referrals provided to employers. They find that the re-employment probability and thus the network connection is weaker during theGreat Recession. Based on German data,Bauer et al. (2011)show that the individual employment probability is negatively affected by the neighborhood unemployment rate. They define neighborhoods using ZIP codes. Postal areas differ considerably in size and are observable, allowing individuals to assess the quality of the neighborhood. In terms of population size, these neighborhoods host on average 7900 individuals starting from 2500 to a maximum of 25,500. In contrast, our neighborhoods contain on average 600 workers and thus are considerably smaller and of equal size which makes it less likely that workers sort into neighborhoods.Against the background of these two studies, we are able to estimate the effect of the neighborhood’s employment rate on an individual’s probability of finding a new job after a plant closure. Furthermore, our analysis draws on a novel, geo-coded data set based on administrative records in Germany that does not follow administrative frontiers orborders. Besides looking into short- and long-run effects of the neighborhood on workers’ job-finding rates, the data set allows us to evaluate more deeply the economic mechanisms that are likely driving our findings. Information on daily earnings of the displaced workers who found a new job and on their job stability enable us to discriminate between explanations related to social norms, and explanations of information transmission or referrals. As our data set also allows to investigate whether a job seeker finds a job at the plant of a neighbor we are able to further discriminate between information transmission and referrals as job finding mechanisms. Thus, we can add to the existing empirical literature why, how, and for how long social networks matter.We proceed with a description of our data.Section 3introduces theeconometricmodel and discusses our identification strategy.

"1. IntroductionAs part of the larger push for Equal Paylegislationin the United States, several states and municipalities have recently passed laws regarding revelation ofsalaryhistories. While the details of these laws differ across jurisdictions, they have several common features. These laws explicitly prohibit employers from seeking salary history information of potential employees during the hiring process.3While some laws are silent on employees volunteering their salary history information, others have explicit clauses that allow for this possibility (California and Connecticut, for instance). In fact, the California law states “If an applicant voluntarily and without prompting discloses salary history information to a prospective employer, nothing in this section shall prohibit that employer from considering or relying on that voluntarily disclosed salary history information in determining the salary for that applicant”.4Table 1lists the municipalities and states that have passed these laws, with the date of enforcement and restrictions, if any.5Table 1.

The aim is to ensure that low paying jobs held early in a woman’s career (or poorly negotiated ones) do not have an impact on future salaries. Supporters claim that the potential impact of this law will be to raise the relative wages of women compared to similarly qualified men. Opponents claim that it would complicate the hiring process and increase litigation risk. They believe that open discussion about salary history as well as future salary expectations actually benefit employees in making decisions about jobs. Since this is a contentious issue, the laws have faced backlash from some members of the businesscommunity. For instance, the Greater PhiladelphiaChamber of Commercefiled a lawsuit questioning the validity of the law and filed a motion for preliminary injunction. More importantly, two states (Michigan and Wisconsin) have passed laws that explicitly ban the passage of such laws by local governments within the state with the intention of protecting employers’ right to solicit salary information from prospective employees. Barring these two exceptions, the rapid expansion of these laws across various states suggests that several other states may follow suit, and a federal law may be in the cards as well. Thus far, 16 states and 10 cities have passed some form of ban on salary history inquiries.6Because the laws are recent, empirical evidence of the impact of these laws on salaries for new jobs is scant. Aside from issues of data and timing, identifying the causal impact of such a law using observational data may be challenging since the laws are sometimes announced months or years before being enforced, and even when enforced, employers are only liable for penalties at a much later date, giving employers several months to address salary disparities. In some cases, there are other contemporaneous policy changes which may have confounding effects making it harder to disentangle the impact of the law under scrutiny.7Real world bargaining is complex and different features of these laws may have countervailing effects on wage outcomes. The main focus on this paper, therefore, is to examine the impact of certain aspects of such policies in a simple game-theoretic framework and to test those predictions in the lab. The controlled setting of the lab enables comparisons between treatment conditions which would not be possible with observational data. I examine the intended benefits of the policy by comparing theprivate informationcase with a perfect information benchmark. The efficacy of these laws may be affected by the fact that the laws either explicitly or implicitly allow prospective employees to voluntarily reveal their salary history to employers. Employers may treat non-revelation of salary history as a negative signal, since those with higher salaries would be much more likely to voluntarily disclose such information. To this end, I examine how the introduction of a voluntary information revelation choice can affect offers and final payoffs. Finally, I am also interested in understanding if individuals with an informational advantage behave strategically to misrepresent that information if they are free to do so, and how these results compare to other information regimes. Along with perfect information, this regime is also an important policy counterfactual to consider, since it is unclear whether real world salary revelations are necessarily truthful.I conduct an ultimatum bargaining experiment with different information treatments regarding disagreement payoffs (the outside option). While the outside option of the proposer (A) is always fixed and known, the outside option of the responder (B) can be one of two types, low or high. In the perfect information treatment (PER)B’s outside option is known toA. In the second treatment (PRI), it is privately known, while in the third I introduce a voluntary disclosure choice forBto truthfully reveal their outside option before the proposer makes an offer (PTR). In the final cheap-talk treatment, I allowBthe choice to misrepresent their outside option (PCT). In a way, the third and the fourth treatment represent important modifications to the private information case that lie at two extremes; the former representing an environment where all revelations are truthful while the latter allows for deception that has no explicit punishment or cost. Using this framework, I answer the following questions: Under which conditions are offers observed by those with the low outside option higher under private information as compared to perfect information? If offers are indeed higher, does adding a truthful information revelation choice before the offer is made affect the benefit of private information because of inferences the uninformed party can make based on revelation behavior? Do informed agents strategically misrepresent their outside option for perceived benefits? What implications do theory and the experimental results have for salary history bans?I find that introducing a truthful revelation choice for the informed party (B) undermines some of the benefits of private information, and outcomes come closer to the perfect information case. Based on the revelation choices ofB, therefore,Acan make some inferences about their opponents outside option. Confirming theoretical predictions, cheap-talk outcomes resemble those under private information since revelation signals are uninformative. This is because the overwhelming majority of those with a low outside option either hide or misrepresent their outside option as high in the hope of eliciting higher offers. The superior outcomes for those with a low outside option under private information reflects the intended effect of a policy that gives an informational advantage to one party in bargaining.Inequalityis lowest under private information and highest under perfect information. The experiment also demonstrates that the voluntary revelation feature of such policies may erode the informational advantage. Inequality is higher in this treatment as compared to the private information case. The similarity in results of the cheap-talk treatment and private information indicates that if we believe that potential employees can lie about their outside options and that employers know this, then their information is essentially private to begin with.Admittedly, real world wage bargaining may be more complicated than the ultimatum bargaining framework chosen here. I consider only two outside options, whereas an employer may have a continuous probability distribution over a range of possible salaries in mind while negotiating with an employee. Salary histories may not be exactly known by employers (perfect information) and it isn’t realistic to expect a situation in which they are private and we can compel all employees from revealing them (private information). To motivate these modeling choices, note that in a representative sample survey of U.S workers,Hall and Krueger (2012)find that only one-third did not consider their offer to be a take-it-or-leave-it offer, which suggests that ultimatum bargaining may not be uncommon. Half the respondents also said that their employers had learned their pay in their earlier jobs before making the offer that led to the current job. The private information case in this paper is a benchmark that indicates the policy intention, and is useful to study as such to reveal the full benefits of private information. It may also not be common knowledge that everyone who chooses to reveal their prior salary does so truthfully (truthful revelation treatment) or one in which lying about your previous salary is as easy as the click of a button without any chance of being found out or any real consequence (cheap talk). There is some evidence, however, that misrepresenting current salaries is a very real phenomenon. For instance, a labor market study of 60,000 respondents across 28 countries in Europe conducted by an international data company, Intelligence Group,8revealed that around 25% of Europeans lie about salaries during negotiations. This number is as high as 43% in countries like Germany and much lower in the United Kingdom and Greece. Given the sensitive nature of such a question, it is conceivable that these underestimate the actual degree of lying about previous salaries. A recent survey byAgan et al. (2020)also finds that only 5% of respondents believe with certainty that their current salary disclosures would be verified by potential employers. Thus, while understanding the limitations of modeling choices that yield clean and empirically testable predictions for this lab experiment is important when thinking about policy implications, there is evidence to suggest that even these simple cases may have wider implications for labor markets. A more general theoretical framework with less restrictive modeling choices which can also be adapted to study the salary history laws can be found inCullen and Hurson (2019). My experiment tests the theoretical prediction on an extension of their model which also argues that these laws may be ineffective, for exactly the same reason as elaborated upon in this paper. This is discussed further in the next section.The rest of this paper is organized as follows:Section 2discusses selected literature most closely related to my experimental design and the policy question.

"1. IntroductionThe concept of meaningful work—activities that individuals view as purposeful and worthwhile—has received relatively little attention in modern economics.1While organisational psychologists have long examined the meaning people derive from their jobs (Rosso et al., 2010), modern economists typically conceive of work as a disutility, i.e. as an unpleasant activity that must be endured as a means to earn an income andfinanceconsumption. Nevertheless, studies relying on self-reported and experimental data have challenged the assumption that only monetary motivations matter in the labour market (Binder, 2016,Bradler, Dur, Neckermann, Non, 2016,Hamermesh, 2018,Hamilton, 2000,Kosfeld, Neckermann, Yang, 2017,Preston, 1989,Stern, 2004). In fact, one convincing piece of evidence for the intrinsic value of work is the enormous psychological cost of becoming unemployed, which by far exceeds income losses (Clark, 2001,Kassenboehmer, Haisken-DeNew, 2009,Knabe and Rätzel, 2011,Knabe and Rätzel, 2011,Nikolova, Ayhan, 2019,Winkelmann, Winkelmann, 1998).Nevertheless, despite the recent attention to non-monetary work-incentives (Lazear, 2018), only two economics papers have called for incorporating work meaningfulness in standard labour supply models (Cassar, Meier, 2018,Spencer, 2015). Meanwhile, the empirical research on meaningful work inorganisational psychologyhas left several knowledge gaps (Lysova et al., 2019). While important, these studies rely on small non-representative samples, lack a unified definition of work meaningfulness, and use divergent measurement scales that often conflate meaningfulness with other constructs such as calling (Bailey, Lips-Wiersma, Madden, Yeoman, Thompson, Chalofsky, 2019,Bailey, Yeoman, Madden, Thompson, Kerridge, 2019). This is unfortunate because it limits our understanding of which factors contribute to work meaningfulness and whether it is conducive to behaviours such as increased effort and delayed retirement.This paper closes these knowledge gaps by making a threefold contribution to the literature: first, we investigate the determinants and consequences of meaningful work using a cross-country nationally representative dataset of workers from 30 European countries in 2005, 2010, and 2015. Conceptually, we rely on self-determination theory (Deci, Ryan, 1985,Ryan, Deci, 2000), which outlines the conditions leading to motivation and work meaningfulness. Empirically, we construct an index of meaningful work based on survey statements about perceptions of doing useful work and having feelings of “a job well done” (fulfillment) (see AppendixTable A.2andFig. 1). As such, we are the first to quantify the relative importance ofjob characteristicsthat enhance or diminish work meaningfulness, which could help inform policies and interventions to promote it. We find thatautonomy, competence, and relatedness are about 4.6 times more important for meaningfulness at work than compensation, benefits,career advancement, job insecurity, and working hours. Relatedness, which reflects supportive relationships with colleagues and superiors, emerges as the most important factor for work meaningfulness. These findings highlight the greater salience of self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation for meaningfulness compared to objective working conditions and monetary rewards.Download :Download high-res image (97KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. Violin plots, feelings of work well done and doing useful work.Source: Authors based on European Working Conditions Surveys (EWCS) 2005–2015.Second, we show that perceptions of meaningful work have implications forlabour economicsbecause they meaningfully predict retirement intentions,absenteeism, and skills training. For example, a ten-point increase in work meaningfulness reduces absenteeism by about one third of a working day per year and raises the intended retirement age by 2.5 years, on average. These findings not only validate the usefulness of work meaningfulness in economics but also have relevant implications for employers and policy-makers. Our third contribution is that we outline the conceptual and methodological steps for a future research agenda on meaningful work in economics.",Milena,Femke,None
"1. IntroductionVocational educationprograms have long been one of the mainstays ofactive labor market policies. The basic premise of these programs is that by providing skills rewarded in the labor market, the unemployed will find better paying jobs faster. In a simple labor supply model, the new skills raise the wage offers for program participants, generating job prospects above their reservation wages. The evidence on the effectiveness of these programs, however, is decidedly mixed (Blattman and Ralston, 2015;Brown and Koettl, 2015,McKenzie, 2017).1Among the possible hypothesized reasons for these programs’ mixed results is that the labor market may not value the specific skills the participants acquired. In particular, the curricula may lack important “soft” personal and social (“non-cognitive”) skills training (Heckman et al. 2006;Cunningham and Villaseñor 2014). Another concern with these programs is that they might generate expectations for better wages and employment conditions that do not materialize. Increased expectations might raise the reservation wage, but if training does not transfer skills that are sufficiently well-rewarded in the labor market, resulting wage offers may not match participants’ enhanced expectations. In this case, the worker would not be able to find a job that matched her expectations and could become discouraged.In this paper we use an at-scale randomized field experiment to examine the differential impact of vocational and soft skills job training for youth in theDominican Republic. The program, “Programa Juventud y Empleo” (PJyE), was designed to improve the employment opportunities of at-risk youth,2given the relatively high level of unemployment among youth, especially young women. In 2009, the unemployment rate of youth ages 15 to 24 with secondary education or less was 16.6% overall and 28.1% for women. This was relatively high, compared to 5.9% for adults 25-40 (8.8 for women), and 3.8% for adults 41-64 (4.4% for women) (ENFT3). PJyE's main objective was to improve the employment opportunities of at-risk youth by building their vocational and soft skills. The program provided in-classroom training and an internship in a private business, and participants had to complete both to graduate from the program. The program also financed participants’ transportation, medical and accident insurance, and provided them with a small stipend. Between 2002 and 2013, the program conducted 3627 courses training over 72,500 youth, of which 57% were women.We consider two interventions randomly assigned to program applicants: (1) vocational education combined with soft skills training and an internship and (2) soft skills-only training with an internship. We study both the short (one year) and medium run (three and a half year) effects, testing the effectiveness of the two alternative curricula. Consistent with the program's objectives, we examine effects on skill development, future expectations, labor market outcomes, and well-being. For women, we find that both curricula have strong positive effects on soft skills and on expectations of future labor market and life success. For men, however, neither curriculum had an effect on skills, although the curriculum with vocational education resulted in a positive effect on expectations. Hence, for men, the program illustrates conditions where expectations may exceed the returns to acquired skills, leading to discouragement.In fact, we found strikinggender differencesin the effects on short-run labor market outcomes. For women, both curricula were associated with higher employment rates in higher paying jobs with higher job satisfaction twelve months after program completion. Remarkably, there were no differences in effects between the vocational and the soft skills-only curricula, suggesting limited marginal value of the vocational education on top of soft-skills training, plus internship. However, while men who received only soft-skills curriculum saw no labor market effects, those who received the vocational curricula did see a negative effect on short-run employment and were more likely to reject higher wage offers. This latter effect is consistent with the program having had no effect on skills but creating expectations of higher wage offers that did not materialize, which may have led to higher unemployment.Three-and-a-half years after program completion (medium-run), neither curricula had an impact on employment or wages of either men or women. However, the interpretation of these results differs by gender. The training gave women skills that allowed them to find higher paying jobs faster than those in the control group. Over time, the women in the control group were able to catch up to those who benefitted from the program. On the other hand, men in the vocational education treatment group were more likely to turn down jobs, despite higher wage offers.The different labor market experiences of men and women led to different effects on medium-run welfare. After three-and-a-half years, women in the treatment group still had significantly higher positive expectations about their future life success and prospects in the labor market than did the control group. They also reported higher job satisfaction, self-esteem, and that they now needed higher salaries to meet their basic needs. On the other hand, men in the treatment group reported higher rates of active job search (even if employed), an increased likelihood of turning down higher paying jobs, lower self-esteem, and reported needing lower salaries to meet their basic needs. In other words, while the program positively improved women's lives, men ultimately experienced deterioration in the quality of their lives.This paper makes several contributions to the literature. First, to our knowledge, this is the first study to shed light on why vocational education programs may have limited or negative impacts on labor market outcomes by focusing on how programs affect both expectations and skills.Second, it helps to disentangle the marginal impact of the vocational component from the soft-skills component and the internship. Despite the popularity of training programs that combine different types of skill trainings (usually vocational, soft-skills, and apprenticeships), the evidence on the effectiveness of each of the components is very scarce. There are several experimental evaluations of training programs in low- and middle-income countries with a combination of different skills tracks andapprenticeships.4However, few of these studies separate out the marginal effects of the different components. An exception isGroh et al. (2016), which shows that a soft-skills training for women in Jordan increased the optimism and the expectations of the women about the future; however, the authors found no impact on labor outcomes. In a related study,Adhvaryu et al. (2018)study the effect of on-the-job soft skills training on a series of labor market outcomes for women garment workers in India. They also find increased extraversion and communication, and skill upgrading and higher productivity among beneficiaries, although they do not find evidence of increases in wages. To date, this is the first study that identifies the marginal impact of the vocational component. Since vocational training generally accounts for the bulk of the resources of these programs, this has practical implications in term of cost-effectiveness. We provide a simple cost-benefit analysis in the discussion section.Third, our paper provides medium-term experimental evidence of the impact of training programs in developing countries. While the short-term effects of training programs have been studied extensively in developed countries,5longer run experimental evidence for developing countries is still scarce and mixed.Ibarrarán et al. (2019)followed a different cohort of the PJyE for six years and found sustained effects on formality for men but no effects on employment. Other longer-run studies includeAttanasio et. al (2015), who use experimental data from a training program in 2005 in Colombia and find that even up to ten years later, the program had a positive and significant effect on the probability of working in the formal sector, and earnings were 11.8% higher.Hirshleifer et al. (2014)used administrative data to study the impacts of vocational education training in Turkey three years after the intervention finding that impacts in the short term dissipated with time; andAlzua et al. (2016)studied the effects of the program Entra 21 in Argentina four years after the completion of the project, finding similar results.Finally, gender differences are widely studied in the literature,6but results remain inconclusive.7Our results on gender differences are consistent with findings described byAttanasio et al. (2011), who evaluated Colombia'sJovenes en Acciónprogram, which has a similar curriculum as PJyE. Conducted 20 months after the beginning of the intervention, the authors found positive labor market effects for women but not for men.8The paper is structured as follows.Section 2describes the interventions considered in this study.Section 3describes the experimental evaluation design including random assignment, data collection,descriptive statistics, and estimation strategy.Section 4presents the results and the final section concludes.",Paloma,Guillermo,Paul
"1. IntroductionIn the past decade, economists have begun to investigate the role of language in shaping economic behaviour (e.g.,Caminal, Paolo, 2017,Olney, 2016; seeGazzola and Wickström, 2016, for an overview) and become particularly intrigued by the idea that language may have a causal influence on economic choices. For instance, in the most renowned paper,Chen (2013)shows that speakers of languages without strong grammatical distinction between present and future exhibit more future-oriented behaviours, perhaps because the future appears less distant in the daily routine of speaking. Another linguistic feature that has received much attention from economists is sex-based grammatical gender, which seems to link systematically togender differencesin economic outcomes. At the country level, several studies have documented a negative association between the dominant language’s gender marking and i) women’s participation in the labour market (Gay, Santacreu-Vasut, Shoham, 2013,Jakiela, Ozier, 2018,Mavisakalyan, 2015); ii) pay equality (van der Velde et al., 2015); iii) women’s representation in politics as well as their access to credit and land (Gay, Santacreu-Vasut, Shoham, 2013,Santacreu-Vasut, Shoham, Gay, 2013); iv) female participation in corporate management and female managers’ propensity to lead large teams (Santacreu-Vasut et al., 2014); v) women’sentrepreneurial activityrelative to men’s (Hechavarría et al., 2017).Systematic differences in economic behaviour across speech communities might arise if speaking a language affects speakers’ cognition, by drawing her attention to, e.g., the distinction between present and future, or gender. While this effect of “thinking for speaking” (Slobin, 1996,Slobin, 2003) has been hypothesised bylinguistsat least since the 1950s, it is difficult to test empirically because linguistic features might coevolve with formal and informal institutions. To illustrate, consider a localcommunityin which the mode of production, hundreds of years ago, relied on a highly gendereddivision of labour. Over time, the importance of this distinction of the male and female sphere may have shaped both the community’s language as well as formal and informal institutions. A growing body of empirical studies provides evidence that historical practices and modes of production in ancient societies—such as the use of plough cultivation (Alesina et al., 2013), the relative use of female labour in agriculture (Carranza, 2014), or the adoption ofpastoralismas a form of subsistence (Becker, 2019)—predict contemporary gender differences among their descendants. Furthermore, these studies show that the adoption of certain production practices in ancient societies was determined by environmental conditions, which have also been found to be predictive of linguistic features of local languages, such as the presence of grammatical gender (Galor et al., 2018).1Taken together, this evidence indicates that linguistic features do not evolve randomly, but rather in response to environmental features, possibly the same that also shape social practices, institutions and norms.Previous research has addressed the coevolution of language andformalinstitutions by exploiting within-country variation inlinguistic structures(e.g.,Jakiela, Ozier, 2018,Mavisakalyan, 2015).2The goal of this paper is to shed light on the interrelatedness of language andinformalinstitutions, in particular social norms. As codes of conduct that prescribe how one “ought to behave”, social norms are more difficult to rule out as drivers of differences in behaviours across speech communities: Their members may, even within the same framework of formal rules, follow distinct informal rules.3The contribution of our paper is, first, to develop a theoretical model that allows distinguishing more carefully the direct effect of language on behaviour from an indirect effect brought about by its coevolution with social norms. In that respect, it is closely related to a recent discussion of channels through which language could influence economic decision-making byMavisakalyan and Weber (2018). Our model goes beyond their framework by integrating language into standard economic analyses, thereby providing a tool that can easily be adapted to study the effects of language in other contexts. Second, we present results from an empirical application that are consistent with the insights from the model, suggesting that the interrelatedness of language and social norms may render attempts of empirically measuring a direct effect of speaking a gendered language unsuccessful, as they are currently approached.Our formal model of labour supply is based on an identityeconomics frameworkand allows individuals who care about matching the “ideal” level of participation for their gender, as given by a social norm, to distort their labour supply. In this set-up, language can affect the distortion in two ways. The direct effect ofspeakinga gendered language comes from drawing the speakers’ attention to a given norm: Frequent reference to gender makes speakers more perceptive of the norm, leading to stronger gender differences in labour supply among them relative to speakers of neutral languages. Thecoevolutioneffect arises because the norm itself differs systematically across speaking communities, prescribing larger differences in the “ideal” behaviour for men and women in those speaking a gendered language.4As a result, this second effect presents a challenge for researchers aiming at isolating the effect ofspeakinga gendered language.Next, we extend the model to assess a strategy that some researchers (e.g.,Santacreu-Vasut et al., 2013) have suggested to overcome this challenge: the so-called “epidemiological approach”. The method involves comparing migrants descending from different countries within the same country of residence and is widely used to study the effect of country-of-origin social norms on behaviour while ruling out institutional constraints (e.g., theeducation systemor availability of childcare) and the overall economic environment as drivers (Fernández, 2011). We explore the merit of this strategy for isolating the causal effect ofspeakinga language in our theoretical model and show that it might not succeed. The intuition behind this result is that women who emigrate from countries with high language gender marking are more likely than women from other countries to be positively selected in terms of their labour market orientation, and thus to reject the social norms toward femalelabour force participationin their country ofancestry. Empirically, the selection effect may mask any potential cognitive effects of language.Using the European Social Survey (ESS) and a linguistic dataset that is more comprehensive than the ones used in previous studies, we demonstrate these identification challenges empirically in an analysis of immigrants’ labour market behaviour in Europe. Conclusions regarding the extent to which language plays a role in shaping behaviour vary, depending on the linguistic indicator, sample composition (first- vs. second-generation immigrants), and language assignment (most commonly spoken at home vs. dominant language in country of origin). Generally, our results do not confirm the leading hypothesis in the literature that behaviour is more strongly in line with traditional gender norms for speakers of a gendered language. Instead, our results suggest at most a weaknegativecorrelation between gender-stereotypical behaviour and speaking a gendered language for some definitions of gender marking, and for women only. For men, we find a negligible effect regardless of the specification used. These results, however tentative, are consistent with the notion that language reflects social norms in a speaking community, and that those who select into migration (first generation) are more likely to reject these norms in their country of origin, and may transmit their traits to their children (second generation).We believe that isolating the direct effect of speaking a gendered language is nevertheless an important goal given recent political debates about the role of language for gender equality and efforts tochange languagein pursuit of this goal. Examples include the official introduction of the Swedish gender neutral pronoun “hen” in 2012 (Sendén et al., 2015) and the increasingly common practice of substituting the gender neutral plural “they” for singular third person pronouns (he, she) in the English language (Baranowski, 2002,Pauwels, 2003). According to the channel proposed by linguists that we explore in this paper, genderless and natural gender languages should call less attention to gender and sex, which could have positive effects on equality. To the contrary, feminist language critique frequently calls formoregender-differentiation in language, e.g. in job titles, to improve equality by raising women’s visibility. From a policy perspective, the question of what works better (or what is more feasible)—making language more gender neutral or more gender symmetrical—is ultimately an empirical one.5With the present paper, we hope to contribute to this worthwhile endeavour by focussing the discussion on the obstacles to measuring the cognition effects, which we show require more attention in order to move this research agenda forward.The paper is organized as follows: We present our formal model of the effect of language on labour supply inSection 2, combining insights from linguistics and psycho-linguistics with identity economics. InSection 3, we present our empirical application, including data description and empirical approach. The results inSection 4support the conclusions we derived from the theoretical framework. Finally,Section 5offers a summary and concluding remarks.",Miriam,Luise,Eva
"1. IntroductionRecent technological change has led to the automation of tasks that follow precise and well-understood procedures or routines. As workplace computerisation and robotisation have been replacing the humans who previously performed these routines, there has been a gradual change in the contents/tasks demanded in the workplace, especially in a range of low- and medium-skill occupations. The theoretical and empirical study of the reshaping of the structure oflabour demandhas been the focus of a growing body of literature pioneered byAutor, Levy and Murnane (ALM) (2003), and further developed byAcemoglu and Autor (2011),Autor and Handel (2013)(henceforth AH),Goos, Manning and Salomons (2014)and, more recently, by Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018a, 2018b). The new theoretical model used in these analyses is based on the task-based approach. Production requires the allocation of tasks to capital or labour, and new technologies require changes in the allocation of tasks to these factors of production. Tracking such changes in the task content of production has been found to be valuable for understanding how labour demand is changing as a result of automation. In particular,ALM (2003),Acemoglu and Autor (2011),Autor and Dorn (2013)andGoos et al. (2014)have found that computerisation is associated with an increase in non-routine cognitive tasks and a decrease in routine manual and routine cognitive tasks.There are, however, significant challenges associated with using the task framework, with measurement undoubtedly being among them. To approximate job tasks, the first empirical studies drew upon a detailed occupation dataset, The Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT), or its successor, the Occupation Information Network (O*NET). However,Spitz-Oener (2006)using data for Germany, and more recently, AH for the US, documented substantial heterogeneity in job contents even within detailed occupations. These findings encourage the use of workplace-level data rather than occupational-based data to measure job contents/tasks, especially if the aim is to provide a precise estimation of task prices. In this paper, we account for this need, and use individual information on job tasks to explore, first, cross-country differences in task endowments for a harmonised sample of developed countries. A second and more important aim of our study is to explore the link between tasks and wages by estimating task prices in a cross-country setting in order to devise country differentials in task prices, and to examine their potential drivers. We do so by using data from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), a survey that provides harmonised information across countries, and that contains very precise information on job contents at the worker level. Furthermore, the PIAAC survey data contain precise information on workers’ skills (based on the results of numeracy and literacy cognitive tests) that goes beyond the educational level attained. These data enable us to estimate the factors that underlie the intensity of task endowments, as well as their prices conditional on a more precise measure of workers’ skills. Moreover, these survey data provide excellent controls of individual skills that we can use in determining and interpreting task prices.A cross-country analysis of these developments is needed because previous evidence has shown that the process of de-routinisation has not followed identical paths across countries.Hardy et al. (2018)documented an increase rather than a decrease in routine cognitive employment in the transition economies of Eastern and Central Europe.Gimpelson and Kapeliushnikov (2016)andAedo et al. (2013)found similar results for Russia and Southern European countries, respectively. Hence, there is clear a need for an assessment of job tasks as well as task prices based on a comparable sample of developed countries at the worker level. Ours is not the first study to use the PIAAC dataset to explore task contents and their cross-country differences. Recent studies, such asMarcolin et al. (2018)andLewandowski et al. (2019), have used PIAAC data to construct a routine job index and the cross-country differentials. However, our study is the first to explore the link between tasks and wages, particularly to estimate task prices and their differentials across countries.Empirical evidence on task prices is scarce. In the US, AH found that a one-standard-deviation increase in abstract tasks predicts a seven-log-point wage premium; a one-standard-deviation increase in manual tasks results in a wage penalty of 11 log points; while an increase in routine tasks is not related to any significant difference in wages1. Other studies that have explored the link between tasks and wages with individual-level data for the US are Firpo, Fortin and Lemieux (2013), and, more recently,Bohm (2020). Additionally, Spitz-Oener (2003) estimated task returns for Germany. This paper's main contributions are to extend the single-country analysis of task prices to a broad group of developed countries, to show their differences, and to try to envisage potential drivers. As our task measures closely resemble those of AH, our aims are to estimate prices for abstract, routine and manual tasks for 19 developed countries; to compare our results (for the US) with those found by AH; and to explore the cross-country differentials. Furthermore, the PIAAC survey data contain precise information on workers’ skills (based on the results of numeracy and literacy cognitive tests) that goes beyond the educational level attained. These data enable us to estimate task prices conditional on workers’ skills, and, hence, to obtain a measure of the market demand for each of the constructed tasks2.Our findings represent a relevant contribution to the literature. First, our task measures, and the items these measures are based on, are well-validated vis-a-vis previous research using the PIAAC, as well as other worker-level studies, such as AH. Averaged at the occupational level, our task measures show very high correlations with respect to O*NET, specifically for abstract tasks. Based on these measures, we depict the differences in tasks across countries, provide suggestive evidence on the importance of the within-occupation variation in task measures across countries, and relate those task disparities across countries with variables that have been shown to reflect countries’ development levels (such as GDP per capita, ICT capital stock or numeracy skills). Second, we estimate wage returns to tasks (task prices), and find that within occupations, a one-standard-deviation increase in abstract tasks is related to a 3.3-log-point wage premium. For routine (manual) tasks, we find that the individual returns within occupations are a 2.6- (2.9)-log-point wage decrease for eachstandard deviationof routine tasks. Finally, we address the differences in task prices across countries by computing the relationship between country level variables and task prices. We find suggestive evidence that supply-and-demand factors can help to explain task returns: i.e., the higher the task endowment in a country is, the more attenuated the positive or the negative deviation in the price of this specific task is. Development factors, as well as labour market institutions – particularly union coverage and the strictness of employment protectionlegislation– seem to play a role in the differences in all three task prices.The rest of the paper is organised as follows.Section 2discusses the data sources and the construction of task/job contents.Section 3presents the descriptive results and decompositions of international differences in tasks.Section 4discusses the estimation of task returns, and focuses on their differentials and potential drivers.Section 5concludes.",Sara,Lucas,Piotr
"1. Introduction and related literatureThe aims of this paper are twofold: to estimate the extent to which job displacement increases participation insocial programmesfor the disabled, and the implications on health expenditure.The high share of working-age individuals receiving disability benefits is a major social and economic problem in many developed countries.Liebman (2015)documents a substantial increase in the share of disability insurance recipients within the working-age population in the United States, rising from 2.2% in the late 1970s to 4.6% in 2013.Banks et al. (2015)report for Great Britain that the number of disability recipients more than doubled from the 1970s to 2013. According toOECDstatistics, 5.6% of the working age population in OECD countries received disability benefits in 2007 (the middle of our examined period), with much higher than average rates in Hungary (12%), Sweden, Norway, Finland and the Netherlands (8−11%) (OECD, 2009, Figure 4.1). To make the problem more severe, very few recipients of disability benefits return to the labour market.Consequences ongovernment expendituresare substantial. According toEurostat (2019), spending on disability benefits amounted to 1.9% of GDP in the European Union (EU27) in 2007. In most OECD countries these expenditures are much larger than expenditures on any other income-replacement programme for working-age individuals (OECD, 2009). It is, thus, of great policy importance to understand and potentially reduce the employment-related channels of disability claims. Such reductions can not only increase the employment rate of the working-age population, but can also have beneficial effects on the public healthcare budget – a previously undocumented aspect, which is the focus of our analysis.We know from previous literature that job loss has a lasting negative effect on future labour market position (Böheim, Taylor, 2002,Eliason, Storrie, 2006) and a particularly scarring effect on consecutive earnings (Arulampalam, 2001,Gregory, Jukes, 2001,Jacobson, LaLonde, Sullivan, 1993,Ruhm, 1991; among many others). Also, disability insurance recipiency has a substantial workdisincentiveeffect on the beneficiaries (e.g.Chen, Klaauw, 2008,French, Song, 2014,Maestas, Mullen, Strand, 2013). However, less is known about the effect of job loss on the uptake ofsocial security benefits.If eligible, a displaced worker can claim unemployment benefits. However, once the benefit period expires, the individual either has to return to work or needs to secure other social security benefits so as to receive some income and maintain social insurance status. It has been shown that unemployment benefits and disability benefits are to some extent substitutes (Koning, Vuuren, 2007,Koning, Vuuren, 2010for the Netherlands;Bratsberg et al., 2013for Norway), althoughRiphahn (1997)(using data from Germany) rejects this hypothesis.The availability of disability benefits is likely to affect labour force status after a job loss. Indeed, asAutor and Duggan (2003)point out, the characteristics of the disability insurance system influence the propensity of labour force exit for workers who faced adverse shocks. The more generous the disability benefit is, the more likely it is for workers to exit the labour market. Similarly,Rege et al. (2009)andBratsberg et al. (2013)show for Norway that job loss significantly increases the risk of disability benefit uptake. Looking at the period of theGreat Recession, bothMaestas et al. (2015)andJiménez-Martín et al. (2018)find that the recession had an increasing effect on disability applications, but due to the increased rate of denials, there is no clear effect on the stock of disability benefit recipients.Scharle (2008)shows on county-level data from Hungary that local labour market conditions are correlated with disability insurance claims.In the first part of this paper, we contribute to this literature by estimating the causal effect of job loss on disability insurance enrolment and analysing the time-varying patterns of the transition rates based on individual-level administrative data from Hungary between 2003 and 2011. To overcome the endogeneity of job loss, we exploit mass lay-offs and match laid-off to non-laid-off workers withpropensity score matching. We then follow individuals in the matched sample and obtain that job loss implies a 1.5-fold (or by 1.4% points) higher transition to disability insurance in four years. Half of the excess transitions occur within the first year, and the transition probability returns to the value in the control group after about three years.The increased uptake of disability benefits after a job loss may be a moral hazard issue. As evidence for this,Gruber and Kubik (1997),Duggan and Gruber (2014)show that disability insurance plan characteristics and denial rates have stronger effects on the labour supply of the healthier, more able individuals;Campolieti (2002)shows that the generosity of the disability benefit system affects the prevalence of hard-to-diagnose conditions among the recipients. On the other hand, the increased transition to disability may also stem from genuine health shocks associated with unemployment. Indeed, we find that the four-year mortality rate increases 1.7-fold (or by 0.4% point) as a result of the lay-off, suggesting the presence of genuine health shocks.Disentangling the moral hazard and the health shock channels is not straightforward, even if data on healthcare use or health expenditure is available, because non-employment may affect the demand for health services through various pathways. First, unemployment and inactivity may have direct health effects, although the literature on it is mixed (see e.g.Browning et al., 2006andSchmitz, 2011for non-significant results;Schaller and Stevens, 2015for negative average effects andSchiele and Schmitz, 2016for negative effects on those in initial bad health). Second, even if health status is constant, non-employment may reduce healthcare use because of the decreased incentives for health maintenance and possibly because of a change in insurance status.Kuhn et al. (2009)andSchaller and Stevens (2015)find little evidence for an overall effect of job loss on healthcare use, although the latter paper shows that doctoral visits and prescription drug usage decrease if the lost job was the primary source of insurance.Specifically, the application for and maintenance of disability benefit may have profound, time-varying impact on healthcare use. At the time of the application, healthcare use may increase because of the expanded incentives for being diagnosed with various chronic conditions, and also because of the need to check health status during the review process. Afterwards, receiving disability benefit may reduce incentives for health maintenance, thus lowering healthcare use.In the second part of our paper, we examine these channels, i.e. we analyse the relationship between health expenditure – an indicator of healthcare use – and the uptake of disability benefit. Our focus is on the health spending of individuals who claim disability benefit after a job loss. Such an investigation is novel in the literature. One would expect that becoming a disability beneficiary is associated with increased health spending both due to poor health (i.e. disability) and to the application process, although little is known about the magnitudes of health spending around disability uptake.According to our results, claiming disability benefit after being laid off is associated with a fivefold surge in inpatient and a 2.5-fold surge in outpatient and pharmaceutical expenditure. Although the expenditure declines after the uptake of the benefit, it does not reach its pre-disability level. More detailed data on medication categories show that, beyond physical health shocks, the diagnosis of chronic physical conditions, such as hypertension or diabetes, and the deterioration of mental health all contribute to the observed surge in health expenditure. Thus, the increase in disability insurance enrolment after a job loss is neither purely a moral hazard issue nor exclusively a consequence of genuine health shocks. These results extend and partly contradict the findings ofRege et al. (2009), who identify the mental health effect of job loss as the key driver of the increase in disability benefit uptake.",Anikó,Péter,None
"1. IntroductionThe main purpose of unemployment insurance (UI) is to provideincome supportduring unemployment in case of job loss. The design of UI, however, entails a trade-off between insurance and incentives. This may lead to a moral hazard problem, which induces the insured unemployed to search less intensively. The empirical literature has extensively analysed the effect of unemployment benefits (UBs) on unemployment spell duration.1The results generally show that the generosity of UB prolongs unemployment duration, suggesting that the insured unemployed may behave opportunistically while searching for jobs.Beyond its well-known effects during unemployment, UI may induce a moral hazard behaviour in both employers and employees, which can alter job separation rates. On the demand side, firms may have an incentive to exploit the UI system to adjust their workforce in case of negative demand shocks (Feldstein, 1976). On the supply side, workers may have a preference for leisure combined with UB compensation. In this case, they have an incentive to work just long enough to attain UB eligibility and then exit employment. In this paper, we aim to estimate the causal effect of UB eligibility on layoff probability and to provide some insight on the role of the employer and employee’s moral hazard. Our contribution to the literature is twofold.First, we bring new evidence by exploiting quasi-experimental variation in UB eligibility conditions in Italy. In contrast to the empirical literature on unemployment duration, the effects of UI on layoffs have indeed received little attention.2The analysis relies on an inflow sample of more than 400,000 new jobs drawn from administrative registries covering the period of 2005 to 2012, which we follow until job separation. We identify the impact of attaining UB eligibility by exploiting two eligibility conditions in the Italian UI system: i) at least 52 working weeks in the last two calendar years and ii) at least one day of workbeforethis two-year horizon. Identifying the effect of UI eligibility is challenging since it is confounded by the effect of work experience accumulated along the job spell. To control for this confounder, we add a control group of workers who cannot attain UB eligibility despite accumulating the same level of work experience over the last two years. This allows us to carry out a duration analysis in a difference-in-differences (DiD) estimator framework.Second, we provide evidence that the impact of UB eligibility on layoffs in Italy is not homogeneous across regions, despite these being characterised by the same labour market institutions. We focus on the geographical dimension that is related to the puzzling and long-lasting North–South divide in Italy. Our conjecture is that a higher unemployment rate in the South of Italy may drive a different response of the layoff rate to UB eligibility. Furthermore, different social norms (Banfield, 1958,Bigoni, Bortolotti, Casari, Gambetta, 2018,Bigoni, Bortolotti, Casari, Gambetta, Pancotto, 2016,Guiso, Sapienza, Zingales, 2004) may induce employees and employers to react in a different way to the same type of moral hazard.Our results confirm the existence of moral hazard. According to our preferred specification, we find that immediately after reaching UI eligibility, the probability of layoff increases by 12% for at least 16 weeks. The impact is significantly larger after theGreat Recession, when the instantaneous increase is of 21%, while no effect is found before 2008. In the South, the effect peaks at 24%, whereas in the rest of Italy, the overall effect is not significantly different from zero. The layoff rates in smaller firms also show a more pronounced reaction. We find no evidence of a substitution between quits and layoffs. Similar conclusions are reached if we rely on aregression discontinuity design(RDD) estimator identifying the effect around the 52 weeks eligibility threshold.The paper is structured as follows. InSection 2, we present the theoretical setting and review the existing empirical literature.Section 3presents the Italian institutional framework for the period under analysis.Section 4describes the data and the sample.Section 5shows some descriptive evidence and results based on an RDD.Section 6presents our preferred model, a DiD design in a duration model, and interprets the results.Section 7reports a large set of robustness checks of both the RDD estimates and the findings from the DiD duration model.Section 8concludes.

"1. IntroductionIndigenous Peoples in North America have faced perpetual injustices throughout history. A summary includes, but is not limited to, the colonization, annexation, and military occupation of Hawaii (Sai, 2008;Silva, 2004), genocide (Thornton, 1987), massacres (e.g., Wounded Knee,Brown 2007), forced relocation (e.g., the “Trail of Tears”) and isolation in Indian reservations (Foreman, 1972), disenfranchisement (Wolfley, 1991), the slaughter of the bison (Feir et al., 2019), and the forcible assimilation of Indigenous children through Indian boarding schools (Adams, 1995;Feir, 2016,Feir, 2016). SeeNabokov (1999)for a historical summary.These injustices extend to contemporary racial disparities, which are some of the largest. Among racial and ethnic minorities, American Indians and Alaska Natives (AIANs) have the lowest employment-to-population ratio (54.6%, with 59.9% for whites), the highest unemployment rate (9.9%, with 4.6% for whites) (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2016), and they earn significantly less income (median income of $35,060 in 2010, compared to $50,046 for the nation as a whole) (U.S. Census Bureau, 2015). These disparities are less stark for Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders (NHPIs) as they have the highest employment-to-population ratio (62.8%); though, this reflects a stronger economy in Hawaii. Even absent this, unemployment rates are still higher for NHPIs relative to whites (5.7%, versus 4.6%) (U.S. Bureau of Labour Statistics 2016).Povertyrates among those who identify as AIAN alone (NHPI) are nearly double (1.5 times) the rates of those in the general population (U.S. Census Bureau, 2015;WHIAAPI, 2010). For NHPIs, these disparities are even more substantial for the 22% of AIANs who reside or used to reside on one of the 326 federal or state Indian reservations (Gitter and Reagan, 2002;Taylor and Kalt, 2005;U.S. Census Bureau, 2015) or in Alaska Native Statistical Areas (U.S. Census Bureau, 2015).1These disparities are only becoming more relevant as Indigenous populations grow.2Several factors could contribute to these disparities, such as differences in education, geography (especially in or near Indian reservations), and the intergenerational legacy ofcolonialism, such as the harmful effects of Indian Residential schools (Adams, 1995;Feir, 2016,Feir, 2016) and the slaughter of the bison by colonial settlers (Feir et al., 2019).Another possible explanation isemployment discriminationwhich anecdotal and survey evidence3suggest may be occurring, Indigenous Peoples also face negative stereotypes, some of which could contribute to discrimination.4Economists typically distinguish between three sources of employment discrimination: taste-based discrimination (Becker, 1957),5levels-based statistical discrimination (Arrow, 1973;Phelps, 1972),6and variance-based statistical discrimination (Aigner and Cain, 1977)7(seeLahey and Oxley (2018)for an excellent discussion). Psychology adds the concept of implicit bias, where discrimination occurs due to unconscious bias (Greenwald and Mahzarin, 1995).8Sociologistsconceptualize discrimination as being caused by numerous factors that are intrapsychic, organizational, or structural (Pager and Shepherd, 2008;Small and Pager, 2020). Employment discrimination against Indigenous Peoples could occur from any of these sources.We are only aware of one peer-reviewed quantitative study that studied employment discrimination against Indigenous Peoples in the United States.9Hurst (1997)decomposed the AIAN-white earnings gap using the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition method.Hurst (1997)found that, while observable factors such as education and geography explain a large part (87%) of the gap, there is “still a substantial unexplained differential in earnings between the various categories of Indians and non-Indians.” (p. 805).Quantifying employment discrimination against Indigenous Peoples is essential to inform policies to reduce these significant economic disparities. If there is little discrimination, then disparities are primarily caused by factors other than employment discrimination like differences in education, which policymakers may be able to target directly. However, if there is significant discrimination, then this may suggest that supply-side policy measures like education or skills training10may be less effective at closing this gap. In this case, stronger discrimination laws, or stronger enforcement of them, could be more helpful, as could efforts that seek to reduce discriminatory attitudes or behaviours or our abilities to act upon them.To quantify discrimination, we conducted a field experiment of hiring discrimination—a resume correspondence study—sending applications to job openings. Resume correspondence studies are the preferred method of estimating employment discrimination because they can hold all factors other than minority status constant (Bertrand and Duflo, 2017;Gaddis, 2018;Neumark, 2018) which is not the case for decomposition studies that use survey data (e.g.,Hurst, 1997).In our field experiment, job applications are identical on average but are either signalled to be white or Indigenous (Native American, Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian). Our general approach follows previous studies of this nature (e.g.,Baert et al., 2013;Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2004;Carlsson and Rooth, 2007;Neumark et al., 2019a;Pager, 2003) by estimating hiring discrimination by comparing interview offer rates (“callbacks”) by race.Since signalling Indigenous status is not straightforward, we use four different methods. Our most common signal is volunteer experience, where we mention Indigenous status in the description of a volunteer experience, mirroringTilcsik (2011),Ameri et al., 2019, andNamingit et al., 2017. Our second most common signal is language, through listing an Indigenous language along with English as mother tongues in a language section on the resume. We also occasionally signal Native Hawaiian status using Native Hawaiian first names or Native American status by using last names of Navajoancestry.We also quantify whether there is an additional bias against Native Americans from Indian reservations. Employers may have negative perceptions of these reservations, as poverty rates there are higher (Collett et al., 2016), incomes are lower (Akee and Taylor, 2014),economic conditionsare worse (Akee and Taylor, 2014;Gitter and Reagan, 2002;Taylor and Kalt, 2005), and educational quality can be lower (DeVoe et al., 2008). If Native Americans from Indian reservations who move to urban centres experience discrimination because of their upbringing, then this makes it more difficult for them to move to these urban centres. Thus, migration is a less useful way for them to seek economic opportunities and possibly escape poverty. Estimating this potential bias against Native Americans who move from Indian reservations to urban centres is increasingly vital given increasing migration over time from Indian reservations to urban centres (e.g.,Snipp, 1996;Pickering, 2000).Our large-scale field experiment, based on 13,516 job applications in 11 cities and five occupations, shows no evidence of discrimination in callbacks against Indigenous Peoples in any of these cities and occupations. We similarly find no additional bias against Native Americans who lived on an Indian reservation. Our results do not vary by which combination of four signals for Indigenous status we use. Our results hold under a battery of robustness checks which include alternative functional forms and clustering, weighting, alternative callback measures, and correcting for the variance of unobservables (Neumark, 2012).Our finding of no difference in callbacks is less common compared to the literature (Baert, 2018;Neumark, 2018). Of all resume correspondence studies from 2005 to 2018, 80 (78.4%) show significantly negative discrimination, 17 (16.7%) show no statistical evidence of discrimination, and five (4.6%) show significant preference for the minority group (Baert, 2018). However, publication bias may be a problem, as discrimination experiments with null results are less likely to be published (Zigerell, 2018).We also conduct a complementaryGelbach (2016)and Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions of disparities in wages, unemployment rates, unemployment durations, and employment durations. We decompose the extent to which differences in observable characteristics explain these economic disparities, and what portion of the disparities remains unexplained, which could suggest discrimination. This provides an alternative measure of discrimination that, while possibly biased, is broader than our experiment by, for example, covering more cities and occupations, and covering contexts outside of hiring discrimination.In our preferred decomposition, we find that AIANs have a large, unexplained gap in unemployment rates of 4.3 percentage points and we also find weak evidence of slightly longer unemployment durations. We do not find unexplained gaps in wages, controlling for occupation, or in employment durations. For NHPIs, we find an unexplained gap of 4.1%lower wages, a 0.7 percentage point higher unemployment rate, and weak evidence of slightlyshorterunemployment durations.Despite not finding discrimination in callbacks against Indigenous Peoples in our audit field experiment, this does not imply that Indigenous Peoples in the United States do not face employment discrimination at all. We discuss how certain choices for our experiment could have affected our estimates, such as the saliency of our racial signals, our choice of cities and occupations, and the relatively higher labour market tightness during our study. Our decomposition of economic disparities, despite the problems with this approach, also suggests that there could be hiring discrimination outside the context of our audit study. This is evidenced by Indigenous Peoples facing higher unexplained unemployment rates and holding lower-wage occupations.In addition to this study being the first audit study of discrimination against Indigenous Peoples in North America, our study also provides many methodological contributions to the audit studies literature more broadly. We conduct numerous robustness checks and discuss other considerations that are crucial to the interpretation of audit studies. These include, but are not limited to pre-registering our experiment, using more than one method of signalling minority status, testing how salient signals of minority status and other resume features are, controlling for the variance of unobservables (Neumark, 2012), using population and occupation weighting to generate study-population-representative results, testing and discussing how our results vary by occupation and city, and exploring how our results vary by labour market tightness and economic cycles. These are essential checks and discussions for audit studies more broadly, regardless of whether they find discrimination. We also extend the decomposition literature by studying disparities in economic outcomes that are not usually studied (unemployment rates, unemployment durations, and employment durations) and we are among the first to apply the newer Gelbach decomposition.",Patrick,Brigham,None
"1. IntroductionIn many European welfare states, immigrants from low-income source countries are overrepresented in social insurance (SI) programs and underrepresented in employment; see, e.g.,Bratsberg et al. (2010;2017),Sarvimäki (2011),Hansen and Lofstrom (2011),Riphahn and Wunder (2013),OECD (2013, Table 3.6), andSchultz-Nielsen (2017). Generous social insurance weakens the economic incentives to search for jobs and take up work. This paper examines whether immigrant-native participation gaps can be attributed todisincentiveeffects embedded in SI programs.1We study the impacts of SI generosity among participants in one of the largest social insurance programs in Norway, the temporary disability insurance (TDI) program. A major reform of the benefit computation formula in 2002 generated considerable variation in benefits across observationally similar participants entering just before or just after the reform, enabling us to identify the causal effects of the TDI benefit level ontransitions to employmentand future earnings.Why would we expect social insurance generosity to affect immigrants from low-income countries differently from natives? In our analyses, we explore three potential mechanisms. First, immigrants tend to enjoy less consumption gain from employment, due to a combination of relatively low labor earnings prospects and a progressive social insurance benefit schedule. If social insurance claims rise with the replacement ratio due to moral hazard, as indicated by the literature (see, e.g.,Krueger and Meyer, 2002;Johansson and Palme, 2002;Røed and Zhang, 2003;Henrekson and Persson, 2004), this would yield higher social insurance take-up (and lower employment) rates among immigrants. Second, non-pecuniary costs of working may be higher for immigrants if they face less attractive employment opportunities and have a higher valuation of non-employment. More valuable time outside paid work relates to family structure and larger households in particular, and also to attachment to a foreign country with lower living expenses. Together with the higher social insurance replacement ratios, this implies that the utility difference between employment and non-employment may be systematically smaller for immigrants than for natives. Based on a simple theoretical framework – where individuals are allowed to choose freely between employment and social-insurance-supported non-employment in a frictionless labor market – we point out that a marginal change in benefits will affect the realized state only for individuals who initially were on the fence between the alternatives of employment and social insurance. Consequently, we expect the behavioral responses to marginal benefit variations to be heterogeneous, with particularly large effects for individuals who are close to indifference between employment and non-employment.The third potential mechanism relates to the availability of realistic job opportunities. Social insurance generosity can influence individual employment and earnings patterns only insofar as such opportunities exist. For the TDI claimants studied in this paper, this is not necessarily the case. Health impairments may effectively limit the range of feasible employment opportunities, particularly in thin local labor markets. This restriction from the demand side may be more or less binding for immigrants than for natives. The fact that immigrants from low-income countries tend to have lower education, less host-country work experience, and limited majority language skills, points to larger employment barriers for immigrants. However, the fact that they are heavily overrepresented in the central parts of Norway with considerably thicker and more diverse labor markets, points in the other direction.A supplementary mechanism relates to the value of joint leisure within households and the impact that benefit generosity may have on the labor supply of the spouse of the claimant. If higher benefits raise the total income of the claimant him/herself – also taking into account any negative labor supply responses – we expect the effect on the spouse's labor supply to be negative, both through a direct income effect and through a substitution effect caused by leisure complementarities.To our knowledge, no prior study has explicitly examined the differences between immigrants and natives in their labor supply responses to benefit generosity. Our choice of the temporary disability insurance program as the foundation for the empirical analysis is motivated by importance as well as possibility. TDI is by far the largest among the Norwegian programs compensating for temporary income loss, with a caseload more than twice as large as the unemployment insurance program. And even though participants in this program have health impairments that undermine their current work capacity, they are still considered to have a possibility of returning to some form of regular work in the (near) future. The second reason for focusing on the TDI program relates to a major reform in 2002, that generated quasi-experimental variation in benefit generosity across participants, such that entrants with exactly the same individual characteristics could obtain quite different benefit levels due to small differences in the timing of the health impairment. Because we can calculate the exact pre and post-reform benefits for each individual, even for the counterfactual state, we can use a difference-in-differences type strategy where both the actual and the hypothetical benefit levels are allowed to correlate with outcomes at all times, but where the causal effect is identified as the “extra” statistical association stemming from the periods where each benefit-schedule actually applies.2This way, we exploit the quasi-experimental features of the reform to examine the effects of the benefit level on various outcomes of program participants, including the transition rate to employment and subsequent earnings for up to 10 years after program entry.We build on the recent study of the Norwegian TDI program byFevang et al. (2017), which reports average impacts of TDI benefits on the duration and outcome of TDI spells. Our study allows for differential responses by immigrant status and extends the analysis to effects of TDI benefits on earnings of program participants as well as their spouses over a ten-year period following program entry. We also examine how individual characteristics that convey information about potential earnings capacity (such as the highest earnings obtained in prior years), the value of leisure (as captured by family structure), and presumed job finding prospects (as captured by actual work experience and geographical location), interact with benefit generosity.We confirm that the TDI benefit level on average has a negative influence on the transition rate to regular employment for both natives and immigrants. In addition, we identify considerable negative effects on subsequent labor earnings. Equally important in our context, our results show that the behavioral responses are much larger for immigrants from low-income countries than they are for natives. For example, while a 10% increase in the benefit level is predicted to reduce the hazard rate from TDI to regular employment by 3.1% for native men and by 1.0% for native women, it reduces the hazard rate for immigrant men and women by 6.8% and 5.0%, respectively. Further, while a one Euro increase in the (annualized) benefit level reduces the average annual labor earnings over the next five years by 11 cents for native men and 6 cents for native women, it reduces earnings of immigrant men and women by 33 cents and 23 cents, respectively.The average responsiveness of a group is greater the larger is the fraction of its members that is close to indifference between employment and non-employment. We show that heterogeneous effects according to earnings potential and family structure explain a considerable part of the observed response differential between immigrants and natives. Allowing for heterogeneous effects also along the dimensions of past work experience (as a proxy for employability) and geographical location, further reduces the immigrant-native response differential to statistical as well as substantive insignificance. The larger benefit sensitivity observed for immigrants than for natives appears to be driven by differences in social and economic circumstances, and should not be taken as conclusive evidence for behavioral differences, given such circumstances.Since social insurance benefits change the budget constraint as well as preferences for market and non-market activities, more generous TDI benefits may also affect the labor supply of the claimant´s partner. Except for native female claimants, our findings show that the earnings of the spouse drop in response to higher TDI benefits. As for the direct impacts on TDI claimants, the negative earnings effect appears to be larger for immigrants than natives. The spousal responses imply that the negative effects on earnings are amplified when we consider outcomes like family earnings.The negative earnings effect of higher TDI benefits appears to endure for many years, again with native women as an exception. For immigrants, the evidence points toward a permanent effect with statistically significant negative impacts estimated as long as 10 years after program entry. Even if social insurance benefit receipt mitigates the long run effects on after-tax income, the reduction in labor supply dominates and the net effect of increased TDI benefits on after-tax income is negative for families.The paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we start out with an overview of relevant literatures.Section 3presents a descriptive overview of the income distributions of immigrants and natives in self-supporting employment and social-insurance-supported non-employment, respectively.Section 4then presents our theoretical considerations, whileSection 5describes the temporary disability insurance program that forms the basis for our empirical analysis.Section 6presents our data and our identification strategy.Section 7examines the impacts of the benefit level on transition rates out of TDI and annual labor earnings over a 10-year period after program entry.Section 8examines the sources behind differential behavioral responses in terms of earnings prospects, family situation, and employment opportunities, and evaluates the role that these factors have in accounting for immigrant-native response differences.Section 9examines the impacts on the earnings of the claimant's spouse and on after-tax household income. Conclusions are given insection 10.We emphasize that when we use the term “immigrant” in the remainder of this paper, we refer to immigrants from low-income source countries.3Immigrants from other (high-income) countries are dropped from our empirical analysis. The reasons for this are, first, that immigrants from high-income countries have a much higher probability of leaving the country, implying that it is difficult to follow them over time in our data, and second, that their tendency to enter and leave the country is highly dependent on their employment status. Moreover, our data indicate that the labor market behavior of immigrants from high-income countries is very similar to that of natives (Bratsberg et al, 2017).",Bernt,Oddbjørn,Knut
"1. IntroductionA long and ongoing literature is concerned with the evaluation of active labour market programmes (ALMP) in a selection-on-observables setting. Propensity score (PS) based matching-type estimators are the establishedeconometricworkhorse in this literature (e.g.,Imbens, 2004,2015;Smith and Todd, 2005;Wunsch and Lechner, 2008;Lechner and Wunsch, 2009,2013;Biewen, Fitzenberger, Osikominu, and Paul, 2014;Doerr, Fitzenberger, Kruppe, Paul, and Strittmatter, 2017;Caliendo, Mahlstedt, and Mitnik, 2017;Calónico and Smith, 2017; themeta studyofCard, Kluve, and Weber, 2018, and references therein). A common issue in PS-based methods is the concrete specification of the PS. The past and current literature usually estimated the PS using a parametric model, i.e. Probit or Logit. Covariates and functional forms were commonly chosen in a fairly ad-hoc manner based on monitoring the balancing properties of the resulting estimated PS (compareRosenbaum and Rubin, 1984;Dehejia and Wahba, 2002).The emerging literature in statistical learning, might help to make this specification less ad-hoc.1In this paper, we investigate if machine learning methods can improve averagetreatment effecton the treated (ATET) estimation when used to predict the PS. Estimating the PS used in matching-type estimators with machine learning could help in three ways: 1) detecting variables of the selection process that might otherwise be omitted by the researchers, but are available in the data; 2) allowing for the appropriate degree of functional flexibility in the PS; 3) increasing the precision of the estimate by avoiding overfitting of the PS. These issues become more relevant with the increased availability of rich-covariate “big data” datasets, the handling of which requires suitable methods.Although off-the-shelf machine learning methods have many well-documented advantages in prediction and classification, it is not obvious that using them for propensity score estimation in a matching framework will improve the estimation of causal effects. One potential reason is that they aim at a different target (compareAthey and Imbens, 2019). The goal of using a PS in matching estimation is to balance the covariate distribution of treated and non-treated units to obtain a quasi-experimental situation. Machine learning algorithms, if used for PS estimation, follow the goal to predict treatment participation given the covariates, as good as possible, by trading off bias and variance in out-of-sample comparisons. One example for why this may be a bad idea are covariates that are very good predictors of outcome but only weakly correlated with treatment assignment (compare e.g.Belloni, Chernozhukov, and Hansen, 2014). Since machine learning algorithms try to maximize predictive power (in a mean square error sense), they may omit such variables as they do not help much to predict the treatment, accepting a somewhat larger bias in the propensity score that is dominated by the resulting variance reduction. However, since these now-omitted variables are important predictors of the outcome, the small bias in the propensity score may translate to a large one in the ATET estimation.While there are already some implementations of the idea of estimating the PS used in matching-type estimators with machine learning procedures (e.g.Krumer and Lechner, 2018;Goller and Krumer, 2019) there is little evidence on whether such an estimator actually has favourable finite sample properties. In early papers,Setoguchi, Schneeweiss, Brookhart, Glynn, and Cook (2008)andLee, Lessler, and Stuart (2010)investigated the performance of machine learning methods for estimating the PS. Those papers based their simulations on a data generating process (DGP) which might be well suited for their targeted applications in the medical context. They found machine learning predictions to outperform the parametric baseline methods. Pirrachio, Petersen, and van der Laan (2015), and Cannas and Arpino (2019) used the same specifications as the two above-mentioned papers and found the Super Learner (van der Laan, Polley, and Hubbard, 2007) and the Random Forest, respectively, to perform best, while the other machine learning techniques did not work sufficiently well in terms of bias inPS matching. As these four studies used the same data generating process based on only ten covariates and a treatment share of 50 percent, they might be less informative formicroeconometricapplications in which the dimension of confounders is usually much higher and the treatment shares very likely to deviate from 50 percent.In another recent work,Brown, Merrigan, and Royer (2018). evaluated machine learning PS estimation techniques in a simulation study. In particular, they found thatLeastAbsoluteShrinkage andSelectionOperator (LASSO), Boosting and Deep Learning outperformed the Random Forest and the baseline approach in terms of bias in their simulations. While they based the simulations on a high-dimensional empirical dataset with a low share of treated, this is only partially related to our question as they focus on using the PS as covariate in a CoxProportional Hazard Model.Hill, Weiss, and Zhai (2011)investigated a high-dimensional empirical problem and discussed strategies and challenges to understand which PS method to use. They illustrated the various potential strategies and the resulting wide range of different estimates, highly depending on the choice of the empirical researcher. As they did not observe the true effect, they were not able to point out which strategies worked best in their setup.In conclusion, there is only limited practical advice from the existing literature on how to improve PS estimation with the goal of ‘better’ treatment effect estimation. Thus, our work contributes to the literature in evaluating the performance of classical and machine learning based PS estimators for matching-type estimators in a realistic labour market setting.To be as close as possible to a real situation empirical researchers might face, we use a rich administrative dataset of German long-termunemployed personsin an EmpiricalMonte Carlo Simulation(EMCS), as suggested byHuber, Lechner, and Wunsch (2013)and Lechner and Wunsch (2013). Furthermore, we compare the different estimators in a real programme evaluation application.Our database consists of a large sample of German unemployed means-tested benefit recipients at the end of 2009, most of them long-term unemployed, including all individuals participating in a specific training programme in the first quarter of 2010. There is a broad range of characteristics recorded for each individual, which includes all the quantifiable information relevant for the case-workers’ decision to send the respective individual to a training programme or not.We evaluate the effect of a training programme and simulate the performance of different PS estimators, using the radius matching on the propensity score with bias adjustment (RMBA) algorithm developed in Lechner, Miquel, and Wunsch (2011), which performed best in the simulation ofHuber, Lechner, and Wunsch (2013). To be more precise, we use two different machine learning techniques, namely Random Forest and LASSO to estimate the PS. We choose these two as they use very different approaches in a non-parametric sense: Random Forest approximate the PS locally, similar to non-parametric regression, while LASSO with many polynomials and interaction term will approximate the PS with a flexible global function, e.g. similar to series estimation.2In that sense, they represent two very different types of approaches. A large literature discusses both methods, establishing theoretical properties (e.g.Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman, 2009), as well as modifying them for usage in other types of causal inference problems (e.g.Belloni, Chernozhukov, and Hansen, 2014;Wager and Athey, 2018;Lechner, 2018;Athey, Tibshirani, and Wager, 2019). We compare these two estimators to the true, a random, and a PS based on a parametric ad-hoc (Probit) model, which we then use for estimating the ATET in the RMBA estimator.Our findings are mixed. LASSO performs well as PS estimator for the usage in radius matching especially in situations in which using Probit and Random Forest do not deliver credible estimates. When there are many covariates compared to observations, Probit does not work well; once the number of observations increases sufficiently, Probit and LASSO perform equally well. Random Forest tends to predict the treatment in sample well, but does not work properly as balancing score estimator. If the share of treated units is low, the Random Forest cannot manage to split deep enough to estimate a PS flexible enough to remove the selection bias. In fact, we find that PS estimated with Random Forest may lead to comparing control units and treated units, which are not sufficiently similar. Thus, whether using specific off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms does help depends on the context of the application. Since knowing which of the methods works a priori appears to be difficult, a plausible alternative is to use Causal Machine Learning methods instead, e.g. ‘double machine learning’ suggested by Chernozhukov et al. (2018) or the Modified Causal Forest suggested byLechner (2018), that are optimized specifically for treatment effect estimation (for an overview see e.g.Knaus, Lechner, Strittmatter, 2018).The empirical application that we conducted reflects the sensitivity to method choice. While all methods lead to a positive effect of the training programme, the effects based on PS estimated by Random Forests are about 30 percent larger compared to the estimates using LASSO or Probit as PS estimator.The structure of the rest of the paper is as follows: InSections 2and3, we describe the institutional background and the database used for the simulation and application in detail.Section 4introduces the EMCS, as well as the estimators used.Sections 5and6present the results of the simulations and the empirical application.Section 7concludes.

"1. IntroductionEstimating the causal effect of early childbearing on women's labor market outcomes is a long-standing challenge for researchers. Early childbearing is often perceived as both a social and an economic problem, creating challenges for both society and the mother in question. There is a widespread belief that early childbearing is negatively correlated with women's educational attainment, employment prospects, and lifetime earnings. In this study, early childbearing is defined as giving birth to a child before turning 25.1However, the results are robust to younger threshold ages, including 21 or younger, at first childbirth. I investigate whether the long-term socioeconomic problems experienced by early childbearing women reflect already-existing disadvantages or are a consequence of the timing of childbearing. I find short-lived negative effects of early childbearing, but in contrast to common belief, I find no evidence that early childbearing has long-term negative effects onwomen's earnings.To perform my analysis, I examine the full population of Danish mothers over the period 1980 to 2014. It is commonly expected that the opportunity costs of early motherhood in the Scandinavian welfare state model are low relative to countries providing less social welfare. Nonetheless, studies in a Scandinavian context have found non-trivial earnings penalties for early childbearing women (e.g.,Holmlund, 2005;Mølland, 2016; and Johansen et al., 2019).Leung et al. (2016)study the full Danish population and find that women having their first child before turning 25 suffer from significant lifetime labor income loss. It is therefore an ongoing puzzle whether the negative effects of early childbearing are caused by the timing of childbearing or by selection, even in the Scandinavian countries.The advantages of the Danish data are threefold. First, the data are register-based, which makes it possible to observe the entire population of Danish mothers to obtain a very large panel. Second, the data include a large number ofdemographic, educational, income, labor market, and health variables, which makes it possible to control for a large set of important confounding factors. The detailed health registers provide an especially strong advantage to the identification strategy outlined below by distinguishing terminated pregnancies as miscarriages or induced abortions. Third, the administration of the registers’ historical information is highly reliable.These features make it possible to analyze the impact of early childbearing in a novel way by combining two strong identification strategies, each designed to identify causal effects of early childbearing on adult labor market outcomes in different ways. Some previous studies use a within-family estimator to account for family heterogeneity (Geronimus & Korenman, 1992;Hoffman et al., 1993;Ribar, 1999;Holmlund, 2005; Diaz & Fiel, 2017; andJohansen et al., 2018). Others treat miscarriages as an exogenous variation in women's childbirth timing (Hotz et al., 1997;Ashcraft et al., 2013;Fletcher & Wolfe, 2009;Ermisch, 2003;Goodman et al., 2004; andMiller, 2011). This paper constructs three samples to compare and implement both strategies and evaluate whether a combination of the two serves as a better estimation method.The first sample consists of early and non-early childbearing sisters. The second sample consists of early childbearing women and non-early childbearing women who were also pregnant early but whose first childbirth was delayed due to a miscarriage. These samples are constructed to replicate earlier studies and to examine whether the same results can be obtained with data for Danish women. The results for both suggest that early childbearing has a significant negative effect on earnings and educational attainment.The third sample is a combination of the first two. It consists of early childbearing women and their non-early childbearing sisters who were also pregnant early but their first childbirth was delayed due to miscarriage. The negative effects of early childbearing on earnings disappear in the long run, and the effect on education diminishes substantially when a sister fixed-effect estimator is applied using sisters who miscarried at an early age.These results show the advantages of this novel combination of identification strategies, which eliminates the potential biases each strategy faces when applied on its own. Even though sisters share backgrounds, adolescence, and genes, there may remain some unobserved heterogeneity between early childbearing women and their non-early childbearing sisters, as birth timing is highly endogenous to individual features. On the other hand, even though miscarriages are highly random and delay childbirth, they are not entirely unbiased to biological and social features. I incorporate a detailed health variable to address the biological bias. Aschraft et al. (2013) show thatsocially disadvantagedwomen have a higher risk of miscarrying even after health is controlled for, which suggests that studies using miscarriages for exogenous variation without further controls for family heterogeneities may also be biased.A combination of the two identification strategies addresses these biases. The use of a sister fixed-effect estimator adds to the validity of treating miscarriages as an exogenous variation by addressing the heterogeneity in social economic and family backgrounds between miscarrying and non-miscarrying women. Together with controlling for the possible negative correlations between health and miscarriages, this arguably produces a better causal estimate of the effect of early childbearing on adult labor market outcomes.The main result of this study is that early childbearing has no persistent effect on women's earnings, which suggests that the observed inferior earnings of early childbearing women are due not to early childbearing but to pre-existing disadvantages in ability and social factors. This paper thus makes two contributions. The first is methodological, as it shows that the existing commonly applied estimators may be prone to bias and that a combination of these estimators serves as a better estimation method. The second is the result that early childbearing does not need to have long-term effects for women in Denmark, a country with strong public welfare institutions.The paper proceeds as follows.Section 2gives a short literature review.Section 3summarizes the institutional settings.Section 4outlines the data used in the study.Section 5explains theeconometricstrategy.Section 6presents the results and robustness checks.

"I. IntroductionEducation is widely accepted as a leading instrument for promoting better economic outcomes at an individual level (UNESCO, 2005). Following the innovative analyses byMincer (1958,1974), the literature examines the economic returns to differing levels of schooling at an individual level.1Education can positively influence non-monetary outcomes, as it can reduce crime (Lochner and Moretti, 2004), improve health (Currie and Moretti, 2003), and improvecivic engagement(Milligan et al., 2004). A large body of empirical literature investigates the monetary returns to education in developed and developing countries.2In general, estimated returns to education are larger in developing countries than in industrialized countries. Previous studies that examine the returns to education in developing countries rely on observationalstudy designs. For sub-Saharan Africa, where rates ofpovertyare among the highest in the world (World Bank, 2016), education is particularly important. The issue of causal estimation of the returns to schooling is central for careful policy targeting. However, previous empirical estimates that used data from sub-Saharan Africa rely on observational study designs, which are ill-equipped to detect true causal effects. Precisely measuring the returns to schooling in the context of sub-Saharan countries is a challenge plagued byeconometricissues, data availability constraints (Card, 1999,2001), and survey design issues (Serneels et al., 2017).3,4,5For example, the socioeconomic characteristics of households and communities are important determinants of both schooling and labor market outcomes in developing countries. The omission of individual ability measures in empirical estimations can lead to large upward bias (ability bias) of observational study estimates (Lang, 1993). In practice, the bias present in estimates based on observational study designs could be quite large.In this paper, we examine the returns to cognitive skills and the returns to schooling using data from South Africa.6We use two surveys which collected extensive household information, including various dimensions of cognition. The surveys were conducted between 2002 and 2014 in two distinct regions of South Africa: urban and rural. They provide data on how various dimensions of cognition influence schooling and labor market outcomes in rural and urban settings. In particular, the use of two distinct surveys from two contrasting areas of South Africa enables an examination of the implications of heterogeneous local labor markets on the importance of specific cognitive domains. The first survey that we use is Health and Aging in Africa: A Longitudinal Survey of an INDEPTHCommunityin South Africa (HAALSI). HAALSI examines a rural population aged 40 and older. The second survey, the Cape Area Panel Study (CAPS), follows ametropolitan areapopulation aged between 14 and 22. Both surveys collect cognitive evaluations via direct measurements of specific cognitive domains. In HAALSI (2014), four cognitive domains were tested: memory, numeracy, orientation, and attention. In CAPS (2002–2009), a cognitive evaluation was administered in Wave 1 (2002) and evaluated the domains of literacy and numeracy. Using data from the five waves of the CAPS panel data and the baseline wave of the 2014 HAALSI, we examine the influence of each cognitive domain on reported earnings. Furthermore, we useprincipal component analysis(PCA) to compile information from specific cognitive domains into an aggregate index and examine the impact of both specific cognitive measures and the aggregate cognitive index on the estimated returns to schooling.Theoretical research byBen-Porath (1967)andBecker (1975, 101, n. 89), and empirical studies in sub-Saharan countries (Boissiere et al., 1985;Field et al., 2009), indicate that cognitive skills influence schooling attainment. The failure to account for measures of cognitive ability in observational study designs that estimate the Mincer equation tends to bias the return to schooling estimates. Recent empirical comparisons have shown a gap between ordinary least squares (OLS) andinstrumental variables(IV) estimations of the returns to schooling (Card, 2001;Trostel et al., 2002). The magnitude of ability bias in the returns to schooling can be an important factor that contributes to this discrepancy. Without causal estimates of the returns to schooling, gauging the ability bias in observational study designs can shed some light on the true lack of accuracy of observational study estimates on the returns to schooling in low-income countries.We report three major findings. First, we find that the OLS estimate for the return to each additional year of schooling acquired is 14 percent (based on Wave 5 of the CAPS). Based on HAALSI, the OLS estimate for each additional year of schooling acquired is approximately 10 percent. These estimates are similar to estimates based on survey data from sub-Saharan Africa fromPsacharopoulos and Patrinos (2004). Second, when we instrument for individual schooling levels using schooling fees, we find evidence consistent across all two-stage least squares (2SLS) specifications of higher effect size. Using the schooling fees as an instrument, we find that each additional year of schooling leads to an increase in earnings by approximately 18-20 percent (significant at the 5-percent level). When we use the quarter of birth as an instrument, the estimated return to each additional year of schooling increases up to 28 percent, but these estimates are imprecisely estimated.7Our IV estimates are generally higher than the OLS estimates, a difference likely due to the 2SLS estimation being based on individuals with high marginal returns to schooling. In the third estimation, we detect evidence that suggests that specific cognitive domains play a far more important role in determining a person's earnings than general cognitive skills.8Virtually no prior research examines the importance of cognitive skills for earnings in sub-Saharan countries. This is largely due to a lack of longitudinal data on specific cognitive skills and earnings. Based on the two samples, the overarching pattern that we observe is that, in the rural sample,executive functions(e.g., memory or orientation skills) are more important for earnings. Conversely, in the urban sample, higher-order cognitive skills are more important. Although numeracy skills are evaluated in both samples, it is a statistically significant predictor of earnings only in the urban CAPS sample.This paper makes four important contributions to thelabor economicsliterature on the returns to schooling in developing countries. First, we contribute to understanding the effects of cognitive skills on the returns to education.We estimate and demonstrate the importance of specific cognitive domain proxies in the classical Mincer equation. Our results suggest that cognitive ability scores explain a sizable, positive effect on earnings and slightly diminish the effect of schooling on earnings. Related to this issue, we show that the earnings gap between blacks/coloured and whites in South Africa is considerably reduced when we account for the ability measures.Neal and Johnson (1996)find a similar result in the context of the U.S. racial wage gap. In contrast, cognition measures do not influence the gender earnings gap. These findings imply that differences in premarket skills do account for a significant portion of the earnings gap acrosspopulation groups, but do not seem to play a large role in the gender earnings gap in South Africa. Second, we contribute to the existing empirical literature by estimating the returns to certain dimensions of cognition that proxy for innate ability. Furthermore, cognitive skills measures implicitly provide information about the fundamental role of schooling quality and non-school factors in the production of human capital, which have been overlooked in the previous standard estimations of returns to schooling (Hanushek and Woessmann, 2008). Our results suggest that certain domains of cognition may be more important for earnings than other domains are. When we split the ability proxy into specific cognitive domain components, we find that only the numeracy domain in the CAPS sample and the memory and orientation domains in the HAALSI sample are statistically significant determinants of earnings. Third, although we rely on a limited sample size and an arguably imperfect instrument, we provide suggestive evidence of the causal estimates of the returns to schooling in South Africa by exploiting an IV estimation approach. We also provide suggestive evidence on the magnitude of the ability bias in the context of a developing country. Although much has been written about ability bias (Lang, 1993), and numerous empirical papers have estimated arguably causal returns to schooling in high-income countries (Card, 2001), little is known about the true casual returns in the context of low-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Although the measures of cognitive skills that we use are an important proxy for ability, they are not a direct measure of ability. Nevertheless, we examine how the inclusion of proxies for ability enhances understanding of the effects of cognitive skills on the returns to education. Finally, we provide additional evidence on the returns to schooling based on two survey sources drawn from two distinctdemographicgroups. HAALSI (conducted in 2014) surveyed an aging generation of rural South Africans, aged 40 and older. In contrast, the CAPS, collected between 2002 and 2009 in a metropolitan area, gathered information on young adults, aged between 14 and 22. By using two distinct samples—one based in an urban setting and another based in a rural setting—with rich data on various cognitive domains, we gain a better understanding of the relationship between the returns to schooling and specific cognitive domains in two distinct settings in the context of a developing country.The remainder of the paper is structured as follows:Section IIprovides background information about South Africa'seducation system, major cognitive domains, and previous research about the role that cognitive domains play in determining a person's earnings.Section IIIdescribes the survey data, sampling strategies, and overall sample characteristics.Section IVpresents the empirical strategy.Section Vreports the results.Section VIdescribes various robustness checks.Section VIIoffers a discussion and concluding remarks.",Plamen,Nusrat,Jerray
"1. IntroductionOne of the key questions in the unemployment insurance (UI) literature is how the length of the benefit period affects the duration of unemployment spells and the quality of subsequent job matches. A major challenge of causal inference is to find exogenous variation in the length of the benefit period. The most convincing studies have relied either on discontinuities in the benefit rule that determines the maximum benefit duration as a function of age and/or work history (e.g.Caliendo, Tatsiramos, Uhlendorff, 2013,Card, Chetty, Weber, 2007,Lalive, 2007,Lalive, 2008,Le Barbanchon, 2016,Schmieder, von Wachter, Bender, 2012) or policy changes that extended or reduced the benefit period for some group of the unemployed but did not affect other groups (e.g.Hunt, 1995,Lalive, Ours, Zweimüller, 2006,van Ours, Vodopivec, 2006). The regression discontinuity approach can be applied only in the case of certain countries where the maximum benefit duration varies across worker groups (e.g. Germany, Austria, Italy and Portugal).1A common problem with thepolicy reformsis that the benefit periods are often extended in response to recessions (e.g. the federal- and state-level benefit extension programs in the U.S.) or to the relatively poor employment development of certain worker groups, so that the policy changes themselves are endogenous (Card, Levine, 2000,Lalive, Zweimüller, 2004). Large-scale reforms may also havespillover effectson those who are not directly affected through search externalities (Lalive, Landais, Zweimüller, 2015,Levine, 1993). In the case of Finland, neither of these approaches can be applied as the maximum duration of UI benefits remained at 100 weeks for several decades up until 2013.2In this paper, we propose and apply a novel approach to estimate the causal effects of potential benefit duration in the absence of variation in the maximum benefit period.In Finland, an unemployed worker who has worked for a certain minimum number of weeks during the past two years is awarded a new period of UI benefits (500 payment days or 100 calendar weeks prior to 2014). A worker who enters unemployment without satisfying this employment condition may still be entitled to UI benefits if he or she has some residual benefits left from the previous unemployment spell. Within this group the remaining benefit entitlement can be anything between 1 and 499 payment days. Thus, even though themaximumentitlement period is the same for all unemployed, there is variation inpotentialbenefit duration at the beginning of unemployment spells among workers with different employment histories.3Obviously this variation alone does not permit causal inference, as it is completely driven by differences in past labor market outcomes.To identify the causal effects, we take advantage of a change in the employment condition in 2003 that reduced the minimum number of employment weeks required for renewal of the entitlement period. As a result of the reform, workers who satisfied the new but not the old employment condition became eligible for UI benefits for different periods of time depending on the date of their unemployment entry, whereas other workers were not affected by the reform. Provided that the change in the employment condition did not affect the unemployment inflow, the resulting variation in the potential benefit duration within the affected group is exogenous, and thus the causal effects of potential benefit duration can be identified by comparing different groups before and after the 2003 reform. Since the reform only affected a relatively small fraction of all UI recipients, we should not worry about the confounding spillover effects.We classify workers who became unemployed between 2000 and 2004 into groups defined by the number of employment weeks and the number of residual UI days from the previous spell. These groups were affected differently by the 2003 change in the employment condition. The groups where employment weeks exceed the new but not the old threshold of the employment condition are the most likely to experience a notable increase in potential benefit duration after 2003. Moreover, within these groups, the average increase in potential benefit duration is larger for those with fewer residual benefit days from the previous spell. Under the assumption that the expected value of unobserved characteristics in different groups follows the same trend, we can estimate the effects of potential benefit duration by comparing changes in the unemployment outcomes over time across different groups.Our findings indicate that one additional week of UI benefits increases the expected duration of compensated unemployment by some 0.16 weeks, corresponding to an elasticity of 0.5. This effect appears to be fairly homogeneous, as the absolute effect varies between 0.10 and 0.22 weeks across various subgroups of workers. The effect is quite similar for women and men, for different education groups, for private- and public-sector employees, and for those facing different labor market conditions. However, workers aged 45 and over, those with relatively high UI benefits and those with fewer residual days from the previous unemployment spell are somewhat more responsive to changes in the potential benefit duration. Furthermore, we find evidence that longer benefit periods improve the quality of the first post-unemployment job: one additional week of benefits is estimated to increase the expected wage and duration of the next job by some 2 Euros per month and 0.14–0.18 weeks, respectively. The former effect corresponds to an elasticity of 0.06, whereas the latter effect is economically more significant with an elasticity of around 0.2. The effect on the quality of the next job varies across groups, being close to zero in many cases. Women, low educated and private-sector employees are the most likely to benefit in terms of higher wages or more stable jobs from the longer job search periods that longer benefit periods enable. Our back-of-the-envelope calculations imply that the match-quality effect has a significant fiscal impact: better job matches following a benefit duration extension may increase tax revenues andsocial security contributionsover post-unemployment job spells by an amount that accounts for two-thirds of the direct costs of longer unemployment spells.Our study makes three contributions. First, we show that it may be possible to estimate the causal effects of potential benefit duration even when there is no variation in the maximum benefit duration. In most countries, benefit eligibility depends on the record of past employment and awarded benefits can be collected over several unemployment spells. In these cases, theeconometricapproach we propose here can be applied. Second, we provide first evidence on the effect of potential benefit duration on unemployment duration for Finland.Tatsiramos and van Ours (2014)summarize the findings of the previous studies for other countries by concluding that a one-week increase in potential benefit duration typically prolongs average unemployment duration by approximately 0.2 weeks. Although our approach differs from the previous studies, which have exploited variation in the maximum benefit duration, our estimate for Finland is of the same magnitude. Third, our study contributes to a modest literature on the effect of potential benefit duration on the quality of subsequent job matches. Most studies in this literature find either a small negative effect or no effect at all on measures of job quality (e.g.Card, Chetty, Weber, 2007,Lalive, 2007,Le Barbanchon, 2016,Schmieder, von Wachter, Bender, 2016). A notable exception isNekoei and Weber (2017)who find a small positive wage effect but no effect on subsequent job duration in Austria.4Our results of positive impacts on the match quality are encouraging, given that they suggest that the Finnish UI scheme does not only subsidize leisure time but also productive job search.The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. The next section describes the Finnish UI system during the period under investigation. This is followed by a section describing our data and sample restrictions.Section 4presents descriptive evidence to support the validity of our research design and likely effects of potential benefit duration.Section 5describes the econometric model and reports the estimation results along with the results of robustness checks.Section 6discusses the fiscal impact of benefit duration changes, andSection 7concludes.",Tomi,Hanna,None
"1. IntroductionTransgender people report experiencing high rates of discrimination.1For example, in an EU-wide survey, 54 percent of transgender respondents reported that they “have felt personally discriminated against or harassed because of being perceived as trans” within the preceding year (European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, 2014). In a survey of 6,436 transgender men and women from the U.S., 50 percent reported experiencing harassment at work and 44 percent reported having experienced hiring discrimination based on their identity (Grant et al., 2011). Hiring discrimination could lead to increased rates of unemployment, adversely affecting individual mental health andwellbeing(Paul and Moser, 2009). This means that hiring discrimination could be a partial explanation for the increased rates of psychiatric hospitalization and suicidality among transgender people (Dhejne et al., 2011). Yet, there is a lack of experimental studies going beyond self-reported experiences that identify the actual discrimination faced by transgender people in the labor market. We conducted a preregistered field experiment to document causal evidence of hiring discrimination against transgender people in 12 labor market sectors in Sweden.2There have already been some efforts to study transgender people in the labor market through nonexperimental methods. For example,Geijtenbeek and Plug (2018)found that Dutch transgender people suffered an approximate 11 percent wage penalty. There are, however, some well-known difficulties in using registry data to study discrimination. First, these nonexperimental statistical approaches cannot fully separate discrimination from other explanations due to issues with omission of unobservable productivity-relevant variables (Neumark, 2018) which prevents identification of averagetreatment effects. Second, and more specific to the case of transgender people, registry data in most cases captures a subset of individuals who have gone through, or started, the process of legally changing their name and/or gender. In Sweden, the first point of contact for an individual wishing to start this process would be a psychologist to deliver a gender dysphoria diagnosis.3The number of treatment referrals for youth gender dysphoria has grown drastically in Sweden in recent years (Frisén et al., 2017;Socialstyrelsen, 2020).4As this increase is especially pronounced among young people who are soon to enter the labor force it is important to explore the hiring situation they might face.In the present study, we used a broad and more inclusive definition of transgender people. We defined transgender people as those who legally have changed their gender as well as those who socially identify as the opposite gender assigned to them at birth. It is difficult to say for certain how many people fit this broader definition; according one study only 34 percent Swedish transgender men and women reported having legally changed their gender (Zeluf et al. 2016).5This suggests that a large proportion of transgender people may not appear in registries but do identify with the opposite gender. Research has shown that 26 percent of transgender people in Sweden have experienced discrimination in access to healthcare (European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, 2014) and 69 percent have experienced negative treatment in receiving healthcare (Zeluf et al., 2016). These experiences could make it difficult for transgender people to start or complete the process of formal and legal gender transition, but they may still be at risk of facing discrimination in the labor market.As an alternative to nonexperimental methods,Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004)6popularized the use of correspondence testing to detect discrimination. This method has become the standard way of testing for discrimination in housing and labor markets. Correspondence tests have been used to document discrimination against many groups in Sweden (e.g.,Ahmed et al., 2012;Ahmed et al., 2009;Ahmed and Lång, 2017,2019;Bursell, 2014;Carlsson, 2011;Carlsson and Rooth, 2007;Rooth, 2004;Carlsson and Eriksson, 2019). Correspondence studies are field experiments in which fictitious applications are sent to real employers with job postings. The associated curricula vitae (CVs) are kept the same for all applicants but the relevant group signal is randomized by the researcher. Rates of positive employer responses to job applications from each group can then be compared to acquire average treatment effects. The method has provided credible evidence of hiring discrimination, especially against minority groups in many different countries. (For recent reviews of this literature, seeBertrand and Duflo, 2017;Baert, 2018; andNeumark, 2018)Between January and May of 2019, we sent 2,224 fictitious applications to employers with job vacancies in 12 low-skilled sectors in the Swedish labor market. We exploited the common practice in Sweden of prefacing one's CV with a short cover letter. In this letter, our fictitious applicants introduced themselves by name (e.g., “Hello, my name is A Eriksson).” In the second paragraph, they then mentioned: “For future contact I would like to clarify that I have changed my name (from B Eriksson) so a few of my old documents are in my previous name.” For transgender applicants, the names A and B were drawn from a pool of common differently gendered names and for cisgender applicants the names where drawn from the same gender. Our design makes use of the fact that changing one's name is fairly commonplace in Sweden. Between 2013 and 2018, 95,090 people applied to change their first name in Sweden (own calculations using data obtained from the Swedish Tax Agency). It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that cisgender applicants were not seen as particularly special by evaluators because of their name change.From an international perspective, studying the situation for transgender people in Sweden means that we estimate a lower bound of hiring discrimination against this group. Sweden is considered one of the most progressive countries in the world when it comes to gender equality (World EconomicForum, 2018) and LGBT acceptance (Flores and Park, 2018). Furthermore, Swedish transgender people report some of the lowest rates of experienced discrimination in the EU when searching for work (European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, 2014).Following our preregistration plan, we began by examining overall discrimination against transgender applicants across all 12 occupations in the experiment. Besides estimating the average treatment effect of being transgender on positive employer response rates when applying for work, our design allowed us to test a prediction of the statistical discrimination theory (Arrow, 1973;Phelps, 1972); that discrimination should diminish as information about other relevant skill indicators increases. We also examined whether employers’ based their decisions on their customers’ tastes (Becker, 1957) by examining differences in discrimination between occupations which tend to require face-to-face customer interaction (FFCI) and those which do not.7We then applied Neumark's (2012) method to check whether our estimates of discrimination were robust to the critique presented byHeckman and Siegelman (1993).8Additionally, we explored the role of occupational gender distribution. This was mainly motivated by evidence from correspondence studies of hiring discrimination which tends to show heterogeneity across occupations with different gender ratios (Rich, 2014;Ahmed et al., 2013a;Carlsson, 2011). Another reason was that some survey data suggest that men may be more prejudiced against transgender people than women (Nagoshi et al., 2008). We performed subsample analyses where occupational sectors were categorized by occupational gender ratio, splitting the total sample into male-dominated, female-dominated, and mixed occupations. Discrimination in occupations with different gender ratios was evaluated in a similar way to overall discrimination (i.e., checking for signs of statistical and customer discrimination). In an effort to better understand the heterogeneous discrimination uncovered across occupations with different gender compositions, we also examined differences in the treatment of transgender male and female applicants. Lastly, we tested the robustness to the Heckman-Siegelman critique of the estimated discrimination in these gender ratio subsamples.",Mark,Per,Ali

"1. IntroductionThe twentieth century has witnessed a spectacular rise in women’s participation to the labor market. Around 1900, one in five women of working age was in gainful employment in the US. A hundred years later, the female employment rate had risen to two thirds of the working age population, accompanied by gradual gender convergence in wages and earnings, and the entry of women in occupations traditionally occupied by men (Goldin, 2006). Similar changes were taking place in all economically advanced countries, albeit with varying time lags with respect to the US experience.These developments have generated a vast body of work, studying womens changing role in the economy and the underlying driving forces. A widely documented phenomenon is the female gain in human capital accumulation, leading to narrowing and then reversing gender gaps in college completion rates.1Meanwhile, medical advances have reduced fertility via the introduction of oral contraceptives, improvedmaternal health, and provided substitutes to maternal lactation. Another relevant factor is the introduction of antidiscriminationlegislationin most countries, which was more recently accompanied by affirmative action aimed at removing entry barriers in male-dominated, high-income occupations (seeGoldin, 2006,Bertrand, 2011, andOlivetti and Petrongolo, 2016, for a discussion of these forces and a survey of the literature). Besides these gender-specific trends, gender-neutral changes such as the rise in the service economy were creating cleaner and less physically demanding jobs in which women may have a comparative advantage, whether innate or acquired (Ngai and Petrongolo, 2017). Closely knit to these economic and institutional changes was the evolution of gender identity norms, which slowly but steadily reshaped women’s aspirations and societal perceptions about appropriate gender roles in the household and the labor market (Goldin, 2006,Bertrand, 2011). Women’s changing role in the labor market has also spurred – and was often reinforced by – government intervention and firm policies targeting families and in particular offering women the opportunity to combine careers and motherhood (Olivetti and Petrongolo, 2017).Despite decades of progress, gender convergence has recently slowed down (most notably in the US), and sizable gaps remain in most indicators of gender success. Women in the US earn about 18% less than men (on an hourly basis) and their employment rates are 10 percentage points lower. In the UK,gender differencesclosely replicate the US picture, with a 20% wage gap and an employment gap of 9 percentage points. In most continental European countries wage gaps are narrower, but employment gaps are substantially larger. In all countries women are still under-represented in high-income, high-status occupations. Large and persistent gaps are especially remarkable in light of equalized education opportunities and equal pay legislation gradually adopted in most countries since World War II.The causes of remaining genderinequalitiesare actively debated in current labor research. While traditional human capital factors such as education and experience can no longer explain earnings or employment differentials, other aspects of labor market attachment still seem to differ between men and women. A strand of the literature has highlighted gender differences in preferences and psychological traits, whether innate or shaped by social contexts, leading to women’s underrepresentation in the upper part of the earnings distribution. Based on experimental evidence from the lab and, more recently, from real-world settings, a large body of work has documented some gender differences in attitudes towards risk, competition and negotiation, which may interfere with labor market success whenever financially rewarding careers develop in highly-competitive environments, characterized by volatile earnings (seeCroson, Gnezy, 2009,Bertrand, 2011, andAzmat and Petrongolo, 2014, for surveys). Among studies that directly relate such differences in attitudes to the gender gap in earnings, the portion of the earnings gap explained remains relatively modest (Blau and Kahn, 2017).Another strand of work has mostly emphasized women’s role of primary providers of childcare and home production, which sets limits to their labor market engagement. As a likely consequence of worklife balance considerations, women typically work shorter or more irregular hours than men, are more likely to take career breaks, and specialize in different occupations andindustries. These work dimensions may only marginally contribute to differential accumulation of actual work experience, but could still contribute to gender gaps via differences in job search behavior and compensating pay differentials associated tojob characteristicsespecially favored by women, such as short or flexible hours, atypical work arrangements, or shorter commutes, to name a few (Goldin, 2014,Blau, Kahn, 2017,Bertrand, 2018). Indeed, childbirth drives large and persistent wedges between the earnings of mothers and fathers (Kleven et al., 2019a).In this paper we discuss some strands of the recent literature on the evolution of gender gaps and their driving forces, expanding on our previous work on these topics and exploring avenues for future research.2We will start inSection 2by revisiting a few stylized facts about gender gaps in employment and wages in a few high-income countries. Most of the evidence presented refers to the US and the UK, with a few comparisons with major continental European countries.Section 3discusses and builds on one gender-neutral force behind the rise in female employment, namely the rise of the service economy, to the detriment of themanufacturing sectorand home-produced services, and will describe how both mechanisms may be conducive to a rise in female employment. We will then relate the growth in service jobs to the polarization of employment, which in the US is much more pronounced for women than for men, and to the geographic distribution of jobs, which is predicted to be especially relevant for female employment prospects.Section 4will turn to currently debated causes of remaining gender gaps and discusses potential labor market consequences of women’s heavier caring responsibilities in the household. In particular, we will highlight how women’s stronger distaste for commuting time may feed into gender pay gaps by limiting women’s job opportunities. Evidence for a few countries shows that women on average commute shorter distances than men, and that the age profile in the gender commuting gap closely mimics the age profile in the earnings gap. Relatedly, women gain less than men from job mobility in terms of earnings, but gain more in terms of vicinity to new workplaces, consistent with stronger willingness than men to trade off wage gains for shorter commutes.Section 5concludes with summary views and open questions for future research.",Barbara,Maddalena,None
"1. IntroductionWhen individuals used to engage in formal job search, they would open the classified section of the newspaper and read the jobadvertisementsposted there. The advertisements would feature some information about the jobs, and some way to contact the employer by phone or mail. For a labor market researcher, neither the newspaper nor the specific ads that the job seeker read are visible. Even the content of the ads was very difficult to collect. Whether a person would then get in touch with the employer was also not recorded and therefore hard to study. This way of searching for jobs had been in place for a long time, and researchers essentially took it as a given.With the advent of high-speed internet and dedicated job search websites, this picture has drastically changed within a decade. While only 20% of U.S. unemployed workers searched for jobs online at the end of the 1990s, close to 80% did so a decade later.Fig. 1replicated fromKuhn (2014)shows this, and highlights that this marks a trend that closely mimics the rollout of high-speed internet.Download :Download high-res image (293KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. Prevalence of high-speed internet and online job search,Kuhn (2014).Nowadays, when individuals engage in formal job search, they access an online portal where they usually enter keywords and geographic area and get to see jobs that match their criteria. While early websites such as Craigslist.com were a close replica of classified sections in newspapers, in principle the flexibility of web-based platforms opens up completely novel ways of providing information and to organize what individuals can search for and how. This allows researchers not simply to observe the market outcomes, but potentially to act as designers of the market place, as I will elaborate below. Beyond the ability to change the market interaction, an interesting feature of the online search process is that it leaves a digital record of the search activities of individuals and of the job postings of firms.The online environment thereby offers novelties in terms of the type of research that labor economists can now engage in which are summarized here, and I elaborate on them throughout this paper:iWe can study what thefirmswant by analyzing the text of the job postings.iiWe can trace whatjob seekerssearch for.iiiWe can trace what vacanciesjob seekersget shown based on their search.ivWe can trace whatjob seekerslook at in detail or save.vWe might be able to trace whatjob seekersapply for.viWe might be able to trace whom thefirmscall back.viiWe might be able to link the observations in the points i. to vi. to administrative records on these firms and/or workers.viiiWe might be able to intervene andcustomize/randomizeinformation, which enables causal inference on the workings of the labor market and opens up the opportunity for “search design” or “platform design”.Online job search websites in general have access to a massive set of vacancies including the vacancy description and when and for how long the vacancy was advertised, which enables point (i). On the job seeker side they tend to track job seeker behavior summarized in (ii)–(v) above. Sometimes the websites even record whether firms get back to individuals through the portal, as indicated in (vi) above.Records on (i)–(iv) are standard in most job search portals and already offer in unprecedented detail a view on the job search process on both sides of the market. Records on (v) are present for some websites, and (vi) is not yet common. If (v) and (vi) exist they often comprise only one of several ways that job seekers and firms can use to get in touch and therefore provide only a partial view. But as websites gain in sophistication and provide ever easier ways for both market sides to interact within the platform we are likely to see a more comprehensive view on these dimensions. And since some of these websites are run by the government or record official government identifiers, it is sometimes possible to (vii) link this data to administrative records of firms, workers, or even of matched worker-firm data.Researchers are therefore now in a position to study in depth the process of job search, selection, and hiring. I expect that this will offer a revolution in our understanding of the hiring stage in labor markets, and this article reviews some of the recent advances on this below. Yet those only scratch the surface at this early point in this line of research. Given thewealthof papers in the macro-labor literature that have opened the black box of the matching function a little bit but lacked any observational data confirming their specifics assumptions, it seems that there is scope for a corrective wave of empirical research that will allow us to sharpen the models we use.Returning to the theme of “search design” with which this article started, it is important to realize that the wealth of data that is now available plus the data that is available from administrative records might enable platforms and market designers to improve the market interaction. This is possible not only because of the new data, but because the arrival of online search engines enables (viii): the ability to optimize the search process and to customize/randomize information. Online platforms routinely explore improvements to their platforms by trying new designs on a subset of the market. They can do this as assigning information differentially to different users of the website is relatively easy, while it might have been difficult or impossible in the times where this information had to be printed in newspapers which were then available to everyone in the market. Labor economists could exploit this variation.They can contribute to designing this variation by using insights fromlabor economicsto guide them. This process of “search design” has at least three dimensions. First, one can design which additional information is provided to help job seekers. Given the general information overload that people are exposed to, a crucial choice is which type of additional information to provide. Examples that come to mind from a labor economics perspective are to display related occupations and jobs within them, or market tightnesses. Second, economists can aid in thinking through the fine details of the search process per se. Are keywords the best way to search? Should one allow other dimensions, such as search by market tightness? If so, which other dimensions should be “searchable”, and how would an algorithm trade them off.Third, labor economists can also try to randomize other information within the market to better understand the workings of that market. Sending (fake) CV's randomly to employers has been in the repertoire of empirical economists for more than a decade to understand how employers would choose amongst potential employees. The online setting offers opportunities to do similar interventions easier and cheaper, and possibly for both sides of the market. This opens new opportunities to delve deeper into the workings of the labor market.Both the study of novel observational data, and the ability to change the search process itself and to assess the outcome in a random fashion, have the potential to transform the way we understand and approach labor markets. The second part of changing the search process offers the additional exciting avenue for economists to become active in shaping the market interaction, rather than just acting as passive bystanders that take the search frictions as given. This is the key message of this paper.In the remainder, I will useSection 2to highlight some of the few existing papers that study novel observational data. The section will display the new possibilities for research that such data offers.Section 3highlights a design approach to labor market search, and how to evaluate the success in a randomized design. It also reviews work on understanding the market through small randomized interventions in the market at large. Given that this work is just starting out, there is not a wealth of work to draw on yet. The section will be based on joint work with my co-authors Michele Belot and Paul Muller. Finally,Section 4concludes with an outlook to future developments.",Philipp,None,None
"1. IntroductionThe fast-pacedinternationalisationof the tertiaryeducation systemhas drastically increased the number of international students from 2.0 million in 2000 to 5.3 million worldwide in 2017.1The UK is one of the largest recipient countries of foreign students. In 2019, it hosted about 486,000 international students, representing 25% of the student population in the country.2The increasingly diverse student population has sparked a scientific and political debate. Advocates of internationalisation argue that increasing diversity benefits both native and foreign students, while critics raise concerns about potential negative spill-overs and native college flight. Empirical evidence on the effects of increasing numbers of foreign students is mostly restricted to primary andsecondary educationand points to ambiguous effects across different settings.3Tertiary education settings have received less attention to date.4In this paper, we provide causal evidence on the effects of higher internationalisation and ethnic diversity on student grades and educational choices in a setting of exogeneous assignment to undergraduate seminars at a British university. We measure the ethnic composition of a seminar (small-scale learning group) by the share of non-native language background (labeled as the share of non-native speakers hereafter) but also by the ethno-linguistic diversity within the group of non-native speakers.Ethno-linguistic diversity among non-native students is expected to influence student performance and choices as it changes incentives for English language use and assimilation, a mechanism that is straightforwardly derived from a model of language assimilation (Lazear, 1999). At a given share of non-native speakers, a non-native-speaking student from a smaller linguistic minority broadens her pool of potential learning partners if she communicates in English, albeit potentially at some cost. The smaller the pool of potential same-language learning partners, the higher the incentives to engage in English communication. This intuition directly maps into a theoretically-positive effect of diversity on classroom integration which in turn is expected to have positive spill-overs on theacademic performanceof non-native speakers. Further, language skills acquired through interaction with native peers can directly improve performance in English curricula, even in quantitative courses. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the effect of ethnic seminar diversity (beyond the simple share of immigrants) on student outcomes in a tertiary education setting.We base our analysis on the administrative records of economics students at a university in the LondonMetropolitan area. This institutional environment provides a fitting “laboratory setting” for our analysis for two reasons. First, the student body that we analyse is characterised by a high degree of ethno-linguistic diversity. Over the 2006 to 2016 period, we observe on average a share of 56 percent of non-native students from 67 different non-English-speaking countries. The high degree of ethno-linguistic diversity ensures a sufficient common support for the share of non-native students and the diversity to identify the causal effect of both variables. This level of internationalisation is shared by other British institutions, and the institution that we analyse does not stand out in terms of selectivity or graduate earnings. Second, students of the economics programme are exogeneously allocated to seminars during the compulsory stage of their studies, which results in an exogenously varying ethno-linguistic composition that is consistent with an as-good-as-random assignment to seminars.We describe three sets of results. First, grades of native speakers are unaffected by the share of non-native students and the linguistic diversity of a classroom. Non-native speakers are not penalised by higher shares of non-native students in the classroom, but benefit from a higher ethno-linguistic diversity. In a more diverse classroom, the academic performance of non-native speakers improves, especially for low-achieving students.Second, we trace potential mechanisms through an in-class survey. Students change their pattern of classroom interaction across ethnicities in response to higher diversity. When diversity increases, non-native students become more likely to interact with native students while interaction patterns for native speakers remain unaltered. Diversity appears to counteract segregation between native and non-native speakers.Third, in the longer run the initial share of non-native speakers increases the likelihood to choose courses that are again popular among non-native students. This segregation into courses, potentially, better suited for non-native students, might explain the persistent effect of share of non-native speakers on third year performance which is to some degree inconsistent with the contemporary results. With respect to early seminar diversity, and in line with contemporary results, though, third year grades are positively affected, suggesting some persistence of the contemporary effect of diversity on performance. Finally, a voluntary alumni survey suggests that being assigned to a larger share of non-native students in the compulsory stage increases the likelihood of non-native speakers to be abroad at the point of interview of the post-graduation survey.Taken together, our findings suggest that even at a high level of internationalisation, there are virtually no negative effects on the learning of native students through the exposure to non-native speakers in small-class teaching. Diversity improves the learning of non-native speakers while natives speakers’ performance remains unaffected.With this paper, we contribute to the literature on the effects of the internationalisation of education. In general, existing studies have focused on the share of foreign students in primary and secondary school classrooms.Ballatore et al. (2018)exploit rules of classroom formation to identify a sizeable negative effect of additional immigrant students in Italian primary schools, which are substantially larger for foreign rather than native students. Other studies describe small negative to zero to even slight positive effects of higher shares of foreign students using variation between cohorts or classes of the same school (Diette, Oyelere, 2017,Figlio, Özek, 2017,Frattini, Meschi, 2017,Geay, McNally, Telhaj, 2013,Gould, Lavy, Paserman, 2009,Ohinata, van Ours, 2013), regions (Hunt, 2017,Jensen, Rasmussen, 2011,McHenry, 2015) or between countries (Brunello and Rocco, 2013). With respect to diversity of primary/secondary school classrooms,Maestri (2017)finds a positive effect of more diverse classrooms on foreigners language acquisition, whileBredtmann et al. (2018)report negative correlations between diversity and thesocial integrationof immigrants in German primary schools.Only few studies have estimated the effects of internationalisation in tertiary education settings.Anelli et al. (2017)show that higher shares of foreign peers in introductory maths courses reduces the probability of native students moving into STEM majors, but find no direct effect on grades. Compared to our own study, their interest is on the effect of internationalisation on major choice in a US public university. In our setting, as common in European universities, students have already chosen their major at enrolment, and as such follow more comparable educational paths.Braakmann and McDonald (2018)describe a relationship between diversity at the course level and student performance for three UK-wide cohorts and deal with potentially endogenous course choices by exploiting within-programme variation across courses. They complement their main analysis with an IV strategy relying on network effects among foreign students. Their results point to ambiguous effects of diversity, depending on the level of analysis.Machin and Murphy (2017)find no evidence for a crowding out of domestic students in response to higher influx of foreign students in UK universities.Our paper makes three contributions to these strands of literature. First, we examine the effect of diversity in higher education beyond the simple share of foreign students on a fine-grained seminar level. These seminars display relevant peer groups with meaningful social interactions. WhileBraakmann and McDonald (2018)demonstrate sensitivity of the level of observation with respect to student diversity, the classroom level has only been addressed byMaestri (2017)for primary school classrooms in the Netherlands and byBredtmann et al. (2018)for German primary schools. Second, whereas the aforementioned studies have to deal with potential selection into classrooms and programs, we base our identification on a clean natural experiment relying on as-good-as-random allocation of students to small-scale seminars. This strategy alleviates many concerns about potential confounders through the selection of students into seminars. Third, we provide insights into plausible mechanisms by surveying students in the field about ethnic interactions and language use.Our results have implications for education practitioners. Even in an environment where non-native speakers represent more than half of the students, we do not find negative effects of their share on the performance and educational choices of native students. This supports current policies of pursuing greater internationalisation in higher education and should caution against forces asking for stricter admission policies discriminating by origin. Moreover, to favour the integration of non-native speakers, diversifying early study environments by avoiding segregated classrooms appears to be a low-cost way to improve the educational performance of lower ability non-native-speaking students.Beyond the educational setting, our results may speak to the effect of diversity in work-related settings, where existing literature has not yet reached a consensus about the effects of diversity on productivity (Dale-Olsen, Finseraas, 2019,Hoogendoorn, Van Praag, 2012,Kahane, Longley, Simmons, 2013,Trax, Brunow, Suedekum, 2015). Here, we provide complementary findings from “academic work groups” and show that higher levels of diversity indeed provide the potential to raise productivity and knowledge production.",Arnaud,Ingo,Elena
"1. IntroductionFrom an early age, interaction with peers has a significant impact on students career choices (Anelli, Peri, 2017,Schneeweis, Zweimüller, 2012). At each stage of formal education, new classmates are introduced and a student’s aspiration may take a new turn. College is no different, except that students have already made a critical step towards their chosen career and new turns can be very costly. Another difference is that college classmates often share similar career choices, so students have a better idea of whom they will be competing and interacting with in the future. It is not clear, though, whether having better peers improves thelearning experienceor discourages disadvantaged students from pursuing the chosen career (Arcidiacono, Lovenheim, 2016,Carrell, Sacerdote, West, 2013,Sacerdote, 2001).In this paper, we investigate the effect of class composition in college on the decision to switch programs and on future earnings and occupation. To establish causality, we properly control for individual skills and institutional quality by exploiting the rule of class assignment in a major flagship university in Brazil. In most of its programs, the first-year students are assigned to one of two classes, in which they take most of their courses together throughout college. The ‘first’ class starts in late February or early March and has most of the best students; the ‘second’ class starts in late July or early August and accommodates the worst candidates at the entry-level. Candidates must choose both their study program and preferred class before taking the entrance exam. Also, they cannot choose multiple programs and take multiple tests for the same university in the same year. Since the admission is highly competitive, they can hardly predict their initial rank when they apply, and two-thirds of the admitted candidates prefer the first class.This arrangement allows us to compare similar candidates at the bottom of the better class and at the top of the worse class using a fuzzy regression discontinuity (RD) design. Thus, we identify the effect on nearly median students who want to join the better class because part of them cannot. Our findings reveal that students in the better class have both a relative disadvantage with their peers and an absolute disadvantage with a similar student in the worse class. For instance, if in the first class, a student’s failure rate is one and a half as high as if she were in the second.Both genders are found to be equally affected in terms ofacademic performance. However, men’s willingness to switch study programs and time tograduationare more sensitive to the class assignment than women’s. If attending the first class, a male student is 6.5 percentage points (p.p.) more likely to change his major, which doubles the average rate, and 10 p.p. (or 20%) more prone to delay his graduation. A female student, on the other hand, is 5 p.p. more likely to drop out of the university. At first glance, these findings might result from the difference in the type of program that men and women enroll. Since women are over-represented in programs with easier admission, they do not have as many options left as men if they want to quit their major. However, the effect on women’s willingness to switch majors is low regardless of the type of program. The effect on men is surprisingly higher in programs where they are underrepresented.In the long run, we find neither men’s nor women’ssalaryis affected by the disadvantage faced in the first class, but their occupation is. The women’s probability of being promoted to management is 13 p.p. higher if they attend the second class rather than the first. For men, attending the second class increases the chance of being apublic servant, which is a prestigious occupation in Brazil due to its high salary and stability (Braga et al., 2009).We further explore two mechanisms to explain our main findings: peer quality and relative rank. While peer quality refers to the absolute level of classmates’ skills, which affects human capital through peer learning, networking, and even teaching methods; rank refers to students’ relative position in their class, which affectsindividual motivationand teacher’s discrimination within a class.1To verify the role of each mechanism, we estimate the relationship across program cohorts between discontinuity and difference in peer quality between classes. The smaller this difference, the weaker the contribution of peer quality to the discontinuity. But even under an infinitesimal difference between classes, it is possible to order students from top to bottom.The estimated relationship confirms all the results persist even if classes are very similar, indicating that they are all driven by the difference in student’s relative rank. Moreover, a higher peer quality in the first class is found to mitigate the rank effect on the willingness to switch programs, delay in graduation, and future occupation. The reason men’s decision to switch programs is more affected than women’s is their higher responsiveness to their rank. For women, the rank effect is so weak that a small increase in peer quality brings the net effect of attending the first class close to zero. For men, the effect is much stronger and canceled out only by an abnormal difference in peer quality.Although candidates are unaware of the cutoff between classes when they apply to the university, they could decline an offer as soon as the entrance scores and class order are revealed (Bond et al., 2018). To verify this type of selection bias, we run theMcCrary’s (2008) test and find no evidence of missing students on either side of the cutoff. We also test for differences between the instructors in these classes and find no significance.2The last concern is related to the starting date of the two classes, which are five months apart. We estimate the effect of this delay on the academic outcomes of first-class students by using an unexpected strike in the university. If anything, the delay, similar to the one enforced by the class cutoff, reduced the student’s commitment to the program — i.e., the effects may be underestimated in our RD design.3Our evidence is consistent with recent studies on the effect of class ranking in primary and secondary schools on academic outcomes (Cicala, Fryer, Spenkuch, 2017,Elsner, Isphording, 2017,Fabregas, 2017,Murphy, Weinhardt, 2016,Tincani, 2017), criminal behaviour (Elsner and Isphording, 2018), non-cognitive skills (Pagani et al., 2019), career choices (Elsner et al., 2018), and future earnings (Denning et al., 2018). It is also consistent withBertoni and Nisticò’s (2008) study, which shows that rank andpeer effectsconversely affect the academic performance of college students. Our work contributes to the literature by showing that the relative rank also leads tocareer changesafter students have enrolled in college and has consequences for their future occupation. According toZafar (2011),Arcidiacono et al. (2012), andStinebrickner, Stinebrickner, 2014,Stinebrickner, Stinebrickner, 2012, students who are poorly matched in their programs adjust their optimistic beliefs and are more likely to drop out. In our context, the lower rank makes students more willing to quit, but a broader quality gap between classes has the opposite effect. It is worth noting, however, that students do not anticipate their disadvantages when the class ranking is disclosed. It is only after they interact with their peers that their willingness to switch programs is affected.This paper is also broadly related to the evidence that students underperform when facing a relative disadvantage (Bedard, Dhuey, 2006,Black, Devereux, Salvanes, 2011,Fredriksson, Öckert, 2014,McEwan, Shapiro, 2008) and update their perceived return of schooling when receiving new signals (Hoxby, Turner, 2015,Jensen, 2010,Wiswall, Zafar, 2015). Furthermore, by tapping the relationship between relative rank and peer quality, our study explores a mechanism through which peer effects are heterogeneous and sometimes harmful to disadvantaged candidates (Booij, Leuven, Oosterbeek, 2017,Carrell, Sacerdote, West, 2013,Feld, Zölitz, 2017,Lavy, Paserman, Schlosser, 2012,Lavy, Silva, Weinhardt, 2012).4Likewise, the benefit of joining a more selective school could be null if students see themselves at the bottom of the ability distribution (e.g.,Abdulkadiroğlu, Angrist, Pathak, 2014,Dale, Krueger, 2002,Heinesen, 2018,Hoekstra, Mouganie, Wang, 2018,Kirkeboen, Leuven, Mogstad, 2016,Ockert, 2010).5In addition to controlling for institutional differences, our empirical strategy provides unique evidence of the relationship between peer quality and relative rank.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.Section 2describes the university’s admissions policy and the rule of class assignment.Section 3details the data sources and presents thedescriptive statistics.

"1. IntroductionWageinequalityhas always existed. As each person differs in terms of skills, attitude, opportunities, and background, it must not be surprising whether two or more individuals earn different levels ofsalary. Thereby, wage inequality may not represent an issue by itself, but some of its determinants do. Understanding what drives wage inequality is very important considering it has grown constantly over the last decades (Devicienti, Fanfani, Maida, 2019,Felbermayr, Impullitti, Prat, 2018,Lemieux, 2006).Another contemporaneous phenomenon in the labour market of several countries is the increasing diffusion of temporary contracts. From constituting only a small minority of jobs, they have become the main channel of entry into the labour markets of several southern European countries characterised by a strong duality. While these contracts have been introduced with the idea of providing flexible labour to employers and facilitating the occupational activation of ‘marginalised’ categories, their diffusion might have also contributed to a widening wage inequality and partly explains its recent increasing trend.The existence of a wage gap between temporary and permanent workers is predicted byeconomic theory. According toRosen (1986), temporary workers should receive higher wages as ‘compensation’ for their less favourable job conditions. However, most empirical research has found that temporary workers receive a wage penalty rather than a ‘wage premium’ (e.g.Blanchard, Landier, 2002,Boeri, 2011,Booth, Francesconi, Frank, 2002,Gebel, 2010,Kahn, 2016). According to these studies, the wage penalty reported by temporary workers may be due to their lower levels ofbargaining power, training and labour productivity, as well as expectations of conversion into a higher-paid permanent contract in the future.In this study, we aim to provide further insight on the role of temporary contracts in shaping wage inequality. Identifying the influence of temporary contracts on wage inequality is challenging, however, due to several confounding factors. First, the composition of workers hired into the two types of contracts is likely to differ due to more selective hiring processes for permanent jobs. Second, even if assignment in the two contracts was as good as random, selective attrition along the job spell is likely to modify the composition of the two groups in a different way. For example, we may expect the more highly skilled temporary workers may be ‘promoted’ to permanent jobs (Elia, 2010), which changes the skill composition of the two groups in favour of permanent jobs along the job spell. Both selections would bias the estimates in the direction oflower wagesfor temporary contracts.Our contribution to the literature is threefold. First, the previous literature relied on stock samples of workers, whose composition may be affected by dynamic sorting. To avoid this issue, we focus on an inflow sample of new hires and compare their gross daily wages at hiring.Second, while most of the previous literature has used survey data, we rely on administrative data due to the richer longitudinal dimension, larger sample size, and lower risk of misreporting. We draw a sample of more than 3 million new hires during the period of 2005–2015 from Italian administrative registries (LoSai INPS), which cover about 6.5% of employees in the salaried private sector. We focus on Italy as an interesting case study because the share of temporary workers out of the total number of employees substantially increased in recent decades, such that they represent the majority of new hires each year (67.6% in the fourth quarter of 2018,Ministry of Labor and Social Policies, 2019). By exploiting the rich panel structure of the data, we control for selection at hiring in the two contracts taking into account occupational history over the last 16 years, which importantly includes lagged wages and contracts. We implement a flexible inverse probability weighting estimator to estimate the averagetreatment effecton the treated (ATT), where the estimand of interest is the wage earned by individuals hired into permanent jobs, conditional on a similar employment history to those hired in temporary ones.Third, we gain further insight into the potential mechanisms by taking advantage of the large sample. First of all, since wage inequality is partially related to differences in terms of working hours among employees (Checchi, Garcia-Peñalosa, Vivian, 2018,Ciani, Torrini, 2019,Vaughan-Whitehead, Vazquez-Alvarez, 2018), we run estimates both for all hires and the ones in full-time jobs only. Moreover, we estimate the unconditional quantile treatment effect on the treated (QTT), as proposed by (Firpo, 2007), to determine whether wage inequality changes over the distribution. Finally, we estimate heterogeneous effects by individual characteristics (i.e. gender, age, and macro-region of residence), year of hiring, sector, and type of temporary contract. Indeed, differences in wage inequality are expected over different categories of individuals. For example, on the one hand, ‘marginalised’ categories such as female, young, and low-skilled workers may be negatively affected by temporary contracts given their lower bargaining power, unlike other workers who may receive a wage premium to accept a flexible contract. On the other hand, the intrinsic value of an open-ended contract may be higher for ‘marginalised’ individuals, who might be willing to work in a permanent job for a lower wage.The descriptive evidence is in line with previous empirical research showing a wage penalty for full-time temporary contracts. However, we reach different conclusions after controlling for positive selection into permanent contracts. We estimate an average premium at entry for temporary contracts of about 11.3 percentages points (pp). The differences are smaller for full-time jobs (9.5 pp), which indicates the presence of inequality in working hours in favour of temporary employment. However, in contrast with the previous literature, our evidence corroborates the theory of equalizing differences (Rosen, 1986), which states that an individual may prefer a temporary contract over an open-ended one only in the presence of a wage premium, due to the intrinsic value of permanent jobs. This interpretation is also supported by estimations on the quantiles and of heterogeneity, which show a larger premium for low-skilled workers, women, youths, and during the years of the economic crisis. The premium is therefore larger for categories of workers for whom this intrinsic value is probably higher. Results are robust to multiple sensitivity analyses, such as a placebo test on the lagged dependent variable (Imbens and Wooldridge, 2009) and the relatively large confounder that would be needed to invalidate our results (Rosenbaum, 2002). A second estimation approach based on a fixed-effect estimator exploiting the entry into different contracts by the same individuals also confirms an average premium for temporary contracts at hiring.The remainder of the paper is organised as follows.Section 2contains a review of studies focusing on wage inequality and temporary contracts.Section 3presents the institutional setting.Section 4describes the administrative data andsample selection. The descriptive evidence is presented inSection 5, whileSection 6explains the empirical strategy we use to estimate the wage gap between temporary and open-ended contracts.Section 7shows results of theeconometric analysis.

"1. IntroductionDeveloped countries usually provide some form of social protection to financially support young labor market entrants in case they do not directly find insurable employment. In most countries this consists in a means-tested welfare benefit, but in some others freshly educated youths are entitled to unemployment insurance (UI). Such a scheme is often accompanied by strong eligibility conditions to contain moral hazard costs. In Australia and New Zealand UI is provided immediately upon registration as job seeker, but imposes very strict job search requirements. In Belgium, Denmark and Luxembourg entitlement to UI is subject to less stringent job search obligations (Langenbucher, 2015), but is postponed by a waiting period.1In Sweden, until 2007 high school graduates were entitled to unemployment benefits (UB) only from age 20 onwards (von Buxhoeveden, 2019).In Belgium, the focus of our analysis, there is a one-year waiting period between the time that youths enter the job market and the moment they become eligible for UI benefits. This aims at keeping work incentives high in the school-to-work transition. As of 2015, the Belgian government unexpectedly scrapped the entitlement to these benefits for youths who start the waiting period at the age of 24 or older. With an average age of graduation from master programs slightly above 24 in Belgium, this decision affected in particular master's graduates. In this paper we empirically test whether this reform affected their work incentives within one year and a half following labor market entry. The way the reform has been implemented offers a unique natural experiment to study this question. The 24-year-old graduates who registered for the first time as unemployed job seekers in 2014 were informed by surprise in January 2015 that they were no longer entitled to UI at the end of their waiting period. By contrast, graduates aged 23 at first registration in 2014 remained entitled. This therefore naturally allows to evaluate the effects of the reform on employment outcomes in a difference-in-differences approach.Before 2015, UI for young labor market entrants in Belgium displayed an unusual inclining benefit profile. In such a setting, work incentives are maximal at the start of the zero-benefit waiting period. Later on, as one approaches the end of this period, standard job search theory (Mortensen, 1977andvan den Berg, 1990) predicts that homogeneous forward-looking agents progressively decrease search effort and increase their reservation wage. These behavioral reactions result in decreasing job finding rates, better job matches and higher earnings. The 2015 reform that completely abolishes the entitlement to this inclining profile is therefore expected to reverse these predictions. Relative to the counterfactual of nopolicy reform, job finding is expected to gradually increase and the quality of found jobs to decrease as the end of the waiting period is approached.There is ample empirical evidence that reducing the generosity of social benefits positively impacts job finding and that recipients anticipate by accelerating their transitions to employment well before benefits exhaust (see for a surveyTatsiramos and Van Ours, 2014, orSchmieder and von Wachter, 2016). There is, however, to the best of our knowledge, not any evidence on the impact on job finding of a change from an increasing profile of UI benefits to a flat rate (zero-level) benefit profile. Based on the arguments ofKolsrud et al. (2018), we may actually expect that such a change has only small positive effects on job finding rates. Dynamic sorting and negative duration dependence in job finding rates imply that youths who are sensitive to monetary incentives may already have left unemployment before the prospect of losing entitlement to UI starts to play a role on behavior. In the Belgian UI scheme for youth, no benefits are paid-out at the start, so that these incentives are very strong initially. Hence, the dynamic sorting will progress at a faster rate than in regular UI. To this can be added the predictions of the calibrated life-cycle model ofMichelacci and Ruffo (2015). They conclude that moral hazard is less an issue for youth than for prime aged workers because the young want to be employed anyway as to improve life-time career prospects.Researchers have not only studied the impact of UI generosity on job finding. There is also ample but mixed evidence about its effect on job quality.2Nekoei and Weber (2017)explain why it is so in the case of the impact of an extension of benefit duration. While an extension raises the reservation wage, the more selective acceptance behavior implies that individuals remain longer unemployed which in turn reduces job quality. This lower quality can be caused by the employers’ screening of job applicants based on unemployment duration (Kroft et al., 2013) or by a reduced selectivity of long-term unemployed as a consequence ofliquidity constraints(Chetty, 2008;Card et al., 2007). The reform analyzed in this paper may have a similar ambiguous effect on job quality. On the one hand, the prospect of not qualifying for UB is likely to induce many unemployed youths to become less selective in their job acceptance decision. On the other hand, the reform may also induce young graduates to find jobs earlier in the unemployment spell when higher quality jobs are available (Lindner and Reizer, 2019). The last channel requires, however, that the reform effectively induces youths to accelerate job finding early in the waiting period, which we do not expect given the length of this period. The first channel should therefore dominate and drive a negative effect of the reform on job quality.This is not the first study of the behavioral effects of waiting periods for UI or welfare benefits. However, the existing papers have focused on the effect of introducing such qualifying periods (Bolhaar et al., 2019) or extending their duration (Cockx and Van Belle, 2019). Other research has studied instead the effect on work incentives of receiving benefit payments after a period of no-pay status (Bargain and Doorley, 2011;von Buxhoeveden, 2019). In contrast to these studies, we contribute to the literature by analyzing the impact on work incentives of abolishing the entitlement to UI benefits when a waiting period is completed. As we will show in this study, the length of such period is an important determinant of employment responses to such a scheme.Our analysis uses administrative population data of all recent master's graduates who registered for the first time as unemployed job seeker at the regional Public Employment Services (PES) between 2011 and 2014. For privacy reasons we only have access to data grouped by age and period of registration. Since not all employment outcomes are measured in the same way across regions, the analysis is performed separately for the two main regions of Belgium: Flanders and Wallonia. Cumulative job finding rates are observed six, twelve and eighteen months after registration. The rates measured after six and twelve months are used to study the behavioral anticipation of the prospect of losing entitlement to UI, while the one measured after eighteen months allows to detect the (additional) ex-post effect of actually losing benefit eligibility. In Wallonia job finding includes jobs lasting as short as one day, while in Flanders a job transition is registered only to the extent it is still ongoing at the end of the month. To estimate the effect on short-lived jobs in this region, we therefore use an indicator of transitions to temporary help agency work (temp jobs for short) that theFlemishPES registers separately. Because there may be a trade-off between rapid job finding and lasting integration on the job market, our range of outcomes also includes the probability of being employed measured at the same time horizons as the job finding rate.The empirical results deliver two main messages. First, they provide clear evidence that the prospect of losing UI eligibility increases the transition to very short-lived jobs. In Flanders, in the absence of the policy reform, 9.0% (resp. 12.1%) of the 24-year-old master's graduates registered as job seekers would have found a temp job within 6 (resp. 12) months after registration. The policy reform caused a significant increase of this fraction by 3.3 (3.7) percentage points. Effects of a similar order of magnitude are estimated in Wallonia on cumulative transitions to employment lasting at least one day, although less precisely. There is, however, no evidence of an additional effect of the policy reform when the eligibility loss has become a tangible reality, i.e. one year and a half after registration. Second, when we consider the effects on transitions to more stable jobs (ongoing at the end of the month) and on employment probabilities, the impacts are at all moments of observation small and statistically not significantly different from zero. In sum, our findings suggest that the reform has only accelerated transitions to short-term labor contracts which did not serve as a stepping stone to stable employment.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.Section 2summarizes the institutional context, the policy reform and the natural experiment it entails.Section 3takes a first look at our dataset and provides the exact definition of the employment outcomes of interest.Section 4discusses the methodology andSection 5presents the results.Section 6ends with some concluding remarks.",Bart,Koen,Muriel
"1. IntroductionExclusion from the labor market is a serious risk factor for social exclusion and reduced well-being in many Western societies (see e.g.Clark, Oswald, 1994,Paul and Moser, 2009,Pohlan, 2019). Beyond the economic strain it puts on individuals, unemployment may incur substantial psychological and social costs that can even persist across generations (see e.g.Clark and Lepinteur, 2019). Compared to working individuals, especially the long-term unemployed1often suffer from a greater risk of depression, suicide,alcohol abuseand stigmatization that stresses self-esteem and personal relationships (see e.g.Frey and Stutzer, 2002). Even a generous social welfare system may not suffice to compensate for the negative consequences of job loss, because employment in itself has essential psychosocial functions including social purpose, status and identity (Jahoda, 1981). This raises the question, whetherlabor market policiescan act to improve the quality of life of the long-term unemployed.In this paper, we use a recent Germanjob creationscheme (JCS) to analyze whether subsidized employment improves thesocial integrationand well-being of unemployed individuals with severe employment impediments. In contrast to previous JCSs, the federalpilotproject ’Social Integration within the Labor Market’ (SILM,Soziale Teilhabe am Arbeitsmarkt) explicitly aimed at promoting social integration rather than re-employment prospects.Instead of providing subsidized employment opportunities, policy could also foster re-integration into the labor market, for example by job search incentives or training programs. These may be effective for relatively healthy and skilled individuals, but may fail for the long-term unemployed. One reason is that employers often interpret long unemployment durations as a negative signal (see e.g.Bhuller, Brinch, Königs, 2017,Kroft et al., 2013). Alternatively, the barriers to early retirement or disability pension could be lowered, as many long-term unemployed are of advanced age or face health problems. Retirement can have a greater identity value than unemployment (Hetschko et al., 2014), but incentivizing work-capable individuals to leave the active labor force may come at great fiscal cost (seeAutor et al., 2016,Autor and Duggan, 2006). Hence, the government may directly provide subsidized job opportunities to long-term unemployed individuals.By now, a comprehensive program evaluation literature has established that JCSs, in general, have either insignificant or negative employment effects for participants (see e.g. the meta-analyses ofKluve, 2010andCard et al., 2018and the review for German employment subsidies byWolff and Stephan, 2013). Primarily, this is due to so-called ‘lock-in’ effects which reflect reduced job search efforts during participation (see e.g.Bergemann, Pohlan, Uhlendorff, 2017,Huber et al., 2011b,Hujer, Thomsen, 2010,van Ours, 2004). However, there is also some evidence that long-term unemployed and hard-to-place individuals do benefit from participation (see e.g.Caliendo et al., 2008,Hohmeyer and Wolff, 2012). Lock-in effects might be less important for these individuals, because they are less likely to find a job in the counterfactual of no program participation. At the same time, they are also particularly exposed to the above mentioned psychosocial costs of unemployment (Paul and Moser, 2009).Yet, few studies have explicitly investigated whether subsidized employment may improve measures of well-being and social integration; and the evidence is mixed.Crost (2016)shows that, between 1992 and 2004, German JCSs improved thelife satisfactionof participants. In a similar vein,Knabe et al. (2017)use cross-sectional data to show that participation in a more recent German job creation program, ‘One-Euro-Jobs’, is associated with increased life satisfaction. Usingfixed effectsregressions,Wulfgramm (2011)provides some evidence that One-Euro-Jobs can partially counteract the negative effects of unemployment on life satisfaction.Gundert und Hohendanner (2015)find that this program does not generally improve social belonging.Huber et al. (2011a)estimate slightly negative effects of welfare-to-work programs on mental health in Germany.2We contribute to this emerging strand of the program evaluation literature in several ways. First, we focus on long-term unemployed individuals with employment impediments; a group that is expected to be most responsive to both the harms of unemployment and the potential benefits of subsidized employment. Although the target group of SILM amounts to about 670 thousand individuals in Germany,3sample sizes in large scale surveys like the SOEP are typically too small to conduct meaningful analyses. Therefore, we use a novel and unusually rich dataset which links social security data with a panel survey of program participants and control individuals (seeBrussig et al., 2019).This dataset allows us to study the interplay of both employment outcomes and subjective measures of quality of life. While the effect of program participation might be negative on employment, it may still improve well-being and social integration. It is possible, however, that the participants would have achieved similar subjective outcomes without participating in SILM, e.g. through non-subsidized employment. We therefore closely examine how much of the average effect on well-being and social integration can be attributed to changes in the employment share within the treatment and control group.To grasp the multidimensional nature of individual quality of life, we use four different subjective indicators and study precisely which of these aspects are most affected. Life satisfaction can be viewed as a proxy for individual utility or a summary measure for quality of life (Frey and Stutzer, 2002). Mental health problems might be a typical side effect of unemployment (Paul and Moser, 2009) and may be reduced by participation in SILM. Our measures of social integration – social belonging and social status – reflect the subjective perception of an individual’s role and position in society. Subsidized employment might positively affect perceived status and identity compared to the state of unemployment (Stutzer and Lalive, 2004). However, knowing the program is only temporary and targets disadvantaged individuals could dampen this effect.We apply nearest-neighborpropensity score matchingto estimate the averagetreatment effecton the treated (ATT) for three different survey waves that roughly correspond to a period of 7, 18 and 29 months since individual program entry. Our findings suggest that participation significantly improves well-being and social integration, but to varying degrees for the four outcome measures. While life satisfaction strongly increases, social status improves only moderately. Furthermore, the ATTs substantially decrease over the course of the program. Using the administrative data, these results are linked to the estimated employment effects. First, we document considerable lock-in effects during participation. Moreover, we explore compositional changes in the treatment and control group: over the course of the program, an increasing share of control individuals enter non-subsidized employment, while a growing share of participants leave SILM. These shifts can completely explain the decrease in the ATTs on well-being and social integration over time. To estimate the short-term post-program effects, we are limited to individuals with an early planned end date. For them, the effects on both employment and subjective outcomes vanish upon leaving the program. Finally, heterogeneity analysis reveals that individuals with an above-average duration of welfare dependence and those with health impairments benefit more from participation.The rest of the paper is structured as follows:Section 2gives an overview of the program’s implementation and its design.Section 3describes the data sources.Section 4explains how we link administrative and survey data and construct the final estimation sample.Section 5describes the identification strategy and potential threats.Section 6presents the results of the main analysis, along with robustness checks and a heterogeneity analysis.Section 7concludes.",Boris,Friedhelm,Laura
"1. IntroductionDeclining femalelabor force participation(FLFP) in India is a policy concern as it can impede the country's growth potential. Between 2005 and 2012, 19.6 million women left the labor force, and FLFP declined from 42.6% to 31% (Andres et al., 2017). Inclusive growth is important aswomen's employmentand income can increase theirbargaining powerand havespillover effectson their children's well-being (Duflo, 2003;Qian, 2008). Apart from structural features of the economy,1social norms about appropriateness of women engaging in market work are an important constraint to low levels of FLFP.2Jayachandran (2015)identifies role models as a policy approach to show what is feasible for women to attain and influence social norms on gender attitudes. Female politicians, as public role models, can affect FLFP through policy measures and changes in women's aspirations and social norms (Beaman et al., 2012).Previous research has shown that women's political representation results in policies and welfare effects favorable to women and children,3but there is limited evidence of the labor market consequences of electing women. To address this gap, this paper uses the National Sample Survey (NSS) 2011–2012 to study whether exposure to female politicians during young adulthood affect women's labor market outcomes later in life. I exploit district-level variation in exposure to female politicians in state legislatures, at ages 15–24 across cohorts from 1980–2007, to assess the impact on women's choice of economic activity. I find that exposure at ages 18–20 leads to a large increase in the probability of women working in wage employment as an adult, with limited effect on self-employment orcasual work. Specifically, a 10 percentage point increase in female politicians, equivalent to an additional politician in the median district, results in a 2.5 percentage point increase in wage employment corresponding to an increase of 42%.Causal identification of the effect of elected female politicians requires addressing the endogeneity of electoral preferences, which can be correlated with both FLFP and female political representation. To overcome endogeneity bias, I use aninstrumental variablederived from a fuzzy regression discontinuity. I follow the estimation strategy ofClots-Figueras (2012)andBhalotra and Clots-Figueras (2014)and use the fraction of seats won by women in close elections against male candidates, as an instrument for the fraction of seats won by women in a district. The identifying assumption is that the gender identity of the winner in close mixed-gender elections is quasi-random and does not indicate a clear electoral preference for women.Existing evidence on labor market outcomes shows that female politicians in reserved seats at local levels of government in India, where a constitutional amendment in 1993 introduced quotas for women in village councils, increased household-based women-owned establishments in the informalmanufacturing sector(Ghani et al., 2014), self-employment in farming (Deininger et al., 2012), and allocation of work to women inpublic works programs(Bose and Das, 2018;Ghani et al., 2019) with no effect on wage employment. Implementation of the quotas has been linked to an increase in young women's education and occupation aspirations (Beaman et al., 2012), improved perception of women in leadership roles and weakening of gender stereotypes (Beaman et al., 2009), changes in gender-discriminatory behavior (Kalsi, 2017), and provision of public goods favorable to women (Chattopadhyay and Duflo, 2004), all of which can stimulate women's workforce participation.In contrast to these earlier studies, a distinguishing feature of this paper is to focus on exposure at a critical, formative period of young adulthood when norms, aspirations, and expectations are shaped, and important decisions regarding transitioning into higher levels ofeducation and employmentare made. Second, I examine the role of women elected to state legislatures.4The role and background of politicians vary considerably at these two levels of government with implications for the pathways of their policy influence5and the type of constituents that find them to be relevant role models. There are also limitations to generalizing the effect of quotas,6as it can change political competition through changes in candidate quality and voter preferences (Bhalotra and Clots-Figueras, 2014;Clots-Figueras, 2012).I examine and discuss two pathways that could affectwomen's wageemployment, namely a role model or policy channel, recognizing that multiple channels could be at work simultaneously. Role models can change the reference point of prevailing norms (Ray, 2006) and revise individual aspirations and expectations, which can, in turn, affect economic outcomes (Akerlof and Kranton, 2000). Research from social psychology shows that individuals are impressionable to perception change during late adolescence and early adulthood (Krosnick and Alwin, 1989). In line with this interpretation, I find that the effect on later life employment is linked to exposure during young adulthood and not explained by contemporaneous exposure. The results are driven by areas with less entrenched gender bias underlining the importance of a broader enabling environment for this role model effect to manifest.Plausible policy roles include direct creation of employment opportunities and the provision of public goods. The effects are not due to opportunities in the public sector; rather, the results are driven by private sector employment. In fact, women are more likely to select into service, sales, and clerical occupations that are less socially stigmatized and require completion ofsecondary education. Consistent with this, I find that having a female politician in power in the years prior to starting higher secondary school increases the probability of women, but not men, completing this level of education. More broadly, female politicians could provide policy support that is beneficial for men and women alike since I also find an increase in men's workforce participation, including labor re-allocation from casual work to self-employment.This paper shows that in addition to directly influencing women's participation and entry into politics in India (Bhalotra et al., 2018;Brown et al., 2018), female politicians in state legislatures can also affect broader labor market outcomes for women through dual channels of a policy and a role model effect. In addition to documenting substantial economic spillovers of women's representation in politics, the paper also identifies critical periods of young adulthood when such exposure can have a long-lasting impact on bolstering women's economic advancement.The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.Section 2discusses the institutional context;Section 3describes the data;Section 4describes the empirical strategy;Section 5presents the main results and robustness checks;Section 6discusses mechanisms, andSection 7concludes.",Sadia,None,None
"1. IntroductionDespite overall convergence over the past decades, substantial differences between men and women in educational and labor market outcomes remain. For example, while the gender gap in college enrollment andgraduationhas reversed (Goldin et al., 2006), women are still less likely than men to enter more competitive and more rewarding MBA and STEM programs (Buser, Niederle, Oosterbeek, 2014,Jurajda, Münich, 2011). In addition, there still is a significant gender pay gap (Blau, Kahn, 2017,Petrongolo, 2019). Women are in particular heavily underrepresented in high earning jobs at the top of the corporate ladder (Cook, Glass, 2014,Fortin, Bell, Böhm, 2017). In US Fortune 500 companies, for example, only around one out of five board seats is held by a woman (Deloitte, 2019). Likewise, in the largest publicly listed companies in the European Union, about one quarter of the board members is female (European Commission, 2018). To narrow this gap, several countries (e.g. Norway, France, Germany, Italy) have introduced gender quotas on corporate boards (Bertrand et al., 2018).An explanation for the pervasivegender differencesin educational choice and labour market outcomes can be found in (innate) differences between men and women in their willingness to compete (Buser, Niederle, Oosterbeek, 2014,Kamas, Preston, 2018,Reuben, Wiswall, Zafar, 2017).1A large body of experimental evidence indeed confirms that men are more competitive than women. In their seminal paper,Niederle and Vesterlund (2007)find that men opt more than twice as often as women for a competitive tournament as their preferred compensation scheme for a series of stylized, homogeneous tasks. Their experiment has been replicated many times (Azmat, Petrongolo, 2014,Niederle, Vesterlund, 2011). However, in the recent literature a more nuanced picture emerges, where one of the organizing principles seems to be that the gender differences in competitiveness depend on the nature of the task at hand.2Men prefer competitive reward schemes more often than women for arithmetic, ball-tossing, and maze-solving tasks (Almås, Cappelen, Salvanes, Sørensen, Tungodden, 2015,Balafoutas, Sutter, 2012,Booth, Nolen, 2012,Buser, Niederle, Oosterbeek, 2014,Healy, Pate, 2011,Niederle, Segal, Vesterlund, 2013,Saccardo, Pietrasz, Gneezy, 2017), while the gender gap is often not found, or sometimes even reversed, for verbal tasks (e.g.Dreber, von Essen, Ranehill, 2014,Große, Riener,Günther, Ekinci, Schwieren, Strobel, 2010,Shurchkov, 2012). In other words, men seem to compete more often in stereotypical male tasks, whereas women are at least equally competitive in stereotypical female tasks.In this paper, we study the impact of two other task dimensions on the gender gap in reward scheme choices. First, we test whether the gender gap extends beyond the lab by looking at a real-life educational setting. The typical lab experiment involves relatively simple gaming tasks, such as completing a basic arithmetic problem, solving a maze, or tossing a ball in a bucket.3It is not obvious that the finding from the lab — that men have a stronger preference for competitive reward schemes than women — can be replicated in the field with tasks that are familiar to the subjects and part of their daily lives. A growing body of research on confidence indicates that the familiarity with a task and the familiarity with the peers allow people to base their decisions on a more accurate prior of their relative standing in a group (Alicke, Klotz, Breitenbecher, Yurak, Vredenburg, 1995,Benoît, Dubra, 2011,Lavy, 2013,Perloff, Fetzer, 1986). In the lab, where tasks and competitors are unfamiliar, subjects may be overconfident. If this applies mainly to men, the gender gap in competitiveness is likely to be smaller in the field than in the lab.Second, we examine whether the gender gap in competitiveness depends on the difficulty of the task at hand. As a large body of confidence research shows that task difficulty influences people’s perception of their own task performance and their relative performance in comparison to others in particular (Benoît, Dubra, Moore, 2015,Kruger, 1999,Moore, Cain, 2007,Windschitl, Kruger, Simms, 2003), task difficulty is likely to have an impact on the willingness to join a competition. Because self-assessments (How good am I?) have been shown to have a greater impact than other-assessments (How good are others?) (Kruger, 1999), people tend to overestimate their relative performance in easy tasks and underestimate their relative performance in difficult tasks (Hoelzl and Rustichini, 2005). We therefore expect that the preference for a competitive reward scheme diminishes in the difficulty of the underlying task.However, men and women may not respond equally to variations in task difficulty. This follows from another group of confidence studies (Buser, 2016,Mobius, Niederle, Niehaus, Rosenblat,Roberts, Nolen-Hoeksema, 1989) suggesting that men and women differ in the extent to which they place weight on different self-assessment criteria. While men place more weight on their self-assessed performance in an ongoing task, women tend to be more conservative in their belief updating and rather rely on (external) assessments of their past performance in similar tasks. This leads to the prediction that men are more likely to overestimate their relative performance in an easy task and underestimate their performance in a difficult task, implying that the negative impact of an increase in task difficulty on the willingness to compete is stronger for men.We provide evidence from three framed field experiments (Harrison and List, 2004), which we conducted during the final exams of a compulsory course in an undergraduate business and economics program between 2015 and 2017. In these experiments, we confronted students (in total 681) with a set of bonus questions and the choice to earn grade points for these questions either according to an absolute grading scheme, that is, the equivalent of a piece rate scheme, or according to a tournament scheme. To test the role of task difficulty, we varied the level of the bonus questions between treatments. In particular, in Experiment 1 (the 2015 cohort) we provided a set of relatively easy bonus questions. The difficulty of the questions was significantly increased in Experiment 2 (the 2016 cohort). Finally, in Experiment 3 (the 2017 cohort) we randomly allocated students from the same cohort to the easy and difficult questions.Our findings largely confirm our hypotheses. Consistent with most of the literature on confidence, we find that the students are more likely to shy away from competition under the difficult-task treatments. Furthermore, in the easy-task treatments, men chose the tournament compensation scheme significantly more often than women. In contrast, in the difficult-task treatments the gender difference was small and insignificant. Hence, the result from the lab that men are more likely to opt for a competitive reward scheme has been replicated in our exam setting, but only under the condition that the task was relatively easy. Task difficulty significantly diminished the tournament-entry choices of everyone so that, on average, students were overconfident about their performance in the easy-task treatments: there is no evidence of overconfidence in the difficult-task treatments. Most importantly, men were more affected by the increased difficulty of the questions so that men and women appeared almost equally confident in the difficult-task treatments.Our study contributes to the literature on gender differences in two important ways. First, it is one of a few experimental studies to explore gender differences in the willingness to compete in a real-life setting. There is a large body of evidence from the field that investigates a related hypothesis, namely that women perform worse than men under competitive pressures (Czibor, Onderstal, Sloof, Van Praag,De Paola, Gioia, Scoppa, 2015,Iriberri, Rey-Biel, 2019,Jurajda, Münich, 2011,Ors, Palomino, Peyrache, 2013,Pekkarinen, 2015).4However, these studies focus on the gender gap in performance under competition rather than on the gender gap in the willingness to compete.Flory et al. (2014)andSamek (2019)are two noteworthy exceptions. They test for gender differences in the willingness to compete in a labor market setting and find that women are significantly less likely to apply for jobs with a more competitive compensation regime. In contrast, we test for gender differences in competitiveness in an exam setting.5While the exam setting was also used by a number of field studies in the confidence literature (Bengtsson, Persson, Willenhag, 2005,Dahlbom, Jakobsson, Jakobsson, Kotsadam, 2011,Jakobsson, 2012,Nekby, Skogman Thoursie, Vahtrik, 2015), the focus of these studies is only on students’ confidence about their own performance and not on their confidence about their relative performance which is key to the concept of competitiveness.6A second contribution of our study is that, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first to investigate whether the gender gap in the willingness to compete depends on the difficulty of a task at hand. However, a small number of studies have examined related questions. In a series of experiments,Windschitl et al. (2003)investigated the moderating impact of task difficulty (shared adversities or shared benefits in their treatments) on subjects’ confidence about their relative task performance. Yet, their focus is on the self-assessed performance in an arranged competition. The impact of task difficulty on subjects' degree of confidence in their skill relative to others is the subject of the lab experiment byHoelzl and Rustichini (2005), but the authors do not study gender differences. Finally,Gneezy et al. (2003)let the participants in one of their experiments choose the difficulty level from a menu of tasks and show that men prefer, on average, more difficult tasks in return for a higher piece-rate reward. Nevertheless, their findings do not imply that men more often than women prefer a more competitive environment when the difficulty of a task increases.7The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:Section 2discusses our experimental design and Section presents3the results.Section 4summarizes and discusses potential practical implications of our study.",Britta,Thomas,Linda
"1. IntroductionIt is now broadly recognized that non-cognitive skills are key determinants of adult outcomes. Over the last 15 years, several studies have shown that they are as important as cognitive skills in determining a variety of outcomes, including educational attainment, labour market outcomes, crime rates, and health outcomes (Cobb-Clark, Tan, 2011,Conti, Heckman, Urzua, 2010,Fletcher, 2013,Heckman, Stixrud, Urzua, 2006,Lindqvist, Vestman, 2011,Nyhus, Pons, 2005). A recent study byDeming (2017)showed that the returns of non-cognitive skills in the labour market are even greater for newer cohorts.Childhood is generally considered to be a critical period in the acquisition of non-cognitive skills. Due to complementarities across periods, high levels of skills early in childhood lead to greater productivity of investments later in childhood (Cunha and Heckman, 2007). While the literature has extensively explored the childhood determinants of cognitive skills, comparatively little is known about the determinants of the formation of non-cognitive skills. We already know that the latter are influenced by maternal time (Del Bono et al., 2016), parenting style (Fiorini and Keane, 2014), maternal education (Carneiro et al., 2013), and family income (Fletcher and Wolfe, 2016).Björklund and Jäntti (2012)andGrönqvist et al. (2017)found evidence supporting the existence of an intergenerational transmission of non-cognitive skills, whileBlack et al. (2017)showed that birth order predicts socio-emotional skills andoccupational choices.We complement these studies by asking whether family size influences the formation of children’s socio-emotional skills. The popular quantity–quality model (Becker, 1960,Becker, Lewis, 1973,Becker, Tomes, 1976) and resource-dilution theory are often used in the literature to explain the negative correlation between family size and individual’s outcomes (Björklund and Salvanes, 2011). However, the number of studies rejecting a quantity–quality trade-off regarding the formation of cognitive skills based on quasi-experimental variations is growing (Angrist, Lavy, Schlosser, 2010,Angrist, Lavy, Schlosser, 2010,Aslund, Grönqvist, 2010,Black, Devereux, Salvanes, 2005,Black, Devereux, Salvanes, 2010,Cáceras-Delpiano, 2006).Black et al. (2010)found a negative effect of an increase in family size instrumented by twin birth, whileAslund and Grönqvist (2010)found a small negative impact on children’s grades in compulsory and secondary school, but only for vulnerable children, as defined by low parental education, large sibships, and high birth order.Here, we investigate whether an increase in family size has a negative impact on the accumulation of non-cognitive skills, as predicted by the Beckerian quantity–quality model and resource-dilution theory. The net effect of an increase in family size is ambiguous because we may also expect social interactions between siblings to affect the acquisition of non-cognitive skills. An extensive literature in psychology demonstrates that sibling relationships can, depending on the context, lead to either moreaggressive behaviours(Slomkowski, Rende, Conger, Simons, Conger, 2001,Stauffacher, DeHart, 2006) or warmer attitudes that foster the development ofsocial skills(Stormshak, Bellanti, Bierman, 1996,Volling, Belsky, 1992).We empirically address this question by using a longitudinal dataset of children born in the UK in 2000–2001, namely the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) by the Centre forLongitudinal Studiesat the University of London, to study the effect of an increase in family size on the formation of socio-emotional skills. The main identification challenge is that fertility decisions are unlikely to be randomly distributed across families. Indeed, these decisions depend on both observable and unobservable family characteristics, such as parents’ socio-economic status, theirlife satisfaction, their own non-cognitive skills, and their parenting style, that are likely to be correlated with the formation of socio-emotional skills during childhood. To account for the endogeneity of fertility decisions, we use a well-known instrumental approach developed byAngrist and Evans (1998), which exploits the fact that parents whose first two children are of the same sex are more likely to have an additional child than parents whose children are of opposite sex. Contrary to most of the studies using this instrumental approach, we are able to follow children over time and observe how they behavebeforeandafteran increase in family size. The richness of this cohort study data enables us to confirm that there are no pre-existing differences between children from families whose first two children are of the same sex and children from families whose first two children are of opposite sex. Finally, we provide evidence that there is no parental preference for one gender as regards fertility decisions in our data.Using the parental preferences for child sex variety as a natural source of variation in fertility decisions, we show that the birth of a third child negatively affects the formation of socio-emotional skills for both the first- and the second-born. In particular, we find that this effect is stronger if the birth occurs when the children are young (under six years old). More surprisingly, we find no effect of the birth of a third child for boys: The negative effect of the birth of a third child is entirely driven by girls. Investigating the potential mechanisms at play, we provide evidence that this differential effect across gender is partly driven by an unequal response of parents’ time investment in favour of boys and, to a lesser extent, to an increase in the demand for household chores for girls. We also show that the negative effects of family size persist even 11 years after the event.To the best of our knowledge, only two previous studies are similar to ours. Using different methods and, respectively, UK and US data,Silles (2010)andJuhn et al. (2015)found negative associations between family size and the development of non-cognitive skills of children, as measured by the British Social Adjustment Guide and the Rutter B scale in the former, and by the National Longitudinal Study of Youth’s Behavior Problem Index in the latter. Our paper contributes to the literature in several key aspects. First, we make use of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), a well-established measure in psychology, to study the impact of an increase in family size not only on behavioural and emotional skills but also on pro-social behaviour. As shown inLayard et al. (2014)andClark and Lepinteur (2019), behavioural and emotional skills have different influences on future adult outcomes (e.g., unemployment experience, educational attainment, well-being). Second, we use aninstrumental variablesapproach to estimate the causal impact of family size on the different dimensions of the SDQ and provide a thorough examination of the potential sources of heterogeneity and channels. More specifically, we are the first to show that there is a family-size penalty for girls regarding the development of behavioural, emotional and pro-social skills. We explain this penalty by exploring channels already investigated inJuhn et al. (2015), that is, parental investment, but we also provide evidence of a new channel: As family size increases, girls tend to be more likely than boys to perform household chores.Silles (2010)andJuhn et al. (2015), respectively, rely on generations born in 1958 and at the end of the 1980s. We provide evidence for a much younger cohort, the MCS cohort, born in 2000–2001, for whom the acquisition of non-cognitive skills is of higher importance than previous generations (Deming, 2017).The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.Section 2describes the dataset and the main measure of socio-emotional skills exploited in this paper.Section 3presents our instrumental approach and provides evidence on the validity of the identifying assumption.Section 4shows the effect of an increase in family size on children’s non-cognitive skills, andSection 5concludes.",Simon,Hélène,Anthony
"1. IntroductionOver the last six decades, there has been a remarkable decline in the totalfertility rate, which decreased by almost 50%; nearly half of the world’s countries now have below replacement rate fertility rates (Murray et al., 2018). At the same time, the “quantity-quality” trade-off should imply that the change in the number of children families are having is likely to be accompanied by changes in parental investments and hence quality of children. In this context, understanding if and what policies affect fertility, and how they also impact child outcomes is not only of academic interest, but also highly policy relevant.Subsidizing childbearing to encourage fertility has long been a policy objective in numerous (developed) countries; as such, parental leave benefits, in the form of entitlements to leave with job protection and most often income compensation, after the birth of children, have become a salient part of family policies. AllOECDcountries with the exception of the US implement government funded policies granting paid leave for employed parents; however, the design of these benefits differs significantly across countries in terms of income replacement rates and the lengths of protected leave and/or duration of benefit receipt. There has also been a shift towards more generous policies, with average duration of the leave in OECD countries increasing from 14 weeks in 1980 to 53 in 2018.2But despite their wide implementation, there is still relatively scarce evidence of the effects of parental leave policies on fertility, and particularly the effects of their financial component, mostly due to difficulties in finding exogenous changes in the opportunity cost of children, but also due to the fact that changes in these policies are typically small and gradual. Parental leave benefits were initially available only to mothers, hence being referred to as “maternity leave benefits”; although nowadays they are (in most countries) available to both parents, mothers still take a significantly larger share of the available protected leave after the birth of children.In this paper, I exploit an unexpected and significant change in the maternity leave policy in Romania to investigate the effects of (large) changes in the financial incentives component of maternity leave benefits on fertility and early life child outcomes. An important contribution of this analysis is that in addition to the effect on live births, I investigate the effects on conceptions and abortions, which are not observed in register data. For the early life child outcomes, I investigate the effects on maternal prenatal behaviors, health outcomes at the birth of the child and early investments in child’s human capital. The policy change used for identification was announced in 2003 and implemented in 2004 in Romania, and radically changed the way in which parental leave benefits, at the time available only to mothers, were awarded. Prior to the policy change, maternity leave benefits were awarded proportional to the mother’s pre-birth earnings. The monthly benefit amounted to 85% of the taxable average earnings over the 6 months preceding childbirth, and was awarded for a maximum of two years. After a radical and unexpected policy change, the benefits requested after January 1, 2004 were awarded as a fixed sum equal to 85% of the national averagesalaryof both men and women. Because of a very large gender gap in wages, calculating the fixed maternity leave benefits in reference to the national average salary meant that more than 80% of employed women would potentially gain from the reform; moreover, the potential increase in nominal terms was very large, the fixed benefit being one third higher than the average (potential) proportional benefit in the previous regime, with much larger increases for lowearning women. Benefits requested prior to that date were unaffected and continued to be calculated proportional to each mother’s pre-birth earnings. The policy change also entailed an increase in the requiredtaxcontribution period (work requirement), from 6 to 10 months prior to the birth of the child. This policy change significantly altered the opportunity cost of childbearing for employed mothers, but did not affect out of the labor force women, as they were not entitled to receive this type of benefit.The Becker model of fertility (Becker, 1991) predicts that the relative increase (decrease) in maternity leave benefits will lead to higher (lower) fertility levels, but also to a decreased (increased) quality of children. Quality of children is influenced by prenatal investments, child health at birth and early investments in infant health. However, in addition to the price effect, the change in maternity leave benefits also induces an income effect, which may affect investments in the quality of children in the opposite direction, leading to an ambiguous net effect on the quality of children. This paper aims to bring empirical evidence of the short term effects of maternity leave benefits on the quantity and quality of children, in a reduced form; however, due to the nature of the data, it cannot speak of whether the fertility effects are quantum or tempo effects.The analysis uses the 2004 wave of the Romanian Reproductive Health Survey (RHS-Ro), which includes detailed information about all pregnancies, irrespective of how they ended, and multiple health outcomes for the youngest child, for each woman in the representative sample. The primary strategy to identify the effects of the policy change announcement is a difference-in-differences design that exploits the fact that only employed women were affected by the policy change, and uses housewives (out of the labor force women) as a control group, as they were, theoretically, unaffected by the policy. I compare the pregnancies occurring in between March and June 2003, thus potentially affected by the policy change and compare them to pregnancies conceived in the same months of the previous 3 years. The findings indicate that in the post policy change announcement period, employed women had small and insignificant increases in conception rates, but very large and significant decreases in abortion probabilities relative to housewife women, suggesting that abortion is the relevant margin of changing fertility in Romania. As a consequence, the number of live births also increased significantly post announcement. The effect is driven by women from less well-off households, who most likely benefited from the policy change, with women from richer households having, if anything, an opposite behavior. The effects on early life child outcomes are small and mostly insignificant, suggesting that mothers do not immediately adjust their investment behavior as a consequence of changed financial incentives.This paper speaks to the literature on the relationship between financial incentives and fertility, its main contribution being the comprehensive analysis of reproductive behavior and early investments in child health as a response to changes in financial incentives. Due to the nature of the Romanian Reproductive Health Survey, I am able explore the entire spectrum of individual level decisions related to fertility: occurrence of pregnancy (conception), decision to carry the pregnancy to term, and several important outcomes conditional on live birth, such as maternal behavior during pregnancy, child health at birth and early investments in child health, whereas previous studies analyze outcomes conditional on pregnancies being carried to term3, and in very few cases aggregate number of abortions4. Analyzing the effects on the probability of abortion is especially relevant and interesting in the Romanian context since abortion rates have been, historically, among the highest in Europe after their (re)liberalization in 1990. The abortion rate in Romania in 2002 was of 1174 abortions per 1000 live births, relative to an European average of 274 abortions per 1000 live births (source: World Health Organization), and abortions were regarded as a contraception method. In this setting, it is very important to understand if financial incentives can influence this aspect of reproductive behavior.Secondly, the Romanianpolicy reformmodified only the level of the financial benefits attached to childbirth for employed mothers, and not the length of time for which they were awarded.5Other policies previously used for identification entailed a change in both the financial benefits and the length of time of protected employment, making it more difficult to disentangle the effects attributable to monetary incentives.6This paper investigates the exclusive role of pecuniary incentives in determining fertility and early investments in child health. Finally, the policy change exploited in this paper affected a very large share of the population,by a large margin and applied to births of any rank, which increases the external validity of the findings.The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows.Section 2briefly discusses the theoretical considerations and presents related work.Section 3presents the details of the Romanian policy reform affecting the maternity leave benefits.Section 4describes the Romanian Reproductive Health Survey and the identification strategy.Section 5presents the main results, andSection 6discusses robustness checks that include different specifications and extending the period of analysis, and presents two alternative identification strategies.Section 7concludes.",Simona,None,None
"1. IntroductionSocial interaction affects our beliefs and behaviors, constituting the ‘exposure effect’ in shaping child development. In theliterature of economics, parents and peers have been identified as two indisputable sources. In the context ofsocial networkwhere individuals are directly or indirectly connected, peers’ parents can also affect the early-life experience of an individual. Compared to the vast literature on parental influence andpeer effect, the relationship between peers’ parents and their social influences is relatively understudied.The influence of peers’ parents can be non-negligible for a number of reasons. One mechanism is that children learn from their parents to behave in certain ways and affect their peers. Peers’ contemporaneousspilloversuch asacademic performance, which is the primary focus of the peer effect literature, shall be considered a close counterpart of this channel. Parents are also the active actors behindschool policiesthat benefit or harm the peers of their children (Walsh, 2008). Other possibilities involve direct interaction or the spread of information among social ties (Eble, Hu, 2019,Granovetter, 1973,Olivetti, Patacchini, Zenou, 2018). Whereas most of the attention in appliedsocial network analysisis on the spillover among peers, this paper shows that the parent of one’s peer is another source of social influences.To measure the influence of peers’ parents, I investigate the extent to which average college attainment of peers’ parents is related to a child’s future college attainment. I analyze the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (AddHealth) dataset which covers a nationally representative sample of high-school students in the US. In addition to standarddemographiccharacteristics, the AddHealth dataset contains the detail of friendship networks in a school and the educational background of parents. The estimates from a baseline binary choice model reveal that the college attainment of peers’ parents does influence a child’s future college attainment. Moreover, the mechanisms are based on the gender of both peers’ parents and the child. Whereas the inclusion of peers’ observed characteristics (including academic performance), neighborhood characteristics, and networkfixed effectsnegate the effect of peers’ parents of the opposite gender, the spillover from peers’ parents of the same gender remains robust. The magnitude of the same gender spillover is smaller compared to the influence of stronger social ties. For example, the spillover of peers’ paternal education on boys is one-third of the effect of having a father who is a college graduate, whereas the spillover of peers’ maternal education on girls is one-sixth of the effect of having a mother who is a college graduate.To obtain a causal interpretation, an ideal setting is to randomly assign peers of different family background and observe their interaction with peers’ parents. However, in an observational study where friendships were formed naturally, one might worry that non-random sorting among students is a confounding factor. The inclusion of network fixed effects in the baseline model is not sufficient because there may still be within-school unobserved heterogeneity related to both the college outcome and friendship decision, which resembles the omitted variable bias. Therefore, I adopt two distinct approaches. The first strategy involves a selection-corrected model in the spirit of the Heckman two-step procedure (Heckman, 1976,Heckman, 1979,Hsieh, Lee, 2016). I simultaneously estimate network formation and college outcome equation, taking into account friendship sorting based on similarities in unobserved characteristics.1This structural approach addresses a common type of friendship sorting called ‘homophily’. For example, smarter students tend to study together. However, there exist other types of formation process.2To impose less assumptions on the friendship formation process, my second strategy follows a commonly used approach in the peer effect literature to exploit plausibly idiosyncratic variations in parental composition of each cohort (Bifulco, Fletcher, Ross, 2011,Hoxby, 2000,Olivetti, Patacchini, Zenou, 2018). This strategy regards all grade-mates as peers, as opposed to actual links, and makes use of quasi-random peer group formations. In both approaches, I do find a similar gender-specific pattern for students from a lower-educated family.I arrive to the same conclusion as the recent finding byFruehwirth and Gagete-Miranda (2019): the inclusion of peers’ academic performance, which is conventionally regarded as the ‘peer effect’, does not fully explain the spillover of peers’ parents.3The gender-specific pattern further complicates the explanations behind the residual influence.Olivetti et al. (2018), who also analyze the AddHealth dataset, provided a clue. They find that the work decision of peers’ mothers generates as a role model effect and affects the futurelabor force participationof a girl. I therefore posit a similar logic about my current finding: there exists a role model effect from peers’ parents on humancapital acquisition. There are several pieces of supporting evidence. First, the same-gender spillover is only significant when neither or only one of the parents graduated from college. Second, students whose father is absent also experience significant spillover from peers’ fathers.4The estimate is particularly strong for girls. Third, the magnitude of the same gender spillover on males is stronger when one’s own father is less caring. Changing from having the least caring to the most caring father completely offsets the same gender spillover from peers’ fathers on males. As in the literature, young people look up to outside adult figures when they lack a role model inside family (Bisin, Verdier, 2001,Gustafson, Stattin, Magnusson, 1992). Last, I exploit the unique but under-utilized aspect of the AddHealth dataset – the ranking of friends. I find that the effect concentrates on the parents of close friends.The contribution of this study is three-fold. First, I update the evidence on the importance of peers’ parental education.Manski (1993b)pioneers the distinction between contemporaneous spillover among peers and the effect of peers’ characteristics. The first refers to the ‘endogenous effect’ caused by peers’ outcome and the second refers to the ‘contextual’ effect generated by peers’ pre-existing characteristics.5This paper is more related to contextual effects generated by the family background of peers. Among the studies using the AddHealth data,Bifulco et al. (2011)andBifulco et al. (2014)analyze cohort composition of college educated mothers and find a small long-term effect on educational outcomes. More recently,Cools et al. (2019)define high-achievers using parental education (at least one parent with a degree). They find that the exposure to high-achieving boys has a negative effect on a girl’s educational attainment. Studies using other data sources also find a positive spillover from peers’ parents.6Carrell and Hoekstra (2010)find that students suffering from domestic violence create negative spillover to the classroom.Black et al. (2013)analyze random variations of peer composition across cohorts in Norweigan schools and find significant effects of father’s earnings of grade-mates on male students. Studies in other countries also find that peers’ parents matter (Haraldsvik, Bonesrønning, 2014,McEwan, 2003).7For example,Ammermueller and Pischke (2009)exploit random assignment of students into classes and find that the number of books in classmates’ homes is positively related to the reading test scores of 9- and 10-year-olds in six European countries. In China,Eble and Hu (2019)find that gender bias of classmates’ parents negatively affects the math score of a girl. This paper complements the studies on the effect of peers’ parental education in three aspects. First, I examine the friendship network. Methodologically, I estimate the spatialautoregressive modelthat allows students to have their own peer groups in a network (Bramoullé, Djebbari, Fortin, 2009,Lee, Liu, Lin, 2010,Lin, 2010). This is different from the linear-in-means model where a student is assumed to be affected by all members in a group (school, grade, or class) equally.8Second, I differentiate the effects of peers’ fathers from that of peers’ mothers. Third, I relax the assumption that the effect of peers’ parents on educational outcomes is the same for male and female students.The heterogeneous effect by gender further relates to two growing strands in economics. I provide evidence on when role modeling may take place. Earlier work has acknowledged that non-parental adults affect young people through demonstrating “know-how” of behaviors (Borjas, 1995,Wilson, 2012).Bisin and Verdier (2000)show that the influence of non-parental adults dominates parental influence when socialization within the family is not successful. Later evidence on role modeling typically refers to teachers (Bettinger, Long, 2005,Dee, 2007,Eble, Hu, 2017,Griffith, 2014) or senior peers (Kofoed, mcGoveny, 2019,Porter, Serra, 2019). With the angle of social network, peers’ parents can also demonstrate as role models either through direct interaction or the spread of information (Chung, 2000). My finding indicates that non-parental role models become more relevant when one’s family lacks a role model.The gendered pattern also speaks to the significance of gender norm in driving economic decisions.Akerlof, Kranton, 2000,Akerlof, Kranton, 2002pioneer the formulation of gender identity in aneconomic framework. In their setting, utility-maximizing individuals care about self-image. A cost is incurred if they deviate from the average behavior of the relevant gender group. Thus, the ‘ideal behavior’ creates a pressure to conform. Subsequent work also finds empirical ground about the importance of gender norms on economic behaviors (Alesina, Giuliano, Nunn, 2013,Bertrand, Kamenica, Pan, 2015,Fernandez, Fogli, 2009,Fernández, Fogli, Olivetti, 2004,Giménez-Nadal, Mangiavacchi, Piccoli, 2019). For example,Haaland et al. (2018)find that gender norm of acommunitydisseminatesand affects the gender employment gap of the next generation. In my finding, with different educational compositions of fathers and mothers in a network, different beliefs on gender norm are passed down through inter-generation transmission.",Bobby,None,None
"1. IntroductionIn many countries, experiments conducted in recent years have revealed a relatively widespread discriminatory behaviour among employers (seeBaert, 2018,Bertrand, Duflo, 2017,Neumark, 2018,Rich, 2014for literature reviews). Several recent works have studied different actions to prevent this discrimination. The introduction of anonymous resumes is the most studied policy. However, the results are mixed.Behaghel et al. (2015)show that setting up an experimental anonymous resume policy is not efficient for ethnic minorities in France. In contrast,Aslund and Skans (2012)find an increase in the number of interviews for both ethnic minorities and women in Sweden.Krause et al. (2012)conclude that the method of implementation of the policy is a crucial factor in obtaining a positive impact. Some other studies focus on the content of the resumes.Fremigacci et al. (2015)assess the potential impact of merit labelling by making the ”bestapprenticein France” distinction appear on the resume. However, this attempt was not effective in reducing discrimination because, although all applicants benefits from this distinction, those with a native-sounding name benefit more than other groups.Edo and Jacquemet (2013)evaluate the impact of a satisfactory level of native language on resumes. Their results are more encouraging than the results in the literature because such a signal makes it possible to reduce the differences observed. Another type of policy is the introduction of diversity in hiring committees to reduce discrimination.Bertrand and Duflo (2017)gather the literature on this topic. They point out that the results on discrimination are not obvious and could even be negative (see, for instance,Bagues, Sylos-Labini, Zinovyeva, 2017,Bagues, Esteve-Volart, 2010,Bursell, 2007,Zinovyeva, Bagues, 2011). Overall, few tools have proven effective in fighting discrimination in recruitment and more research on this point is worth pursuing.In this article, we assess the effect of the organization of recruitment in large companies on the degree of hiring discrimination. More specifically, we compare the intervention of a centralized human resources (HR) department to the selection made only within the establishment concerned by the position, generally by a manager responsible for recruitment. We expect a lower rate of discrimination for three reasons. HR professionals are better trained and more aware than other recruiters regarding discrimination. HR professionals are also less influenced by local constraints that can generate discrimination (e.g., conforming to consumer preferences or seeking to maintain homogeneous teams to facilitate their management). Finally, HR professionals also have more time to devote to the selection of applications and therefore make their choices less often on the basis of stereotypes (Chugh, 2004).To conduct our analysis, we use the data from a correspondence study realized by the French Ministry of Labour (Foroni et al., 2016). We find a net discrimination rate of 20.2% against second-generation immigrants, which is the lower bound of the literature,1but in line withCarlsson and Rooth (2007)andKaas and Manger (2012), who find that the net discrimination rate decreases with the size of the firm. The aim of this experiment was to establish a dialogue with some large companies about their recruitment practices on the basis of the experimental results and encourage them to implement policies to prevent discrimination. This dialogue was also an opportunity to gather information related to the recruitment process for each job offer, in addition to those related to the experimental design. Thus, we can distinguish recruitment for which the selection was made through a centralized HR department of the company (e.g., at national or regional levels), by an external service provider, or by a person in charge of hiring if the recruitment was managed at the level of the establishment the offer concerns.In this paper, we evaluate the impact of centralized HR recruitment on the degree of discrimination in large companies. Approximately two-thirds of the tested job offers are managed in this manner, while the other job offers are managed solely at the establishment level. Notably, because we consider very large companies, the organization of recruitment varies across job offers and not only across companies. Indeed, data show intra-firm heterogeneity in terms of organization of recruitment for many companies. Next, because the organization of recruitment is potentially endogenous, we use an instrument to evaluate a causal effect. We exploit the information regarding whether the tested job offer is from a company that developed a franchising network.Our results suggest that acting on the organization of recruitment in large companies can be considered a relatively effective tool in the fight against discrimination in recruitment, at least as far as the first stage of recruitment is concerned. Centralized HR departments lead to a significant decrease in the probability that applicants with a native-sounding name are preferred.The study is organized as follows.Section 2describes the experimental design of the correspondence study and compares the net discrimination rate of this experiment to the literature. Then,Section 3presents the results depending on the organization of recruitments.Section 4discusses the influence of the organization of the recruitment process on the degree of discrimination.Section 5concludes.",Clémence,Morgane,Emmanuel
"1. IntroductionA key component in firms’ production strategies is to put together a workforce with the optimal mix of skills. Hiring workers with complementary human capital will improve productivity and profits. The ability to speak several languages and knowledge about cultures and religions could thus be important human capital resources influencing firm performance. Workers might differ along these dimensions too, and this could influence firm productivity (Lazear, 1999). Cultural diversity might introduce new ideas and innovation (Alesina et al., 2000;Kerr and Lincoln, 2010;Peri et al., 2015), since people with different backgrounds than the majority might see new solutions to problems. However, a firm with a workforce from several different cultures might have to spend resources to integrate the workers into well-functioning teams. For instance, cultural diversity implies preference heterogeneity that might create tensions and conflicts (Easterly and Levine, 1997) unless the firm has institutions to handle conflicts.1In this paper, we study the importance of the related costs and benefits of linguistic diversity on productivity. At the firm level, the flow of communication between co-workers will be slower if co-workers do not understand each other well, which can result in production problems and conflicts. Language differences can result in task differentiation, which might have negative effects on productivity if non-native language speakers do not have complementary skills. The potential costs are likely to increase with the distance between two languages. In contrast to cultural diversity, it is hard to think of positive effects of language diversity per se, except if the firm is exporting to a wide range of countries with different languages.2The empirical literature on the effects of linguistic diversity on productivity is surprisingly small (seeSection 2). The paper most similar to ours isParrotta et al. (2014). They use employer-employee data from Denmark to group the workforce into language groups (based onEthnologue, 2009) and then calculate Herfindahl indexes to measure linguistic diversity. In their main OLS specifications, they find that a onestandard deviationincrease in diversity is associated with about 1.3% decrease in productivity, while the 2SLS estimates are twice this size.We make four important contributions to the previous literature on how linguistic diversity affects productivity. First, we improve the measure of linguistic diversity. Instead of grouping together countries into language groups, we directly measure the linguistic proximity of languages using data of linguistic distances between 245 languages (Ginsburgh and Weber, 2016;Wichmann et al., 2018).3Using this data set, we construct a measure of linguistic diversity within a firm's workforce based onBossert et al. (2011)generalized index offractionalization. Second, we employ a flexible production function, where we allow heterogeneous production technology and different labour immigrant-native skill groups, and even take into account fixed workplace effects. We simultaneously address different endogeneity issues using the standard approach in the firm productivity literature. Third, we address the issue of language learning and proficiency in a foreign universal language. Fourth, we attempt to separate the impact of linguistic diversity from the correlated impact of cultural diversity. We do so by employing data on cultural, religious and genetic differences between countries from the World Values Survey (WVS) and fromSpolaore and Wacziarg (2016,2018).4These data allow us to construct measures of cultural, religious and genetic diversity of workplaces and we can then examine how sensitive the estimates for linguistic diversity are to controls for potentially confounding cultural diversities. SinceBecker (1957), we know that both employer and co-worker discrimination might affect workplace productivity.5While we cannot exclude the possibility that discrimination occur due to language preferences, discrimination can clearly also be attributed to genetic, religious and cultural differences. Since linguistic distance is positively correlated with genetic, religious and cultural distance (Spolaore and Wacziarg, 2016), controls for genetic, religious and cultural distance are important also from a discrimination perspective.InSection 2, we review the previous literature.Section 3discusses how to measure linguistic diversity. Data and key measures are defined inSection 4.Section 5presents the empirical approach.Section 6studies the relationship between workplace linguistic diversity and the linguistic diversity of the lagged labour supply facing a workplace. Our main results are presented inSection 7, whileSection 8briefly concludes.",Harald,Henning,None

"1. IntroductionDoes working with a more effective mentor improve the productivity of mentees? This very basic question has received little empirical attention despite the prevalence of mentoring across a variety of educational and occupational settings. A 2002 publication by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, for instance, reports that there are over 800 apprenticeable occupations (Crosby, 2002). Formalizedapprenticeshipsin which prospective labor market participants are mentored as part of their preparation are an occupational licensing requirement prior to workforce entry in many occupations such as nursing, medicine,clinical social work, and teaching (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2018). There are about half a million individuals being trained each year in these occupations alone.1In a study of occupational licensing,Kleiner and Krueger (2013)report that nearly 30% of employees were licensed and that about half of these require apprenticeships. Thus, it is clear that knowing more about what constitutes a high-quality apprenticeship should inform the training of a large segment of the U.S. workforce.This paper explores whether a key aspect of apprenticeships, the effectiveness of the mentor who supervises the apprenticeship, is predictive of the labor market productivity of mentees. We use a novel database that includes nearly a decade of data on the preservice apprenticeships (“student teaching placements”) of teacher candidates in Washington State—linked to data on the workforce outcomes of these candidates once they become K-12 teachers—to address the question of whether assignment to a more effective mentor teacher during these apprenticeships impacts the effectiveness of student teachers who become teachers themselves. This work builds on prior work on the mentorship ofin-serviceteachers (e.g.,Papay et al., 2016;Rockoff, 2008), and follows a similar study that used more limited data (seeSection 2) to investigate the same question aboutpre-serviceteachers in Tennessee (Ronfeldt et al., 2018a). Importantly, this is the first study to consider mentor productivity as measuredbeforethe mentor-mentee relationship to investigate this key question.There are a number of reasons to focus on the connection between mentor and mentee productivity in the case of teaching. First, teachers are the single largest college-educated profession—there are over three million public school teachers—and education is a majorindustry, with K–12 public school education expenditures in the United States comprising approximately 4% of GDP. Moreover, the vast majority of these three million public school teachers served as student teachers in the past as will the majority of teacher candidates today. Teachers have also been shown to play a critical role in the creation of future human capital.2Finally, and importantly for the purposes of the study, there is a well-established measure of labor market productivity for teachers—the “value added” that teachers contribute toward student achievement test scores (discussed more extensively below)—permitting a direct link between the productivity of mentors and mentees.3It is important to note that value added isnotdirect measure of the quality of mentorship provided by mentors, but to the extent that teaching quality and mentorship quality are correlated, this measure helps us understand how much mentees benefit from a high-quality mentor.We find evidence of a strong and positive relationship between value-added measures of mentor effectiveness and mentees’ value-added effectiveness in math, and more modest relationships in English Language Arts (ELA). Specifically, across a variety of specifications, apprenticing with mentors whose value added is onestandard deviationhigher is associated with roughly 10–20% of a standard deviation higher value added of mentees in math and (an inconsistently statistically significant) 5–12% of a standard deviation higher value added in ELA.4The increase in math value added associated with a one standard deviation increase in mentor quality is roughly equivalent to the difference in average value added between a novice and second-year teacher; in other words, the expected gain inteacher effectivenessfrom assignment to a more effective mentor is equivalent to the well-documented returns to the first year of teaching experience (e.g.,Ladd and Sorensen, 2017;Rivkin et al., 2005;Rockoff, 2004).Our findings are robust to the inclusion of various in-service measures of mentor quality (e.g., experience and degree level) and preservice measures of mentee quality (e.g., teacher preparation program and licensure test scores), but there are several potential threats to the causal interpretation of the above estimates. Most importantly, prior quantitative (Krieg et al., 2016,2019) and qualitative (St. John et al., 2018) evidence from Washington State (the setting of this study) documents considerable non-random sorting of teacher candidates to mentor teachers. While we can account for sorting along observable dimensions—for example, the sorting of candidates with higher licensure test scores to mentors with higher value added documented inKrieg et al. (2016,2019)—it is plausible that positive sorting of teacher candidates whoalready would be more effective teachersto more effective mentorsalong unobserved dimensionsmay explain at least some of the estimated relationships discussed above.We address this threat to validity by following the approach ofAltonji et al. (2005,2008) andOster (2017)who provide methods for estimating the bias produced by different magnitudes of non-random sorting. We show that under plausible scenarios—including a scenario in which the amount of sorting on unobservable dimensions is the same as the amount of sorting on observables—the relationship between mentor effectiveness in math and the future effectiveness of their mentees in math is still positive and statistically significant. We interpret this as evidence that at least some of this relationship reflects a causal relationship between mentor effectiveness and the future effectiveness of their mentees in math.",Dan,John,Roddy
"1. IntroductionMines and other large-scale projects can change societies. The establishment of the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline System had a dramatic impact on wages and employment in Alaska (Carrington, 1996), and large mining projects in Peru (Aragón and Rud, 2013) and the United States (Black et al., 2005) produced interesting economic andindustrydynamics. What is less clear is how such projects shift a broader set of socioeconomic variables. To shed light on this issue, we study mine openings in the Nordic countries where the mining industry has a long tradition and where register data is available. This allows for a detailed assessment of how employment, the industry structure, and the human capital distribution change in a municipality when a new mine opens.One theoretical model useful for studying large-scale projects is the spatial equilibrium model outlined inMoretti (2010,2011). The model stresses that a demand shock (such as a mine opening) will have a direct effect on local employment in the affected industry, and that it will propagate to other industries such that the industry composition changes. We study these dynamics as well as changes in the human capital distribution.Extractive industries have been studied extensively, and resource abundance has been linked tomacroeconomicperformance (Sachs and Warner, 1995,1999,2001;van der Ploeg, 2011). Sachs and Warner's prominent cross-country studies present evidence suggesting that countries with a high ratio ofnatural resourceexports tend to have lower growth rates. In contrast, papers studying the effect of extractive industries using within-country variation often find positive effects on employment and income (Allcott and Keniston, 2014;Aragón and Rud, 2013;Black et al., 2005;Kline, 2008;Michaels, 2010). Our study falls into this latter category.The effects of mines and other large-scale projects have been assessed using a variety of settings and methodologies. One class of papers identifies local impacts by studying one large-scale project. An important example is Carrington's (1996) study of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System in the 70 s. Viewing the construction project as a substantial anticipated and temporarylabor demandshock, he establishes significant positive shifts in employment, population, and earnings during construction and a reversion in earnings and the employment/population ratio once the pipeline was completed.Aragón and Rud (2013)take a related approach in studying the Yanacocha mine in Peru, which is one of the largest gold mines in the world. They find positive footprints of the mine on household income within a radius of 100 km from the mine.1A second class of papers uses geographical variation in the intensity of resource extraction or resource endowments. One such paper byBlack et al. (2005)studies the impact of coal mines on local labor markets using the coal boom in the 70 s and the bust in the 80 s. An important finding from this study is that a boomingcoal industryhasspillover effectsto other locally-focused sectors such as construction, retail, and services. A related paper byAllcott and Keniston (2014)focuses on boom-and-bust effects in the oil and gas industry and establishes pro-cyclical movements in employment, migration, and wages. Another paper in this vein is the study of the long-term consequences of oil abundance in the Southern United States byMichaels (2010). This paper finds that oil-abundant counties had a higher population growth, a higher per capita income, and better infrastructure and that oil abundance created jobs in the mining andmanufacturing industries. These results, however, stand in stark contrast to those established byCaselli and Michaels (2013), who use variation in oil endowments and production across municipalities in Brazil to establish that oilwindfallshave moderate, if any, effects on localliving standards, despite significant increases in reported spending on public goods and services.The study byKline (2008)represents a third class of papers. Kline uses (exogenous) variation in world prices of crude petroleum between 1972 and 2002 to study the effects on employment, hours, and wages in the US oil and gas field services industry. The results show that employment and hours respond immediately to higher prices and that wages respond somewhat later.The study most similar to ours is that ofKotsadam and Tolonen (2016), who use a multi-country longitudinal survey spanning the African continent and complementary information on mine locations to investigate the gender-specific employment effects of mine openings and closings. In their analysis, they find that large-scale mining in Africa produces local boom-bust economies with transient gender-specific employment effects.Our study differs from these earlier papers by paying particular attention to the Nordic context and to the life cycle of mines. Using the register data available in Norway, Sweden, and Finland, we show that mines have large local impacts. In particular, difference-in-difference,event studyand synthetic control method estimates all show strong and positive employment effects in municipalities where new mines are established.In addition to assessing the direct employment effects, we investigate how the demand shock impacts the industry structure. We are able to document that, in addition to high growth in the mining sector, other industries such as construction, the primary sector (excluding mining), and the electricity, gas and water supply industry also experience employment growth in response to a mine opening. Hence, in line with theory, there is clear evidence that the positive demand shock (to mining) propagates to a broader set of industries.A key contribution of this paper is to address to what extent mine openings change a broader set of socioeconomic variables. A first result shedding light on this issue is that municipalities with mine openings experience a growth in population that matches the growth in employment. Mine openings have only moderate effects on unemployment and the number of people outside the labor force. The results also show that the male share of the municipality increases when a mine opens, but such an increase occurs late and is modest. Equally interesting is it to note that mine openings make the age distribution more U-shaped and lead to an increasing number of people in all education categories (however, the number for people with lower levels of education is larger).The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we present the register data and the mines. InSection 3, we discuss our methodology, and we present results inSection 4.Section 5provides a discussion of the findings and concludes.",Anders,Maja,None
"1. IntroductionFluctuations in monthly unemployment rates are highly persistent. Depending on the detrending method used, the autocorrelation of monthly unemployment rates in the U.S. ranges between 0.97 and 0.99, with even higher values for prime age workers. This implies a half-life of unemployment fluctuations ranging between 22 and 83 months.1Intuitively, one might expect that search frictions, as inMortensen and Pissarides (1994), could generate sizable persistence. It is well known that the standard search model with these frictions struggles to replicate the volatility of unemployment, but a number of papers have further pointed out the inability of these frictions to, by themselves, generate persistent unemployment fluctuations.Pries (2004)observes that when the standard model is calibrated to match average levels of worker flows, the quantitative contribution of these frictions is quite small, generating virtually no internal propagation. While the addition of persistent productivity shocks can generate persistent unemployment fluctuations,Shimer (2005)points out the persistence of the standard productivity shock in the calibrated Diamond–Mortensen–Pissarides (DMP) model generates persistent unemployment through unrealistic counterfactual mechanisms.2Fujita and Ramey (2007)andElsby et al. (2015)further argue that the standard model with these persistent shocks fails to generate realistic propagation, as it fails to reproduce the full dynamics of unemployment persistence in the short and long run. Thus, an important question is whether there are additional internal propagation mechanisms that can endogenously generate unemployment persistence.In this paper, we study the propagation of unemployment fluctuations stemming from compositional changes across worker groups with different baseline unemployment rates. The inclusion of compositional changes can potentially have a significant quantitative impact on the dynamics of unemployment in a standard search model. If, in a recession, the composition of workers shifts towards workers with high unemployment rates, this will naturally amplify fluctuations in unemployment over the business cycle. Further, if changes in composition are persistent, then they will also increase the persistence of unemployment in response to a shock.To illustrate this channel, we begin by considering a simple model of worker flows. In the model with homogeneous workers, the autocorrelation of unemployment is given by1−s−f,wheresandfare the probabilities of job separation and job finding respectively. In the U.S.,s+f≈0.5,implying little persistence in unemployment fluctuations, having a half-life of 1–2 months. Even with levels of worker flows observed in recessions or across heterogeneous worker groups, flows are sufficiently high to generate rapid convergence.We then extend the simple flow model of unemployment by allowing for two worker groups – inexperienced and experienced. In this environment, workers can gain experience while employed, which places them in a state with lower separation rates and higher job finding probabilities. On the other hand, when a worker separates from his job he can lose skill, returning to the inexperienced state. With multiple worker groups, the aggregate unemployment rate now depends not only on the unemployment rate within groups, but the composition of the labor force across these groups. In this environment, the persistence of any compositional shift depends on the flows between groups, similar to how the persistence of unemployment within groups depends on worker flows between employment and unemployment. If flows across worker groups are low, then compositional changes will generate persistent fluctuations in unemployment.To quantitatively assess this mechanism, we embed the compositional change channel within a standard DMP model with productivity shocks. We extend the model to have workers in three different experience states: inexperienced, experienced, and displaced. Displaced workers are those who have lost skills when they separate from an experienced job. The worker heterogeneity involved in our compositional framework is generally unobservable and workers can transition across groups. We proxy for these three types empirically using data on employer tenure to distinguish between experienced and inexperienced workers and data on displaced workers as measured in the Current Population Survey. Allowing for this displaced state allows for careful empirical discipline of compositional changes using evidence from the literature on worker displacement. Flows into and out of displacement are the key compositional flows impacting persistence in the model.The calibrated model matches empirical patterns of wages, job finding probabilities, and job separation probabilities for low tenure, high tenure, and displaced workers. Displaced workers have a higher baseline unemployment rate, stemming from a slightly higher probability of job separation and a much lower job finding probability. Thus, a compositional shift toward these workers will increase the aggregate unemployment rate. Our calibration implies that increased unemploymentwithinexperience groups converges rapidly to the steady state since worker flows within each group are high. However, when increased unemployment arises from changes in the composition of workersacrossexperience groups, with an increase in the share of workers who are displaced, it converges much more gradually.The magnitude of persistence generated from this channel depends on how much the composition of workers changes with the business cycle.Mueller (2017)andHuckfeldt (2016)document that in recessions the previous wage among recently unemployed workers rises and the incidence of downward occupational switching increases. We interpret these findings in our framework as a relative increase in separations by experienced workers and a higher incidence of skill loss among those separations. Both factors lead to increased inflows to displacement during recessions and we use them to empirically discipline the cyclical variation in the composition of workers in our model.In our simulations with persistent productivity shocks, we find that the cyclical compositional changes induced by matching these empirical patterns increases the persistence of unemployment. Allowing for cyclical compositional change increases unemployment persistence in the model by 40%, as measured by the half-life implied by the autocorrelation coefficient. Importantly, however, with the inclusion of cyclical changes in the composition of workers, the aggregate unemployment rate is not well described by a simple AR(1) process and so autocorrelation coefficients and implied half-lives provide an incomplete description of the persistence of unemployment. Impulse responses of unemployment to a negative shock in simulations with and without compositional change look similar for the first year after a shock, however, their long run behavior diverges substantially. In simulations without cyclical compositional changes, unemployment falls to 25% of the peak within four years of the initial shock. In contrast, with cyclical compositional changes, it takes more than 10 years to fall to 25% of the peak. Thus, the added mechanism of compositional change is particularly effective at increasing unemployment persistence in the long-run.Our paper relates to the literature studying internal propagation mechanisms to generate persistence in search and matching models, includingPries (2004)andFujita and Ramey (2007).Pries (2004)is closely related to our work as he also considers an environment with compositional change. In his model of worker-firm learning, economic downturns coincide with both decreased match quality and increased uncertainty about the quality of existing matches. Matches with uncertain quality, including new matches, face a higher risk of separation. Thus, increases in uncertainty generate compositional changes towards workers with higher unemployment rates and slow convergence because of recurring separations amongst the newly unemployed. We view this as a potential example of the type of compositional channel we emphasize and thus complementary to the skill composition channel we illustrate. Relative toPries (2004), we are able to provide tighter empirical discipline on the magnitudes of compositional change over the business cycle, providing additional quantitative evidence in favor of the importance of compositional change.Our paper also relates to the literature studying the quantitative properties of the standard search and matching model, includingShimer (2005)who finds that the standard model generates less than 10% of the volatility of unemployment observed in the data.3While our primary emphasis is on the propagation of unemployment, we note that the inclusion of cyclical changes in composition provides an additional mechanism that amplifies unemployment fluctuations. Our simulations with cyclical changes in composition generate astandard deviationof unemployment fluctuations that is roughly 15–30% larger than counterfactuals without cyclical composition changes.Ferraro (2018)studies the quantitative properties of the DMP model by extending an otherwise standard search and matching model to have worker heterogeneity. He shows that endogenous separations and changes in the composition of the unemployed acrossskill levelscan generate volatile and asymmetric fluctuations in unemployment, as in the data. While we do not allow for endogenous separations, our model allows for realistic transitions between skill levels; inFerraro (2018)a worker’s skill is fixed over time. Given these transitions, our model generates added persistence and volatility in unemployment from cyclical composition changes while still being consistent with evidence fromMueller (2017)that unemployment rates are most volatile for high skilled workers. The model ofFerraro (2018)implies the opposite, that unemployment rates are most cyclical for low-skilled workers.Our paper also relates to the search and matching literature on skill loss. Early papers in this literature, such asLjungqvist and Sargent (1998)andden Haan et al. (2005), asked whether increased levels of steady state skill loss could generate higher levels of steady state unemployment to reconcile the European experience since the 1980s.4den Haan et al. (2005)argue that skill loss coupled with endogenous separations could lead to a lower steady state level of separations, and actually lower unemployment.5However, these criticisms are unlikely to apply to our context, as we study cyclical movements in skill loss. Separations, especially involuntary ones, increase in recessions, including among higher skilled workers, as shown inMueller (2017).Another complementary propagation channel is a thin market externality, as proposed byPissarides (1992). This externality occurs when downturns coincide with an increase in the fraction of low productivity workers in the unemployment pool so that firms have a lower incentive to post vacancies, decreasing job finding rates. BothPries (2008)andRavenna and Walsh (2012)study the impact of this channel in amplifying unemployment fluctuations. In their frameworks, workers are ex ante heterogeneous and they find that increases in the fraction of low productivity workers in the unemployment pool amplify unemployment fluctuations. Workers in our model are instead ex ante homogeneous, but change types as they gain or lose experience over time and search in separate markets corresponding to their experience, so that there is no thin market externality.6Lalé (2018)also studies the role of skill loss and the thin market externality on amplification in an environment where workers can gain or lose skill over time. However, in his work, workers of different productivity levels have identical separation and job finding rates. In our model, differences in worker flows across groups are central to how compositional change generates persistent aggregate unemployment fluctuations.A recent literature includingJarosch (2014),Huckfeldt (2016),Jung and Kuhn (2018), andKrolikowski (2017)focuses on extending search and matching models to account for the earnings losses of displaced workers. Similar to the spirit of our calibration,Jung and Kuhn (2018)aim to account for worker flows over the life cycle and across years of employer tenure. However, as with most of these papers, there is no discussion of cyclical movements in earnings losses or unemployment. A notable exception to this isHuckfeldt (2016), who proposes a model of endogenously selective hiring to explain the countercyclical earnings losses by displaced workers. As his paper does not examine the persistence of aggregate unemployment, we view our work as complementary to his findings.Finally, our findings may seem at odds with the results ofShimer (2012), who argues that fluctuations in separation rates and the composition of the workforce across observable characteristics (e.g. age, sex, race, education) contribute minimally to aggregate unemployment fluctuations. However, recent work inAhn and Hamilton (2016),Mueller (2017),Munro (2018), andHall and Schulhofer-Wohl (2018)find an important role for compositional changes, either through additional observables (e.g. the prior wage of the unemployed or the reason for unemployment) or through unobservable heterogeneity. Further, the compositional changes we envision are distinct from those originally considered byShimer (2012). In our model, a worker’s type is not permanent, but can change over time with gaining or losing experience, andShimer (2012)acknowledges that changes like these in a worker’s type could be an important exception to his findings. With regard to whether fluctuations in separation or job finding rates are key drivers of cyclical changes in unemployment, we conduct the a similar decomposition as inShimer (2012)and find that the majority of unemployment fluctuations are generated by movements in job finding rates. Although skill loss happens at the point of separation, this result occurs because displaced workers have such low job finding rates that compositional changes have a particularly large impact on the aggregate job finding rate.",Aspen,David,Christian
"1. IntroductionImmigration is a very important economic and social phenomenon. According to theOECD, in 2015 about 244 million people were living outside their country of origin, more than half of them inG20 countries. In recent years, many of these countries have seen a significant rise in migration trends: between 2010 and 2015, net migration added about 10 million people to total population (OECD, 2017a).The effects of immigration for the rich receiving countries have been widely investigated. However, while there is a vast literature considering the labour market effects of immigration (e.g.Ottaviano and Peri, 2012, for the US;D'Amuri et al., 2010, for Germany;Manacorda et al., 2012, for the UK), less has been done to study how immigration affects the educational choices of young natives. This paper adds to the small literature on the latter topic by focusing on Italy, a country that has only recently become a destination ofinternational migrationand that attracts mainly low-skilled immigrants from developing countries.Previous contributions (see for instanceBetts, 1998) point to two opposite effects of low skilled immigration on the education of natives. On the one hand, a large inflow of immigrants reduces the schooling resources available to natives. School quality declines and natives invest less. On the other hand, low skilled immigration increases the supply of low skilled labour. When low and high skills are complements in production, a higher supply of low skills reduces the wages and employment probabilities of the low skilled and increases the productivity and wages of the high skilled. Consequently, returns to education raise and natives have stronger incentives to acquire additional schooling.Recent empirical research suggests that the balance of these effects is positive and that low skilled immigration raises thehuman capital investmentof natives (see for instanceMcHenry, 2015andHunt, 2016). Not all natives, however, are positively affected. According toLlull, 2014, some are more likely to pursue a white - collar career and extend their stay in school. Others become more detached from the labour market and, given the lower expected return to their investment, drop out from school earlier, reducing their education.Using data from Italy, we contribute to this literature by showing that in this country the observed increase in low skilled immigration has raised - with respect to the counterfactual of constant immigration - both the share of young natives (males in the whole country and females in the industrialized North) with college or enroled in college and the share of low educated natives (males and females) who have completed compulsory education but are not engaged in further education, thus attenuating the downward trend in the share of low educated natives and accelerating the upward trend in the share of natives with higher education.Our empirical analysis combines local labour market data on young natives drawn from the ItalianLabour Force Surveywith data on legal immigrants drawn from other official sources. We recognize that the empirical relationship between the human capital choices of natives and immigration is influenced by the fact that immigrants are not randomly allocated across local areas. We address the endogeneity of immigration by using the shift-share instrument proposed byCard, 2001a, which exploits the tendency of immigrants to locate in areas where previous immigrants of the same ethnicity settled.Our identifying assumption is that the local economic shocks attracting immigrants in the past (in our case, 1991) are uncorrelated with the educational choices of natives occurring more than 15 years later, conditional on a battery of controls.1In support of our identification strategy, we investigate the validity of the exclusion restriction by implementing the tests designed byOster, 2019,Conley et al., 2012,Mitaritonna et al., 2017andJaeger et al., 2018.We show that our empirical results can be explained by adapting a standard model of educational choice (seeCard, 2001b) to accommodate immigration. Following higher immigration, the marginal benefits of education rise for college but fall for lower education, because low skilled immigrants are substitutes for low to medium skilled natives but complements for high skilled natives.Whenlower secondary educationis compulsory and natives differ in their costs of education, these changes in marginal benefits increase the share of natives investing in college and reduce the share of those investing a few years longer than lower secondary education, for instance to complete short term vocational courses, thus raising the share with only compulsory education. We estimate wage equations by gender and find that the conditions required for immigration to increase the share of both lower and higher educated natives are satisfied, especially for Italian males.While these effects show up very clearly for native males, they are somewhat less obvious for females. On the one hand, we find evidence that higher immigration increases the share of lower educated females who are not engaged in education or training; on the other hand, we find a negative but very imprecise effect on college enrolment or attainment. We interpret this result by pointing out that many Italian females with a college degree are either employed in jobs requiring less than college, suggesting that they and low skilled immigrants may be substitutes rather than complements, or work in the public sector, which is less permeable to the influence of immigrants. We also notice that the impact of immigration on educated females is positive in the industrialized North and negative in less developed areas, where good jobs outside the public sector are scarcer.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We start with a review of the literature inSection 1.Section 2motivates why we treat immigration in Italy as low skilled andSection 3introduces an illustrative model of educational choice.Section 4presents the data andSection 5describes our empirical approach. The main results are discussed inSection 6. Conclusions follow.",Giorgio,Elisabetta,Lorenzo
"1. IntroductionContrary to popular perception, many of the immigrants to the U.S. in the last decades were highly skilled. Between 1990 and 2010, the number of skilled immigrants residing in the U.S. rose by about 4.8% annually.2Today, 16% of the U.S. workers with a bachelor’s education are immigrants. The inflow of immigrants has furthermore been unevenly spread; 25% of computer scientists and electronics engineers are immigrants, but only 6% of those working in thelegal professionsare. Basic economic arguments (Borjas, 1999) suggest that such an unbalanced and sizable flow of migrants might have substantial and detrimental effects on natives with similar skills working in the same professions. Given the empirical distribution of skilled migrants across occupations, we expect any labor market effects to be largest among U.S. workers in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) occupations (Table 1).3However, with a few exceptions (Peri, Shih, Sparber, 2015,Hanson, Slaughter, 2016,Bound, Braga, Golden, Khanna, 2015), the literature so far has neglected the question of how skilled immigrants have affected native born workers in the STEM fields. How do natives’ human capital decisions react to skilled immigration? Would they have specialized in different occupations?STEM occupations are the fundamental inputs in scientific innovation and technological adoption which, in turn, are the main drivers of the productivity growth in the US (Peri et al., 2015). There has been a concern about the shortage of STEM workers in the US. The H1B visa was introduced to allow access into the US to professional STEM workers. This paper focuses on the direct impact of skilled immigration introduced by the H1B temporary visa program. The approach I take here focus on the directly impacted STEM labor market, thus it precludes any analysis of the overall welfare impact of the skilled immigration on the Non-STEM labor market.A comprehensive answer to previous research questions is crucial to understand the economic impacts of skilled immigrant inflows, and the answer requires multiple key inputs. First, we need to estimate the demand for skilled workers across occupations. Second, we need to understand how the native-born workers choose occupations and whether occupational switching can serve as a pressure-valve mitigating and diffusing any consequences of the inflows of skilled immigrants. In particular, I build a labor market equilibrium model focusing on dynamicoccupational choicesof native workers with the following key features: (a) skilled natives and immigrants are allowed to be imperfect substitutes or complements, and substitutability or complementarity can vary across occupations; (b) workers are heterogeneous in terms of their multi-dimensional abilities; (c) workers accumulate occupation-specific human capital through learning-by-doing, and (d) the occupation-specific human capital is partially transferable across occupations.In this paper, the proposed and estimated labor market equilibrium model is used to identify the wage impacts of skilled immigration in the STEM fields over the last two decades, taking into consideration of occupational adjustments by natives. The labor market equilibrium approach departs from the recent literature and allows me to address the following main points.First, I estimate thelabor demandfunctions across different occupations. With regard to the corresponding production functions, there are two streams in the literature. One type of common assumption is that native and immigrant workers of the same type are perfect substitutes (Bound, Braga, Golden, Khanna, 2015,Dustmann, Frattini, Preston, 2012). This assumption of perfect substitutability is not innocuous, as it considers the impacts of immigrants only within the scope of direct competition. In other papers (Llull, 2018,Ottaviano, Peri, 2012,Peri, Sparber, 2009), native and immigrant workers are imperfect substitutes in the production process because they work in different occupations based on their skills.4This paper falls into the second stream. Besides allowing for the endogenous occupation adjustment following (Llull, 2018a), the general production function in this paper allows native and immigrant workers to be imperfect substitutes or, more importantly, complements even conditional on occupational choices and labor market experience. Allowing the possibility of complementarity adds a potential beneficial side to the story to avoid the overestimation of negative impacts. Moreover, the production functions allow thesubstitution elasticityto vary across occupations, which would better capture the asymmetric impacts of immigrants across occupations.Second, by explicitly modeling occupational choices by natives, I can quantify and correct the biases in the estimated effects of immigration on wages introduced by ignoring native workers’ labor market adjustments. Another common assumption in the literature is the fixed native labor supply in narrowly defined labor markets (Borjas, 1999,Borjas, 2003,Llull, 2018,Ottaviano, Peri, 2012). Failing to account for native workers’ adjustments may lead to a substantial bias in the estimated wage impacts of skilled immigration. Using the estimated model, I identify that a non trivial fraction of native workers adjust their occupational choices in response to foreign labor competition, which mitigates any initial impacts through diffusion. Occupational adjustments to immigration have been studied byPeri and Sparber (2009)andLlull (2018a). This paper complements to the previous two by explicitly studying the occupational responses by native workers in the context of skilled labor market.Third, the equilibrium model with multiple occupations allows me to evaluate the impacts of a selective immigration policy based on occupations that would not be possible otherwise.Llull (2018c)poses and estimates a labor market equilibrium to study the immigration policies that change the skill composition of immigrants in the U.S.5However, this paper focuses exclusively on selective immigration policies based on occupation.The two-sector equilibrium model (Computer Science occupations (CS) v.s. Other-STEM occupations) builds on work byLee (2005),Lee and Wolpin (2006)andLlull (2018a).6Besides the computational simplicity, I focus these two occupations based on the following reason. During the period of interest, we observe a substantial increase in the number of temporary non-immigrant visas awarded to high skilled workers in the STEM occupations, and individuals with computer-related occupations becoming the largest share of H1B visa holders (Bound et al., 2015). Given these circumstances, it is of considerable interest to investigate how the inflow of skilled immigrants affect the labor market outcomes for US STEM workers as a whole and US computer scientists during this period.The supply side of the model extends the structure ofKeane, Wolpin, 1994,Keane, Wolpin, 1997. Native workers from age 22 to 65 make yearly forward-looking decisions about their occupational choices. Native workers differ in their innate abilities for working in either sector.7Agents choose their occupations according to their comparative advantage (Roy, 1951), which evolves over time because human capital accumulates throughout the life-cycle. Learning-by-doing on the job leads to accumulation of occupation-specific human capital that is only partially transferable across occupations. Switching occupations is costly in the current model due to the loss of previous accumulated human capital. In theirhuman capital investmentdecisions, natives make forecasts about future wages, which depend on future inflows of skilled immigration and future sector specific productivity shocks. Individuals are assumed to be able to perfectly foresee future career prospects when making decisions.8Skilled foreign workers are allowed to accumulate human capital through learning-by-doing as well. However, the lack of portability of the H-1B visa across occupations restricts theiroccupational mobilityafter entering the U.S. labor market (Kerr and Lincoln, 2010).9In this model, the supply of foreign workers is directly taken from the data and is exogenously determined by the U.S. immigration policies (H-1B visa regulations). The decision to migrate to the U.S. is specified outside of the model similar toLlull (2018a).10The features of the H-1B visa effectively separate the foreign labor supply from the labor demand, which provides plausible exogenous variations to identify the occupation-specific production functions. SeeSection 2andSection 3.1.2for more details.11On the labor demand side, I assume a nested Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) production function that uses both domestic and immigrant labor in the production process. The nested-CES function allows for imperfect substitutability between native and immigrant labor similarly as inOttaviano and Peri (2012)andPeri and Sparber (2009). The current setup has an embedded channel of imperfect substitutability which occur endogenously through differentoccupational decisionsof natives and immigrants on the labor supply side (Llull, 2018a). The nested-CES function provides an additional channel for the imperfect substitutability that native and immigrants workers are not perfectly substitutable even conditional on their occupational choices. Furthermore, the flexible specification incorporates the asymmetric effects of skilled immigration across occupations.12It also captures the immigrant-native interaction happening through both labor market and output market.I fit he model to U.S. data from the Current Population Survey (CPS), the AmericanCommunitySurvey (ACS), and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). The model is identified by combining the structural assumptions with the exogenous variation in the flow of skilled immigrants.13I then use the estimated parameters to quantify the effect of skilled immigration on labor market outcomes.My estimation results add to the previous papers (Peri, Sparber, 2009,Ottaviano, Peri, 2012,Manacorda, Manning, Wadsworth, 2012), finding that skilled native and foreign labor are imperfect substitutes in the CS occupations and more interestingly are complements in the Other-STEM occupations. I then explore the O*NET data to provide evidence for the micro-structure of these finding. Task specialization within occupations is a potential source that can explain these findings.With the estimated parameters, I first quantify the effect of skilled immigration on the STEM occupations. I consider a counterfactual economy in which the total foreign skilled labor supply is kept constant at its 1994 level. This experiment attempts to determine the impact of immigration policies on total quantity restriction, such as the variations in the H-1B cap. I find a very limited impact on native workers even for large inflows of skilled immigrants. Wages of skilled domestic workers, on average, increase only by 2.41% due to this highly restrictive counterfactual policy.A universal restriction on the number of skilled immigrants may be suboptimal. The economy can improve its performance with selective immigration policies that favor occupations where complementarity exists.14Thus, in the second set of counterfactual analysis, I manipulate the occupation mix of skilled immigrants to replicate the effect of a selective immigration policy. The foreign labor in the Other-STEM occupations increases while that of the CS occupations are fixed. Optimizing the occupation mix of skilled immigrants achieves a Pareto improvement. Workers in the occupations where complementarity exists experience a direct increase in wages due to inflows of skilled immigrants, while others experience a positivespillover effectas a result of native workers’ occupational mobility.This paper contributes to a growing body of literature that studies the impacts of skilled immigration on U.S. labor market outcomes (Kerr, Lincoln, 2010,Hunt, Gauthier-Loiselle, 2010,Hunt, 2011,Hunt, 2015,Borjas, Doran, 2012,Moser, Voena, Waldinger, 2014,Bound, Braga, Golden, Khanna, 2015).15Motivated by the empirical evidence documented inPeri and Sparber (2011),Peri et al. (2015), andD’Amuri and Peri (2014), the main focus of this paper is on domestic workers’ occupational adjustments in response to skilled immigration. Adding this adjustment margin relaxes the assumption of fixed labor supply like inBorjas (2003),Card (2009),Ottaviano and Peri (2012), orLlull (2018b). In the paper, I identify a non-trivial portion of domestic workers switching occupations in response to inflows of skilled immigrants, which highlights the importance of accounting for natives occupational adjustments when quantifying the wage impact of immigration.Llull (2018a)studies three adjustment mechanisms of native workers: education, occupation, and labor participation. The occupational adjustments in this paper have a very similar flavor. This paper departs from previous papers in two additional dimensions. The first one is using flexible enough production functions to allow natives and immigrants to be imperfect substitutes or even complements. The paper combines two channels for imperfect substitutability. First, native and immigrants are different because they make different occupational decisions as inLlull (2018a). Second, conditional on occupations, they enter the nest-CES production function as two different types of labor which is due to task specialization. This enlarges the scope within which we discuss the impact of skilled immigration.Bound et al. (2015)assume natives and immigrants are perfect substitutes. With a normal downward sloping labor demand, their model only captures half of the story. My model further allows the elasticity of substitution between natives and immigrants to vary across occupations. This extends the setup inOttaviano and Peri (2012)that better captures the asymmetric effects of skilled immigration across occupations and generates correct incentives of occupational mobility, eventually allowing the model to evaluate the effect of selective immigration policies.Studying the native’s internal migration in response to immigration adds to another strand of the literature. In the literature,Card (2001),Borjas (2006), andPiyapromdee (2017), model the spatial equilibrium responses to immigration in a static framework, estimating the wage effect of immigration across different local labor markets and finding mixed evidence of this adjustment margin.16The role of geographic mobility in these papers is analogous to the occupational mobility here: both geographic and occupational mobility mitigate the wage effects of immigration through diffusion in equilibrium.There are few structural papers studying natives’ occupational response to foreign competition.Bound et al. (2015)andLlull (2018a)are the only ones, to my knowledge, falling into this category.Bound et al. (2015)utilize a calibrated model to analyze the employment and wage adjustment of native computer scientists. The partial equilibrium setting in their study focuses only on the market for computer scientists and misses the wider impacts that high-skilled immigration might have on the U.S. economy.Llull (2018a)proposes a rich model incorporating the educational, occupational, and participation adjustments of natives to immigration, which mitigate initial effects on wages andinequalitythrough diffusion.Llull (2018a)identifies a significant heterogeneity in these adjustments both across individuals and across different margins. In this paper, I focus mainly on the occupational adjustment margin but add more structures to the production functions. This model provides us some new insights into the effects of changing the immigrant occupational composition, like the OPT in the U.S., which has not been studied in the previous papers.The paper is structured as follows.Section 2describes the OPT and the H-1B visa program in the U.S.Section 3specifies the model andSection 5.1discusses the data, identification, and estimation procedure.Section 5presents the results.Section 6shows the counterfactual experiments. I include several robustness checks and discuss some potential model specification issues and limitation of the current model inSection 7and conclude inSection 8.",Jie,None,None
"1. IntroductionA currently expanding literature examines how up- and downturns of the economy affect the health of newborn children. This research is motivated by evidence that health at birth impacts both health and labour market outcomes later in life (Currie, 2009) and that relatively mild shocks in utero can have substantive adverse effects on the individual in the long run (the so-called fetal origins hypothesis, for reviews seeAlmond, Currie, 2011,Almond, Currie, Duque, 2018). Understanding the impact ofeconomic conditionson newborn health as well as the underlying mechanisms is therefore important in order to realize efficiency gains through reallocation of resources to early-life periods. It also contributes to accurately estimating the cost of the business cycle and determining the need for stabilization policies (seeBarlevy,Barlevy, for a review). In addition, to gauge the effectiveness of health-improving interventions after the first year of life, it is useful to improve our understanding of the determinants of early-life health.Previous work for developing countries has found strong evidence that recessions tend to increase infant mortality, while booms tend to lower it.1In contrast with this evidence, it has been suggested that the effect of the cycle differs in developed countries, with newborn health improving in recessions. The pivotal study byDehejia and Lleras-Muney (2004), using U.S. state-level data, estimates that an increase in the unemployment rate by one percentage point lowers both the infant mortality rate and the incidence of very low birth weight (below 1500 grams) by 0.5%.There are several reasons for why babies’ health suffers less from recessions in developed countries than in developing countries (see also the discussion inFerreira and Schady, 2009). First, while spending on public health care has been shown to decline during downturns in developing countries (Cutler, Knaul, Lozano, Méndez, Zurita, 2002,Paxson, Schady, 2005), fiscal policy generally tends to be countercyclical rather than procyclical in developed countries (Lane, 2003). Second, recessions are often shorter in developed countries, and given the higher level of health spending, marginal reductions are less severe. Third, credit markets are more widespread, allowing mothers to smooth income and thus spending on health care and nutrition.Studies on effects of economic fluctuations in developed countries on health of theadultpopulation confirm that contemporaneous health improves in recessions. Pioneering work byRuhm (2000)and many subsequent studies provide strong evidence for theprocyclicalityof the total mortality rate.2Several of the channels linking the business cycle to adult health also apply to babies, both in utero and shortly after birth.3This includes channels that are related to parental job loss, since downturns give rise to displacements and lower chances of re-employment. Job loss reduces the available income that can be spent on tobacco and alcohol. Smoking and drinking during pregnancy are highly detrimental to newborns’ health. It has been shown that these behaviors are less prevalent in downturns (Ruhm, 2000,Ruhm, Black, 2002). Further, as a result of job loss, the mother’s opportunity cost of time decreases, so she may become more engaged in time-intensive activities that benefit babies’ health, such as prenatal care,physical exerciseor breast-feeding (Miller and Urdinola, 2010), and her exposure to hazardous working conditions decreases. One may also consider channels that are not propelled through actual job loss. First, recessions are associated with less traffic and lower air pollution levels (Chay and Greenstone, 2003). Air pollution, in turn, has been shown to be an important determinant of newborn health (seeCurrie, Zivin, Mullins, Neidell, 2014,Currie, Zivin, Mullins, Neidell, 2014, for a review of the literature). Second, while job loss has been associated with stress, lower workloads in recessions might reduce job-related stress for those who do not lose their job, and positivespilloversamong parents are likely. There is plenty of evidence that stress affects birth outcomes, in particular during the first trimester of pregnancy (Bozzoli, Quintana-Domeque, 2014,Camacho, 2008,Foureaux Koppensteiner, Manacorda, 2016,Lee, Orsini, 2018,Mansour, Rees, 2012,Torche, 2011). Third, economic upturns might be characterized by a shortage of medical staff, resulting in lower availability and quality of prenatal and neonatal care (Stevens et al., 2015). The latter mechanism, however, could also work in the opposite direction if the enlarged tax revenues brought about by upturns are used to increase the quantity and quality of medical staff (Konetzka et al., 2018).In the light of the importance of the issues at hand, it is perhaps surprising that there is only little evidence for developed countries.Margerison-Zilko (2010)does an extensive literature search and finds about 15 studies, almost all of which concern aggregate data. One major complication in estimating the effect of the cycle is that women who give birth in a recession may systematically differ from those who give birth in a boom.Dehejia and Lleras-Muney (2004)argue that low-educated women – who do not suffer from skill depreciation – prefer to give birth in recessions when the wage they would receive is low. The authors provide evidence that the fraction of low-educated mothers indeed rises in times of high unemployment, at least for white mothers. The effect is reversed for black mothers, a finding thatDehejia and Lleras-Muney (2004)attribute tocredit constraints. In this line of reasoning, low-educated black mothers would also prefer to give birth in recessions, but cannot afford to do so since credit constraints prevent them from smoothing income over time.Salvanes (2013)andAparicio and González (2014)find that low-educated mothers are overrepresented in recessions.The composition of newborns has also been studied in the literature on long-run health effects of conditions at birth. After all, late-life health problems among cohorts exposed to adverse early-life conditions may be affected by selective fertility in the corresponding birth years. Most of these studies do focus on what are now developed countries; however, the birth cohorts are from years in which governmental social safety nets were largely absent. Some studies examine how exposure relates to birth rates or to the composition of newborns in terms of observed characteristics of the families into which they are born, following the line of reasoning that if such a relation exists then it is also more likely that there are systematic differences between exposed and non-exposed in terms of unobserved characteristics of the families.Van den Berg and Modin (2013)provide an overview of those studies (see e.g.Kåreholt, 2001,van den Berg, Lindeboom, López, 2009,van den Berg, Doblhammer-Reiter, Christensen, 2011). They all conclude that the composition of newborns does not vary systematically over the business cycle.One approach to deal with compositional changes over the business cycle is to compare babies born to the same mother at different stages of the cycle. Econometrically, this may be achieved by including motherfixed effectsin the model equations, which requires individual-level data. Interestingly, whenDehejia and Lleras-Muney (2004), who study the U.S., control for mother fixed effects using a subsample from California, the positive effects on the health of newborns become all insignificant, suggesting that selection had been the main driver. Other studies of developed countries employing fixed-effects identification strategies also fail to establish a significant relationship with the cycle (Salvanes, 2013,Salvanes, 2013, for Norway andAparicio and González, 2014, for Spain).4Most studies of developing countries find their results unaltered when accounting for selection bias (Baird, Friedman, Schady, 2011,Bhalotra, 2010,Paxson, Schady, 2005).Van den Berg and Modin (2013)consider individual records from Swedish birth cohorts 1915–1929, where birth weight was recorded at birth by health care workers. Note that at that time, Sweden was not yet a developed economy according to today’s standards. They find no relationship between the national business cycle and birth weight, both in basic analyses and in fixed-effects analyses with mother-specific fixed effects.Van den Berg et al. (2017b)use family-specific fixed-effects in the analysis of long-run effects of conditions at birth among Dutch birth cohorts around 1850 on individual longevity, and they subsequently examine the distribution of the estimated unobserved family-specific fixed effects over the various birth years. They find no evidence of an association between conditions around birth on the one hand, and the unobserved family-specific “frailty” determinant of longevity on the other hand.This paper contributes to existing literature in several important ways. First, we shed new light on the relationship between economic conditions and newborn health in developed countries using data from Sweden. The data come from population-wide registers spanning the years 1992 to 2004; they include comprehensive information of infant health and conditions around birth, from the neonatal and patient registers. All information is recorded at the individual level and in real time by professional health care workers. We match these data with monthly local-labour-market unemployment rates which provide indicators of the business cycle. Exploiting geographical variation in unemployment within Sweden, we control for variables that may confound a relation between economic conditions and newborns’ health.Second, we improve upon previous strategies of controlling for selective fertility. The data provide identifiers of the mother and father, which enable us to compare health outcomes of babies born to the same parents. In this way, we control for the possibility that parents select into pregnancy depending on the state of the business cycle. Most existing studies on developed countries could at most use mother fixed effects to address selective fertility. An exception isAparicio and González (2014), who also use parents fixed effects but have less detailed unemployment information.5Unlike all these studies, this paper is the first that controls for selective fertility and finds robust evidence for countercyclical effects on newborn health: Higher unemployment significantly reduces the incidence of neonatal mortality and very low birth weight. Our point estimates suggest that a one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate is associated with a ca. 10% decrease in these health outcomes, but standard errors are quite large. The effect is entirely driven by the unemployment rate of men. We also find evidence for selective fertility over the cycle, which underlines the importance of controlling for parental fixed effects.6Third, we exploit the rich socio-economic anddemographicinformation about the parents to explore some of the underlying mechanisms. First of all, we consider the role of actual parental unemployment, which is more prevalent in times of recessions. This sheds some light on whether health-enhancing activities – due to lower opportunity cost of time – or reduced smoking and drinking – due to lower available income – drive the estimated effects. We find that parental job loss does not play an important role in mediating the beneficial effects of recessions. As a next step, we investigate whether the effects vary by socio-economic status (SES) of the parents. Low-SES parents tend to be hit harder by recessions. We also find that recessions decrease the occurrence of premature birth. Somewhat speculatively, these findings are in line with a pathway through air pollution which is plausibly reduced in recessions and has been shown to disproportionately affect low-SES families and to provoke premature birth in prior work. Our paper also contributes to the literature on birth weight determinants. In particular, the effect sizes on the incidence of low birth weight may be compared to those due to other interventions (Currie, Cole, 1993,Kaestner, Lee, 2005,Kramer, 1987).This paper is structured as follows:Sections 2and3explain the data andeconometricmethod, respectively.Section 4presents the results, starting with an analysis of selective fertility. We then report baseline effects on newborn health, followed by a sensitivity analysis, and an investigation into heterogeneity and potential mechanisms.Section 5concludes.",Gerard,Alexander,Steffen
"1. IntroductionThe use of credit information for employment screening has increased significantly over the last two decades (seeFig. 1), withindustrysurveys indicating use by approximately 47 percent of employers (Society for Human Resource Management 2012). This screening tool has come under fire, though, by politicians andcommunitygroups that claim it unfairly penalizes those who have suffered from unemployment, medical debt, family breakup, or “individual bad luck” (Traub 2016). Anti-screening activists further argue that there is no research linking credit history to job performance, credit reports often contain errors, andbankruptcyand other negative credit events are caused by outside events, not “over-consumption.”1,2There is also concern that these checks might disproportionately affect minority applicants (Traub 2013). In response to these fears, a number of state governments have passed laws restricting the use of credit information by employers. The first of these laws was passed in Washington in 2007, and, as of this writing, 10 states and three municipalities have such laws on the books. Thirty-one other states have considered similar laws. This practice has come under scrutiny at the federal level as well. For example, theEqual Employment OpportunityCommission recently noted in a discussion letter, “if an employer's use of credit information disproportionately excludes African-American and Hispanic candidates, the practice would be unlawful unless the employer could establish that the practice is needed.”3Download :Download high-res image (109KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. Use of Credit Checks by Employers, 1996–2012Percentage of Employers Conducting Credit ChecksSource: Society for Human Resource Management, Survey of Hiring Managers, periodic Survey on the Use of Credit Checks in Hiring Decisions.Although employer credit checks are now pervasive and state and local bans on the use of credit information have become increasingly popular, until recently little research has been done to date on their economic impact.4In this paper, we explore this impact using data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Consumer Credit Panel/Equifax. These data contain a five percent random sample that is representative of all individuals in the United States who have a credit history and whose credit file includes the individual's social security number. This large dataset allows us to measure properties of the Equifax Risk Score5(subsequently referred to as “risk score”) distribution for extremely detailed geographies like census tracts. We pair this credit information with data on employment outcomes for these geographies from the LEHD Origin Destination Employment Statistics (LODES), described inSection 2below. By comparing outcomes across tracts—and within residence tracts, across employment destinations—we are able to measure the relative impact of these laws on low-risk score populations.We find, robustly, that these bans shifted employment to residents of low-credit score census tracts. Our baseline specifications indicate that low-credit score tract6residents (for example, those with an average credit score below 620) saw employment increase by roughly 3.7–7.5 percent. The LODES data contain information on both the residence of the employees and the location of employment. The residence location-employer location nature of the LODES data enables us to cleanly identify this effect by exploiting variationwithinresidents of a tract across employment locations with and without the bans. These shifts, in percentage terms, were in relatively higher-paying jobs. Across industries, employers in the public sector were most affected by these bans, followed by those in transportation and warehousing, and in-home services. This pattern makes sense, as both compliance and previous use of risk score information in hiring are likely to have been high in the public sector and in highly regulated industries, such as transportation and information, which often provide employees access to secure facilities, goods, customers’ residences, andprivate information. Employers failing to perform background checks in these industries could possibly be held legally liable for damage caused by the employee. Employment in construction and food services declined among residents of low-risk score tracts following these bans, as people shifted to better-paying jobs. As expected, employment in the financial sector, which is typically exempt from these bans, was unaffected by the introduction of these laws.Although employment relatively increased for people living in the lowest-risk score tracts following a ban, we find that these relative increases were mirrored by relative employment declines for those living in mediocre risk score tracts (for example, those with average scores between 630 and 650). Using new data on 74 million online job postings collected by Burning Glass Technologies, we rationalize this finding by exploring employer experience and education requirements for new hires. A relatively larger fraction of jobs in low credit score areas began requiring college degrees and prior work experience following a ban on credit screening. This is important evidence of substitution across signals by employers. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of signal substitution in this context.The elimination of a signal of worker quality also raises the possibility of increased statistical discrimination based ondemographiccharacteristics. To explore the net impact of these bans on minority populations, we used data from the American Community Survey Integrated Public Use Micro Data. We compared labor market outcomes for blacks in states with and without bans, relative to prior trends and conditional on individual controls. We find that the introduction of a ban is associated with a 1 percentage point increase in the likelihood of being unemployed for prime-age blacks compared with the contemporaneous change for whites. Thus, it appears that the prohibition of credit screening and the increased emphasis on other signals may actually, relatively,harmminority applicants.This paper contributes to an important empirical literature on signals in employer screening. Several studies (Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2004;Kroft et al., 2013;Correll et al., 2007) have demonstrated the importance of implicit signals like race, work history, and family status, in experimental contexts. Fewer studies have looked at the availability of such signals and their equilibrium effects in a non-experimental context. Seminal papers in that vein includeAutor and Scarborough (2008)andWozniak (2015). Both papers demonstrate that some signals that seem to penalize minority applicants—a retail personality quiz and drug screening, respectively—actually may not do so in equilibrium. Relatedly,Holzer et al. (2006)shows that employers who check criminal records are more likely to hire blacks, althoughFinlay (2009)finds that people without criminal records from high-incarceration demographic groups do not have better labor market outcomes with increased testing.Adams (2004)provides evidence thatlegislationprohibiting the use of age by employers raises employment for older workers, andGoldin and Rouse (2000)shows that eliminating gender signals increases employment for women among musicians.7Finally,Modestino et al. (2015a,2015b)show, using similar job vacancy data from Burning Glass Technologies, that employer demands for signals like education and experience are sensitive to labor market conditions.Very recently, there have been several papers exploring the relationship between the existence of credit score information and employment generally.Bos et al. (2016)look at the effect of a Swedish law that removed negative credit information from some reports and found significant employment increases. Conversely,Dobbie et al. (2016)andHerkenhoff et al. (2016)find that removal of bankruptcy flags in credit reports – which occur after seven years for Chapter 13 filers and ten years for Chapter 7 filers – has small employment effects. This is perhaps not surprising, given the relatively minor impact of the flag's removal on credit scores themselves (approximately 10 to 15 points on average) documented byDobbie et al. (2016). These studies explore the impact of the existence of this specific type of older credit information for all context (including borrowing), not just its availability to employers.8Additionally, there are a handful of contemporaneous papers that look employer credit check bans in standard microdata series.Fredberg et al. (2016)use the SIPP to look at the impact of employer credit check bans for those who report having difficulty paying their bills. They find increases in the job finding hazard, though they detect no impact on minority groups (perhaps due to sample size issues).Bartik and Nelson (2016)use CPS data and find that bans are associated with reduced job finding rates for Blacks using a difference-in-differences approach.Relative to this literature, our paper makes three central contributions. First, it uses a rich and novel data set allows us to provide a highly robust and cleanly identified estimate of the impact of an economically important screening ban on employment outcomes. The identification does not rely on a single aspect of one's credit report, such as an older bankruptcy flag, or on indirect proxies such as race. Second, the paper provides some of the first evidence of large-scalesignal substitutionby employers and confirms that this substitution has disparate impact across demographic groups. This analysis provides some of the first real world evidence of this phenomenon.9Lastly, the paper provides an empirical framework for convincingly identifying the impact of state and locallabor lawsthat target attributes that cannot be easily linked at the individual level, like risk scores. Many labor market laws—like those dealing with undocumented workers or those dealing with mental health issues—fall into this category, and the worker location-employer location identification framework described here has the potential to be useful in these situations.Our paper also contributes to a growing literature on credit scores themselves, the information they contain, and their potential racial bias.Iyer et al. (2015)shows that credit score information is correlated with non-quantifiable signals of borrower quality, including appearance.Cohen Cole (2011)shows that lenders treat credit scores differently in heavily black areas. Finally, several papers have shown that while credit scores differ across racial groups, these scores nevertheless contain information about creditworthiness not captured by demographic characteristics. (Avery et al., 2012;Board of Governors, 2007).It is important to note that this paper estimates employment gains for residents of low credit score tracts relative to those living in mid- and high-score tracts. Our specification are designed to measure these relative effects within small geographies. In the paper, we interpret these relative gains as reflecting shifts in which workers get jobs, not overall increases, and our language reflects that. Our interpretation stems from the findings, reported in AppendixTable 3, of small and insignificant effects of an un-interacted dummy for a credit check law in a standard cross-state differences-in-differences specification in our data.We do not presume that there are nogeneral equilibriumeffects. Cotes et al. (2018) find that aggregate job vacancies decline following a credit check ban. This impact can be rationalized in a model with employer screening and risky credit, such as the one constructed byCorbae and Glover (2018). That paper summarizes the model by saying “a policy banning pre-employment credit screening… has both direct and indirect effects on the equilibrium. First, as expected by policy markets, there is a redistribution of wages from high to low credit score workers…. However, there is also an indirect effect on the equilibrium that lowers welfare for everyone.” Thee exercise here, we believe, is best reflective of the redistribution channel discussed above, and is not well suited to measure the broader general equilibrium mechanisms.Further, credit check bans may affect firm decisions beyond the decision whom to hire. In principle, these bans may also affect the location in which firms operate as well as the absolute number of employees hired. We explore the possibility of firm relocation in appendixTables 3and6and conclude these effects are small. Some industries may respond differently, though, and this heterogeneity may be an areThe paper proceeds as follows.Section 2provides a brief description of the Consumer Credit Panel, LODES, and Burning Glass data, along with summary statistics on tract-level outcomes.

"1. Introduction and literature reviewThe international financial crisis and the associatedbankingand sovereign crises shook many European economies. Policy reactions to these events ranged from institutional reforms, to country-specific programmes for balance-of-payments problems, and to formal agreements2between countries and their lenders to engage in deep and wide-ranging structural reforms. Government involvement in assisting or rescuing banks increased fiscal burdens andausteritymeasures were typically first adopted in the public sector. These included pay freezes, pay cuts, and other reforms related to the terms of employment. These crises may have also produced voluntary adjustments in pay or terms of employment in the private sector, modifying the impact of austerity on the public-private sector wage gap.In the context of positive public sector wage gaps,3which were especially large in countries that were forced to seek external financial assistance, austerity measures in the public sector were typically front-loaded and they produced needed fiscal savings. However, further important policy questions are whether (i) austerityloweredorincreasedpublic-private sector wage gaps, (ii) these measures occurred in the context of public sector wage gaps which wereunexplainedby available data orexplainedby observable characteristics in the two sectors, and (iii) austerity measures impacted all quantiles of wage gap distributions proportionately, or whether they influenced their overall shape.Whether public sector austerity had the obvious arithmetic impact on the wage gap (question (i)) depended on possible wage adjustments in the private sector. In countries where, for a given degree of public sector austerity and labour market tightness, the private sector did not reduce wage costs substantially (this may not have been warranted, or it may have reflected underlying rigidities in wage setting), public sector austerity probably led to an arithmetic decrease in the pay gap. However, in countries where the private sector responded flexibly and more aggressively to reduce costs, the result could have been an increase in the public-private wage gap. Indeed, eight of the nineteen countries implementing austerity measures saw their unexplained wage gap increase between 2007 and 2013 – seeTable 3. To the extent that a decrease in a large wage gap was an independent policy objective relating to the literature surveyed below, the impact on this gap needs to be explored.Lowering the wage gap may or may not be an economically desirable objective (issue (ii)). This should depend on thenatureof the pre-crisis public-private sector wage premium. In the context of standard Mincer wage equations for the two sectors, decomposition of the public-private wage gap into anexplainedportion attributable to observable characteristics (e.g. education) and a component which isunexplainedby the available regressors suggests a variety of associatedpolicy issues. Where the wage gap is large andunexplained, an independent target of lowering the total gap might be both economically desirable and feasible.On the other hand, a country's pay gap may beexplainedby the prevailing employee characteristics in the two sectors, in turn reflecting the nature of the country's history and sectoral specialisations.4In these cases, an independent target of reducing the public-private wage gap may not be economically desirable.Issue (iii) above complicates these considerations considerably: It is by no means the case that a public-private wage gap, which is on average positive, will reflect an upward, parallel, displacement of the private sector wage distribution. Nor is it clear that public sector austerity will lead to a parallel, downward, shift of the public wage distribution. Indeed, as will be seen below, public sector austerity measures in a number of countries shielded low-paidpublic servantsfrom their effects.The issues posed above are central to a number of theoretical papers which are breaking new ground on how the public sector should be placed in the overall economy. Some of this literature notes that the appropriate public-private wage gap should depend on frictions such as the relative separation rates in the two sectors: The calibration inGomes (2014)suggests that, because of greater job security and a lower public sector separation rate, the wage rate there should be 2.5% lower than in the private sector.Gomes (2018), suggests that, in the context of a UK calibration, aligning the public sector wage distribution to the private sector one would reduce the steady state unemployment rate by 1.4 percentage points.Bradley et al. (2017)examine the impact of public sector austerity measures in a structural model with a public sector and search frictions. They find very modest overall effects but changes in the composition of employment in favour of the private sector and a serious decrease in the share of skilled public sector employment when the public sector wage cuts are progressive. A scarcity of skilled public servants may have deleterious effects on the ability of a country to cope with the demands of an increasingly complex world. If the wage gap is high for the low-skilled and low or negative for the high-skilled, inefficiencies may be at work at both ends of the wage distribution – seeGomes (2018, p. 1470). Thus the quantile structure of the public-private wage gap is important. A number of other papers also involve the public-private sector wage gap.Chassamboulli and Gomes (2019b)explore a formalisation ofnepotismwhere some public sector jobs are reserved for agents who are willing to pay a cost for networking. The model has awealthof implications for unemployment and welfare which depend on, inter alia, the (exogenous) publicminusthe (Nash) private wage gap.Cavalcanti and dos Santos (2015)focus on the allocational effects of the public sector. Finally, through several possible mechanisms,5high public sector wages can spill into the private sector, modifying the public-private sector wage gap.These are all important issues for public policy, and much remains to be learned about the impact of the crises and public sector austerity on the patterns of public-private wages in Europe. A number of authors have considered the effects of crises on individual countries:Nikolic et al. (2017)examined the impact of the crisis in Croatia and Serbia, comparing the wage gap in 2008 and 2011.Christopoulou and Monastiriotis (2015)investigated experience in Greece during 2009–2013.Depalo (2018)focussed on identification issues for the wage gap in Italy, following the wage freeze imposed in 2010.Ramos et al. (2014),Anton and Munoz de Bustillo (2015), andHospido and Benito (2016)studied the experience of Spain. These indicative studies provide valuable local information on the impact of public sector austerity, taking into account country idiosyncrasies and circumstances and using a variety of methodologies.6Yet, the sweep of the crises and austerity measures taken were so drastic as to warrant a broader, comparable, study of as many European countries as data sources will allow. With a large enough number of countries, informativepatternsof (i) country preparedness for crises, (ii) the type and severity of the crises experienced, (iii) the measures taken, and (iv) their effects on the relative wage structures within countries, can be discerned. We use cross section data from the EU SILC survey years 2008 to 2014, pertaining to incomes in 2007 (the last year during which all countries exhibited growth) and up to 2013 (the last crisis year for most European countries), to analyse the wage gap in 31 European countries. Given the differences in the application of restraint in these countries, we also explore changes in the wage gap across the quantiles of the wage distribution. Finally, we consider the impact of austerity measures in the public sector, coded as wage freezes and cuts, on the public-private wage gap at the mean and at different quantiles of the Unexplained Gap distribution.Extant studies do examine cross sections of European countries.Giordano et al. (2011)andDepalo et al. (2015)study the wage gap for the pre-crises period, using the EU SILC 2004–2007 for 10 countries.De Castro et al. (2013)consider the wage gap in 26 countries for the two years 2006 and 2010, using the Structure of Earnings Survey.Campos et al. (2017)appears to be the only other cross-country study of the wage gap during the crisis years. They use data from the EU SILC for the income years 2003–2011 for 25 countries and macroNational Accountsdata for 19 countries for the period 1970–2014. Their main focus is the structural determinants of wage gaps across countries, noting that improvements in the cyclically adjusted primary balance are associated with significant decreases in the public sector wage gap. This concern harks back to the budget constraint mechanism raised inFernandez-de-Cordoba et al. (2012).Campos et al. (2017)also note that wage gaps narrowed over time, possibly due to the crises.The current paper appears to be the first to record the austerity measures taken during the recent international and sovereign crises and to study their impact for so many countries, using data and methods that are consistent cross-sectionally. We consider whether the austerity measures taken had an impact on the public-private wage gap, its explained and unexplained components and its quantile architecture. With the patterns of external assistance in mind, we construct the cluster of countries that were minimally affected by the crises, and the group of countries that were forced to seek external financial assistance. We find strong wage gap commonalities within these. With the exception of Ireland, which is grouped as a medium-gap country, countries that sought external financial assistance are all in the high wage gap group, while countries that did not take austerity measures during the period studied were generally in thelow wagegap cluster. We note this pattern, but stop short of attributing causality. We also show that wage reductions in the public sector often resulted in a lower or even negative public-private wage gap for its highly paid employees, while their impact on the gap for its low-paid employees was often positive. These common experiences are not obvious from individual country studies or cross-sectional efforts based on a smaller number of countries. Our findings complement the work of the theoretical papers above and should assist in the formation of policy for the public sector.Section 2describes the austerity measures adopted in Europe.Section 3describes the data used.Section 4presents the average wage gap and its decomposition into the explained and unexplained components.Section 5studies the wage gap, explained and unexplained, at different quantiles for the two years 2007 and 2013.Section 6examines econometrically the impact of wage freezes and cuts on the unexplained wage gap at the median, the 10th, the 90th, and the difference between these quantiles.

"1. IntroductionIt is well established that an increase in unemployment insurance (UI) increases unemployment duration.1Two primary channels have been put forward to understand the connection between UI and unemployment duration. First, UI extensions may decrease a worker’s overall search effort and therefore increases the time spent unemployed. Second, UI may increase the worker’s reservation wage and therefore increase their duration of unemployment as the worker turns downlow wagejobs.2In this paper we investigate how a change in a worker’s search effort affects his unemployment duration by asking: is the arrival rate of a job offer independent from the wage it pays?If the job arrival rate is independent of the wage offer, as with search models in the spirit ofPissarides (2000), then UI affects a worker’s overall job finding rate changing their search intensity and changing the set of acceptable wage offers. On the other hand, if UI affects a worker’s search behavior and their likelihood of finding high wage jobs relative to low or medium wage jobs (as with search models in the spirit ofMoen (1997)), then the effect of UI is more subtle. To test for such a relationship between job arrival rates and wages, we ask whether the semi-elasticity of the hazard rate with respect to UI receipt is constant across the wage distribution. We formally test this assumption using a mixed proportional hazards competing risks (MPHCR) model, with data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97). We find that the semi-elasticity of the hazard with respect to UI is not constant across the wage distribution, suggesting that the arrival rate of a job offer depends on the wage that it pays. We then decompose the increase in unemployment duration caused by UI and find that the correlation between arrival rates and wages accounts for about 9% of the increase in the duration of unemployment.Our paper contributes to the empirical literature testing the effect of UI on unemployment duration as well as re-employment wages. With respect to unemployment duration we find positive effects of similar magnitude to recent research using administrative data from Europe (for exampleSchmieder et al. (2012)). The empirical literature on wage effects is mixed:Lalive (2007),Schmieder et al. (2016)andCard et al. (2007)find small negative effects of UI on subsequent wages while others such asBlack et al. (2003)andNekoei and Weber (2017)find positive effects.3We find that UI has positive wage effects for individuals who receive UI, although they experience longer average durations of unemployment. While most recent papers take a reduced form approach, which allows these papers to test the effect of UI on unemployment duration and the resulting wage, our approach accounts for durations and wages jointly, allowing us to analyze how UI affects search behavior and job finding rates across the wage distribution.The paper proceeds as follows: inSection 2we formally outline the framework we use to test the independence of job arrival rates and wage offers. InSection 3we discuss the data and issues of selection. InSection 4we derive the likelihood function and the empirical test of the effect of UI on the hazard rate of leaving unemployment. InSection 5we discuss the results and the robustness of the results.Section 6concludes.",Christine,Bryan,Benjamin
"1. IntroductionUndocumented immigrants make up 3.5% of the U.S. population, and 5.1 percent of its labor force (Krogstad and Passel, 2015). Yet, their labor supply, assimilation and ability to contribute to the U.S. economy is likely to depend on their ability to drive. Spatially decentralized urban and suburban areas make the United States one of the top motor-vehicle dependent countries in the world.2For many low-skilled workers living further away from high-density job areas having access to a car is a necessity to get to work (Raphael and Rice, 2002). We examine how states’ granting of driving privileges to undocumented migrants may impact their employment and wages.Several states have recently enacted measures granting undocumented immigrants access todriver's licenses. Access to a driver's license can significantly lower the commuting costs of many undocumented immigrants by reducing their probability of being charged with driving without a license during a police stop. Such a charge can result in getting their car impounded, fines, potential loss of earnings if unable to get to work, not to mention required court appearances that can lead to deportation.3Whereas undocumented immigrants have been shown to be more risk tolerant than documented immigrants (Dustmannet al., 2017), many fear the higher risk of apprehension and deportation in the current immigration enforcement environment. In this regard, fifty percent of undocumented migrants who return to Mexico in theEncuesta de Migraciόn de la Frontera Norte(EMIF) report fearing deportation while residing in U.S. states adopting immigration enforcement measures (Amuedo-Doranteset al., 2013). Media reports have documented how children are left alone when their parents are taken into custody by immigration authorities after being stopped by the police and charged with driving without a license.4Indeed, traffic violations are among the top reasons for being detained.5In contrast, undocumented migrants with a valid driver's license may be allowed to drive away after a traffic stop after providing proof of identity and eligibility to drive.6As such, a standard labor supply model would predict that, by lowering the risk associated with driving to work, access to a driver's license can lower commuting costs, raise the expected return from working and increase labor supply.Using 2005 through 2017 data from the AmericanCommunitySurvey, we exploit the state and temporal variation in the granting of driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants to estimate its impact on this population's employment likelihood, weekly hours of work and real hourly wages. We find that likely undocumented men increase their labor supply in response to the availability of driver's licenses, although modestly. Specifically, likely undocumented men raise their weekly work hours by 1.6%. These findings hold after taking into account the possible endogenous adoption of a state policy granting driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants and the non-random residential choices made by undocumented immigrants. They are also unique to our sample of likely undocumented men, as similarly skilled, foreign-born, Hispanic, long-term resident, naturalized counterparts do not exhibit a significant response to the policy.We also investigate the mechanisms through which the policy impacts are likely to take place by exploring changes in likely undocumented migrants’ work commuting patterns. Even in states that do not grant unauthorized migrants driver's licenses, 78% of likely undocumented immigrant men in our sample indicate using a motor vehicle to get to work, and only 29% of them carpool. Therefore, it is not surprising to find that their work commuting options remain largely unchanged by states’ granting of driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants. However, their daily one-way work commuting time slightly rises by 3%. We also find evidence of access to driver's licenses increasing the propensity of having a job that requires driving, such as driving a bus or taxi, by 25%.Our paper contributes to a growing body of work examining the impact of a variety of recently adopted tougher interior enforcement measures on undocumented immigrants and their families (e.g.Bohnet al.,2014;Miles and Cox, 2014;Amuedo-Doranteset al.,2018;Kostandiniet al.,2013;Watson, 2014). To this date, analyses of undocumented immigrants’ employment outcomes have been primarily focused on the impact of tougher interior immigration enforcement measures, such as employment verification mandates (e.g.Amuedo-Dorantes and Bansak, 2012;Bohn and Lofstrom, 2013;Orrenius and Zavodny, 2015). Compared to previous studies, which focused on measures challenging the assimilation of undocumented migrants, we look at a policy measure that should facilitate the assimilation of undocumented migrants by allowing them to drive more safely with proper identification and proof of eligibility to drive. To our knowledge, this is the first paper examining how state-level regulation regarding the issuing of a driver's license to undocumented immigrants is affecting their labor market outcomes nationwide.",Catalina,Esther,Almudena
"1. IntroductionAcross developed economies, many children participate in part-time employment alongside compulsory schooling.OECDfigures from 2015 show 30% of 15 year-olds in the United States taking paid work, 23% in the United Kingdom, 18% in Germany and 14% in France. Declining participation in part-time work by teenagers in the UK has been blamed by employers’ organizations for young adults being increasingly ill-prepared for full-time employment, with negative implications for workforce productivity and economic growth (UK Commission on Employment and Skills, 2015). Working while still in education may improve teenagers’ stock of cognitive and non-cognitive human capital, in the form of financial literacy, communication skills, and lower discount rates (Light, 2001,Oettinger, 1999), but could also crowd out time allocated to productive educational ‘investments’ (Becker, 1965,Ruhm, 1997). Since qualifications obtained from compulsory education help determine subsequent education opportunities, the effect of in-school employment on test scores is likely to restrict or enhance trajectories of human capital accumulation over a much longer period (Dustmann and van Soest, 2007). Indeed, in the UK there remains a significant direct wage return to obtaining more age-16 academic qualifications, and at higher grades, even holding constant qualifications obtained later (Dearden et al., 2002,McIntosh, 2006).In this paper we evaluate the effect of part-time work during school term-time at age 15 on educational performance at age 16 and retention in full-time education, unemployment experience, earnings, and occupational attainment up to age 25. Our contribution is to identify both the ‘policy effect’ effect of part-time work, and its parameter in the ‘production function’ for educational or labour market performance. The ‘policy effect’ includes indirect effects of resulting changes to other inputs, while the ‘production function parameter’ is the direct effect holding these other inputs constant. This distinction, and the mechanisms underlying it, matter for policy implications in education. For example,De Fraja et al., (2010)andDatar and Mason (2008)show that students and parents substitute school inputs for their own, meaning that policy effects of increased school quality are expected to understate such interventions’ benefits in the education production function. In our application, it is important to know both whether part-time work as a teenager fosters accumulation or effective signalling of human capital, and the extent to which any such benefits are reduced or outweighed by crowding out of educational investments.We use data from “Next Steps”, a longitudinal survey tracking a cohort born in 1989–90 and attending school in England in 2004, up to age 25 in 2015. FollowingTyler (2003),Rothstein, (2007)andKalenkoski and Pabilonia (2010)’s studies on part-time work and the educational performance of US High School students, we obtain identification by using time-varying indicators of local labour market opportunities for teenagers asinstrumental variablesfor in-school employment, namely the youth unemployment rate and density of small businesses in the retail, wholesale, hotel and restaurant sectors. In our range of outcome variables, we followRuhm (1997), who adopts a similar IV approach and finds a positive effect of teenage part-time work on total and hourly earnings and occupational attainment between 6 and 9 years after High Schoolgraduationdespite a negative effect on completed education; andHotz et al. (2002)who show the long-run positive effects on wages to be small and statistically insignificant once they account for individuals’ entire history of work experience.We are guided by and contribute to two further related literatures. The first is on the relationships between part-time work, educational performance, and teenagers’ allocation of time, attitude to schoolwork, and consumption patterns.Sabia (2009)finds few important effects of part-time work on schooling-related attitudes and investments among 12–15 year-olds, whileKalenkoski and Pabilonia, 2009,Kalenkoski and Pabilonia, 2012find an additional hour of employment reduces homework time by 11min, with significant crowd-out also of screen time, sport, and other extra-curricular activities. Meanwhile, part-time work may facilitate contemporaneous consumption of risky substances (alcohol, cigarettes and cannabis) through the child’s budget constraint (Markowitz and Tauras, 2006) or exposure to different peers (Clark and Lohéac, 2007) either in the working environment or by providing more opportunities freely to associate without parental supervision (Lee, 2013). The next piece of the puzzle is whether these changes in behaviour have independent effects on performance.Kalenkoski and Pabilonia (2017)show that marginal homework time has positive effects on academic achievement only for boys, who devote less time to homework on average, whileRees and Sabia (2010)yield no strong evidence that sporting participation enhancesacademic performancesof adolescents of either sex. Alcohol, cigarette and drug consumption have all been shown to reduce educational performance and retention (Bray, Jeremy, Zarkin, Gary, Ringwalt, Chris, Qi, Junfent, 2000,Yan and Brocksen, 2013), with onlyDee and Evans (2003)finding no direct effects of alcohol consumption.The second literature is on the bias in estimates of returns to education caused by part-time work experience.Light (2001)shows the returns to an additional year of schooling in the original NLSY (1979) cohort are at least 25% higher when in-school work experience is omitted. The direction of this effect is robust to analysis on more recent cohorts (Ashworth et al. 2017). HoweverHotz et al. (2002), show that the return to “school plus work” can be lower than “school only”. This accords with the time allocation literature, suggesting that part-time work can reduce the quality or quantity of engagement with education during nominally “full-time schooling”. Analogously toLight (2001), our research questions can be stated: “How does the causal effect of part-time work change when the education enhancing role of study time is netted out?” and “How does the causal effect of part-time work change when the wage enhancing role of school performance is netted out?”.We analyse how the magnitude of each of these effects differ by sex, in contrast to the prior literature on part-time work during schooling which has focused intentionally on males (Hotz et al., 2002,Light, 2001,Molitor and Leigh, 2005), or consideredgender differencesonly as a robustness check (Tyler, 2003, who finds no differences) or a control variable (Kalenkoski and Pabilonia, 2010). We find a significant negative total or ‘policy effect’ of age-15 part-time work on age 16 educational performance that is somewhat larger (effect size of 6.7% of astandard deviationper hour worked per week) for females than males (2.5%). We also show that part-time work crowds out study time, attitude to schoolwork, and ‘active leisure’ (sporting and music) activities, and facilitates consumption of risky substances. Holding these constant, the production function parameter is negative but smaller and statistically insignificant. We find detrimental or zero total effects of age-15 part-time work on labour market performance by age 25, including duration of unemployment for both sexes, and occupational attainment for women. These results appears substantially to be driven by reduced educational performance at age 16. The direct effect of part-time work at age 15 on these outcomes is somewhat beneficial.",Angus,None,None
"1. IntroductionThe canonical model of earnings assumes log-normal shocks and linear dynamics, although both assumptions have been challenged based on the data. Relaxing these assumptions matters for at least three reasons. First, deviations of labor earnings shocks from log-normality lead to the overestimation of upward earnings mobility. Models based on normal processes are known to overestimate the probability of an individual with low earnings having high earnings in the future (Horowitz, Markatou, 1996,Lillard, Willis, 1978). Hence, a diagnosis of labor marketinequalitiesalong the lifecycle based on Gaussianity assumptions suffers from excessive optimism that is likely to be detrimental to the workers in question, who are possibly trapped at the bottom of the distribution. Second, knowledge about the distributional properties of hourly wage growth and earnings is crucial for quantifyingprecautionary savingsand labor supply (Jessen et al., 2018) and other reactions to fluctuations as a first step. Third, welfare costs associated with fluctuations in labor earnings (quantified for instance byPijoan-Mas, 2006, under incomplete markets) are likely to be underestimated under log-normality on wage growth combined with linearity assumptions on earnings dynamics. In addition to deviations from Gaussianity, nonlinear dynamics of labor income have a first-order impact on consumption and saving behavior; a better understanding of income processes helps fill the gap between income and consumption inequalities. Taking both the nonlinearity and the non-Gaussianity of income dynamics into account is therefore essential when designing optimal social insurance anddirect taxation.Arellano et al. (2017)show, for instance, that nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity generate heterogeneous consumption responses and that assuming linearity instead is misleading when assessing the impact of earnings shocks. Large, negative income shocks are responsible for relatively small consumption drops at the bottom of the distribution but have sizable effects at the top. By contrast, large, positive shocks seem more profitable in the short run at the bottom of the distribution, but this effect vanishes in the long run. Under the canonical model, the effect of earnings shocks on consumption is assumed to be homogeneous regardless of the location in the distribution.This paper investigates the channels through which deviations from normality and nonlinear dynamics occur by relying on an accounting decomposition of labor earnings into hourly wages and working time at both the extensive and intensive margins; the infra-annual extensive margin upon which we focus in this paper refers to participation in the labor market, captured by the annual number of days worked, while the intensive margin designates the daily number of hours worked, i.e., the annual number of hours worked divided by the annual number of workdays. We build in particular on recent works (Guvenen et al., 2016) that quantify the importance of deviations from Gaussianity. We adopt an agnostic perspective on French labor earnings data and characterize the distribution of earnings changes conditional on recent earnings history. The novelty of our approach consists in decomposing earnings into several components (wage, days worked, number of hours worked per day) thanks to available information on working time. When assessing the importance of the deviation from log-normality, we are able to disentangle what is due to hourly wages from what is related to working time at both margins. We rely on the DADS (Déclaration Annuelle de Données Sociales) panel, a longitudinal administrative database, the completion of which is mandatory forpayroll taxesand that contains information on individuals’ labor earnings. We focus on men working in the private sector from 1995 to 2015. As in the US, we find that log-earnings changes are not Gaussian, that their distribution is leptokurtic and negatively skewed, and that individual labor earnings dynamics are both nonlinear and heterogeneous. More precisely, we find that (i) large labor earnings changes that drive the negative skewness and the fat tail are primarily working time changes, especially at the extensive margin; (ii) although we reject the log-normality assumption in the data for wage growth, this deviation from Gaussianity is much smaller than it is for working time; (iii) much of the nonlinearity1and heterogeneity2in earnings dynamics is driven by working time dynamics at the extensive margin; and (iv) finally, the choice between moment-based and quantile-based measures of higher-order moments of the distribution of changes in labor outcomes matters, which stresses the role played by methodological issues.Overall, deviations from normality are primarily the result of unemployment risk: it follows that the welfare cost of non-Gaussian earnings fluctuations depends mainly on the level of insurance provided by unemployment benefits. This work sheds light on the relative importance of the extensive margin, and this empirical finding has two implications. First, for policy makers, the appropriate solutions to labor market inequalities are highly dependent on the relative importance of each channel. It turns out that in France, the extensive margin plays a larger role, which calls for a careful examination of the design of the unemployment insurance scheme.3Most of the recent policy debate has focused on enhancing both flexibility and security: on the one hand, by improving coverage after layoffs and by providing workers with unemployment insurance; on the other hand, by loweringlabor costs, either thanks to social contribution exemptions at the bottom of the distribution or by diminishing firing costs and capping the maximal amount granted by labor courts to workers in case of disputes. Second, in the same vein but from a more academic perspective, addressing the problem of ”zeroes”, i.e., career gaps or incomplete labor market sequences, is a first-order issue; although this topic is relatively well known, few papers take this concern seriously (see for instanceBiewen, Fitzenberger, de Lazzer, 2018,Magnac, Roux, 2009). Censored models, microsimulation and supplementary data (e.g. on non-labor earned income) would definitely be needed to further pursue this topic.LiteratureNumerous papers in the literature are devoted to earnings dynamics model volatility while relying on parametric assumptions:Moffitt and Gottschalk, 2002,Moffitt and Gottschalk, 2011,Baker and Solon (2003),Low et al. (2010),Altonji et al. (2013)as well asMagnac et al. (2018). Most papers assume Gaussian shocks, althoughLillard and Willis (1978)noted that “the actual distribution of log earnings is leptokurtic and slightly negatively skewed with respect to [the corresponding normal distribution]” andHorowitz and Markatou (1996)further argued that in such models, the transitory error component exhibits fatter tails than a normal distribution and that misspecification, including Gaussian shocks, could overestimate the probability of upward earnings mobility. Other papers consider mixtures of normals, includingGeweke and Keane (2000)andBonhomme and Robin (2009).Recent works have suggested an agnostic, non-parametric perspective on log-earnings changes in the data to document the validity of parametric assumptions used by researchers when estimating dynamic models of earnings. Using individual-level earnings data, namely, W-2 forms4obtained from the US Social Security Administration (SSA) over the 1978-2011 period,Guvenen et al. (2016)documented first that labor earningschangesare not log-normal. In another contemporaneous project,Busch et al. (2018)propose decomposing labor earnings into the product of hourly wages and annual hours worked. However, there is a methodological issue related to the measure of higher-order moments of the distribution of shocks. Based on Italian data,Hoffmann and Malacrino (2019)usemoment-basedmeasures of dispersion, asymmetry and heaviness of tails. They show that both the negative skewness of annual labor earnings growth and its fluctuations over the business cycle are driven by employment time changes, i.e., changes in the number of weeks an individual works during a year. The distribution of weekly earnings growth is instead symmetric and stable over the business cycle. By contrast,Busch et al. (2018a)resort toquantile-basedmeasures to characterize the distribution of hourly wage shocks in German data, and they find that Kelley’s skewness is negative, therefore concluding that hourly wage changes in the country exhibit an asymmetric distribution.Finally, a vast strand of literature relates labor earnings changes to consumption and saving behavior: see, e.g.,Blundell and Preston (1998),Parker and Preston (2005),Blundell et al. (2008)as well asPistolesi (2014)who focus on income and consumption inequalities. Under tight borrowing constraints, higher volatility of labor income might prevent individuals from smoothing their consumption; incomplete markets combined with inequality may result in inefficiency. In such situations, precautionary motives arise as a way for agents to insure themselves against earnings fluctuations, either by saving more (precautionary saving) or by working longer hours (precautionary labor supply). According toPijoan-Mas (2006), the relative importance of the two motives depends on the persistence of the non-deterministic component of the wage process,5and the inability of markets to insure against fluctuations could be responsible for large welfare losses. According toJessen et al. (2018), precautionary labor supply would amount to 2.8% of hours worked in Germany.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section is devoted to a brief description of the institutional setting that prevails in the French labor market.Section 3presents our data. InSection 4, we describe our empirical approach to disentangle wages from working time changes in labor earnings growth.Section 5presents our main results, whileSection 6is devoted to some extensions, andSection 7concludes the paper.",Pierre,Lionel,None
"1. IntroductionIncreasing rates of immigrants over the past decades in Western countries have spurred debates about immigration and integration policies, questioning whether the host economies can successfully integrate immigrants into the labour market (Bauer et al., 2000;Dustmann et al., 2019). Two recent major events have sparked the debate in Europe. The 2004 and 2007 enlargements of the common European labour market, which triggered a massive inflow of labour migrants from Eastern Europe to the old EU countries, and the sudden increase in the influx of refugees, notably from Syria, to EU countries, which culminated in the autumn 2015.In a world with large cross-country productivity differences, there is a potential for substantial economic gains from immigration, as openbordersallow labour to flow towards its best use (Kennan, 2013;Bratsberg et al., 2017). Moreover, immigration of labour may alleviate thedemographicand fiscal challenges that European countries withageing populationsface (Storesletten, 2000;Bratsberg et al., 2017).Although employment and earnings of immigrants increase with years spent in the host country (Chiswick, 1978;Borjas, 1985;LaLonde and Topel, 1992;Dustmann, 1993;Borjas, 1995;Lubotsky, 2007;Algan et al., 2010;Sarvimäki, 2011;Dustmann and Görlach, 2015), studies have documented substantial employment and earnings disparities between immigrants and natives, and in particular for non-labour migrants, the immigrant-native employment gap remains large even 7–10 years after immigration (Edin et al., 2003;Damm, 2009a;Damm and Rosholm, 2010;Bratsberg et al., 2017;Schultz-Nielsen, 2017;Ruiz and Vargas-Silva, 2018;Fasani et al., 2018;Schultz-Nielsen, 2019).12A substantial part of the literature on immigrant employment has investigated the importance of supply-side factors such as admission class, skills acquired in the host country, potential work experience and language ability (Chiswick, 1978;Borjas, 1985;Borjas, 1995;Husted et al., 2001;Cortes, 2004; Algan,Dustmann et al., 2010;Schultz-Nielsen, 2016). The aim of our study is to estimate how sensitive immigrant employment is to local labour market conditions. Immigrant employment may in fact be more sensitive to changes in local labour market conditions than native employment. This may be the case for at least four reasons. First, immigrants are overrepresented in low skilled jobs (Smith, Pedersen, Pedersen and Schultz-Nielsen, 2003;Edin et al., 2004) which fuels instability, in part due to skill- or routine-biased technological change (Katz and Murphy, 1992;Berman et al., 1998;Card and DiNardo, 2002;Moore and Ranjan, 2005;Goos et al., 2014) and task offshoring (Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg, 2008;Goos et al., 2014).3Second, employers may discriminate immigrant applicants.4Third, in many countries firms use the last-in-first-out (LIFO) principle in downsizing and immigrants are likely to be overrepresented in the group of recent hires (Bratsberg et al., 2017;Åslund et al., 2017). Fourth, job-referral networks of recent immigrant cohorts are ethnically stratified.5The question of how sensitive immigrant employment is to locallabour demandconditions is important for several reasons. First, such knowledge will give us an understanding of the extent to which economic growth alone can increase the employment rate of immigrants. Second, such knowledge can be used for optimal design of publicemployment policies. For instance, during economic recession it may be optimal to increase resources foremployment programmesfor immigrants or low-skilled workers to stimulate local demand for their skills and spend additional resources on training and skill-upgrading programmes. Third, such knowledge can be used for optimal design ofsettlement policieson newly recognized refugees and asylum seekers. In particular, current settlement policies on refugees employed in a number of European countries can be reformed in order to increase the speed oflabour market integrationof refugees.Our empirical approach addresses the challenge that immigrants self-select into locations (see e.g.Edin et al., 2003;Damm, 2009a;Damm, 2014). If people with favourable characteristics sort themselves into locations with favourable labour market conditions, point estimates from observational data studies will overestimate the true effect in absolute terms. To get exogenous variation in local labour market conditions, we exploit the current Danish Spatial Dispersal Policy on Refugees in place since 1999. The allocation is based on a quota-system that distributes newly arrived refugees to municipalities with lower shares of foreigners. Our study is the first to exploit this policy for identification of causal effects of local characteristics on integration of immigrants into the host country society. In particular, we exploit the policy to identify the effects of the initial local labour demand in the assigned location on immigrant employment. We provide consistent estimates of the effects of initial local labour market conditions in the assigned location by identifying refugee status without any measurement error and by using the subsample of refugees who received asylum after a substantial share of municipalities had reached full capacity in a given year. Our study provides quasi-experimental estimates on the sensitivity of immigrant employment to the local employment rate. We find that a one percentage point higher employment rate in the assigned location increases the employment probability of refugees by 0.5–0.6 percentage points (elasticities 1.1–1.8) two to four years after arrival in Denmark. We also estimate the effect of the initial local unemployment rate on the employment probability of refugees. We find that assignment to a municipality with a one percentage point higher unemployment rate decreases the individual employment probability of refugees by 0.9–1.7 percentage points (elasticities −0.16-(−0.19)) two to four years after asylum.Our study is related to three existing impact evaluations that exploit spatial dispersal policies on refugees in Scandinavia to identify the causal effect of local labour market conditions on immigrant labour market outcomes:Åslund and Rooth (2007)for Sweden,Damm and Rosholm (2010)for Denmark andGodøy (2017)for Norway. While our study provides quasi-experimental estimates of the effects of the initial employment rate in the assigned location as well as for a range of alternative measures of local labour market conditions on immigrant employment,Åslund and Rooth (2007)estimates the effects of the initial local unemployment rate on both immigrant earnings and employment.Godøy (2017), instead, estimates the effects of the initial regional employment rate of non-OECD immigrants on immigrant earnings, whereasDamm and Rosholm (2010)exploits the first Danish Spatial Dispersal Policy on refugees in place from 1986–1998 to provide quasi-experimental evidence on local determinants on the hazard rate into first job.An important strength of our paper relative toÅslund and Rooth (2007)andDamm and Rosholm (2010)is that we identify refugee status without any measurement error using Danish administrative registers from 1999. Our study hereby addresses an important concern in previous studies that the estimated effects of local labour market conditions are biased due to measurement error stemming from potential use of a contaminated sample.To our knowledge, only one existing study (Åslund and Rooth, 2007) provides empirical evidence on the direction of the bias of estimates of the effect of local labour demand conditions on immigrant labour market outcomes in observational data studies. Comparison of their point estimates with point estimates using an observational data approach suggests that observational data studies tend to overestimate the true effect in absolute terms, because immigrants with favourable characteristics tend to self-select into locations with favourable labour market conditions. We investigate whether this result generalizes to another Scandinavian country and find that it does.Damm and Rosholm (2010)find that being assigned to a region of high unemployment delays the employment of refugees. Using the second Danish Spatial Dispersal Policy in place since 1999, we test whether their finding generalizes to a later time period and confirm that it does.Our study also contributes to the economic literature by showing how researchers can make better use of micro data for refugees subject to a Spatial Dispersal Policy due to municipal quotas, including the ‘Whole of Sweden’ Strategy used in e.g.Edin et al. (2003)andÅslund and Rooth (2007)and the Danish Spatial Dispersal Policy in place since 1999. In future research, instead of using the full population of refugees subject to the Spatial Dispersal Policy, consistency of estimated effects of location characteristics can be increased by extracting the subsample of refugees who received asylum after a substantial share of municipalities had reached full capacity in a given year.The economic literature on the effects of local labour demand conditions on immigrant labour market outcomes is rather limited. Observational data studies suggest that ethnic minority groups are more sensitive to changes in labour market conditions than the majority population (seeHoynes 2000for U.S. evidence.6For Norwegian evidence, seeBarth et al., 2004;Bratsberg et al., 2010;Bratsberg et al., 2017).7Our estimates do not suffer from location sorting at the time of arrival to the host-country. Therefore, our point estimates of the effect of the local unemployment rate on the employment probability of refugees are much smaller in absolute terms than in observational data studies (e.g.Bratsberg et al., 2017). In fact, (in absolute terms) our point estimates are also lower than the point estimates 2–4 years after arrival estimated byÅslund and Rooth (2007).8The structure of our paper is as follows. Section II describes the institutional background. In Section III we provide our methodological considerations and set up our empirical model. Then follows a description of our data in SectionIV, and a presentation of our empirical results in Section V. In Section VI, we discuss our results and provide our concluding remarks.",Luz,Anna,Marie
"1. IntroductionHuman capital investmentdecisions are expected to be independent of transitory employment and income shocks. Despite this prediction, a growing body of research suggests that schooling decisions are often affected by immediate economic factors, particularly by the changes in the labor market conditions. The sensitivity of educational investments to economic cycles is more important in developing countries where economic downturns are more frequent and acute, and households are more vulnerable due to weaker safety nets and imperfectly-functioning financial markets. However, empirical evidence of the cyclicality of schooling in the context of developing countries is sparse and, among the few existing papers, the findings are inconclusive and subject to a number of concerns related to the endogeneity ofmacroeconomicconditions.1In this paper, we study the effects of macroeconomic shocks on child schooling in Turkey, a country that has experienced highly-volatile macroeconomic cycles and marked variation in cycles across regions. Using a representative, household-level dataset to identify the impact of local labor conditions, we exploit exogenous variation in locallabor demandthat is driven by both national industry-specific employment growth rates and the baseline industry-level employment composition across regions. The paper also investigates the role of labor market conditions according to the unskilled (e.g., agriculture) and skilled (e.g., high-tech manufacturing) labor demand. We posit that employment growth biased toward unskilled labor, such as primary commodities and unskilled manufacturing, is expected to increase demand for unskilled workers, thereby increasing the opportunity cost of schooling and reducing education.2On the other hand, employment growth biased toward skilled labor is expected to increase demand for skilled workers, thereby increasing the returns to schooling and increasing education. This suggests that the skill composition of labor demand plays an important role in the effect of labor market conditions on schooling, but previous studies have abstracted from this distinction, particularly studies focusing on developing countries.This is the first paper to explore the role of macroeconomic conditions in child schooling in Turkey, which has several characteristics that make it an interesting case study. Turkey has relatively low levels of education for an upper-middle-income country. The average years of total schooling is 7.1 years among the adult population, where 4 percent of the adult male population and 15 percent of the adult female population has no schooling (Barro and Lee, 2013). In addition, macroeconomic conditions and employment growth, in particular, have been highly volatile, and consequently, unemployment rates have varied widely over the 2005 to 2013 period. Finally, employment growth has been highly biased towards unskilled-labor-intensive sectors. For example, the share of unemployed workers with tertiary education in overall unemployment has increased from 11 percent in 2005 to 20 percent in 2013, with variation across regions ranging from 6 to 29 percent in 2013.3The direction of the effect of macroeconomic shocks on child schooling is ambiguous, especially in the context of a developing country. On the one hand, economic downturns and poor labor market conditions reduce the opportunity cost of schooling, generating a substitution effect that is expected to increase education (counter-cyclical). On the other hand, economic downturns might reduce household income, thereby reducing child schooling whenever education is a normal good (pro-cyclical). When credit markets are well-functioning, transitory economic shocks should generate only modest income effects on schooling, as schooling decisions are long-term decisions and hence subject to lifetime earnings. However, in the context of developing countries, households might face financial constraints, and adverse economic shocks might significantly reduce their ability to pay for schooling. Economic downturns that increase skilled unemployment, in particular, may reduce the expected returns to education, thereby reducing the incentive to invest in schooling. The ambiguity of net effect on schooling suggests that the question is empirical in nature, and that country-wide empirical investigations are needed to improve our understanding of the mechanisms.More importantly, investigating skill-structure of employment growth entails important policy implications as policymakers often promote expansions in education as well export-led growth in sectors that are often intensive in unskilled labor. This paper demonstrates that, to the extent that education is important in long-run growth, these two policies might be at odds with promoting economic development. Finally, because the findings in the literature are mixed, dividing the effects according to the skill composition of employment growth might serve to reconcile the findings of the literature.This paper uses data from the Turkish Household Labor Force Survey spanning 2004 to 2013. The dataset is a nationally-representative sample of the Turkish population that includes detailed information on labor market activity of adult individuals, such aslabor force participationand occupation byeconomic sector, as well as socioeconomic anddemographiccharacteristics. The primary measure of local labor market conditions is unemployment rates, which we construct at the sub-regional level. Because local labor market conditions reflect both the demand for and supply of labor, we construct a labor demand index based on variation in national industry-specific growth rates and baseline industry employment shares across regions (Bartik, 1991,Black, McKinnish, Sanders, 2005,Blanchard, Katz, 1992).4Using the labor demand index as aninstrumental variable, we estimate the effect of local labor market conditions on school attendance of children aged 6 to 14, controlling for sub-region and yearfixed effects, as well as household and child covariates.The results indicate that child schooling is pro-cyclical: a one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate reduces the probability of child school attendance by 5 percentage points, which corresponds to a 5% reduction relative to the mean. Consistent with our predictions, we find that higher unskilled unemployment rates increase schooling, whereas higher skilled unemployment rates decrease schooling, which highlights the import role of distinguishing between the skilled and unskilled labor demand in understanding the role of macroeconomic conditions in child schooling.In addition, consistent with the hypothesis that credit-constrained households would be more adversely impacted by negative economic shocks, we find that the results are more acute among children with less-educated parents and living in rural areas. To shed light on a potential mechanism, we demonstrate that parental labor force participation plays an important role in the extent to which macroeconomic shocks affect schooling outcomes. We further study the long-run effects of labor market conditions and find suggestive evidence that the effects of macroeconomic conditions are persistent and not transitory as higherregional unemploymentrates during childhood has adverse effects on long-runeducation and employmentoutcomes of young adults. The results withstand various robustness checks, including using employment-to-population ratios as an alternative to the unemployment rate, employing various alternative measures of the instrumental variable, including using alternative base years and the exclusion ofspillover effects, and controlling for various covariates, such as lagged unemployment rates and birth order.",Pinar,Beyza,None

"1. IntroductionUnderstanding the progress that takes place across immigrant generations is crucial for assessing the long-term impact of immigration on society. In many respects, 2nd-generation immigrants—the U.S.-born children of foreign-born migrants to the United States—show signs of rapid integration. On average, the 2nd generation as a whole and 2nd-generation members from most contemporary national origin groups meet or exceed the schooling level of the typical American (Duncan and Trejo 2018). Not conforming to this pattern, however, are Mexican Americans, who because of historical continuity anddemographicsize constitute arguably the most significant U.S. immigrant flow.Panel A ofTable 1illustrates the seemingly persistent educational disadvantage of Mexican Americans. These calculations of average years of schooling for men use 2003–2016 data from the Current Population Survey (CPS).1Mexican Americans display impressive growth in educational attainment between the 1st generation (9.5 years) and the 2nd generation (12.7 years), but no further improvement is evident for the 3rd+ generation (the grandchildren and later descendants of Mexican immigrants). As a result, even when the comparisons are confined to individuals whose families have lived in the United States for at least a couple of generations (i.e., the 3rd+-generation), Mexican Americans possess schooling deficits of more than a year relative to non-Hispanic whites and almost one-third of a year relative to African Americans.Table 1. Average Years of Schooling of Men, by Race/Ethnicity, Age, and Immigrant Generation, 2003–2016 CPS Data.Note:Standard errors are reported in parentheses. The samples include men in the relevant racial/ethnic and age groups. For Mexican Americans, the “1st generation” consists of individuals born in Mexico, excluding those born abroad of an American parent, and the “2nd generation” consists of U.S.-born individuals who have at least one Mexican-born parent. The “3rd+ generation” (i.e., the 3rd and all higher generations) consists of U.S.-born individuals who have two U.S.-born parents, and these individuals are assigned to racial/ethnic groups based on their responses to the Hispanic origin and race questions. Sampling weights were used in the calculations.Source:2003–2016 Current Population Survey outgoing rotation group data.Considering the low levels of schooling, English proficiency, and other types of human capital brought to the United States by the typical Mexican immigrant, it is not surprising that their U.S.-born children do not eliminate all of these enormous socioeconomic deficits in a single generation (Perlmann 2005;Smith 2006). Of potentially greater concern, however, is the evidence that progress seems to stall after the 2nd generation for Mexican Americans.2Certainly,Mexican immigrantsto the United States confront obstacles that might account for slowed or stalled progress among later generations (Portes and Rumbaut 2001), including discrimination (Telles and Ortiz 2008) and widespread undocumented status (Bean et al. 2011).In addition,Huntington (2004)points to several other factors that could slow the pace of generational integration by Hispanics today as compared to Europeans in the past. These factors include the large scale of current immigration flows from Mexico and other Spanish-speaking countries, the substantial (though lessening) geographic concentration of these flows within the United States, and the fact that such flows have remained sizeable over a much longer period of time than did the influx from any particular European country. In addition, the close proximity of Mexico to the United States facilitates return and repeat migration. These unique features of Hispanic immigration might foster the growth of ethnic enclaves in the United States where immigrants and their descendants could, if they so choose, live and work without being forced to learn English or to Americanize in other important ways.3Because of these and other concerns, Mexican Americans’ prospects for future upward mobility are subject to much recent debate.4In evaluating such theoretical arguments for slower integration by Mexican Americans, however, it is important to consider several potentially serious limitations of the existing empirical evidence. We consider, in turn, the following threemeasurement issues: (1) comparisons of immigrant generations in cross-sectional data, (2) ethnic attrition, and (3) the inability to distinguish the 3rd generation from higher generations.First, as noted byBorjas (1993,2006) andSmith (2003,2006), generational comparisons in a single cross-section of data—like those reported in Panel A ofTable 1—can be misleading because they do a poor job of matching parents andgrandparentsin an earlier generation with their actual descendants in later generations. If we assume that schooling is essentially complete by the age of 25 and changes little thereafter, we can use CPS data to conduct an analysis of generational changes in educational attainment similar in spirit toSmith (2003). Panel B ofTable 1reports the relevant calculations. This panel presents average schooling levels for Mexican Americans similar to those displayed in Panel A, except that now separate calculations are reported for two particular age groups: 25–34 and 50–59. By choosing age groups 25 years apart, we create a situation in which the older age group from a particular generation potentially represents the parental cohort for the younger age group in the next generation. For example, the cohort of 1st-generation men aged 50–59 includes fathers of the 2nd-generation cohort of sons aged 25–34.Panel B reveals only slightly more progress beyond the 2nd generation for Mexican Americans than did Panel A. When we compare age/generation groups that potentially match Mexican-American fathers with their sons (by moving northeast between the connected cells with similar shading in Panel B), average schooling rises from 12.6 years for the older 2nd generation to 12.7 years for the younger 3rd+ generation, a positive but small gain.5Therefore, the evidence of educational stagnation for later-generation Mexican Americans does not seem to derive largely from biases associated with comparing immigrant generations in a cross-section. Further, note in Panel B that young 3rd+-generation Mexican Americans continue to trail the average schooling of their non-Hispanic white and African-American peers by the same substantial amounts observed in Panel A.Potential measurement bias arising from “ethnic attrition” is a second issue that might make it difficult to track progress across immigrant generations. InTable 1, 1st- and 2nd-generation Mexican Americans are identified using the relatively “objective” information collected by the CPS on the countries of birth of the respondent and his parents (e.g., a 2nd-generation Mexican American is a U.S.-born individual with at least one parent born in Mexico). Virtually no large, nationally-representative data sets, however, provide information on the countries of birth of an adult respondent's grandparents. As a result, 3rd-and-higher-generation Mexican Americans (or the so-called 3rd+ generation) must be assigned using more “subjective” measures of racial/ethnic identification. InTable 1, we follow standard practice in defining 3rd+-generation Mexican Americans as those who are U.S.-born, have two U.S.-born parents, and identify as “Mexican” or “Mexican American” in response to the Hispanic origin question. Given data limitations, researchers seeking to study later-generation Mexican Americans seldom have a better option. Nevertheless, the problem with using subjective measures of racial/ethnic identification is that assimilation andintermarriagecan cause ethnic attachments to fade across generations (Alba 1990;Waters 1990;Perlmann and Waters 2007). Consequently, subjective measures of racial/ethnic identification might miss a significant portion of the later-generation descendants of immigrants. Furthermore, if such ethnic attrition is selective on socioeconomic attainment, then it can distort assessments of integration and generational progress. For Mexican Americans,Duncan and Trejo (2007,2011,2017) provide evidence that ethnic attrition is substantial and could produce significant downward bias in standard measures of attainment for later generations. In this way, measurement biases generated by ethnic attrition could create a misleading appearance of socioeconomic stagnation after the 2nd generation for Mexican Americans, similar to what is observed inTable 1.A third but related measurement issue is that the data limitations just described also imply that, for adults, researchers typically cannot distinguish the “true” 3rd generation from higher generations. For this reason,Table 1and the discussion so far refer to the “3rd+” generation. This is potentially a problem because Mexican Americans in generations beyond the 3rd are disproportionately descended from ancestors who came of age in places (e.g., Texas rather than California) and times (e.g., before the Civil Rights era) where Mexican Americans faced discrimination that was more severe and often institutionalized (Foley 1997;Alba 2006;Montejano 1987). The more limited opportunities for advancement experienced by these families may result in lower attainment for Mexican Americans in the 4th and higher generations compared with their 3rd-generation counterparts whose families experienced less hostile environments.Alba et al. (2011)andBean et al. (2015)provide evidence of this pattern for schooling levels, highlighting the importance of distinguishing 3rd-generation Mexican Americans from higher generations.Kosack and Ward (2018)report much slower socioeconomic progress for Mexican Americans across immigrant generations before 1940 than afterward, and for the pre-1940 period they find that Mexicans Americans are particularly disadvantaged in Texas compared with California or U.S. states that do notborderMexico.In the current paper, we exploit previously untapped information from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97) that allows us to address the last two measurement issues just discussed: ethnic attrition and distinguishing the 3rd generation from higher generations. For our purposes, a key feature of the NLSY97 is that it reports the countries of birth of respondents’ grandparents. This means that we can minimize ethnic attrition by identifying 3rd-generation Mexican Americans using ancestors’ countries of birth rather than subjective ethnic identification. It also means that we can distinguish 3rd-generation Mexican Americans from higher generations.We use these data to analyze educational progress between 2nd- and 3rd-generation Mexican Americans. Once we address the measurement issues just described, we find a substantial increase in educational attainment between these generations. Moreover, we show that such progress is largely hidden when we mimic standard data sets and aggregate the 3rd and higher generations into a “3rd+” generation. Similar patterns emerge for cognitive test scores and for annual earnings. Our analysis thus provides promising evidence of generational progress for a recent cohort of Mexican-Americans. Indeed, for this birth cohort, the high schoolgraduationrate of 3rd-generation Mexican Americans is only slightly below that of non-Hispanic whites from the 4th and higher generations.6Our paper relates most closely to two important recent studies of Mexican Americans that, through ambitious data collection efforts for specific locations, are also able to distinguish the 3rd generation from higher generations and, at least in part, account for ethnic attrition. Starting with a survey conducted in 1965 of Mexican-American families living in Los Angeles and San Antonio,Telles and Ortiz (2008)re-interview in 2000 available original respondents and their U.S.-born children. They find little evidence of educational or earnings progress beyond the 2nd generation.Bean et al. (2015)rely on survey information collected from multiple generations of Mexican-origin individuals living in the greater Los Angelesmetropolitan areain 2004. Their analysis does suggest significant schooling and earnings gains for Mexican Americans between the 2nd and 3rd generations.Our analysis contributes in several important ways to the ongoing scholarly debate over Mexican-American progress after the 2nd generation. First, we employ nationally-representative data from the NLSY97. In this way, we avoid issues of selective geographic mobility that can make it difficult to interpret results from studies of particular locations (Alba et al., 2014). Second, we are in a better position to assess and account for the effects of ethnic attrition, because roughly half of our Mexican-American respondents come from a sampling design that didnotscreen on race or ethnicity. In contrast, most of the original 1965 respondents inTelles and Ortiz (2008)and the Mexican-origin respondents inBean et al. (2015)had to subjectively identify as being of Mexican descent to be included in these surveys. Third, in addition to examining the educational and labor market outcomes that have been studied previously, we also analyze a commonly-used measure of cognitive ability. Finally, the recency and youth of our sample—described in greater detail below—imply that our analyses provide better information about the future trajectories of U.S.-born Mexican Americans than previous work could.7",Brian,Jeffrey,Ana
"1. IntroductionIn most European economies, around 20 percent of all workers are employed by the government. Government hire workers to produce goods and services. However, governments face different constraints than private-sector firms and are not driven by profit maximization. Hence, government employment and wage policies are driven by other objectives including: attaining budgetary targets (Gyourko, Tracy, 1989,Poterba, Rueben, 1998); implementingmacroeconomicstabilization policy (Holm-Hadulla, Kamath, Lamo, Pérez, Schuknecht, 2010,Keynes, 1936,Lamo, Pérez, Schuknecht, 2013); redistributing resources (Alesina, Baqir, Easterly, 2000,Alesina, Danninger, Rostagno, 1999,Wilson, 1982); or satisfying interest groups for electoral gains (Borjas, 1984,Gelb, Knight, Sabot, 1991,Matschke, 2003). As a consequence, public-sector labour markets might behave differently from their private-sector counterparts.The objective of this paper is to establish a number of key facts about the French, Spanish, UK and US labour market flows, focussing on the role played by the public sector. We do so by examining data from the French, Spanish and UKLabour Force Surveysand the USCurrent Population Survey(CPS) over the past 15 years. We chose these four countries because they are large countries with sizable public sectors, and have been recently facing pressure to reform their public sectors. Furthermore, because they have different labour market institutions, public-sector hiring procedures and wage policies and various weights on differentindustries, facts that are found to be common across the four countries should be seen as intrinsic characteristics of the public sector. While we do not attempt to explain these facts, we believe that they are an important first step to foster theoretical research on the topic. They can help economists understand the characteristics of the public sector and its policies, as well as provide a guideline of the empirical features that models with a public sector should reproduce and help in the calibration or identification of key parameters. We show that public-sector labour markets do indeed behave differently than the private sector. The size of transition rates into and out of public-sector employment are different and its cyclical pattern as well. Furthermore, the government hires mostly women, college graduates and older workers, which creates asymmetric exposures to public-sector policies for different workers.In the last decade in European countries, public-sector employment was a key policy variable. Following budgetary constraints, many countries imposed measures such as hiring freezes layoffs of public-sector workers, as well as wage cuts or freezes that affected the retention of these workers (Glassner and Watt, 2010). Given the policy role that public-sector employment played during the last decade, a new wave of research constructs search and matching models of unemployment to study the labour market effects of public-sector employment and wages. Examples includeHörner et al. (2007),Quadrini and Trigari (2007),Afonso and Gomes (2014),Gomes, 2015b,Gomes, 2018,Michaillat (2014),Burdett (2012),Bradley et al. (2017),Albrecht et al. (2019),Bermperoglou et al. (2017)andBoeing-Reicher and Caponi (2017). Lying at the heart of these state-of-the-art models are the worker gross flows between private- and public-sector employment and non-employment.However, the extensive literature that estimates and analyses worker gross flows has systematic ignored the role of the public sector. This literature has focused mainly on disentangling the relative importance of job-finding and job-separation rates in driving the unemployment rate. The most cited papers on the topic –Blanchard and Diamond (1990),Shimer (2012),Elsby et al. (2009)andFujita and Ramey (2009)– study the US labour market, proposing different decompositions or examining the role of the time-aggregation bias. Also for the US,Borowczyk-Martins and Lalé (2019)distinguish between full-time and part-time employment, whileElsby et al. (2015)study the role of the participation margin.Smith (2011)proposes an out-of-steady-state decomposition and analyses the UK labour market.Gomes (2012)further analyses the UK labour market along other dimensions, such as education or labour force attachment, whileFujita (2010)concentrates on on-the-job search and job-to-job transitions andCarrillo-Tudela et al. (2016)on the extent of worker reallocation across occupations and industries and their cyclicality. In two comparisons of the UK and the US,Razzu and Singleton (2016)study the fluctuations of unemployment among men and women, whileGomes (2015a)examines the role of conditional transition probabilities and how they depend on the frequency of the surveys. Other papers focussing on the UK includeElsby et al. (2011)andElsby and Smith (2010).Several studies examine other European labour markets.Petrongolo and Pissarides (2008)compare the relative importance of job-finding and job-separation rates across France, the United Kingdom, Spain and the United States.Silva and Vázquez-Grenno (2013)focus on the role of flows in and out of permanent and temporary employment in Spain.Baussola and Mussida (2014)study Italian gross flows, concentrating on unemployment gender gaps.Charlot et al. (2018)split between employment in abstract, routine and manual occupations in France and the US. Other works examining the French labour market includeHairault et al. (2015)andFontaine (2016).Hertweck and Sigrist (2015)study the German labour market andDaouli et al. (2015)the Greek labour market during the crisis. Despite looking at worker flows from different angles, all the papers in this exhaustive list have ignored the duality between the private and the public sectors.InSection 3, we provide evidence on the size and cyclicality of the flows between public and private employment, unemployment and inactivity. France and the UK have larger public sectors than either Spain or the US. Over the last business cycle, public-sector employment was pro-cyclical in France, countercyclical in the US, and acyclical in Spain and the UK.InSection 4, we quantify how government hiring and separations have contributed to unemployment fluctuations. We show that ignoring these flows in unemployment decompositions can potentially bias the relative importance of job-finding and job-separation rates, although in our sample, this bias turned out to be small. We find a relative split of 80-20 percent of the contribution of private- and public-sector employment to fluctuations in the unemployment rate in UK, 85-15 in France and of 90-10 percent in Spain and the US. We performed a counterfactual analysis and show that since 2008, if governments had kept the same hirings and separations from the previous years, unemployment rate would have been lower, by up to 1 percentage point, in the France and the UK, but it would have been higher in the US and Spain. In our view, this finding reflects the differentmacroeconomic policiesconducted by governments in response to theGreat Recession, with a larger focus onausterity policiesby some European countries.We document that jobs are safer in the public sector – aggregate job-separation rates are lower. InSection 5, we further investigate this result by using a multinomial logit model to estimate the differences in transition rates from employment to unemployment and inactivity from the two sectors, conditional on observable characteristics. The argument that public-sector jobs are safer is often used in policy discussions surrounding public-sector pay. However, while there are several papers estimating the wage differentials across sectors, there are no estimates of the value of the job-security.1We use a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation to find the percentage of their wage that private-sector workers would be willing to forgo to have the same job-separation probability as in the public sector. In our preferred scenario, risk-neutral workers would pay 0.5 to 1.6 percent of their wage for the same job security, which can be seen as a lower bound for the insurance value of public-sector employment. Risk-averse workers without any savings mechanism would pay 1.0 to 2.9 percent of their wage, which can be seen as an upper bound. The value of job safety in the public sector is equivalent to between 0.4 to 0.7 percent of total government spending in France and between 0.2 to 0.4 percent in the UK, Spain and the US.",Idriss,Ismael,Pedro
"1. IntroductionSchool violence, as well as more general forms of misbehaviour at school, are a widespread phenomenon that is increasingly capturing the attention of policy-makers, administrators, teachers, and parents. In 2015, across theOECDcountries participating in theProgramme for International Student Assessment(PISA), almost 20% of 15-year-old students reported being victim of some form of bullying on a monthly basis, and almost 50% reported having being victimized at least a few times per year (OECD, 2017). In Italy about 50% of adolescents aged between 11 and 17 reported having been victim of some form of violent or disrespectful behaviour in 2014 (ISTAT, 2015).Being bullied has been found to have both short- and long-run consequences, not only on mental and physical well-being, but also on educational choices and labour market outcomes (Ammermüller, 2012,Bowes, Joinson, Wolke, Lewis, 2015,Eriksen, Nielsen, Simonsen, 2014,Kim, Leventhal, 2008,Ponzo, 2013). In order to design effective policies to combat bullying, it is important to gather robust evidence on its determinants. In a school context, age is likely to be an important factor: being related to the physical and psychological development of children, it can shape social hierarchies at school and be at the basis of the imbalance of power that intrinsically characterises the relationship between bullies and their victims (Olweus, 2013). Age is also especially interesting to look at from a policy perspective, because it is easily observable, and school principals can take it into account when deciding on school admission or class formation.We are not the first to study the link between age and bullying. The occurrence of bullying episodes, in particular of physical bullying, is well known to decline with age (Brame, Nagin, Tremblay, 2001,Smith, Madsen, Moody, 1999).Mühlenweg (2010)finds that higher relative age (measured as the deviation from the mean age within grade) decreases the chances of being bullied in 4thgrade. On the other hand,Ammermüller (2012)does not find age to be a significant determinant of schoolvictimisationin 4thor 8thgrade.In this paper we investigate how the position of a student in the school-level age distribution (hereafter simply referred to asage rank) affects the probability of being bullied at school, using data on the universe of Italian students enrolled in 5thand 6thgrade in three different school years. Contrary to previous papers in the literature, we are the first to look at an ordinal, rather than a cardinal, measure of relative age. This is important because age rank effects have very different policy implications than those stemming from differences in absolute age or in (cardinal) relative age.1By their very nature, rank effects cannot be prevented by simple traditional policies aimed at manipulating the age composition within a given school or class, as there will always be some student at the bottom of the age distribution. The mere awareness of the existence of age rank effects can help setting more realistic expectations on the degree to which a whole class of age-related policies can reduce bullying, and can help policy makers and practitioners to better design and implement a different set of targeted policies or interventions aimed at preventing bullying and at providing support to the most vulnerable students.We achieve identification by including school-by-cohortfixed effects, which allow us to compare students that have the same absolute age and the same distance from the mean age of their school cohort, but result in different ordinal positions because of differences in the shape of the respective school-cohort age distributions (Elsner, Isphording, 2017,Elsner, Isphording, 2018,Murphy, Weinhardt, 2018). This means that the age rank effect we estimate operates on top of the effects of absolute and relative age estimated by the previous literature. We deal with the potentially endogenous sorting of students into different school-entry cohorts through an IV strategy based on the discontinuity in the probability of enrolling in a given school year generated by an end-of-year cut-off rule.To our knowledge, we are the first to estimate an age rank effect. The previous literature on age effects has mostly focused on estimating the effect of absolute and (cardinal) relative age, showing that they both affect a variety of cognitive (Bedard, Dhuey, 2006,Black, Devereux, Salvanes, 2011,Cascio, Schanzenbach, 2016,Crawford, Dearden, Meghir, 2010,Elder, Lubotsky, 2009,Leuven, Rønning, 2016) and non-cognitive outcomes (Crafword, Dearden, Greaves, 2015,Lubotsky, Kaestner, 2016,Mühlenweg, Blomeyer, Stichnoth, Laucht, 2012). We also contribute to a small but rapidly growing literature on rank effects in education, which has so far focused on the rank of students in the test scores distribution (Bertoni, Nisticò, 2018,Comi, Origo, Pagani, 2018,Elsner, Isphording, 2017,Elsner, Isphording, 2018,Murphy, Weinhardt, 2018,Tincani, 2017).In our preferred specification, a one-decile increase in the age rank is estimated to decrease the probability of being bullied by 1.3 percentage points in both grades, against a baseline probability of about 22% for 5th graders and 14% for 6thgraders. The effect is much higher (about the double in size) when the rank is computed with respect to the group-specific age distribution (where groups are defined in terms of socio-demographic characteristics such as gender and socio-economic status; we label these estimateswithin-group effects). This suggests that students’ interactions tend to take place within homogeneous groups, defined by salient observable characteristics. Conversely, thebetween-group effects, which we define as the effect of the (overall) age rank for students belonging to specific groups, are much more similar in magnitude than the baseline estimates. Both the within- and the between-group estimates indicate that male students are the group most vulnerable to age rank effects.The rest of the paper is organized as follows.Section 2describes the institutional setting and the data we use. InSection 3we describe in detail the empirical strategy we follow, whileSections 4and5discuss the main results, present several robustness checks, and investigate relevant heterogeneities in the estimated effects.Section 6concludes.",Rosario,Marco,Marco
"1. IntroductionA college student receives various administrative feedback from their academic institution that may be pertinent to their subsequent decisions and outcomes. In some cases, this feedback informs students that they are performing below the acceptable academic standard expected by the institution and that failure to meet this standard in subsequent assessments will result in some action being taken against them. At other times, the institution may choose to celebrate, levy praise or publicly recognize the academic achievement of high-performing students. In both of these cases, the student receives a salient signal of the quality of theiracademic performance. This feedback changes the student’s default option by introducing a punishment they may face or a benefit they could lose in future periods (Baumeister et al., 1990). Many colleges employ these administrative policies to encourage student success and to align each student’s actions with the expectations of the institution.Despite the high frequency with which students receive feedback about the quality of their performance, empirical evidence of their impact on students’ subsequent academic decisions and outcomes is relatively sparse in the literature. This is because it is difficult to empirically assess the impact of praise and reprimands in a non-experimental setting, owing to the differences between those who are exposed to the information and those who are not. Furthermore, quality data on the various performance feedback that postsecondary students receive and their academic records are not widely available. In this paper, I utilize rich administrative data from a large public university in Jamaica to estimate the causal impact of being recognized on the Dean’s list or put on academicprobationon students’ subsequent academic decisions and outcomes.The Dean’s list initiative is one medium that colleges utilize to recognize the academic performance of high-achieving students. The list is comprised of the names of students whose grade point average (GPA) exceeds some high-performance threshold. Eligible students may also receive a combination of public recognition, praise, and awards for achieving this accomplishment. This list is dynamically updated at a fixed time interval and new students who have passed this performance threshold are added, while others that have fallen below are dropped from the list. In contrast, the academic probation policy targets poor-performing students whose academic performances fall below some minimum GPA expected by the institution. Each student who satisfies this criterion receives a warning letter that explains that they have failed to meet the academic standard expected by the college. The letter also informs the student that if this poor performance is repeated in the following semester, they will be asked to withdraw from their studies. These policies provide each affected student with a signal about the quality of their academic performance and impose a cost on subsequent academic performance below the established GPA standard.There are four main channels through which these policies can potentially impact a student’s subsequent behavior. First, since being treated imposes a cost on subsequent performance below the acceptable standards, affected students may be induced into increasing the level of effort they exert. The students who are affected by these policies enter a new state of nature where they are at risk of facing a penalty or losing an acquired (endowed) benefit. This may incentivize them to more closely align their actions with the institution’s preferences (Baumeister et al., 1990). Second, it is also plausible that these policies could inform students about their places in the GPA distribution and could cause students to update their priors about their academic ability (Weiner et al., 1972). Several studies show that students update beliefs about their academic ability while in college and make decisions about persisting logically. This shows that students behave like producers in evaluating their current performance and deciding how much effort to invest in subsequent periods (Elsner, Isphording, 2017,Lin, 2013,Stinebrickner, Stinebrickner). Third, when students receive positive or negative information about their academic performance, it may alter their self-image, confidence, and motivation. This argument has been made in the psychology literature, where it has been posited that goal-setting, personal expectation, and mental effort investment may be influenced by the perception of success or failure (Bénabou, Tirole, 2002,Feather, 1966,Seaver, Quarton, 1976,Venables, Fairclough, 2009). Similarly,Baumeister et al. (1990)found that praise may improve an individual’s subsequent performance on tasks that depend primarily on effort. Finally, these initiatives could have an impact on a student’s course selection strategy and persistence in their chosen major of study. Because these policies require that students exceed a set standard of academic performance, they may incentivize students to change their behavior along non-effort margins to achieve this objective.1I also explore some of these behavioral changes in this paper.This paper shares some similarity to the works ofLindo et al. (2010),Seaver and Quarton (1976)andThistlethwaite and Campbell (1960). These studies are pioneering research on the impact of performance standards on students’ subsequent academic outcomes.2WhileLindo et al. (2010)focused on the consequences of being affected by academic probation,Seaver and Quarton (1976)andThistlethwaite and Campbell (1960)examined the impact of public recognition on students’ subsequent attitudes and academic performances.Seaver and Quarton (1976)argued that Dean’s list recognition serves as a potentially powerful social reinforcer of the behaviors leading to academic achievement, and it should improve students’ self-esteem and expectations for future performance relative to others. Similarly,Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960)found that there is a motivational effect of public recognition which improves students’ subsequent academic aspirations and outcomes. I contribute to this burgeoning literature in several ways. First, a novel feature of this paper is that it examines the impact of performance standards at both the top and bottom of the performance distribution for students from the same population, whereas existing studies tend to focus on one in isolation. Second, I examine the mechanism through which students adjust their behavior after being affected by either policy and assess the impact of each program on student success. Finally, this paper offers some insights into how the results may diverge when key institutional details - such as the generosity of the performance standard - are altered.To causally identify the impact of each program, theregression discontinuity designis employed. This is done by exploiting the discontinuities in treatment eligibility that is created by institutional policies. In particular, the identifying assumption is that students who are immediately above the performance standard threshold for academic probation and were not eligible for receiving the warning letter have similar observed and unobserved characteristics as those who are just below the threshold and were treated by receiving the written reprimand. Similarly, causal identification requires that students who are narrowly ineligible for a spot on the Dean’s list provide a good counterfactual to students whose grade point averages (GPA) are just above the Dean’s list academic standard. While this assumption is usually violated by students’ manipulation of their eligibility for treatment, this is unlikely to be the case in this paper due to the policies governing students at the institution being examined.I find that both policies have a positive effect on the academic performance of treated students in subsequent semesters. The results show that the students who are affected by the academic probation policy in their first semester have a higher likelihood of switching their major and college of study, though it did not induce them to voluntarily drop out of the institution. I also find similar results when the academic probation standard becomes more restrictive, increasing from a GPA of 1.00 to 2.00. The results further suggest that in responding to either policy, treated students are incentivized to engage in strategic course-taking behavior by choosing courses that are more generous along dimensions we would expect. However, I find no evidence that either policy harmed students’ long-term outcomes, such as their prospects forgraduation. These results provide mixed support for existing findings in the literature and offer several insights on the mechanisms students utilize to meet these standards once they have been treated.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:Section 2outlines the data and institutional framework specific to the policies evaluated in this study.Section 3describes the empirical model and the major assumptions of the regression discontinuity design,Section 4presents the main results, andSection 5provides the main concluding arguments.",Nicholas,None,None
"1. IntroductionIn many European countries, longer entitlement periods of unemployment insurance (UI) benefits are provided for older unemployed. These benefit extensions can contribute to high levels of unemployment in the oldest groups in two ways. First, employers tend to target dismissals at those employees who qualify for extended benefits. Some eligible workers may also leave their job voluntarily to obtain more leisure time if the benefit scheme is sufficiently generous. As a result, the older workers eligible for extended benefits have been found to enter unemployment at a high rate (Winter-Ebmer, 2003,Kyyrä, Wilke, 2007,Tuit, van Ours, 2010, andBaguelin and Remillon, 2014). Second, among unemployed workers eligibility for extended benefits discourages job search and thereby prolongs unemployment spells, and such benefits may be used to bridge the time until retirement (Hunt, 1995,Lalive, Zweimüller, 2004,Kyyrä, Ollikainen, 2008,Lalive, 2008,Tatsiramos, 2010,Baguelin, Remillon, 2014,Inderbitzin, Staubli, Zweimuller, 2016). While the effects of extended benefits on the unemployment inflow and the duration of unemployment spells are well documented, their long-term effects, fiscal impact and effects on health and spouse’s behavior have been studied less.In this paper, we study a reform in 2005 that postponed access to extended UI benefits by two years from age 55 to 57 in Finland. The Finnish scheme is rather generous in the sense that the extended benefits can be received until retirement. We find that the two-year increase in the eligibility age increased employment by 7 months between the ages of 54 and 63 among private-sector workers. Despite a large reduction in the time spent in unemployment, we do not find evidence of long-term health effects as measured by the amount of medical expenditure, disability and sickness benefits received, or mortality by the end of 2015. Moreover, the spouse’s employment months and retirement age do not appear to be affected. As such, the only longer term effect seems to be higher employment for the group that was directly affected by the reform. This employment effect amounts to an increase of 22,000 Euros in wage income and a decrease of 11,000 Euros in unemployment-related benefits on average over the 10-year period. Higher earnings also reduce the need to rely on other benefits, such as housing allowance and social assistance, while increasingtaxesandsocial security contributionspaid to the society. Taking all benefits, income taxes and social security contributions into account, we estimate that the fiscal impact of the reform was around 15,000 Euros over the 10-year period for an average individual. This is a large effect given that the counterfactual level of average net transfers over the same period is about 26,000 Euros.We reach these conclusions using a sharpregression discontinuity design(RDD) and rich register data on all private-sector employees born in 1949 and 1950. The 2005 reform only affected individuals who were born in 1950 or later. As a result, the 1950 cohort became entitled to extended benefits at age 57, while the 1949 cohort became eligible at age 55. The reform provides an ideal setting for RDD analysis given that the individuals cannot manipulate their eligibility status, which is based on the birth date. We also show that the individuals on both sides of the cutoff are highly similar in observable characteristics, and therefore it is likely that they do not differ significantly in terms of unobservables either. Despite this homogeneity, those born in 1950 worked on average notably more than those born in 1949 over the 10-year period. The jump of 7 months at the cutoff value is quite large in relation to the two-year difference in the minimum eligibility age for extended benefits. This implies that the extended benefit scheme as a whole must have a large negative impact on employment of the oldest worker groups.Our findings complement the previous studies on the effects of extended benefits by providing evidence on the full impact of the changes in employment months and earnings over the remaining working career. We also present novel evidence on the extent to which taxation and various income transfers counteract the earnings losses of the unemployed. The previous literature has not been able to assess fiscal impacts at such a detailed level. In addition, we contribute to the literature by examining broader impacts of extended benefits in terms of health, program substitution and spouse’s labor supply.Some previous studies have found a positive association between unemployment and mortality (e.g.Eliason, Storrie, 2009,Sullivan, von Wachter, 2009) and unemployment and adverse health outcomes (e.g.Black, Devereux, Salvanes, 2015,Schmitz, 2011). However, since extended UI benefits essentially secure the income for anunemployed personuntil retirement and can be regarded as an early retirement scheme, it may be that many of the negative effects of unemployment on an individual’s health are absent when extended benefits are available. This could explain why we find no change in mortality despite the large drop in unemployment months.Kuhn et al. (2018)study early retirement through an extended UI benefit scheme in Austria and find that retiring early does increase the risk of premature death for men but has no effect on women. Other studies provide mixed evidence on the effects of early retirement on health and mortality (e.g.Hernaes, Markussen, Piggott, Vestad, 2013,Hallberg, Johansson, Josephson, 2015,Bloemen, Hochguertel, Zweerink, 2017,Black, French, McCauley, Song, 2018,Fitzpatrick, Moore, 2018).Kuhn et al. (2018)argue that the differences in results from these studies can be due to differences in the health and socio-economic characteristics of the affected populations.Unlike some other studies (e.g.Inderbitzin et al., 2016), we find no evidence ofspillover effectson other benefit programs, such as sickness and disability benefit schemes. Furthermore, although several studies have found that thelabor supply decisionsof older couples are interrelated (e.g.Blau, 1998,Lalive, Parrotta, 2017,Michaud, 2003,Zweimuller et al., 1996), we find no effect on spouse’s behavior even though the extended benefits act as a pathway to early retirement for many unemployed workers. To the extent that the unemployed are not looking to retire through extended benefits and would rather return to employment, one would, of course, expect there to be differences compared to the setting in which both spouses’ decisions concern regular retirement.The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In the next section we describe the unemployment-related benefits for older workers in Finland.Section 3presents our research design andSection 4describes our data.Section 5presents some descriptive evidence.Section 6reports our estimation results and inSection 7we discuss the robustness of these results.

"1. IntroductionFemales now attend and complete college at significantly higher rates than males, and a similar gap exists between students from high- and low-income backgrounds (Bailey and Dynarski 2011;Bound and Turner 2011). These gaps concern policymakers who desire equal educational, social, and economic opportunities for all students (e.g.,Rodríguez-Planas 2012), as education, particularly postsecondary education, improves a host of long-term socioeconomic outcomes, including earnings (Card 1999),civic engagement(Dee 2004a), health (Grossman 2006), and crime (Lochner and Moretti 2004). Moreover, there are social benefits (i.e., positive externalities) of a more educated population (Moretti 2004a,b) that motivate a policy response.It is important, then, to identify the cost-effective interventions available to policymakers and college and university administrators that might close sociodemographic gaps in postsecondary educational success, particularly once students have matriculated, as male and first-generation college entrants complete college at lower rates than females and students with a history of college completion in their families, respectively (Bound and Turner 2011).Advising and mentoring programs constitute one class of potentially beneficial interventions, as such programs provide information, guidance, and general support to students who lack these resources in theirsocial networks(Angrist et al., 2009;Avery and Kane 2004;Bettinger et al., 2013;Deming and Dynarski 2009;Dynarski 2016;Evans et al., 2017;Rodríguez-Planas 2012). Indeed, mentoring and advising programs offered to high school seniors have been shown to increase high schoolgraduationand collegematriculationrates among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations (Castleman and Page 2015;Castleman et al., 2014;Stephan and Rosenbaum 2013), and colleges and universities now offer a wide array of advising and support services (Carlstrom and Miller 2013).However, there is relatively little causal evidence on the efficacy of postsecondary voluntary advising and mentoring interventions, and most observational studies are plagued by endogenous take-up of support services (Bettinger et al., 2013).1Moreover, the handful of credibly designed studies that randomize access to support services yield mixed evidence (Rodríguez-Planas 2012). One plausible explanation for these mixed results is low take-up rates of voluntary advising, mentoring, and support services (Angrist et al., 2014). Interventions that proactively engage students tend to have larger impacts on students’ academic success than those that do not, which supports this hypothesis. For example,Bettinger and Baker (2014)investigate InsideTrack, a program in which coaches repeatedly reach out to nontraditional college students via phone, email, text, and social media, and find that the program significantly increased retention and degree completion. Similarly,Evans et al. (2017)find that a comprehensive, multi-prongedcase managementintervention in which community college students were assigned a dedicated case manager (coach) tripled degree receipt among female students. Still, take-up was not universal and was higher among females.An open question of first-order importance to both the design and evaluation of such programs, then, is what malleable, cost-effective policy levers are available to postsecondary institutions that aim to increase students’ take-up and engagement of voluntary on-campus advising, mentoring, and support programs? The causal determinants of student take-up of such programs are largely unknown, though take-up is likely malleable. For example, a field experiment conducted at Reed College in Oregon finds that postcardadvertisementsfor peer tutoring services increased the use of tutoring by about 20% (Pugatch and Wilson 2018).We contribute to this literature by providing novel evidence on how assignment to a same-sex peer advisor affects students’ engagement with a voluntary peer-advising program at American University, which is a selective, midsized, private, non-for-profit university.2We address these research questions using rich administrative data from two cohorts of first-year undergraduate students at American University. Specifically, we exploit the quasi-random assignment of peer advisors to first-semester university students and find that male students assigned to male peer advisors are more likely to engage their peer advisor than are males assigned to female peer advisors; there is no such sex-match effect for female students.Moreover, male students benefit from random assignment to male peer advisors: reduced-form estimates show that male students assigned to male peer advisors are more likely to persist into their second year of college and to graduate (or remain enrolled) in four years than are males assigned to female peer advisors. However, there is no such effect on course grades, which is unsurprising given the non-academic focus of the peer-advising program. The reduced form estimates provide causal evidence that being assigned to a same-sex peer advisor increases male students’ likelihood of persistence and graduation. Qualitative evidence from exit surveys of program participants comport with the quantitative results and provide additional insights into students’ reasons for engaging the peer advisor and the channels through which peer advising increased student persistence.",Jimmy,Seth,None
"1. IntroductionImmigrant assimilation is often associated with cultural change. As emphasized byLazear (1999), adoption of the nativecultureby immigrants facilitates trade with natives and is therefore more likely in settings where trading opportunities with natives are large and trading opportunities with immigrants are small.In Lazear’s (1999) empirical work, adopting the native culture is measured by the adoption of the native language. There are, however, several other dimensions of native culture that could potentially be taken up by immigrants.Watkins and London (1994)emphasize one in particular, which may not be obvious, but it turns out to be empirically important: the adoption of American first names. Using data from US Censuses collected in the first half of the 20th century,1Abramitzky et al. (2017),Biavaschi et al. (2017), andGoldstein and Stecklov (2016)have used a variety of empirical strategies to show that the adoption of American sounding first names led to substantial improvements in labor market outcomes of first and second generation immigrants. Their conjecture is that this is due to a more successful assimilation process by those with American names.In spite of the benefits to adopting an American name, 20–30% of all immigrants in the 1900–1930 Censuses decided to keep a foreign name. This proportion varied considerably across locations, even within groups of immigrants with the same nationality, suggesting that there exists local variation in the costs and benefits of adopting an American name.2In this paper we examine how local labor market conditions and the local concentration of immigrants of different nationalities affect this decision. More generally, we seek to understand how different economic and social factors accelerate or hinder the process of immigrant assimilation.As inWatkins and London (1994)andLazear (1999), we start by examining the extent to which the degree of potential social interaction with other immigrants of the same country of origin affects the probability that an immigrant takes up an American name. We measure the degree of potential interaction using the concentration index developed byLazear (1999), who argued that as this index increased, so did opportunities for trade in the immigrantcommunity. The concentration index is defined as the number of individuals aged 16 to 65 in a county who were born in the given immigrant’s native country, divided by the total number of individuals residing in the county of residence of each immigrant (multiplied by 100), so it is a measure of the extent to which a random immigrant is able to find other immigrants with the same origin residing in the same location as him.3However, we go much beyondWatkins and London (1994)andLazear (1999)cross-sectional analysis, by relating the propensity of immigrants to carry an American first name to the local concentration of their compatriots.Our idea is instead to exploit within county variation to estimate the impact of local immigrant concentrations on naming decisions. This is important since the estimates from purely cross sectional analyses are more prone to contamination by local unobservables which drive both name adoption and local conditions, than estimates relating changes in name adoption to changes in local social andeconomic conditionsover time. We find that, on average, a onestandard deviationincrease in the concentration index leads to about a 1.4 percentage point decline in the share of immigrants adopting American names. This effect is particularly strong for immigrants who have been in the US for less than 5 years.In addition, a novelty of our paper is to relate the propensity of immigrants to carry an American first name to the local labor market conditions of their compatriots. Local labor market conditions for immigrants could affect the opportunities for trading both with other immigrants and with natives. We do not find strong impacts of the local labor market measures for immigrants on adoption of American names.We also try to understand to what extent immigrants with different years in the US responded differently to incentives when deciding to adopt American Names. To gain insight into the role of assimilation, we split the sample by years since arrival and examine the heterogeneity. The results suggest that the longer an immigrant is in the US, the weaker seems to be the average impact of network (concentration index) on American name adoption, while there is not much of a pattern with regards to economic variables. In fact, it is interesting that the impact of the concentration index is very strong early on after arrival.Finally, we examine the heterogeneity of the main results by the birthplace of immigrants. The results show that the concentration index has a stronger impact on name adoption in immigrants from Asia and Southern countries, a smaller but also significant effect on immigrants from Nordic countries and Mexico but no effect on name adoption of immigrants from Eastern Europe and Germany.Although we show results based on the standard indices of name foreignness used, for example, inAbramitzky et al. (2017), andGoldstein and Stecklov (2016), our preferred models use an alternative definition of American name. The definition of American name we use takes all the top 100 baby names in the US Social Security records of the 1900s (independently of the etymological origin), plus all the remaining names in that list (top 101 to top 1000) which are etymologically of American origin, i.e. names that are not from a Latin, Greek, German, Eastern European, Scandinavian, Asian, or other non-American/non-British origin.4Our results are qualitatively similar regardless of the definition we use.According to our definition of what is an American name, we document that at any given time between 1900 and 1930, around 77% of male immigrants in the US had an American first name. In contrast, American first names were much less common among immigrants at the time of their arrival (for example, less than 1% for Italians according to arrival records from Ellis Island). In addition, the proportion of individuals from different countries (in the 1900–1930 US censuses) who have one of the top three American names (John, William and George) among immigrants from that country is larger for immigrants from 6 countries than it is for US natives. This is an indication that a significant number of immigrants tend to have more stereotypical American names than natives. The percentage of top three American names ranges from around 2% for Japan to about 25% for Greece. In contrast, only 15% of US natives held any of the three top names. Consistent with the findings ofAbramitzky et al. (2017),Biavaschi et al. (2017), andGoldstein and Stecklov (2016), immigrants with American names (according to our preferred definition) are shown to work in occupations with better occupation scores, to be more likely to have a US born spouse, to be more likely to speak english, and to be more likely to be a US citizen.It is worthwhile noting thatAbramitzky et al. (2017), andGoldstein and Stecklov (2016)focus the bulk of their studies on the naming choice of second generation immigrants, who are all born in the US. The relevant actor in this case is the immigrant parent, who must decide how to name her native born child. We focus instead on the decision of the immigrant to change his own first name after he arrives in the US. Our framework, which exploits variation in local labor market conditions experienced by immigrants residing in different counties, is more appropriate to understand this decision, than to understand the decision of how to name one’s child, which probably considers more long run forecasts of the future economic prospects of children. Nevertheless, we also show that the naming choice of second generation immigrants responds to the concentration index for sons (but not for daughters).Beyond the three papers already referred to (Abramitzky et al. (2017),Biavaschi et al. (2017), andGoldstein and Stecklov (2016)), and regarding name changes in broader contexts, this paper is related toArai and Thoursie (2009),Algan et al. (2013), andRubinstein and Brenner (2014).Arai and Thoursie (2009)studied the effects of surname change to Swedish-sounding or neutral names for immigrants from Asian, African and Slavic countries. They found an increase in annual earnings after a name change and argued that those changes are a response to discrimination. In a different context,Algan et al. (2013)studied parental naming decisions between Arabic and non-Arabic first names to newborn babies in France over the 2003–2007 period. Using exogenous allocation of public housings dwellings as an identification strategy, they found evidence for the significant economic factors affecting parental naming choices.Rubinstein and Brenner (2014)used sorting into inter-ethnic marriage and differences between Israeli ethnic surnames to study ethnic discrimination in labor markets. Both papers relate closely to the literature looking to racial discrimination and black names (see, for example,Fryer and Levitt (2004),Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004)andCook et al. (2014), among others).5See alsoOlivetti and Paserman (2015)andGüell et al. (2015)for the use of informational contents of names to studyintergenerational mobility.Our paper is also related to the economics literature on identity. The simple model we consider followsLazear (1999)and focuses primarily on the role of market interactions, but we could have written instead an economic model of immigrant identity. Identity may influence preferences (and behaviors and outcomes), and the fact that it operates intrinsically through groups leads to complex group dynamics and equilibria. For example, seeAkerlof and Kranton (2000)andBenabou and Tirole (2006)for theoretical work, as well asCasey and Dustmann (2010)andManning and Roy (2010)for empirical work on this issue.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.Section 2describes the data and documents the extent to which immigrants at the turn of the 20th century adopted American names (for them and their children). It also briefly shows to what extent the adoption of an American name, according to our preferred definition, is associated with better assimilation, as measured by labor market and social outcomes.Section 3presents a simple economic model of name choice, as a function of labor market and network variables.Section 4provides estimates of this model, andSection 5concludes. Online appendices provide a detailed description of the classification of the name types and additional empirical results that are omitted from the main text.",Pedro,Sokbae,Hugo
"1. IntroductionEntrepreneurship evokes individuals driven by ambition and opportunities who choose to take risks to start their own business, with positive externalities for the economy. In many countries, young firms create most jobs during their start-up period (Fölster, 2000;Haltiwanger et al., 2013;Sedláček and Sterk, 2017;Heyman et al., 2018). Yet many entrepreneurs also start businesses because they see no better employment options, particularly in developing countries where underemployment is prevalent and wage jobs are rare (Schoar, 2010). Policy makers around the world have been interested in stimulating and facilitating entrepreneurship. Youth employment is often of particular policy concern since unemployment is higher for youths than for adults in many countries. The transition from education to work can also be lengthy, especially in regions such as the Middle East and North Africa. To help address this issue, policy makers have considered fostering skills for entrepreneurship before youths exit theeducation system.Entrepreneurship educationand training programs have rapidly expanded in developed and developing countries alike (Kuratko, 2005;Valerio et al., 2014).Despite the popularity of entrepreneurship education, evidence of its effectiveness in improving employment outcomes over the medium to long-term is lacking. Existing evidence tends to focus on impacts on participants’ intentions while in school, not on actual project creation or employment outcomes after students have graduated and joined the labor market (for meta-reviews, seeBae et al., 2014;Grimm and Paffhausen, 2015;Martin et al., 2013;Nabi et al., 2017orValerio et al., 2014). Observed impacts on entrepreneurial intentions vary substantially. For example,Peterman and Kennedy (2003)andSouitaris et al. (2007)find some impacts of entrepreneurship education on entrepreneurial intentions among secondary school and university students, respectively.Rosendahl Huber et al. (2014)perform a randomized experiment of an entrepreneurship program that aims to teach children aged 11–12 the basics of business and entrepreneurship and to promote teamwork and leadership in the classroom. They find a positive effect on non-cognitive entrepreneurial skills. In contrast,Oosterbeek et al. (2010)show that an entrepreneurship education program had no effect on university students’ entrepreneurial skills and had a negative effect on the intention of becoming an entrepreneur.Elert et al. (2015)is a rare study looking at the long-term impact of entrepreneurship education on entrepreneurship. They find that high-school entrepreneurial education has an effect on the probability of starting a firm in Sweden, though they do not analyze broader employment outcomes.When modeling entry into entrepreneurship, researchers have distinguished between several stages such as latent, nascent and actual entrepreneurship (e.g.,Blanchflower et al., 2001;Gries and Naudé, 2011). Latent entrepreneurship refers to an entrepreneurial spirit, having business ideas, or the declared preference for self-employment over wage employment. Nascent entrepreneurs, on the other hand, are actively trying to start a new business (Grilo and Thurik, 2005;Reynolds et al., 2004). Studies analyzing the effects of entrepreneurship education on entrepreneurial intentions have mostly focused on latent entrepreneurship. The lack of evidence on impacts on nascent or actual entrepreneurship upongraduationis at times justified by a potential “time lag” from intentions to actions (Souitaris et al., 2007). However, it is not clear how long the duration of that time lag may be.Gielnik et al. (2017)highlight variations in impacts over time in the two years after individuals participate in entrepreneurship training.Beiler (2017)analyzes the effect ofeconomic conditionson entrepreneurship among college graduates. He finds that patterns of entry into entrepreneurship are largely explained by effects occurring during the first year after students’ graduation. Ultimately, it is an empirical question whether changes in short-term intentions are predictive of longer-term effects on nascent or actual entrepreneurship.In addition to focusing mostly on entrepreneurial intentions or latent entrepreneurship, existing evidence on entrepreneurship education is often based on quasi-experimental methods.1Meta-analyses have suggested that observational or quasi-experimental evaluations of entrepreneurship education programs tend to obtain larger estimates of program impacts than experimental studies (Grimm and Paffhausen, 2015;Martin et al., 2013), possibly as they do not address all potential sources of bias or challenges to internal validity.The broader literature analyzing the impact of entrepreneurship-support interventions on labor market and firm outcomes has shown a wide variation in program effectiveness (for a review, seeCho and Honorati, 2014). Most studies on business training analyze whether the skills of existing entrepreneurs can be strengthened to improve their productivity (for a review, seeMcKenzie and Woodruff, 2014). Business training can affect enterprise owners’ practices, although effects on employment or productivity are more limited in general and for women in particular (Bruhn and Zia, 2013;Cirera and Qasim, 2014;De Mel et al., 2014;Drexler et al., 2014;Karlan and Valdivia, 2011;Klinger and Schündeln, 2011). Business training focusing on psychological dimensions such as personal initiative or problem-solving appears more effective than traditional business skill training (Campos et al., 2017). In contrast, fewer studies focus on whether business training can equip individuals with the skills required to enter self-employment, and whether these impacts are sustained in the medium to long-term. There are still relatively few experimental studies analyzing the impact of training programs beyond a three-year horizon, though the literature is growing (Alzúa et al., 2016;Attanasio et al., 2017;Ibarrarán et al., 2018;Kugler et al., 2015;Alfonsi et al., 2019;Crépon and Premand, 2019). The few studies that document impacts of (micro-) entrepreneurship support programs over time show variations depending on the time frame being considered (Fiala, 2018), including short-term impacts that do not last (Blattman et al., 2018). In addition, recent meta-analyses acknowledge the lack of evidence on active labor market programs for specific groups, such as young women, skilled youths, or growth-oriented entrepreneurs (Card et al., 2018;McKenzie, 2017a).In this paper, we present new experimental evidence on the medium-term impacts of entrepreneurship education on labor-market outcomes. We analyze the timeline of impacts of an entrepreneurship education program for university students in Tunisia, including entry into self-employment and labor market outcomes up to four years after graduation. As such, we also study the duration of the potential time lag between entrepreneurial intentions and actions, and whether changes in short-term intentions lead to later changes in latent, nascent or actual entrepreneurship.The paper complements earlier evidence presented inPremand et al. (2016), which focuses on the short-term impact of entrepreneurship education one year after students’ graduation. Short-term results showed that entrepreneurship education targeted to university students in Tunisia had small absolute impacts on entry into self-employment, with effects ranging from 1 to 4 percentage points. However, the employment rate among applicants remained unchanged. Findings on intermediary outcomes were consistent with the limited employment results: the program improved business skills but had mixed impacts on personality and entrepreneurial traits. Yet results also showed that participation in the entrepreneurship track heightened graduates’ aspirations toward the future. As such, short-term results raised the question of whether larger impacts could be expected in the medium to long-term.The medium-term experimental evidence we present in this paper shows that the impacts of entrepreneurship education were short-lived. We find no sustained impacts on self-employment or employment outcomes four years after graduation. An analysis of students’ employment history and project realization process shows how the intervention temporarily affected nascent entrepreneurship: the treatment group had more business ideas, was more likely to try setting up a project and to succeed at some point as a result of trying more. However, most impacts are concentrated in the year after graduation and phase out after that. Consistent with these results, few lasting impacts are found on other intermediary outcomes conducive to entrepreneurship. Among the changes in skills that were observed in the short-term, only a small impact on business knowledge remains four years later. Business networks have not expanded and connections with private-sector entrepreneurs are not more likely. While treated youths are slightly more likely to know how to apply for credit, almost three out of four youths report access to credit as the main barrier to entrepreneurship. Overall, there are no sustained effects on latent entrepreneurship either. Most students who had business ideas have abandoned them and participants in the entrepreneurship training do not have more business ideas than the control group. The increased optimism observed one year after graduation was also short-lived. Finally, patterns of heterogeneity are weak, and the lack of medium-term impact holds across sub-groups defined based on gender, access to financing, skills or networks.The paper is organized as follows.Section 2provides context and an overview of the intervention.Section 3provides a description of the experimental design, study timeline and data.2Section 4outlines thetheory of changeand main outcomes.Section 5details the empirical identification strategy.Section 6provides the main results of the intervention on self-employment in the short and medium run.Section 7presents results on the mechanisms and channels for impact on entrepreneurship.Section 8presents results of the intervention on broader employment outcomes.Section 9concludes.

"1. IntroductionIn light of low fertility and female employment rates the provision of public childcare has been on the agenda of many countries (Immervoll and Barber, 2006). The expansion of public childcare is supposed to increase fertility, mothers’ labor market attachment, and promote childrens’ development in early life. Therefore, many countries have been increasing availability of public or publicly subsidized childcare, especially for children aged below three years. On average,OECDcountries increased enrollment to formal childcare in this age group from 29 to 34 percent, i.e. by 5 percentage points, between 2006 and 20142. In this time period, Germany is among the countries with the strongest increase in child care coverage: enrollment more than doubled from 14 to 32 percent over that time span.3A positive effect of public childcare on maternal employment can be rationalized within an economic model of the family (Blau, 2003). The implied decrease in costs of childcare changes the relative utilities of consumption and leisure. Yet, income effects, preferences for the quality of care, or the availability of alternative modes of childcare loosen this relationship. In particular, subsidized childcare may crowd-out private or informal care keeping maternal employment constant.Given the theoretical ambiguity, an empirical literature on the employment effects of subsidized childcare has emerged. Evidence from early empirical studies based on cross-sectional variation or structural models unequivocally points to a significant impact of costs and availability of childcare on mothers’ labor supply (Anderson, Levine, 2000,Blau, Currie, 2006). More recent studies based on quasi-experimental variation induced bypolicy reforms, however, find mixed results. Although a majority of findings confirms the significant effect of the availability of public or subsidized childcare,4several analyses report negligible or insignificant estimates.5Moreover, effects are often found to be heterogeneous: the impact is larger for singles (compared to married mothers), women without additional young children (compared to mothers with multiple young children), for less educated mothers (compared to high-skilled women with lower elasticities), and it increases with the age of the youngest child.In this study, we follow the quasi-experimental approach to identify potential effects of childcare availability on mothers’ labor supply. We exploit the variation across regions and over time in the supply of childcare that has been introduced by two comprehensive policy reforms in Germany from 2005 and 2008. Starting from very low levels, childcare coverage for children aged 0 to 3 in West Germany rose dramatically. In our observation period from 2007 to 2014, the provision of subsidized childcare increased from about 8% to more than 27%. We are thus able to work with a substantial increase in the provision of childcare and not only marginal changes in childcare costs. Peculiarities of the administrative process and frictions in the market for childcare led to regional variation over time. We argue that – conditional on covariates – this variation can be considered exogenous and used for identification. Exploiting this variation, we assess whether there is a causal link between the provision of publicly subsidized childcare and the labor supply of mothers with children aged 1 to 3 in West Germany.In order to account for unobserved regional differences that might confound the causal relationship between the availability of childcare and mothers’ labor supply, we control for year and countyfixed effects. The empirical analysis is based on eight waves of the GermanMicrocensus. This data set does not contain information on the individual choice of a childcare arrangement. We can, however, estimate intention-to-treat effects (ITT) of the provision of public childcare on maternal labor supply. More specifically, we analyze whether the expansion of subsidized childcare has affected mothers’labor force participation, part-time and full-time employment.With this analysis we contribute to the literature in several ways: Our study quantifies the impact of the expansion in public childcare on maternal employment. In contrast to other studies that have analyzed similar childcare expansions in other countries, we not only look at effects on total labor market participation, but also on different types of employment. Moreover, our data set allows us to control not only for the increase in the total availability of childcare slots but also on the share of full-time slots. Finally, our analysis of heterogenous effects for different socio-economic subgroups adds to the literature on distributional consequences of public policies.We find a statistically significant intention-to-treat effect of the expansion of subsidized childcare for children under the age of three on mothers’ labor supply. An increase in availability of subsidized childcare slots by one percentage point increases mothers’ participation rate by 0.2 percentage points, which translates to an elasticity of 0.04. This is slightly below the findings from an evaluation of a comparable policy reform in the 1990s that affected older children (Bauernschuster and Schlotter, 2015) but virtually identical to simulations results of the expansion of childcare for children aged 1–3 years based on a structural model estimated on data from 2001 to 2006 (Geyer et al., 2015). Estimates for different types of employment show that the increase in mothers’ employment that can be causally related to the expansion in childcare is almost entirely driven by part-time employment ranging from 20 to 35 h per week. Part-time employment up to 20 h per week or full-time employment rates have not changed due to the expansion of subsidized childcare. Full-time employment is also not affected by a rising share of full-time slots (i.e. childcare of more than 6 h per day). Differentiating by socio-economic groups, we find that neither high-skilled nor low-skilled mothers react to the reform. Mothers with mediumskill levels(who make up about 60 percent of all mothers in our sample) are driving the aggregate effect.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.Section 2briefly sketches theoretical predictions on the relationship between the availability of public childcare and mothers’ labor supply and gives an overview of the empirical literature. It also provides a detailed description of the childcare market and policy reforms in Germany.

"1. IntroductionJob insecurity has increased in mostOECDcountries in the aftermath of theGreat Recession(OECD, 2016) and, as a consequence, so has the fear of losing one’s job.1Job insecurity has been a defining feature of some European countries for several decades. After the reforms that took place in the Eighties as a way to introduce flexibility into the labour market, economies like Spain, France or Italy developed adual labour marketstructure with two easily identifiable sets of workers. As opposed to workers with permanent (or open-ended) contracts, those with fixed-term (or temporary) contracts suffer greater exposure to the risk of job loss since the latter, by definition, have a predetermined expiration date. Moreover, further increases in job insecurity are likely in the current context of ‘uberisation’ of the economy and the appearance of zero-hour contracts. While some degree of flexibility is needed for firms to adjust to the economic cycle, job insecurity can be harmful to affected workers. In particular, fixed-term contracts have been shown to lead tolower wages, lower levels of job satisfaction, lower levels of physical and mental health and increased occupational mismatch, among other negative consequences.2The negative consequences of job insecurity are likely to spill over onto other members of the household, in particular children. This paper analyses the intergenerational impact of job insecurity by investigating how the contractual arrangement of working parents affects children’s school related outcomes. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first article that tries to identify the causal effect of parental contractual form on children’s outcomes.Some of the negative consequences of fixed-term contracts affect variables that are normally considered to be inputs affecting the production function of cognitive achievement. These include impacts on parental income, parental time investments and parent’s mental health. Lower levels of income associated with fixed-term contracts could affect the financial resources devoted to children’s education (Blau, 1999). Job insecurity could also be linked to a reduction of the time spent with children if job insecure parents need to devote a disproportionately higher amount of time to look for a more secure job (Becker, 1993). Additionally, it could be difficult to isolate children from the negative consequences on parent’s mental health that could be derived from insecure employment conditions.3The estimation of a causal relationship between parent’s contract type and child schooling outcomes faces two main obstacles. First, it is uncommon to find linked parent-child datasets with rich data of parental labour market characteristics and detailedschool performance. To overcome this obstacle, I use data from the SpanishLabour Force Survey(LFS), that allows linking all members living in the same household at the time of the interview. Given that all members aged sixteen or higher reply to the individual questionnaire, I can construct broad variables measuring school related outcomes. In particular, the information in the Spanish LFS allows the researcher to measure whether an individual has finished compulsory education on time at age sixteen; whether the student is not observed in theeducation systemonce she has reached the legal age to drop out; and the even more pervasive outcome capturing whether the student is not in education, employment or training (NEET) at the age of sixteen. All these indicators make poor employment and earnings prospects more likely in the longer term, among other potentially negative consequences.4The second challenge to estimating a causal relationship between parent’s contract type and child related outcomes is related to the fact that the type of contract under which any of the parents is hired is likely correlated with unobserved parental and household characteristics that also affect schooling outcomes of the child.5This paper uses exogenous variation inregional labour marketpolicies in Spain to identify the causal effects of interest. AsDolado et al. (2002)put it, “if one looks for a country to test for the different effects of temporary work contracts on the labour market, Spain provides a fascinating case study”. After the 1984 liberalisation reform, the use of fixed-term contracts in Spain suffers a substantial increase.Fig. 1shows that from the first year of data available in 1987, the fixed-term employment rate increases steadily from about 15% in 1987 to over 30% in the early 1990’s.Download :Download high-res image (77KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. Fixed-Term employment rates in Spain (%). Source: Spanish National Institute of Statistics. The first data point starts in the second quarter of 1987. The series shows total employment under fixed-term contracts over total employment.After this dramatic increase in fixed-term contracts, several national reforms in the 1990’s and early 2000’s tried to reverse the situation. From 1997, also some regional governments introduced different programs aiming to increase the fraction of permanent contracts. In practice, these programs consisted of introducing regional wage subsidies as a way to offer incentives to firms to convert fixed-term contracts into permanent contracts. Not all regional governments implemented them, and among the regional governments that designed subsidies to foster permanent employment, the amount of the subsidy varied between differentdemographicgroups and across time. I adapt the strategy followed inBarceló and Villanueva (2016), who study the impact of contract type on household financialwealth, to construct an instrument for the contract type held by the father when the student is sixteen years old.6In particular, the instrument is constructed using subsidy variation across region, gender, time and age of the worker at the time of hiring. First stage estimates suggest that the amount of regional subsidies available to convert fixed-term contracts into permanent contracts had a positive and significant impact on the likelihood of holding permanent contracts. A battery of robustness checks suggest that the instrument is strong for fathers, whereas it is rather weak when trying to predict maternal’s contract type. Therefore the analysis in this paper focuses mainly on the role of father’s contract type on school related outcomes of the child.The results show that students whose fathers hold a permanent contract (as opposed to a temporary or fixed-term contract) are, on average, about 7.8 percentage points more likely to graduate on time. They are also less likely to drop out of education at age sixteen by about 2.5 percentage points, and there is suggestive evidence indicating that they are less likely to be classified as NEET by about 1.6 percentage points. These magnitudes are sizeable and represent, respectively, about 37%, 19% and 23% of the initial raw difference in these outcomes between individuals whose fathers have a permanent versus a fixed-term contract (and about 16%, 9% and 7.5% of the overallstandard deviationof the outcome, respectively). Robustness checks show that the main results in this paper are not driven by parents with recent experiences of unemployment.I explore potential mechanisms for the negative effects of father’s fixed-term contract. The results suggest that fathers with fixed-term contracts want to work more hours. Additionally, fathers on fixed-term contracts show significantly lower levels of job satisfaction in several aspects of their jobs; in particular with respect to satisfaction with job stability. Big differential effects in job satisfaction are likely to be felt at the household level. In fact, work in social psychology has shown that children as young as 5 years of age can develop clear perceptions of the world of work and parent’s job insecurity, and understand concepts such as pay, labor disputes, unemployment and welfare (Barling et al., 1999).Temporality and unemployment spells are frequently alternated by job insecure workers. As a result, this paper is linked to the literature analysing the intergenerational effects of parental unemployment. A recent paper in this literature is the one byPinger (2016), that finds that paternal unemployment has a considerable negative effect on the probability to complete upper secondary education. The impact of parental unemployment also seems to affectlife satisfactionof children (Nikolova and Nikolaev, 2018). Workers with fixed-term contracts, in the absence of contract conversion, are faced with job loss at the termination date. Therefore, the results in the job loss literature are also relevant to this paper. Examples of negative impacts of parental job loss on school performance includeRege et al. (2011), who show negative impacts of parental job loss due to plant closure in Norway, andRuiz-Valenzuela (2015)who shows negative effects of job losses stemming from the Great Recession in Spain.7Even if the effects reported in this paper might seem large, other papers in this related literature have also found rather large effects for the impact of paternal unemployment or paternal job loss on children’s outcomes. For instance, using data from Germany,Pinger (2016)finds that parental unemployment at the time of the upper secondary education decision reduces the probability of obtaining a higher education certificate by about one third. Another example in the job loss literature, byRege et al. (2011), finds that paternal job loss has a negative effect on graduating secondary students’ school performance in Norway, reducing graduation-year GPA by about 6% of the standard deviation overall (11% of the standard deviation in municipalities with mediocre performing job markets).The remainder of the paper is organised as follows.Section 2describes the Spanish labour market and the institutional framework in place during the eighties, nineties and early 2000’s.Section 3describes the data, whereasSection 4presents the empirical strategy.

"1. IntroductionA long and growing literature has shown that labour markets are undergoing structural change due to ongoing technological progress: as codifiable or “routine” tasks are automated by digital technologies, the demand for labour in jobs which intensively perform routine tasks is reduced relative to other tasks (seeAcemoglu and Autor (2011)for an overview). Consequently, workers in routine-task intensive jobs will reallocate towards jobs that are less routine-task intensive, leading to structural change in the composition of jobs and their relative wages. However, despite an extensive literature examining the reallocation of workers across jobs, there is relatively little work that directly tests whether the labour market is organised along jobs and their task content, i.e. that there are markets for jobs.Following automation, the reallocation of displaced workers towards new jobs can be costly for those workers if they cannot easily switch to other jobs for which they are less specialized in terms of their task competencies. In the scenario where markets for jobs overlap because of common task content, the impact of the automation of routine tasks would tend to diffuse, lessening its impact on any one group of workers. But if job markets are mostly insular, automation is mainly felt locally by workers with routine-task competencies, leading to those workers carrying most of the burden of adjustment. Although the idea that technological progress or any other task-biased shock results in winners and losers is not new (see, for example,Autor et al. (2015)), there is little empirical evidence that quantifies the distributional consequences of such shocks across workers with different task competencies.To address these issues, this paper examines labour market outcomes of unemployed job seekers with different task competencies.1The paper (i) examines whether the labour market is organized along jobs, defined as detailed occupation-experience cells and their corresponding tasks, and estimates the importance of overlap across jobs based on their common task content; and (ii) uses these estimates to assess the distributional consequences of the automation of routine tasks for unemployment durations across unemployed job seekers with different task competencies. Regarding (i), we find that the labour market is, at least in part, organized along jobs for which an unemployed job seeker fully qualifies in terms of her task competencies. We also find that there is overlap across jobs in terms of their task content – i.e. unemployed job seekers also compete for jobs for which they only partially qualify in terms of their task competencies. But the extent of this task overlap is quite limited: unemployed job seekers can only compete for jobs for which they have the large majority of all required task competencies. These results are direct evidence that markets for jobs and their task content are important for understanding job search. Regarding (ii), limited importance of task overlap across jobs implies that the automation of routine tasks (or any other task-biased shock) can have pronounced distributional consequences for unemployment durations across unemployed job seekers with different task competencies. In particular, we quantify by how much unemployed job seekers with mainly routine-task competencies are disproportionately hurt by ongoing automation.Our empirical approach is to estimate a well-established empirical model capturing job search externalities (seePetrongolo and Pissarides (2001)for an overview), making use of the positive relationship between the re-employment probability of an unemployed job seeker and her labour market tightness, defined as the number of vacancies relative to the number of unemployed job seekers across all jobs that are relevant to her. In particular, we relate a job seeker’s expected unemployment duration to the average tightness she faces across jobs for which she fully or partially qualifies in terms of her task competencies. Because our definition of an unemployed job seeker’s relevant labour market also includes those jobs for which she only partially qualifies, we account for the importance of task overlap across jobs in labour markets.To model task overlap, we build on (Manning and Petrongolo, 2017) who estimate the extent of spatial overlap in job search. Their analysis defines markets as disaggregated geographical units but allows local labour markets to overlap, i.e. for tightness in geographically close-by markets to influence the re-employment probability of a job seeker in a given locality.2Their estimates show evidence of high costs of distance, but they also find that policies targeted at a specific local labour market have limited impact because important ripple effects diffuse their impacts through surrounding areas. Our analysis adapts their approach by defining distance as task dissimilarities between jobs.The main contribution of this paper is that it provides direct evidence in support of the idea that labour markets are, at least in part, organized along detailed jobs and their corresponding tasks. To show this, we use representative data on unemployed job seekers and vacancies from an online job search platform in Belgium. The data contains detailed information on unemployed job seekers’ task competencies as well as vacancies’ task requirements across jobs, where a job is defined as an occupation-experience cell taken from the highly disaggregate ROME-V3 classification of jobs and their related task descriptions. We observe over 2000 jobs and 3000 tasks, with each job consisting of 7 tasks on average. For each of the 139,944 unemployed job seekers that we observe on the online platform in 8 repeated cross-sections during 2013–2014, we merge individual-level administrative data from different sources on their employment histories between 2010–2015 together with a number of person characteristics. Based on these data, the importance of jobs and their task content is shown by the predictive power of job market tightness over re-employment probabilities of unemployed job seekers. Moreover, we show the existence ofspilloversin search externalities between jobs that have more than 80% of their tasks in common. However, we also find substantial rigidities for unemployed job seekers to compete for jobs for which they do not have the large majority of required task competencies. These rigidities have important consequences for the distributional impacts of task-biased shocks.To illustrate this, this paper also quantifies the distributional effects of automation, captured by an adverse routine-biased task shock in vacancies, on job seekers’ unemployment durations. In a benchmark scenario of a single labour market where task competencies don’t matter and each unemployed job seeker can compete for each vacancy, expected unemployment duration would increase the same for all job seekers in response to automation. We then compare this increase to the distribution of changes in unemployment durations under the actually estimated importance of task overlap across jobs, finding substantial differences between unemployed job seekers with different task competencies. Indeed, following automation, unemployed job seekers with mainly routine-task competencies experience a fourfold increase in their unemployment durations compared to the single labour market scenario. To the contrary, unemployed job seekers with non-routine task competencies are largely insulated from automation, suggesting thatactive labour market policiesshould only target disadvantaged job seekers with routine-task competencies.",Maarten,Emilie,Anna
"1. IntroductionSeveral European countries faced large inflows of asylum seekers between 2014 and 2017. During this period, almost 1.5 million individuals applied for asylum in Germany. Throughout 2014-18, Germany issued almost 950,000 positive decisions on asylum claims (data from Eurostat). At least in the short and medium term, the recognised refugees are likely to remain in Germany. Despite migrating for non-economic reasons, many of them intend to work. Thelabour market integrationof refugees is crucial for their own well-being. It also affects public finances and shapes the public view on refugee migration, which in turn influences migration policy at large. According to the German Federal Employment Agency, as of December 2018, about 456,000 refugees and asylum seekers were registered with the Public Employment Services (PES) as job-seekers and 175,000 among them were classified as unemployed.1A growing number of academic studies emphasise that the labour market integration of refugees is more challenging than that of unemployed natives or of other immigrants.2Refugees often have to comply with additional legal requirements and restrictions in the host countries. In addition, they differ from other immigrant groups in terms of background characteristics and life experiences, which can partly explain refugees’ inferior labour market outcomes, as discussed byKeller (2016). However, as suggested byDustmann et al. (2016), specific policies have the potential to accelerate the labour market integration of refugees.While language and professional skills certainly matter for the employment of refugees, labour market frictions, such as a lack of information about host-country labour market, limitedsocial networks, uncertainty concerning asylum or residence status, and legal barriers may create additional obstacles for refugees. Similarly, employers who could potentially benefit from hiring a refugee may be discouraged by a lack of information and high perceived hiring costs. To what extent do these frictions affect the chance of job-seeking refugees and potential employers to form successful matches? In particular, can a simple and inexpensive job search assistance programme ease these frictions and increase employment rates?To address these questions, we set up a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) that allows us to estimate the causal effect of easing matching frictions on labour market outcomes of refugees and asylum seekers in Munich.3The participants of our study arrived in Germany between 2014 and 2017. We met the participants during regular job-counselling sessions of a Munich-based NGO, which provides job search support for refugees. Over the period May 2016-September 2017, we interviewed over 400 job-seeking refugees in person. All participants of the job-counselling sessions received a CV in German and basic job search information. In a second step, we randomly allocated each participant to either the treatment or the control group. Those who were part of the treatment group benefitted from the NGO’s job-matching services. The CV profiles of the participants in the treatment group were added to a database, which the NGO’s employees use for matching with potential employers. Once the NGO identified a potential match between a job-seeker and a vacancy, the NGO (with the consent of the job-seeker) forwarded his or her CV to the employer. This means that the treatment could reduce the matching frictions between job-seeking refugees and potential employers, without affecting the underlying skills of the former.Thetreatment effectswe estimate are based on 298 follow-up surveys conducted after six months and 195 follow-up surveys conducted twelve months after the initial job-counselling sessions. For the full sample, the estimated treatment effects at the time of the first follow-up survey are relatively small. With our data, we do not have sufficient statistical power to reach a clear conclusion about the effect of the job-matching intervention after six months. However, we find larger, albeit only marginally significant, positive effects on employment after twelve months. We then investigate heterogeneity of the effects by education and by legal status, after having observed that the level of matching frictions varies along these two dimensions. We find that the positive effects of the intervention prevail among refugees who face more difficulties accessing the German labour market, i.e. those with lower levels of education and those facing uncertainty about their asylum status. Our data does not support the view that lower search efforts among these individuals drive the results. Rather, job-seekers with these characteristics have a higher need for the job search assistance offered by the NGO, as they have limited access to other providers of similar services and may not search effectively on their own. In addition, potential employers may disregard their applications due to perceived higher hiring costs. In this case, firms that receive a CV from the NGO can get encouraged to hire counting on the NGO’s support.Our project relates to the literature on theeconomic integrationof refugees. Researchers have identified a number of important factors that may affect refugees’ integration: initial conditions upon arrival (Braun and Dwenger, 2017), expected duration of stay (Adda, Gorlach, Dustmann, 2014,Dustmann, Görlach, 2016),4legal status (Devillanova et al., 2018), and length of the asylum process (Hainmueller et al., 2016). A few studies evaluate specific integration policies aimed at refugees. For instance,Clausen et al. (2009)analyse the effect of different integration policies on the job search duration for refugees andfamily reunificationmigrants, using administrative data from Denmark. They find wage subsidies to be an effective policy tool to integrate newly arrived refugees into the labour market.Rosholm and Vejlin (2010)also use Danish data, and look at how incentives influence the extent to which refugees take up work. They find that lowering income transfers for refugees increases theirlabour force participation.Lochmann et al. (2019)find large effects of language training on labour force participation in France using aregression discontinuity design.Andersson Joona et al. (2015)evaluate a Swedishlabour market reformaimed at supporting refugees in finding employment faster using a difference-in-difference design. They do not find any significant short-term effects of increased support by the public employment services. However, analysing outcomes after two and three years,Andersson Joona et al. (2016)find a positive impact on both employment and wages.Our work also relates to the larger literature on the effects of active labour market programmes aimed at immigrants and at unemployed individuals overall. Exploiting a cut-off eligibility rule and using Finnish data,Sarvimäki and Hämäläinen (2016)find that restructuring training for unemployed immigrants can substantially increase their long-term earnings. Similarly,Åslund and Johansson (2011)investigate the effects of a workplace introduction programme targetingdisadvantaged groupsof immigrants in Sweden, and find it to be effective in transitioning individuals to schemes that lead to larger employment probabilities. Using an RCT approach,Maibom et al. (2017)find that individual meetings with case workers improve future employment outcomes of unemployed Danish workers.Manoli et al. (2018)evaluate the long-term effects of a job search assistance programme for the unemployed in Nevada. They find that monitoring of search effort and personalised job-counselling lead to long-term employment and earnings gains.Belot et al. (2018)evaluate an online tool to improve the job search of unemployed individuals in Edinburgh. The tool significantly increased the number of job interviews, especially for participants who otherwise searched narrowly and had been unemployed for a few months.Abel et al. (2018)estimate the effects of plan-making on job search behaviour and employment among unemployed youth. The study shows that, beyond the time allocated to job search, efficiency and effectiveness of search activities is important.Butschek and Walter (2014)present a meta-analysis of a large number of studies focused on evaluating the impact of active labour market programmes for the integration of immigrants across European countries, including job search assistance. Their results indicate wage subsidies to be the most effective policy to foster employment.Card et al. (2018)also provide a large meta-study on evaluations of active labour market programmes. Their results show that job search assistance programmes can be particularly effective for disadvantaged job-seekers. While not targeted at refugees, a number of the above studies suggests that job-matching services add value as they help to identify potential employers and make it easier to approach them. This is particularly relevant for individuals who are likely to not search effectively on their own. However, it is not obvious that findings from studies on native unemployed or immigrants in general can provide a useful benchmarks for refugees. Unemployed natives and other immigrants often have more experience in the local labour market and do not face many of the disadvantages that hinder the employment of refugees. Furthermore, certain characteristics of these individuals (some of which may have contributed to their unemployment) might not be present to the same extent among refugees.The contribution of this paper to the existing literature is threefold. First, we provide a rigorous evaluation of a job search assistance service for refugees through an RCT. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to use an RCT for the evaluation of a labour market programme that specifically targets refugees. Using a clean identification strategy is important because unobservable characteristics are likely to influence the decision to contact service providers and, at the same time, may affect labour market outcomes. We show that lower educated refugees and those facing uncertainty regarding their legal status experience particular difficulties in their job search process and that, in certain cases, a job-matching service can significantly increase their employment. This suggests that policies targeted at facilitating labour market entry may be effective also for refugees. Second, we present details on what our treatment has entailed in practice, which allows us to better describe the mechanisms at work and derive precise policy implications. Third, we build our own panel data set and presentdescriptive statisticson recently arrived refugees and their dynamic integration outcomes. Between 2014 and 2017, Germany became one of the largest refugee-receiving countries in the developed world. We thus study a relevant case of refugee integration. We look at labour market outcomes, which are important both in their own right, and indirectly through their effects on political outcomes (Dustmann, Fasani, Frattini, Minale, Schoenberg, 2016,Edo, Giesing, Öztunc, Poutvaara, 2019).",Michele,Yvonne,Nadzeya
"1. Introduction“Remarkably little is known about [... ] whether the chosen policy, in fact, has the desired outcomes in terms of the size and composition of the immigrant flow.”George J. Borjas, 2014,Immigration Economics, p. 215.Migrant-receiving countries are typically concerned with how well migrants perform in the local labor market and the extent to which their outcomes mirror those of similar natives. Policy makers and scholars usually rely on migrants’ earnings at the destination as a synthetic measure of their quality.1Evidence from a number ofOECDcountries that recent migrants’ initial earnings have been declining over time (see, for instance,Borjas and Friedberg, 2009andAydemir and Skuterud, 2005for the United States and Canada) has prompted debates in some of these countries around the need of reforming immigration policies with the goal of improving migrants’ quality. In particular, there has been an increasing interest in instituting points-based systems that rely on a few socioeconomic characteristics, such as education, age and language proficiency, to select higher quality migrants. For instance,Borjas (1999)argued that “the United States could probably increase theskill levelof its immigrant population by adopting a point system that relies on few socioeconomic characteristics–such as education, age and a measure of English proficiency.” (p. 193). A number of countries, most prominently Canada and New Zealand, currently admit most migrants via points-based systems, however there has so far been little analysis examining whether these systems are capable of achieving their stated objectives, as the initial quote fromBorjas (2014)suggests.2It isprima facieintuitive that immigration policies that select individuals based on their observable characteristics, and most notably education, should be able to improve migrants’ quality.3However, the dispersion in wages across individuals also depend on a number of characteristics, such as innate ability, talent and attitude towards risk, that are not easily observable,4and do not correlate perfectly with education (see, for instance,Heckman and Kautz, 2012). This is particularly true given that both across and within most developing countries there is substantial heterogeneity in the quality of the “same” amount of education.Borjas (1999)himself observes that differences in observable characteristics, such as age, education and occupation, explain only one third of the variation in earnings across workers on the US labor market, and this entails that a point-system “misses those intangibles that are the main determinants of what makes some workers successful and others unsuccessful.” (p. 193).The (strong) dependence of migrants’ quality on characteristics that remainunobserved for migration officers does not just dilute the effectiveness of selective immigration policies in improving migrants’ quality, but it could also produce perverse effects, as shown theoretically byBertoli et al. (2016), who build on the seminal contribution byBorjas (1987). More specifically, when migrants are positively selected on unobservables, an increase in the selectivity of immigration policies that leaves the aggregate scale of migration unchanged leads to a reduction in the average quality of the high-educated immigrants, and to an increase in the average quality of low-educated immigrants, with a possible decline in migrants’ quality. To put it differently, a greater emphasis on a narrow set of observable characteristics could end up discouraging talented and entrepreneurial-minded foreign-born workers without the required education credentials. The wages of these discouraged low-educated migrants can exceed those of the high-educated migrants that are induced to move by the scale-preserving increase in selectivity, thus reducing migrants’ average wages at destination.5Furthermore, as points-based systems generally treat educational qualifications identically regardless to the country in which they were earned, applicants from countries where theeducation systemsare of poor quality could potentially crowd out applicants from countries with better human capital (Mattoo et al., 2008).6We draw on data from the 2001–2017 rounds of the AmericanCommunitySurvey to analyze the origin-specific relationship between the wage distributions for low-educated (at most high-school dropouts) and high-educated (at least four years of college) immigrants in the US labor market. Our analysis consists of two complementary parts. First, we examine the difference in mean wages and the overlap in the wage distributions of these two groups of recent migrants with non-contiguous levels of education from 114 countries of origin after controlling for other observable characteristics through the estimation of a Mincer equation. As shown inBertoli et al. (2016), the greater the overlap of the two distributions, the less likely that a point-system will markedly improve immigrants’ quality. As noted above, this overlap can be caused by two factors: (i) a greater intensity of selection on unobservables for low-educated versus high-educated migrants,7or (ii) because education is a poor measure of quality for certain migrants because of low quality education systems in their origin countries. In order to distinguish between these factors, our second analysis decomposes the variance of wages among recent migrants with the same level of education into within versus between country components. The larger the within country component, the more relevant that differential selection on unobservables is for explaining the overlap in the wage distribution between low- and high-educated workers.We find that the difference in residual wages between the two groups is significantly positive for 95 out of 114 origin countries. However, when we randomly select one low-educated recent male migrant (at most a high school dropout), in 24.7% of the draws he has a wage that exceeds that for a randomly selected high-educated recent male migrant (with at least four years of college) from the same country of origin.8This is mid-way between a situation in which education fully separates high-wage from low-wage individuals and a situation where education is uncorrelated with wages in the labor market at destination. There are notable differences across the 114 countries included in our analysis, but for 98 of them, this synthetic measure of the overlap in the two distributions stands above the corresponding figure for US natives, which is equal to 13.8%. Interestingly, the percentage overlap for natives is less than what we would predict based of the difference in mean wages between the high- and low-educated natives using the relationship between the two observed for immigrants. This indicates that the wage distributions for immigrants, given the difference in means, have more overlap than that for natives.We also find that most of the variance (at least 82%) in wages for migrants with a given number of years of schooling is due to differences in unobservables within rather than between countries. While education quality obviously varies across origin countries in our sample, a possible reason why low- and high-educated workers from the same country have similar wages is because the high-educated workers are less positively selected on unobservables, which might also reflect within-country heterogeneity in education quality, than the low-educated workers.These results are consistent with bothde factoselectivity being stronger for low-educated migrants to the US and there being a large overlap in the wage distributions of low- and high-educated potential immigrants. Returning to the theoretical model inBertoli et al. (2016), our findings suggest that a points-based system (or, more generally, a further increase in the selectivity on education) is unlikely to improve substantially the quality of migrants coming to the US.9Our empirical analysis is clearly contingent on how the destination labor market functions and on the pool of origins from which a country draws most of its immigrants. The residual wages that we obtain after estimating a Mincer equation reflect both individual unobserved characteristics and the returns to these characteristics at the destination. If high-educated foreign-born workers face more discrimination in the labor market against or have more difficulty accessing licensed occupations (Tani, 2018), this will also increase the extent to which the wage distributions for high- and low-educated immigrants overlap.10However, it will also be true in this case that more intense selection on education would fail to improve immigrants’ quality.Our paper makes a unique contribution to the literature by focusing on a simple measure of whether education can serve as a good proxy for migrant quality and by distinguishing the extent to which this is related to differential selection on unobservables versus differing quality of education systems across origin countries. Related papers have examined either the overall link between education and migrant outcomes (Aydemir, 2011) or the differences in returns to education across migrant origin countries (Mattoo et al., 2008), but not both in the same framework. Our analysis reveals that differences inunobservables between low- and high-educated migrants are strong enough such that residual wages for a substantial share of high-educated immigrants arelowerthan those for low-educated migrants even though the difference in means for the two groups is large and significant. Thus, we go beyond previous papers that show low or non-significant return to foreign education.The rest of the paper is structured as follows: inSection 2, we introduce the data used in our analysis and discuss some key definitions. InSection 3, we present our empirical approach and main findings.Section 4explores the heterogeneity in the results obtained from the empirical analysis, and discusses some relevant robustness checks.

"1. IntroductionOver the past decades, the United States has experienced a large inflow of highly skilled STEM workers. Between 2000 and 2015, the foreign-born share of STEM workers increased from approximately 16% to 24% (Fig. 1). In the face of this trend, there are new interests in examining the extent to which labor market outcomes of natives – and immigrants alike – are affected by this supply inflow. Despite a large number of studies on the effect of overall immigration (e.g.,Borjas, 2003,Card, 1990,Ottaviano, Peri, 2012), very little is understood about how high-skilled STEM immigration affects the U.S. labor market. In this paper, I attempt to present new insights to several key issues regarding high-skilled STEM immigration in the United States.Download :Download high-res image (524KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. STEM sector characteristics over time.Recently, there is an intense debate in the U.S. on whether foreign STEM workers displace or complement U.S.-born STEM workers. This issue was raised by the emergence of cases claiming that U.S. firms were abusing high-skilled H-1B visas to bring foreign STEM workers to do the work of native STEM workers for less money.1Although it might be hard to ascertain the intention of firms when they hire foreign-born STEM workers, it is possible to shed light on this issue by examining the degree of substitutability between similarly skilled U.S.- and foreign-born STEM workers. If these workers are imperfect substitutes, then the influx of foreign STEM workers would result in a higher competition among immigrants themselves, mitigating its adverse impact on the wage and employment outcomes of U.S.-born STEM workers. I begin my analysis by outlining the theoretical framework to examine this issue. Using the framework, I found that similarly skilled U.S.- and foreign-born STEM workers are imperfect substitutes with anelasticity of substitutionof approximately 18. This finding suggests that although displacement may occur, it is relatively hard for U.S. firms to fully replace its native STEM workers with their foreign-born counterparts.I continue the analysis by examining how much the returns to skills within the STEM fields are affected by STEM immigration. When foreign-born STEM workers enter the U.S. labor market, they are heterogeneous in terms of their age/experience and educational attainment. Many studies (e.g.,Kerr, Lincoln, 2010,Peri, Shih, Sparber, 2015), however, have overlooked this heterogeneity in their analysis. To see why this is important, one can see that the changes of foreign STEM workers across skill groups between 2000 and 2015 had disproportionately increased the supply of relatively older STEM workers with bachelor and post-graduate degrees (Table 1).2The differences in the magnitude of the supply shift across skill groups within STEM fields implies that if the preexisting workforce in 2000 experiences immigrants’ supply shock that is as large as the changes observed from 2000 to 2015, the wage of older STEM workers with higher educational attainment would be more adversely affected relative to the wage of younger STEM workers with lower educational achievement. The results of the analysis suggest that although 2000–2015 foreign STEM labor supply shock increased the wage of preexisting U.S.-born STEM workers by 4.67%, native STEM workers with higher educational attainment experiencedlower wagegains. I do not find that the wage of older U.S.-born STEM workers to be much more adversely affected compared to younger native STEM workers. This is because the degree of substitution between young and older workers in the STEM sector is relatively high.Table 1.

The table shows the percentage changes in supply across skill groups within STEM fields caused by changes in the number of foreign STEM workers from 2000 to 2015 in each skill groups. The analysis used both men and women of age 28 to 62. STEM occupations are defined using Census 2010 STEM classification.Using the resulting wage effect estimates, it is possible to quantify the economic benefit of 2000–2015 foreign STEM labor supply shock that accrues to U.S.-born workers. A simple back of the envelope cost-benefit calculation suggests that the economic benefit for native workers is approximately 103 billion USD or 1.03% of U.S. GDP in 1999. It is worth noting that almost all of the benefit can be attributed to productivityspilloversgenerated by the influx of highly skilled STEM workers. In the absence of this productivity spillovers, the economic benefit accrues for native workers is approximately only 1.64 billion USD or 0.02% of U.S. GDP in 1999. These results imply that the main benefit of STEM immigration comes largely from the generation of ideas associated with high-skilled STEM immigration which promotes the development of new technologies that increase the productivity and wages of U.S.-born workers. In the absence of these productivity spillovers, the economic impact of STEM immigration on the U.S. economy would likely be relatively small.This paper contributes to the emerging literature that tries to examine the impact of high-skilled immigration on U.S. workers. Traditionally, the economics literature has focused on immigration in the lower-skilled groups (e.g.,Borjas, 2017,Card, 1990,Peri, Yasenov, 2018). However, an increasingly larger share of foreign-born in the total STEM workers pool spurs interests in examining the economic impact of high-skilled immigration. Recent research on the topic has focused on finding evidence of positive spillover effects of high-skilled immigration (Borjas, Doran, 2012,Hunt, Gauthier-Loiselle, 2010,Moser, Voena, Waldinger, 2014), while only a few studies tried to examine how the wages of U.S.-born STEM workers are affected by STEM immigration (Kerr, Lincoln, 2010,Peri, Shih, Sparber, 2015).3A closely related study is the work byTurner (2017)who found that the wages of STEM workers fell by approximately 4 to 12% relative to non-STEM because of immigration from 1990 to 2010. The work byTurner (2017), however, did not allow for the imperfect substitutability between similarly skilled U.S.- and foreign-born STEM workers. Furthermore,Turner (2017)did not take into account that the inflow of immigrant STEM workers has positive productivity effects. This paper complements the findings byTurner (2017)and other related studies in two important ways. First, this paper analyzes the degree of substitutability between similarly skilled U.S.- and foreign-born STEM workers, which have not been examined previously in the literature to my knowledge. The finding of imperfect substitutability between these two types of workers is important because it implies that the adverse effect of STEM immigration would be largely felt among immigrant STEM workers themselves. Additionally, it also implies that the finding inKerr and Lincoln (2010)andPeri et al. (2015), who found that the wages and employment of U.S.-born workers are not adversely affected by the inflow of H-1B STEM workers, can be partly explained by the imperfect substitutability between U.S.- and foreign-born STEM workers. Another important contribution of this paper is that it examines how much the relative wages within STEM are affected by STEM immigration. As noted byKerr and Turner (2015), there is a need to understanding how much the wages within the STEM sector are affected by STEM immigration, especially since the flow of immigrant STEM workers are not uniform across skill groups.The rest of the paper is constructed as follows.Section 2describes the theoretical framework.Section 3describes the data used in the analysis.Sections 4and5present the estimation of the parameters used to simulate the wage effect of STEM immigration.

"1. IntroductionThe effect of migration on natives’ labor market outcomes crucially depends on whether migrants’ skills are complements or substitutes to natives’ skills. High substitutability of skills is associated with significantly negative wage effects of migration for low skilled natives (Borjas, 2017). Low substitutability between skills of low educated natives and migrants, on the other hand, implies that labor market competition between the two groups is limited (Altonji and Card, 1991). Finally, complementarities between high skilled natives and low skilled migrants could explain findings of positive wage effects of migration for high skilled natives (Dustmann et al., 2013). In the end, whether migrants are equipped with skills which are complements or substitutes to natives’ skills is an outcome of individuals’ location decisions. However, little is known about if and how migrants take into account the relationship between their skills and those of natives when deciding where to migrate. The current paper focuses on English language skills and tests empirically if migrants who are proficient in English choose destination countries where many or few individuals speak English.Without any additional assumptions, theoretically it is unclear whether individuals would prefer to migrate to countries where their skills are scarce or abundant. Migrating to countries where one’s skills are scarce could imply greater returns if these skills are in high demand. Migrants might also suffer less discrimination if they compete with natives to a lesser degree. However, the scarcity of skills could also indicate a lack of demand. In this case, abundance of skills would signal higher returns and migrants would be better off choosing countries where natives share the same skill set. Being more similar to natives, they might also suffer less discrimination. In the current paper we focus on English language skills which are highly comparable across countries. Migrants who are proficient in English could prefer to move to countries where English is widely spoken, given that positive returns to a host country’s language proficiency (Bleakley and Chin, 2004) and easiersocial integration(Bleakley and Chin, 2010) might extent to other widely spoken languages. On the other hand, a study byGinsburgh and Prieto-Rodriguez (2011)shows that returns to English proficiency are higher in countries where fewer individuals speak English.Testing empirically how immigrants take into account the relationship between their skills and natives’ skills when deciding where to migrate is challenging due to reverse causality and unobserved factors. In particular, migrants could decide to acquire skills according to the skill composition of their preferred destination country. Furthermore, unobserved factors could be correlated with both migrants’ skills and their choice of destination country. For instance, individuals with parents from different countries are likely to be proficient in both of their parents’ languages, and they are also likely to migrate to the home country of one of their parents. To address these endogeneity issues, we use the introduction of English classes into compulsory school curricula as an exogenous determinant for English proficiency of migrants of different ages. We show that such education reforms are related to improved English proficiency of affected cohorts. By changing compulsory education curricula, governments can determine their citizens’ English proficiency which is likely to influence their migration decisions. Our analysis hence also allows us to study the implications ofeducation policiesfor migration. Crucial for the validity of our results, we provide evidence on the exogeneity of education reforms with respect to past migration.Our findings show that individuals who learned English during compulsory education migrate to countries where fewer people speak English, and where hence their language skills might be more valuable. In particular, those who learned English during compulsory education are 1.3% less likely to migrate to a country where 10 percentage point more individuals speak English. We also show that similar results hold for general skills. As mentioned before, the validity of our results relies on the exogeneity of education reforms with respect to migration. To address this issue, we followLandes and Solmon (1972)andLleras-Muney (2002), and we perform two empirical tests indicating that the introduction of English into compulsory school curricula is not predetermined by past migration rates nor systematically linked to any other socioeconomic factors that could affect migration.For our analysis we use cohort level data on migration from Eurostat, self-collected data on English classes in compulsory school curricula for each cohort, and Eurobarometer data on the proportion of English speakers in each country. We exclude migration from and to the UK and Ireland where English is an official language because: (i) Different from other destination countries, migration to the UK and Ireland might be driven by individuals’ desire to improve their English proficiency, and (ii) different from individuals in other countries of origin, English is not an acquired skill for individuals from the UK and Ireland. We limit our analysis to migration among European countries because outside of Europe, countries differ significantly in migration restrictions and their enforcement, which are both important factors in determining migrants’ choice of destination country. Basically unlimitedlabor mobilityin Europe on the other hand, allows us to isolate the role of migrants’ and natives’ English skills from migration restrictions.1Our empirical strategy exploits variation across countries of origin, countries of destination, age groups, and years. In particular, we test how the interaction between a cohort’s exposure to English classes during compulsory education and the share of individuals who speak English in potential destination countries affects the number of migrants from this cohort to a particular destination country. Our estimation strategy controls not only for individuals’ countries of origin and their chosen destination country, but also for individuals’ age and the year of migration and all interactions between these fixed effects. In addition, we are also able to control for: (i) destination-age-year fixed effects like age-specificlabor demandsin destination countries during specific years, (ii) destination-origin-year interactions which capture aspects such as the establishment of specific agreements across pairs of countries, and (iii) origin-age-year fixed effects which account for factors like the state of the labor market in the origin country for different cohorts. In addition, we also control for cohort-specific differences in unemployment rates. Hence, our findings result from refined comparisons of cohorts which enables us to isolate the effect of the relationship between migrants’ and natives’ English skills on individuals’ choice of destination country.The current paper relates to the extensive literature on the effect of host country language proficiency on migrants’ outcomes, as well as to two smaller strands of literature on migrants’ returns to other languages such as English and to the literature on the impact of language skills on migration. Regarding the first literature, findings by among othersBleakley and Chin (2004),Gonzalez-Luna and Libertad (2005),Chiswick and Miller (2010), andDustmann and Fabbri (2003)show that immigrants’ accomplishments in a host country’s labor market depend positively and to a great extent on their host country’s language skills. Regarding migrants’ returns to English proficiency in countries where English is not the official language,Stöhr (2015)estimates higher returns to English skills for migrants compared to natives in Germany. Looking at natives and Russian immigrants in Israel,Lang and Siniver (2009)on the other hand find no differential returns between high-skilled immigrants and natives, but higher returns to English language skills for low-skilled natives compared to migrants. For Estonia and Latvia,Toomet (2011)finds that native Russians obtain higher returns to English skills than to knowing the localBaltic languages. While the current paper does not estimate migrants’ returns to English proficiency directly, our results are in line with the before-mentioned paper byGinsburgh and Prieto-Rodriguez (2011)who find that returns to English proficiency are higher in European countries where fewer individuals speak English.We are only aware of two papers that specifically address how language proficiency affects individuals’ decisions to migrate.Adserá and Pytliková (2015)introduce proximity between languages of origin and destination countries and a dummy for widely spoken languages into a model that explainsinternational migrationflows. The authors find that migration rates increase with linguistic proximity and with English spoken in the country of destination. However, regarding the second result and different from the current paper, the authors do not study how choice of destination country might differ by migrants’ English skills. InAparicio-Fenoll et al. (2016), we analyze the effect that studying a foreign language during compulsory education has on the number of individuals that move to countries where this language is official, and we find a positive effect. Different from our previous work, the current paper focuses on acquired skills of migrants and natives, and how the interaction between both affects migration choices. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:Section 2presents our estimation strategy, andSection 3describes the data. InSection 4we present and discuss our results as well as robustness and exogeneity checks.Section 5concludes.",Ainoa,Zoë,None
"1. IntroductionChildren raised in materialpovertyare undisputedly at a much higher risk of cognitive and socioemotional developmental delays, poorer educational and health outcomes, lifelong under- or unemployment, welfare dependence, and involvement in crime (e.g.,Duncan et al., 2017,Katsnelson, 2015,Duncan et al., 2012,Duncan et al., 2010,Bird, 2013,Wiborg and Hansen, 2009,Barajas et al., 2007,Bradley and Corwyn, 2002,Duncan et al., 1998). The resulting economic cost of growing up poor is sizable. Estimates of such costs to society range between 1% of GDP in the UK (Blanden et al., 2010) and between 1 and –4% in the United States (Holzer et al., 2007).Awealthof literature has examined the impact of childhood poverty, defining “poverty” as either a lack of access to financial or educational resources (seeDuncan et al., 2017for a comprehensive review). Official child poverty statistics are exclusively based on predefined income or consumption thresholds (Adamson, 2012;UNICEF, 2012;Barajas et al., 2007;Whiteford and Adema, 2007;Roosa et al., 2005).1Yet, psychologists are increasingly turning their attention to tangible explanations for the harmful impact that poverty can have on children's development. One explanation centers on the family-stress hypothesis (seeDuncan et al., 2017): economically disadvantaged children are confronted with more environmentalinequalitiesduring their childhood, including separation from their families, instability, violence, or generally chaotic households (Evans and English, 2002,Evans, 2004,Evans and Kim, 2010). Research points to them experiencing harsher, more punitive, and less attentive parenting (e.g.,Gershoff et al., 2007,Magnusson and Duncan, 2002,Hart and Risley, 1995,Conger and Elder, 1994,McLoyd, 1998).2Inequalities in parenting behaviors have been shown to partially explain the link between material poverty and child behavioral problems (Kaiser et al., 2017) or school achievement (Kiernan and Mensah, 2011).Evans (2004)suggests that “cumulative rather than singular exposure to a confluence of psychosocial and physical environmental risk factors is a potentially critical aspect of the environment of childhood poverty” (p. 77).This paper will focus on the longer-term economic impacts of cumulative psychosocial risks, referred to in the medical literature asadverse childhood experiences(ACEs) (Felitti et al., 1998). ACEs are defined as childhood exposure to parental “abuse” and “neglect” and “household dysfunction” (e.g.,Felitti et al., 1998;Dube et al., 2003;Dong et al., 2004;Anda et al., 2006). Household dysfunction can comprise many things, but most research in this area defines it as exposure to parental alcohol or drug abuse, parental mental health issues, and parental absences due to death, divorce, or incarceration (e.g.,Danese et al. (2009);Kelly-Irving et al., 2013a,Kelly-Irving et al., 2013b;Solis et al., 2015). We assess the lifetime economic handicaps of ACEs in terms of income potential and poverty experiences, and the channels through which such relationships may emerge. Although a vast literature – which we will review inSection 2– has emerged that links ACEs with medical outcomes in adulthood, to date there is little empirical evidence on the lifetime economic opportunities of ACEs.To explore the link between ACEs and lifetime economic opportunities, we use high-quality cohort data from the National Child Development Study (NCDS) (Power and Elliott, 2006). The NCDS followed a birth cohort of children born within one week of each other in the United Kingdom from birth in 1958 up until age 55. The study is rich in detailed information about parents and their children – at birth, age 7, age 11, and age 16. Such a wealth of data allows us to construct a standard composite measure of ACE that has been widely used in the literature (e.g.,Danese et al. (2009),Kelly-Irving et al., 2013a,Kelly-Irving et al., 2013b;Solis et al. 2015). This measure has the advantage of being an objective measure of childhood adversity. It sums individual negative family-related life-events (neglect, time in foster care, parental absence,alcohol abuse, mental health problems, incarceration) that were recorded between the age of 7 and 16 in the NCDS. Thus, we neither rely on self-reports of trauma nor on retrospective information. However, its disadvantage is that it does not allow for different weights of individual components entering the index. We address this problem by providing robustness checks in which we assess the contribution of each individual component to the measure and by constructing an index through factor analysis, which allows heterogeneous weighing of different components by summarizing the covariability among observed components using low-dimensional latent variables (Gorsuch, 1983,Gorsuch, 2003,Thompson, 2004).Because follow-up data were collected on the children in young adulthood up until currently (age 55), we can link earlier-life ACEs with lifetime economic outcomes – as measured by foregone earnings, welfare dependence, and subjective poverty – and identify the channels through which this connection may emerge. To quantify the importance of each underlying mechanism, we use a variance-decomposition approach that was developed inHeckman and Pinto (2015)and was applied inHeckman et al. (2013). We calculate the contribution of differences in observable characteristics, measured at a time when cohort members enter adulthood, to the observed differences in earnings, welfare dependence, and subjective poverty between cohort members with high doses of ACEs (or other components of the ACE index) and cohort members without.The contribution of our study to the literature is to explore ACEs as an important characteristic of childhood poverty. We therefore contribute to a discussion on the multidimensionality of childhood poverty. This idea is different from understanding ACEs as the key channel through which material poverty impacts upon children's development, a hypothesis that has been widely discussed in the literature (seeDuncan et al., 2017). We hypothesize that ACEs capture the key risk factors that interfere with a child's lifetime economic potential,independentof a child's access to material or educational resources. This argument does not preclude the possibility that ACEs are more common in poorer households. Our argument implies that children in better income-resourced households could still be considered poor if they are exposed to ACEs, even though income-based thresholds would not identify them as in need. Thus, they should still be entitled to support from appropriatewelfare programs. Conversely, it also implies that children raised in economically poor families may not need to be flagged as disadvantaged because their parents provide an excellent, low-risk home environment that requires littleinterferencefrom the policy maker.Empirically, we are able to demonstrate evidence in favor of our hypothesis. Although ACEs are disproportionately more common in economically disadvantaged families – children in such families are two to three times as likely to experience at least one adverse event – ACEs also occur in more privileged families. Furthermore, we find that ACEs are strong predictors of economic outcomes at age 55, over and above the influence of standard early-life predictors including health at birth, parental education, occupation, income, and householdovercrowding. Experiencing one additional ACE – on a scale that is bound between 0 and 6 – is associated with an earnings penalty of 9%, and a significant increase in the probability of welfare dependence and subjective poverty by 25% and 27%, respectively. These findings are robust to alternative parameterizations of the ACE index, and allowing for nonlinearities in the relationship between ACEs and economic outcomes. The experience of neglect, an assessment made by the cohort member's teacher between the age of 7 and 11, is the driving mechanism in the association between ACEs and economic outcomes: a child assessed as neglected by their teacher has an earnings penalty of 22%, is 80% more likely to be welfare dependent, and 43% more likely to live in (subjective) poverty. Digging deeper, the observed differences in net earnings by age 55 between those who experienced neglect and those who did not are almost entirely explained by differences in human capital – educational achievements and cognitive and noncognitive skills – accumulated by the beginning of mid-age.Our findings lend support to suggestions made elsewhere that “the true measure of child poverty is parenting” (Heckman, 2011, p. 4). Good parenting will set the foundation for the creation of personal, social, and – as we show – economicwellbeing(seeHeckman and Mosso, 2014for a discussion). The previous literature focuses predominantly on positive parenting behaviors as investment in child development. Our study suggests that negative parenting behaviors, such as child neglect, is clearly adivestment, independent of whether neglect occurs in richer or poorer families.Traditional public policy responses to alleviate child poverty have come in the form of conditional or unconditional cash transfers. Although much has been written on the link between household income and children's outcomes and parenting behavior, causal evidence base on the effectiveness of cash transfers on children's outcomes and parenting behaviors is relatively limited. The few studies that exist using experimental evaluation methods demonstrate that cash transfers may be successful in boosting children's human capital (Gaitz and Schurer, 2017;Dahl and Lochner, 2012). The evidence base on their effectiveness in improving parenting behaviors is more mixed. Some find that cash transfers are effective (Akee et al., 2010;Hamad and Rehkopf, 2016), while others find they are not (Gaitz and Schurer, 2017;Gennetian and Miller, 2002). As of today, we do not know whether providing more money to households automatically takes away the stressors from parents (seeDuncan et al., 2017for a discussion). If the objective of the policymaker is to reduce children's exposure to poor parenting behaviors as an investment into their human capital, it may be more effective to direct resources to parenting interventions in primary care (seeBrockmeyer et al., 2016and references therein) or family-home visiting programs (seeHuston, 2011and references therein). Public policy that directly addresses poor parenting may produce large economic productivity gains.This paper will proceed as follows. InSection 2, we review the existing literature on the association between ACEs and lifetime outcomes and their measurement problems. InSection 3, we explain the data used for the empirical analysis.Section 4outlines our empirical modeling strategy. InSection 5, we present the estimation results.Section 6discusses the limitations of ourstudy designand the policy implications of our findings.

"1. IntroductionGender unemployment gaps have almost disappeared in the US and much of Western Europe, yet there are still many EU countries where the unemployment rate of women vastly exceeds that of men (Albanesi and Sahin, 2018). Gender unemployment gaps are substantially higher among individuals with children younger than 15, especially in countries that offer very long paid family leave (Bičáková, 2016). There are several reasons longer family leave may be associated with higher female unemployment: It can be detrimental to the mother’s productivity and may result in a job loss, especially in countries with no or ineffective job protection. Anticipation of long family-related career breaks may lead to statistical discrimination against prospective mothers in the labor market and can also reduce the incentives of young women to invest in their human capital (Das and Polachek, 2015). Family leave policies may also affect men and influence the size of gender unemployment gaps through their impact on the male unemployment rate (Han et al., 2009)In this paper, we zoom in on one particular link between family leave policies and gender unemployment gaps. We focus on the impact of paid family leave on post-birth labor market inactivity and unemployment of mothers (the subpopulation typically targeted and most directly affected by family leave policies).1Specifically, we evaluate the impact of two parental leave reforms in the Czech Republic in 1995 and 2008, which altered the duration of paid family leave.2The first reform prolonged paid family leave from 3 to 4 years, but maintained job protections for mothers on leave only up to 3 years. Mothers who used 4 years of paid leave, therefore, gave up their right to return to their pre-birth jobs, as their job protection expired 1 year before the end of the benefit receipt period. The second reform allowed some women to shorten paid leave from 4 to 3 or 2 years keeping the overall amount of the financial benefits received virtually unchanged. The job protection remained at 3 years. This paper asks to what extent the changes in the duration of parental leave affected mothers’labor force participationdue to their take-up of the new statutory leave and to what extent the new conditions also induced changes in mothers’ post-leave unemployment and inactivity.While the impact of family leave policies on mothers’ post-birth employment has been widely studied (seeOlivetti and Petrongolo, 2017andRossin-Slater, 2018for an overview), their impact on mothers’ unemployment has so far only been considered byLalive et al. (2014), who find that mothers facing longer family leave accumulate fewer months of unemployment in the first three years after childbirth.Das and Polachek (2015)also explore the impact of family leave regulations on unemployment, but they study the impact on unemployment of all young women, not specifically that of mothers after childbirth. They conclude that paid family leave increases the unemployment rate and unemployment duration of young women. This paper contributes to this scarce literature by evaluating the effect of family leave policies on post-leave unemployment of mothers.We also provide additional evidence about the impact of reforms that prolong the duration of the receipt of financial benefits beyond the job protection period. Although such reforms are quite uncommon and also rarely studied, they can provide crucial evidence about the relative importance of the two key aspects of the family policies; the financial support and the right to return to the pre-birth job. There are only two studies that consider a similar type of reform, and their findings diverge.Schönberg and Ludsteck (2014)evaluated the 1986 reform in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, which prolonged receipt of financial benefits by 1 year beyond job protection, and found long-lasting negative effects on mothers’ labor market outcomes. In particular, the reform discouraged up to 4% of mothers from returning to work and lowered their labor market income by roughly 8% in the 6 years after childbirth.Lalive et al. (2014), on the other hand, studied a similar reform in Austria in 2000, which prolonged receipt of financial benefits by 6 months beyond job protection, and did not find any effect on the mothers’ labor market outcomes 5 years after childbirth.Finally, we extend the existing literature with estimates of the unintended effects of very long paid family leave. Paid leave longer than 2 years is common in Central and Eastern Europe, but is rarely evaluated in the literature. The two Czech reforms have also been studied byMullerova (2017), who estimates the impact of the 1995 reform on employment of mothers with young children, andMullerova (2016), which evaluates the impact of the 2008 reform.3We complement these two studies by providing separate evidence on the intended and unintended effects of the two reforms. While both Mullerova’s papers focus only on the impact on mothers’ employment, we estimate the impact on mothers’ inactivity and unemployment as two separate outcomes up to 6 years from childbirth. We formulate a theoretical framework based on which we predict the expected impact of the two reforms on a woman’s decision to remain inactive, as well as her probability of being unemployed both before and after the end of a statutory leave. We show that considering only the effect on employment disguises the true behavioral impact of the reforms, as the effects on unemployment and inactivity often go in opposite directions. We point out that a zero employment effect is sometimes an outcome of two simultaneous effects on inactivity and unemployment of similar magnitude but opposite signs. As the 2008 reform was partly a reversal of the 1995 reform, we estimate and compare their impact in a single study.There are several reasons why the Czech Republic and the two parental leave reforms constitute a unique setting for the estimation of the impact of family leave on intended and unintended labor market outcomes of mothers with young children. The strong overall attachment of Czech women to the labor force (a legacy of the Communist regime; see, e.g.,Fodor, 2005) contrasts sharply with the absence of mothers of children younger than 3 from the labor market.4The combination of one of the longest paid family leave allowances with among the highest take-up rates in the EU (OECD, 2010) and very limited early childcare facilities, places the Czech Republic (together with Slovakia and Hungary) among the three EU countries with the most sizable employment impact of motherhood (Eurostat).Our data reveal that paid family leave in the Czech Republic is often followed by a spell of unemployment. More than 50% of women who terminate their family leave when their children are aged 2–5 return to the labor force as unemployed and more than 80% of those unemployed with children under 5 enter unemployment immediately after the end of their family leave (CzechLFSdata, 2011–2014). In contrast with EU countries with traditionally low female labor force participation, very few Czech women withdraw from the labor force in the long run (Bičáková, 2016).Following the existing research, we first estimate the impact of the two reforms of paid family leave in the Czech Republic on mothers’ non-employment. Next, we distinguish between mothers’ unemployment and inactivity as two different labor market outcomes. This allows us to separate the impact of the reforms on initial paid family leave (the intended effects on mothers’ inactivity under family leave provisions) from the impact on post-leave unemployment and labor force withdrawal (effects unintended by the reforms). Our empirical strategy compares mothers of the last unaffected and the first affected cohorts of children, controlling for currenteconomic conditions, using mothers of two subsequent cohorts of older children in a difference-in-differences framework.Our results show that 38% of women prolonged their leave beyond the 3-year job protection period in response to the 1995 reform. Apart from these large effects on leave take-up, we also find substantial unintended effects: Some women prolonged their leave beyond the statutory leave duration, and the likelihood of post-leave unemployment increased among women with 4 and 5-year-old children by 6 and 4 p.p., respectively. The 2008 reform partially reversed the impact of the 1995 reform. Almost one-fourth of women shortened their leave from 4 to 3 years. The 2008 reform caused the opposite, but much smaller, impact on post-leave unemployment. The results vary by women’s education but the documented heterogeneity in the behavioral response, in particular to the 1995 reform, of low-educated and high-educated women is surprisingly small.The estimated share of mothers who prolonged their leave beyond the job protection period after the 1995 reform is much larger than has been identified in previous literature. Studying similar reforms, which also prolonged benefit receipt beyond job protection,Lalive et al. (2014)andSchönberg and Ludsteck (2014)estimate a much smaller impact on mothers’ return to work behavior.5Why are the effects of the Czech reform greater than those inLalive et al. (2014)andSchönberg and Ludsteck (2014)? Insufficient institutional childcare or a shortage of flexible forms of work are plausible factors, whose relative importance could be addressed by future research. The enormous take-up rate of the 4 year paid leave also reveals the high compliance of Czech women with the family leave policies. Interestingly, the traditionally high participation rate of women in a post-Communist labor market eventually brings the women back into the labor market, even after long leaves.6Our findings on the unintended effects of the two reforms on mothers’ post-leave unemployment and inactivity are also in contrast to the findings ofLalive et al. (2014), who report no medium run effects on mothers. However, our results are consistent with the conclusions ofSchönberg and Ludsteck (2014), who stress the importance of job protection in avoiding long-lasting negative effects of family leave expansions on mothers’ positions in the labor market.The paper is organized as follows: The next section is devoted to the institutional and theoretical background of the two reforms. We then describe the data we use and present our empirical strategy. The results section is followed by the conclusions.",Alena,Klára,None
"1. IntroductionFor quite some time, the link between STEM majors and innovation, as well as the growing need for STEM graduates in the U.S. economy, have been repeatedly underscored inacademiaand the public media. Given the proclivity of international students, relative to native ones, to major in a STEM field (NSF Science and Engineering Indicators, 2012), immigration policy might be used as a tool to retain high-skilled immigrants educated and trained in the United States in these fields. One such policy is the extension of the Optional Practical Training (OPT) period for foreign-born STEM graduates who receive their degree from a U.S. university. This paper first explores the impact of this policy change on the likelihood that foreign-born college graduates living in the U.S. have a STEM degree. Subsequently, we examine whether any observed changes were partly driven by international students’ increased tendencies to choose a STEM major.OPT is a period during which international students in the United States are allowed to temporarily work on their student visas with theintentof gaining practical training to complement their education. While, in general, OPT lasts for one year, undergraduate and graduate students with STEM degrees became eligible for a 17-month extension starting in 2008, thus allowing them to work in the United States for a total of 29 months on their student visas.1Once the OPT period is exhausted, international students must transfer to another visa in order to remain in the United States. In many instances, they transfer to an H-1B visa -a non-immigrant visa for high-skilled workers.2There are many benefits to both international students and their employers of having an additional 17 months of OPT before needing to transfer to a different visa. Students might benefit from an extended training period during which they can develop professional contacts, find a good job match and plan their next career move. In addition, U.S. employers benefit from having more time to evaluate the prospective employee's performance before sponsoring an H-1B visa. While both of these are important, the likely main benefit to both workers and employers of the extended OPT period, given the limited number of available H-1B visas in recent years, is that it allows employers to apply for an H-1B for a given worker in multiple years, before the worker must leave the country.3There are several mechanisms through which the OPT extension may have increased the number of foreign-born U.S. STEM degree holders living in the United States aftergraduation. First, STEM students using the OPT extension were able to remain in the United States after graduation for a longer period while on OPT. This additional time would have made it easier to win the H-1B lottery or to transfer to another visa, such as a fiancé visa for those marrying a U.S. citizen. The decrease in return migration rates of STEM degree holders could have mechanically increased the number of STEM degree holders living in the United States after graduation.A more interesting possibility is if the OPT extension changed students’ decisions about pursuing a STEM degree in the United States. Another possibility for the international students determined to study in the United States is that the policy increased the likelihood of choosing a STEM major. While we are not able to perfectly distinguish between these mechanisms in this paper, all of which might play a role, we do provide evidence suggesting that some international students, who would have otherwise chosen a non-STEM major, responded to the policy change by pursuing a degree in STEM.Consistent with the large response to the change in OPT policy,Fig. 1shows that the number of foreign STEM graduates participating in OPT grew by over 400% between 2008 and 2016, while the corresponding number of non-STEM graduates grew by only 88% (Ruiz and Budiman, 2018). To put this in perspective, in the years leading up to the 2008 OPT extension, non-STEM graduates consistently had more OPT approvals than STEM graduates, but by 2016, STEM graduates had twice as many OPT approvals as non-STEM graduates (Ruiz and Budiman, 2018). Also consistent with a large policy impact, (Demirci, 2019) finds that the OPT extension available to STEM majors increased these students’ likelihood of using OPT at all relative to non-STEM students. Since all international students were eligible for at least a year of OPT before and after the policy, his finding could be due to international students (or their employers) taking into account the likelihood of a more permanent stay in the United States when making work-related decisions. Finally, academia appears to have responded to the policy as well, with some economics departments changing the name of their major from “economics” (not considered a STEM field) to “econometrics and quantitative economics” (considered a STEM field) in order to attract more international students (“Economics Renames Itself to Appeal to International Students”, 2018). While the increases in the number of STEM students using OPT, as well as the changing names of economics majors, are suggestive of the OPT policy having an impact, they are also consistent with an increase inlabor demandfor students with mathematical and science-related skills.Download :Download high-res image (158KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. Number of OPT approvals from 2004–2016, in thousands.Notes:This figure is fromRuiz and Budiman (2018). In their report, the authors describe the plotted figures as “students with an associate degree or higher”, whereas the STEM categories are “based on the fields outlined by the Department of Homeland Security.” The plotted data originates from a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the Pew Research Center to U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement.We use data from the 2003, 2010, 2013, and 2015 waves of the National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG) –a repeated cross-sectional biennial survey of the college-educated population in the United States, to estimate causal impacts of the policy. Specifically, we compare pre vs. post-OPT extension changes in the propensity to hold a STEM degree of foreign born individuals who first came to the United States on a student visa (treatment group), relative to other foreign-born U.S. college graduates (control group). The control group includes the foreign-born who first came to the United States on a permanent or temporary visa that allowed them to work. Like those in our treatment group, these foreign born individuals obtained their highest degrees in the United States and, therefore, are likely to have been similarly affected by any changingeconomic conditions(such as changes in firms’ demand for STEM labor). They would not, however, benefit from the OPT STEM extension as the latter is only available to those with student visas. As such, we test if the foreign-born in our treatment group became more likely than the foreign-born in the control group to have a STEM major if they enrolled in their field of degree after the 2008 policy change.We find that the OPT extension raised the propensity of holding a STEM degree by about 18% for those in our treatment group relative to those in our control group. To provide evidence that this baseline estimate can be interpreted as causal, we test for pre-trends, make changes to our control and treatment groups, and explore the robustness of our estimates to the addition of several control variables to our model. All of the checks support the interpretation of the OPT extension impacts as causal. Most of the impact originates from students with a terminal master's degree, for whom the likelihood of having a STEM major rose by 33%. We also explore which STEM fields were most affected by the OPT policy change and find that the OPT extension increased the engineering workforce in the United States more than any other STEM field.Data restrictions prevent us from distinguishing among all mechanisms potentially at play. Instead, we focus on the net effects of the policy change, but we are able to provide suggestive evidence that some students may be changing their majors as a result of the policy. We do this by examining whether the policy has had its strongest impact on individuals appearing only marginally committed to pursuing a STEM degree. To that end, we first look at whether the OPT extension induced double majors, with a non-STEM field listed as their first major, to hold a second major in a STEM field. We find that among international students with a master's degrees and a double major, the propensity to double major in STEM when their first major was in a non-STEM field increased 1.7 times as a result of the policy. For students listing a STEM field as a first major, the likelihood of a second major in a STEM field was actually smaller after the OPT policy change. In a similar vein, the OPT extension appears to have induced many non-STEM B.A. majors to pursue a master's degree in STEM, making such a transition 1.1 times more likely. In contrast, the policy does not seem to have had an impact on the likelihood of STEM B.A. majors pursuing master's degrees in STEM. Taken together, these results might be interpreted as suggestive evidence of the OPT extension inducing “marginal” STEM majors to pursue a STEM degree.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

"1. IntroductionThe effect of immigration on the labor market outcomes of native workers is one of the most controversial issues in modernlabor economics(Borjas, 2014). Most early studies (seeCard, 1990,Hunt, 1992, and, for a review of that early literature,Friedberg and Hunt, 1995) concluded that the effect of immigration on the labor market outcomes of natives is negligible. However, the results from more recent studies are mixed, some of them finding significant negative effects (seeBorjas, 2003,Dustmann, Schönberg, Stuhler, 2016b, and, for a review of the more recent literature,Edo, 2019).1By using spatial correlations between wages (or employment) and measures of immigrant penetration, the results from the early investigations could indeed lead to misleading interpretations (Borjas, Freeman, Katz, 1997,Dustmann, Fabbri, Preston, 2005). Obviously, labor is not an exception to the law of supply and demand. If wages do not fall after an immigration-induced increase in labor supply, this could be due to any of the following departures from the standard model. First, immigrants and native workers may not be perfect substitutes, either because they have differenteducation levelsor, within a given education category because they have complementary skills and work in different occupations (Dustmann, Frattini, Preston, 2013,Ottaviano, Peri, 2012,Peri, Sparber, 2009). Second, the labor supply shock caused by immigration may not be exogenous, especially if immigrants sort themselves to destinations with high wage and employment prospects (Dustmann, Fabbri, Preston, 2005,Llull, 2018a). Even if the immigration shock is exogenous, it can induce labor supply responses on the natives’ side which will blur identification. This will be the case for example if native workers respond to immigration by acquiring additional skills (Hunt, 2016,Llull, 2018b), by emigrating to other local labor markets (Borjas, 2006,Cadena, Kovak, 2016,Monras, 2015,Piyapromdee, 2017) or both (Ortega and Verdugo, 2016), therefore violating theceteris paribusassumption. And third, labor market imperfections such as wage rigidities, unions, or other institutional characteristics may prevent wages or employment to adjust (Angrist, Kugler, 2003,Edo, 2016,Glitz, 2012).The main contribution of this paper isnotto provide yet another estimate of the wage (or employment) response to immigration but to investigate the role of labor market institutions, and more precisely of the minimum wage, in determining such response. We find that immigration has relatively small but statistically significant detrimental effects on the wages and employment outcomes of native workers with comparable skills, and show evidence of important heterogeneous effects across U.S. States. In particular, we show that the impact of immigration on natives’ labor market outcomes is more negative in states where the effective minimum wage is relatively low. In contrast, sufficiently high minimum wages tend to protect native workers from any adverse wage or unemployment effects of immigration. The first result (main effect) is consistent with the rest of the literature implementing the national skill-cell approach (Borjas, 2003,Llull, 2018a).2Note that this approach, which we implement at the state (rather than national) level, neglects by construction any potential cross-skill group complementarities, as well as any capital-stock adjustments that could have positive wage impacts for all native workers (Dustmann, Schönberg, Stuhler, 2016a,Lewis, 2011,Ottaviano, Peri, 2012). These channelsshouldbe taken into account when discussing the impact of immigration on the labor market outcomes of theaveragenative worker. The second result (on the differential effects across US States) is consistent with the literature investigating the labor market effects of immigration in the presence of wage rigidities (Brücker, Hauptmann, Jahn, Upward, 2014,D’Amuri, Ottaviano, Peri, 2010,D’Amuri, Peri, 2014).3It complements the view that, by possibly affecting wage-setting mechanisms as well as reservation wages, labor market institutions can mitigate or exacerbate the responsiveness of wages (and/or employment) to immigration. In particular,Angrist and Kugler (2003)investigate how rigidities in product and labor markets (e.g., business entry costs, employment protection, firing costs, replacement rates) can affect the employment of natives in response to immigration. In a panel of European countries, they find that the negative employment effect induced by immigration is exacerbated in countries with high rigidities.Our main methodological innovation is to use the non-linearity created by the coexistence in the United States of state- and federal-level minimum wages (which has already been used to identify the effect of the minimum wage on unemployment) in the context of immigration. Indeed, some U.S. States set their minimum wage at a level which is systematically higher than the federal minimum wage, while in other U.S. states the federal standard applies. This means that the successive rises in the federal minimum wage between 2007 and 2010 (from $5.15 to $7.25) not only strongly increased the number of workers covered by the minimum wage in the U.S. as a whole but did so disproportionately in low-minimum wage states (i.e., in states having an effective minimum wage equal to the federal one). We followCard (1992),Card and Krueger (2000),Baskaya and Rubinstein (2012),Giulietti (2014)andAutor et al. (2016)in taking advantage of the fact that these increases in the federal minimum wage tend to be exogenous to States’economic conditions. We use two complementary strategies (standard panel estimations and a difference-in-differences approach) to estimate the impact of immigration on the wages and employment of native workers within a given state-skill cell. Our first empirical strategy uses state-skill panel data now standard in the U.S. immigration literature (Borjas, 2014). We use the changes in immigration that occur within state-skill cells to estimate the effects of immigration on natives’ wages, employment, and out-of-state migration, as well as to identify the role played by the level of States’ minimum wages in shaping these effects. Our second empirical strategy is derived from the minimum wage literature and exploits a difference-in-differences (DiD) approach. We take advantage of the incremental increases in the federal minimum wage between 2007 and 2010 to analyze the within-cell effects of immigration on natives’ outcomes in States where the federal minimum wage is binding (the treatment group)versusa control group of states that did not experience any change in their effective minimum wages over that same period.In both empirical strategies, we account for the various potential biases that arise from the endogeneity of immigrants’ location choices (i.e., the fact that foreign-born workers are not randomly distributed across labor markets but tend to be mostly attracted to localities where wages and employment are relatively high). We followCard (2001),Cortes (2008)andPeri (2012), and use the historical distribution of immigrants by country of origin across U.S. States (taken from the 1980 U.S. Census) as an instrument for current immigrant penetration. This instrument is based on the fact that immigrants’ location decisions are partly determined by the presence of earlier immigrants whereas the historical distribution of immigration is in principle uncorrelated with contemporaneous changes in labor market outcomes and economic conditions at the state-skill group level. Another identification issue relates to the “native flight” caused by immigration. The out-migration of natives from states that are most affected by immigration should re-equilibrate local labor market conditions, thereby contributing to the understate the adverse labor market effects of immigration (Borjas, 2006,Cadena, Kovak, 2016); in our setting, however, we show that native internal migration resulting from immigration-induced changes in supply at the state-skill cell level is unlikely to bias our estimations.Let’s be more precise about our findings and their interpretation. Recall that we find that immigration has negative effects on the wages and employment levels of native workers within a given state-skill group, but that these effects are less negative when the State’s effective minimum wage is high. High minimum wages, therefore, tend to make natives’ wages and employment less sensitive to competition from immigrants, as predicted by our simple theoretical framework inSection 2. Using data mostly from the AmericanCommunitySurvey for the 2000–2013 period, we find that a 10% increase in the size of a state-skill group due to the entry of immigrants reduces the mean weekly wage of native workers in that group by 0.2%, and by 1% after instrumenting (the corresponding elasticities are respectively −0.02 and −0.1). Our point estimate is close toBorjas(2014 chapter 4) who uses U.S. census data from 1960–2010 and finds a wage elasticity of −0.13% at the state-skill level.4Nevertheless, when we focus on low-education, low-experience groups (e.g., up to completed high school with less than 10 years of work experience), our point estimate is about four times higher than our baseline, corresponding to a wage elasticity comprised between −0.3 and −0.4. Interestingly, we find that a $1 increase in the minimum wage brings the wage elasticity to immigration down from −0.1–−0.03 for the whole sample and from −0.3–−0.2 when focusing on low-educated and low-experienced groups. Moreover, the elasticity of wages to immigration goes from −0.2 in States with the lowest minimum wages (e.g., Alabama, Florida, Texas) to virtually zero in States with the highest minimum wages (e.g., Alaska, Massachusetts, Washington).Regarding employment, we find that a 10% immigration-induced increase in labor supply reduces the employment rate of competing natives by 0.3%, and by 0.9% after instrumenting. When focusing on low-skilled native workers, we find an employment reduction of about 2.5% in the IV specification. This magnitude is consistent with the fact that the negative wage impact induced by immigration is stronger for the low-skilled native workers (Orrenius, Zavodny, 2008,Smith, 2012). Minimum wages also appear to have a protective effect on natives’ employment. Indeed, we find that a $1 increase in the minimum wage brings the employment elasticity to immigration from −0.09–−0.05 for the whole sample and from −0.25–−0.18 when focusing on low-educated and low-experienced groups. Moreover, the elasticity of employment to immigration goes from −0.3 for the lowest minimum-wage states to −0.1 for the highest minimum-wage states.In our regressions, we include time-varying statefixed effectsto control for local economic conditions. However, it is impossible to exclude the possibility that States’ effective minimum wages are not endogenous to changes in economic conditions at the state-skill level. In order to account for the potential endogeneity of States’ effective minimum wages, we followBaskaya and Rubinstein (2012)and use the federal minimum wage as instrument. In fact, federal minimum wage adjustments affect differentially the effective minimum wage across states and are arguably exogenous to economic conditions at the state level.We then implement a difference-in-differences analysis by exploiting the successive rises in the federal minimum wage over the period considered, comparing states where federal standards apply (i.e., our treatment group) to unaffected states (i.e., our control group).5We find that the successive rises in the federal minimum wage between 2007 and 2010 strongly mitigated the adverse labor market effects of immigration in low minimum wage states relative to high-minimum wage states (i.e., in the treatment v. the control group). Over the period 2004–2013, our estimates indicate that these federal adjustments reduced the wage and employment elasticities to immigration in low-minimum wage states respectively by 9.2% (from −0.61–−0.56) and 13.8% (from −0.32–−0.28).The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.Section 2proposes a simple diagrammatic framework discussing how immigration supply shocks and minimum wages interact in a competitive labor market.Section 3describes the data, presents our identification strategies and discusses the main identification issues.Section 4investigates the impact of immigration on the wages and employment of competing native workers and shows that this impact largely depends on whether the effective minimum wage in a given state is higher or equal to the federal standard. InSection 5, we show that our results are driven by the workers with the lowest levels of education and work experience, those for which, arguably, minimum wages are most relevant.Section 6implements our difference-in-differences approach by exploiting the successive changes in the federal minimum wage policy and supports our conclusions that minimum wages protect native workers against competition from immigrant workers with comparable skills.

"1. IntroductionEarly childhood conditions can have long-lasting effects on children’s educational attainment, labour market outcomes, and adult health (e.g.Almond, Currie, 2011,Cunha, J. Heckman, Lochner, Masterov, 2006,Heckman, Mosso, 2014). However, these early conditions differ considerably by children’s socio-economic status (SES), contributing to the emergence of SES gaps in child development very early in life:Bradbury et al. (2015), for instance, show that SES gaps in child development are already pronounced at age 5 and increase further throughout the first years of schooling. Consequently, many children from low-SES backgrounds fall behind.1One of the most important policy tools acrossOECDcountries to support families around childbirth is parental leave. A large literature shows that parental leave policies affect the current work force, in particular maternal labour supply. However, less research examines effects of such policies on the future workforce, namely children – although such policies affect several conditions in early childhood (e.g.Björklund and Salvanes, 2011): Overall, expansions in parental leave policies reduce maternal labour supply after childbirth (e.g.Lalive, Zweimüller, 2009,Ondrich, Spiess, Yang, 1996,Schönberg, Ludsteck, 2014) and thus affect the time parents can spend with their children. Parental leave benefits also directly impact household income, which determines the resources parents can invest into the development of their children (e.g.Dahl, Lochner, 2012,Løken, Mogstad, Wiswall, 2012). These changes in parental resources early in a child’s life may affect children’s development in the short-, medium- and long-run.2However, we know little about the effects of such policies on early child development and even less about the effects on SES development gaps.3Our paper examines effects on child development of a German parental leave reform that completely changed the eligibility criteria and benefit payments: For children born before January 1, 2007, parental leave benefits were means-tested and paid for up to two years after childbirth. After the reform, parental leave benefits were changed to earnings-related benefits and paid for up to 14 months in total per couple. The reform expanded the proportion of mothers eligible for up to 12 months of paid parental leave from 47% to almost 100%. The additional public benefit payments of the programme were fiscally substantial with about 0.1% of GDP in the first year after its implementation.4Gaining eligibility for parental leave benefits correlates positively with parental income and, consequently, with parental education. While the reform increased the average net disposable household income in the first year after childbirth by about 20%, mothers with a university degree received about 40% more than mothers without a university degree (Wrohlich et al., 2012). Although the reform was implemented in a setting with relatively low maternallabour force participationafter childbirth, it still caused the labour supply of mothers to decrease substantially in the first year after birth (see, e.g.,Kluve and Schmitz, 2018, and our own analysis below). Moreover, other studies suggest small effects on fertility (Cygan-Rehm, 2016,Raute, 2019) and breastfeeding duration (Kottwitz et al., 2016).5At the time, critics worried that the reform would widen substantial pre-existing SES gaps in child development (e.g.Henninger et al., 2008), an important concern for earlyinequalitiesin the future work force.We study effects on several important dimensions of child development at age six using administrative data from school entrance examinations. For our empirical analysis, we use a difference-in-differences approach and compare children born before and after the 2007 reform cut-off date to children born around the same cut-off date in the previous year as our control group. We complement the analysis by empirically investigating reform effects on maternal labour supply, earnings and household income at different phases of child development to better understand potential mechanisms behind the effects on children. We base this supplementary analysis on a sample of administrative employment data.In the previous literature, a few studies examine introductions of parental leave (seeCarneiro, Løken, Salvanes, 2015,Rossin, 2011,Stearns, 2015), finding some positive effects on infant health, schooling and later labour market outcomes. Studies on parental leave expansions within the first year after childbirth mostly find no effects on children’s outcomes (Baker, Milligan, 2010,Baker, Milligan, 2008,Baker, Milligan, 2015,Beuchert, Humlum, Vejlin, 2016,Dahl, Løken, Mogstad, Salvanes, 2016,Dustmann, Schönberg, 2011,Würtz Rasmussen, 2010). Studies on parental leave expansions in the second year after childbirth show some effects on long-run child development (Danzer, Lavy, 2016,Dustmann, Schönberg, 2011,Liu, Skans, 2010). These mixed findings may suggest that the timing of parental leave policies matters, but an insufficient magnitude of the expansions may also explain some of the results. Furthermore, these studies mainly focus on long-run child outcomes, so it is not clear whether initial reform effects faded out over time. In addition, most of these reforms analysed in the literature took effect in the 1970s to 1990s. Since then, many factors related to child development have changed substantially across countries, such as maternal labour force participation, day care availability, and social norms. Only few studies examine reforms taking place after 2000 with a focus on short- and medium-run effects of parental leave reforms (e.g.,Baker, Milligan, 2010,Baker, Milligan, 2008,Baker, Milligan, 2015,Beuchert, Humlum, Vejlin, 2016,Huber, 2019,Lichtman-Sadot, Bell, 2017,Pihl, Basso, 2019). Most of these studies rely on outcomes with restrictive information on the cognitive and non-cognitive development of children (e.g. birth weight, infant mortality, premature birth, hospitalisations). Studies examining richer child development measures often use parent-reported information or rely on small sample sizes that require more restrictive assumptions for the identification of causal effects.6Furthermore, previous contributions pay little attention to the mechanisms underlying the effects and whether parental leave policies impact SES development gaps.Our study makes the following major contributions to this literature: First, we shed new light on whether substantial, more recent changes in paid parental leave affect child development in the medium-run. Our setting is very distinct from the vast majority of the previous literature on parental leave evaluations in terms of the magnitude and directions of policy changes (see AppendixFig. A.1). Whereas the previous literature on child development exclusively studied introductions or expansions of parental leave schemes, the reform we examine both expanded eligibility for paid leave in the first year after childbirth and removed eligibility for paid leave in the second year after childbirth. Moreover, the reform we analyse changed means-tested benefits to earnings-related benefits such that high-SES households (compared to low-SES households) gained financial and time resources in the first year after childbirth that could be invested in children’s development. As the changes in terms of benefits and leave duration correlate strongly with families’ SES, the German reform we analyse allows studying how changes in paid parental leave policies affect SES gaps in child development.Second, we contribute novel evidence of parental leave policy effects on medium-run outcomes of children using administrative data from compulsory school entrance examinations at age six. The data cover the full population of children from one German state and allow to examine several important dimensions of child development that are shown to be highly predictive of later educational attainment (e.g.Duncan, Dowsett, Claessens, Magnuson, Huston, Klebanov, Pagani, Feinstein, Engel, Brooks-Gunn, Sexton, Duckworth, Japel, 2007,Grissmer, Grimm, Aiyer, Murrah, Steele, 2010), later health outcomes and labour market performance in other settings (e.g.Blanden, Gregg, Macmillan, 2007,Carneiro, Crawford, Goodman, 2007,Cunha, J. Heckman, Lochner, Masterov, 2006). As child development is assessed by paediatricians, our resulting estimates are not prone to parental reporting bias. By analysing medium-run outcomes, we provide complementary evidence to previous studies on children’s long-run outcomes, which mostly find no or small effects, to address the question whether parental leave policies do not have any effects on children at all, or whether initial effects may fade out over time.OnlyHuber (2019)has so far studied the effects of this German reform on child development of newborns and toddlers. Her paper uses survey data with potentially biased parent-reported information on child development measures. This study is based on a small sample size (e.g., 91 treated children born between January and June 2007) and fails to reject even large point estimates. It uses several pre- and post-treatment cohorts for the control group and thus relies on modeling the longer-term trends for this small sample correctly. Our analysis focuses on pre-schoolers that were assessed by external paediatricians. Our much larger sample size allows to perform differentiated heterogeneity analyses, and allows identifying even small effects on child development. In addition, our study also focuses on potential mechanisms behind our findings.Our results show that the substantial changes in paid parental leave had no impact on children’s language skills, motor skills, socio-emotional stability, and school readiness at age six. The point estimates are close to zero and precisely estimated. Since the differential and potentially opposing effects for families who gained or lost eligibility may offset each other, we stratify the sample by parents’ predicted previous eligibility status for paid leave. We estimate again very small and insignificanttreatment effectson child development. The same picture emerges when we stratify the sample by parental education, an important and widely used dimension to assess SES differences in child development (see, e.g.Bradbury et al., 2015). Consequently, we find no evidence for changes in the SES development gaps despite strong and heterogeneous effects of the reform on maternal employment and family income that we document based on new estimations in administrative employment data. Thus, the reform effects on the current work force are not sacrificed by an increase in SES gaps of the future workforce – at least as based on child development measures at age 6.As likely explanations for the zero-effects, we show that changes in transfers are transitory, that the share of non-working mothers in the first year after birth was already high before the reform, and that mothers mostly adjusted their employment at the part-time margin in the first and second year after childbirth – which the previous literature shows to only have a small impact on child development.",Mathias,Daniel,C.
"1. IntroductionThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) estimates that 12.1 million undocumented persons resided in the United States in January 2014 (Baker, 2017). In the past decade, Congress considered (but failed to enact) a number of proposals that would regularize the status of the undocumented population and provide a “path to citizenship.” Given the large size of this population, any future change in its immigration status is bound to have significant effects on the labor market and the broader economy. But any evaluation that attempts to predict the economic impact of regularization immediately runs into a major roadblock: We know little about the economic status of the 12 million undocumented persons already living in the United States.The study of the socioeconomic status of the undocumented is obviously hampered by the fact that no widely available microdata survey reports whether a particular foreign-born person is undocumented or not. In recent years, however, there has been progress in developing methods that attempt to impute the undocumented status of foreign-born persons at the individual level, such as the imputation algorithm for the Current Population Surveys (CPS) developed at the Pew Research Center orWarren's (2014)analogous exercise using the AmericanCommunitySurvey (ACS). These attempts build on the framework first proposed byWarren and Passel (1987)that attempts to estimate the size of the undocumented population. The Passel-Warren methodology, in fact, underlies the “official” estimates of this population as reported by DHS.The Pew researchers essentially built an algorithm that considers various aspects of a person'sdemographicbackground to add a variable to a CPS microdata file indicating if a foreign-born person is “likely authorized” or “likely unauthorized” (Passel and Cohn, 2014). After being granted access to some of the Pew data files,Borjas (2017)used a variant of this algorithm to create an undocumented status identifier in all the post-1994 Current Population Surveys, and used these data to analyze the differences inlabor supply behavioramong undocumented immigrants, legal immigrants, and natives. The differences in work propensities were striking. Undocumented men had much largerlabor force participationand employment rates than other groups in the population; the gap widened substantially over the past two decades; and the labor supply elasticity of undocumented men was close to zero, suggesting that their labor supply is very inelastic. In contrast, undocumented women had much lower participation and employment rates than other groups in the population.This paper applies the algorithm to the American Community Survey (ACS) to measure the size and examine the determinants of the wage penalty to undocumented immigration.1Undocumented immigrants are likely to earn less than equally qualified legal immigrants simply because the undocumented have many fewer options in the labor market. Not all jobs are available to undocumented immigrants, and the possibility of detection (and eventual deportation) may lead to exploitation of the undocumented by unscrupulous employers. Our analysis of the ACS data yields a number of potentially important findings:(1)Although the unadjusted gap in the log hourly wage between undocumented workers and legal immigrants is large (around 35% for both men and women), much of the gap disappears after adjusting for differences in observable socioeconomic characteristics between the two groups. Two variables, educational attainment and English language proficiency, account for nearly half of the observed wage gap between the groups.(2)The wage penalty to undocumented immigration declined between 2008 and 2016. In 2008, the wage penalty stood between 4 and 6% for both men and women. By 2016, the wage penalty had declined for both groups. Although it is difficult to ascertain why theaveragewage penalty in the national labor market has shrunk, the decline in the wage penalty coincides with the timing of actions by the Obama administration which led to a less restrictive approach to undocumented immigration. In fact, our evidence indicates that the wage penalty to specific groups of immigrants, such as those targeted by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) executive action, declined significantly after the relaxation of restrictions.(3)The finding that theaveragewage penalty is relatively low hides a lot of variation in the penalty among different types of undocumented workers, and among undocumented workers employed in different labor markets. Not surprisingly, the (cross-section) age-earnings profile of undocumented workers lies far below that of legal immigrants (and, of course, of native workers). More strikingly, the age-earnings profile of undocumented workers is almost perfectly flat during much of the prime working years, As a result, the wage penalty for undocumented workers rises significantly over the life cycle.(4)The evidence indicates that observationally equivalent undocumented workers and legal immigrants are not perfect substitutes. As a result, the wage penalty responds to increases in the relative size of the undocumented population. In particular, the wage penalty is larger in states with relatively larger undocumented populations: A 1 percentage point increase in the fraction of the state's workforce that is undocumented increases the wage penalty for men by about 1 percent. In addition, the wage penalty responds to the enactment of state-levellegislationthat restricts the employment of undocumented workers, with tighter restrictions leading to significantly larger wage penalties.This diverse set of findings provides a foundation upon which any eventual analysis of the impact of alternative regularization proposals can be based. It is important to acknowledge at the outset, however, that the robustness of the evidence presented below depends on the validity of the procedure used to impute undocumented status at the micro level.",George,Hugh,None
"1. IntroductionThe H-1B program allows US firms to temporarily hire foreign-born workers in occupations that require highly specialized knowledge. The program is controversial among economists, policy-makers, and the public. On the one hand, it might allow firms to engage in economic activity that would be impossible to pursue through domestic labor alone. Moreover, H-1B workers tend to work in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields that are responsible for much of the country’s technological and productivity growth. On the other hand, some worry that foreign workers are perfectly substitutable with native-born Americans and therefore reduce domestic wage and employment opportunities. Partly in response to these concerns, the US limits the number of new H-1B workers that can be hired each year. This policy presumes that such restrictions will cause firms to substitute toward US labor sources. Less-considered is the possibility that firms will substitute toward other production inputs such as alternative sources of foreign labor.This paper does not assess how immigration affects native-born workers. Rather, it uses triple-difference estimation and administrative H-1B data to analyze how H-1B caps affect wage offers to H-1B recipients. Intuition andneoclassical theorysuggest that H-1B restrictions will cause wage offers to substitutable foreign labor inputs to rise so long as their labor supply is not perfectly elastic. By examining the wage effects induced by H-1B caps, this paper therefore provides a unique methodology for identifying whether firms substitute between different subsets of highly-educated foreign-born workersThe paper’s identification strategy is driven by H-1B program design. H-1B status is awarded to individuals (not firms) for up to a three year period and is renewable to a total of six years. Current policy allows 65,000 new H-1B issuances to employees of for-profit firms per year. An additional 20,000 issuances are available for individuals who have obtained a masters degree or more education from a US university. Each year, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announces the “last date of receipt” (or LDR) on which the general 65,000 quota has been filled. For-profit firms wanting to hire an H-1B worker after the LDR face limited options. Two potential sources include new workers with advanced US degrees so long as the 20,000 advanced quota has not yet been met, and established H-1B workers currently working at for-profit firms. In contrast, prospective employees of colleges, universities, and other non-profit research institutions (henceforth “non-profit” firms) are exempt from H-1B quotas.1Program design therefore segments individuals who possess otherwise-similar education, skills, ethnic heritage, and other characteristics into separate markets: Highly-educated foreign-born workers seeking to enter the US labor market through H-1B employment at non-profit institutions can be hired at any time. Similar workers seeking first-time H-1B employment at for-profit firms can do so only if permits are still available.2H-1B policy, coupled with administrative data on accepted H-1B job offers approved by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) acquired through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, provides a natural experiment for identifying how policy-induced scarcity affects wages paid to H-1B workers.A priori, simple difference-in-difference methodology would seemingly be appropriate. Accepted H-1B job offers could serve as the unit of observation. Offers from for-profit firms would serve as the treatment group; offers from non-profit research firms would be the control. The treatment occurs after the LDR, when for-profit firms that want to hire H-1B workers face limited options.Importantly, however, the filing period for new for-profit H-1B status fluctuates according to demand, implying that permit scarcity is particularly acute in some years. Quotas pertain to fiscal years (which begin on 1 October), but an individual can apply for H-1B status up to six months in advance (1 April).Table 1illustrates that prospective employees of for-profit firms had more than four months to secure an H-1B permit for fiscal year (FY) 2006. In 2007, that period reduced to just 56 days. The shortage was so severe for fiscal years 2008, 2009, and 2014 through the present that the number of applications exceeded the number of available permits during the first week of the filing period and all permits were distributed by random lottery. These regularities point to at least three constraints to difference-in-difference estimation: First, since regressions require observed job offers both before and after the last date of receipt in a given year, they cannot include any year in which the first day of the application period and the last date of receipt occur on (or near) the same day. That is, regressions must exclude the years in which all cap-bound H-1Bs were distributed by lottery. Second, fluctuation in H-1B scarcity suggests that the value of H-1B status could vary across years – the LDR might have little effect on H-1B offers during years in which it occurs late in the application period. Third, firms and individuals anticipate the LDR. This might affect wage offers around the LDR so that no discrete before-and-after date can be used in estimation.Table 1.

Two groups consistent with the ones discussed above are considered in turn: new H-1B workers with advanced degrees from US colleges and universities and established H-1B workers without advanced US degrees who have demonstrated US work experience.Figs. 1and2provide descriptive evidence and motivation for pursuing this approach.

The left panel graphs trends at for-profit firms, while the right does so for colleges, universities, and non-profit research institutions. Wage offers from for-profit firms are high at the start of the application period in both fiscal years, but average wages decline in subsequent weeks. Fiscal year 2007 saw a pronounced reversal with rising wages near 26 May 2006 – the last date of receipt for the 65,000 general H-1Bs in that year. These high premiums eventually subsided, but the cumulative average wage offer was about 4% above that of similar workers for FY 2006 by the time the last date of receipt for advanced degree recipients was reached on 26 July 2006. Importantly, the right panel demonstrates no such behavior for US advanced degree recipients with job offers at non-profit firms.Fig. 2illustrates cumulative average wage for job offers to established H-1B workers without an advanced US degree. These workers can be hired at any time in the year. Trends for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 mirror each other at both for-profit and non-profit firms and are relatively stable. This suggests that effects of H-1B restrictions could be different for new and established H-1B workers – a recurring theme throughout this paper.The empirical analysis in the following sections will more formally analyze the phenomena illustrated in these figures throughregression analysis. Baseline results argue that as the general H-1B cap was reached for FY 2007, the for-profit wage premium associated with offers to advanced US degree holders rose 5% relative to the prior year. This suggests that firms quickly substituted toward these workers when foreign labor without advanced US degrees became unavailable. Conversely, regressions find no evidence that firms responded to the general cap by substituting toward established H-1B labor and offering those workers higher wages.Next, the analysis addresses potential challenges to the identification and interpretation of baseline results. Perhaps the chief concern is that the H-1B cap and other factors could alter the composition and quality of H-1B hires after the last date of receipt. That is, positive wage gains in baseline regressions might represent substitution in response to heightened scarcity, or they might instead simply point to firms’ selection of higher-ability job candidates as H-1B caps are reached. Although it is not possible to entirely rule out a selection effect with available data, evidence remains supportive of the former interpretation: Regressions are conducted for narrowly-defined groups of workers that nonetheless exhibit enough data variation to facilitate meaningful statistical identification; Robustness checks reveal that the main conclusions are insensitive to the inclusion/exclusion of groups over-represented in the H-1B program (namely, Indian-born and computer-related workers); And trends in the share of H-1Bs awarded to individuals from these over-represented groups show no significant break near the LDR for FY 2007 as one might expect to occur if selection is solely driving the results.A second concern is much like the first. The H-1B cap could alter the selection of firms participating in the program. Here, the analysis demonstrates that results are robust to the exclusion of employees of firms that might use the H-1B program to facilitate offshoring activities. Conclusions are further reinforced in regressions usingfixed effectsto control for firm-level idiosyncrasies. Again, these checks help to ensure that wage estimates reflect price effects generated by H-1B scarcity and not changes in the selection, quality, or characteristics of foreign-born workers or the firms hiring them.A third concern relates more strictly to identification. Results could be biased by differential pre-trends in wage offers to treatment and control groups. The paper examines this possibility by concluding the empirical analysis with an event-study analysis. Evidence suggests that groups satisfy common trends assumptions and that wage effects appear only for new H-1B workers with advanced US degrees around the last date of receipt for FY 2007.The next section provides a more detailed discussion of the H-1B program and the related literature. Subsequent sections describe the data, perform the empirical estimation, and conclude.",Chad,None,None
"1. IntroductionVocational skills are valued in the labor market. Along with academic qualifications, the demand for work-oriented vocational skills is increasing (ILO, 2011). Policymakers have responded to the call to improve and enhance the content ofvocational educationand training. For example, the European Union's 2020 roadmap for vocational education and training, the Bruges Communiqué, treats practical work-oriented vocational skills and academic qualifications as being equally important (Brunello and Rocco, 2015).This paper analyzes the labor-market returns to a new breed of postsecondary vocational education that combines the development of work-oriented vocational skills with the updating of academic knowledge. A deeper understanding of the connection between vocationally-oriented education and labor-market outcomes is central toeducation policiesbecause a better match between skills and work promotes labor marketinclusivity(OECD, 2017). Countries around the world are considering how to allocate resources between universities and vocational education providers in a way that best supports their citizens and economies.Studies on the labor-market returns to postsecondary vocational education focus on bachelor's or lower-level programs. Recent evidence for the U.S. shows that community college degrees and diplomas in vocational fields lead to higher earnings and employment, particularly for women (seeJepsen et al., 2014,Belfield and Bailey, 2017, and the references therein). These programs are both vocationally and academically oriented and require up to two years of full-time study. In Europe, many vocational programs are of longer duration, of up to four years, and culminate in the receipt of a vocational bachelor's degree.1Little, if anything, is known about the potential labor-market returns to master's degrees with a vocational focus, even though several European countries (such as Germany, Portugal, and Finland) offer such degrees. The growing literature onpostgraduate educationcompleted later in life focuses narrowly on academic degrees (Hällsten, 2012,Stenberg and Westerlund, 2016). Rapid technological change is occurring in occupations andindustriessuch as manufacturing, where workers traditionally have vocational rather than academic qualifications. Lifelong learning, either in the form of on-the-job training or in terms of formal education, is vital for success in these jobs. For example, over 60% of U.S. workers were found to have received training or instruction at work in the last 12 months (Horrigan, 2016). An analysis of those who have prior working experience is especially policy relevant in the aftermath of theglobal economic crisis, as many unemployed have to decide whether to pursue additional formal schooling, and governments have to decide whether to invest more resources in higher vocational education to improve the labor-market prospects of young people.This paper produces the first estimates (as far as we are aware) of the labor-market returns to schooling in new vocational master's programs established in 2002. We examine returns to formal part-time education for prime-age workers (aged 25–55 years at entry). Using complete annual register data from Finland, we first create a matched comparison sample of individuals who would be eligible to attend vocational master's programs and have similardemographiccharacteristics, ability, and pre-enrollment labor-market experiences but who choose not to attend. For this matched sample of students and non-students, we estimate an individualfixed effects modelto compare earnings before and after attending vocational master's programs. We estimate models of attendance and models of completion.The results of the individual fixed effects models show that individuals who attend vocational master's programs—whether or not they complete a degree—have higher earnings than a matched comparison group who do not attend. By four to six years after entry, the earnings gains for attendees are more than seven percent of the average earnings in the year before entry. Over the same time period, the returns to degree completion are higher, at 10–11%. Returns are broadly similar between males and females and between younger and older students. Five to six years after entry, students of health programs have the highest returns, followed by those of technology and trades programs. Our estimates remain robust even if there is substantial selection into vocational master's programs. Because most European countries, like Finland, have vocational bachelor's programs that enroll large numbers of students, these findings demonstrate the potential earnings benefits of expanding vocational education further to the master's level.",Petri,Mika,Christopher
"1. IntroductionThe ability of organizations to adapt rapidly to a changing environment is a critical success factor in competitive markets (see for instance,Stigler, 1939,Hannan and Freeman, 1984,Volberda, 1996). The apparent lack ofmicroeconomicflexibility has been a pressing concern for European countries, particularly in the recent recessionary context. European labour market institutions are often blamed for restricting the ability of firms, and of the economy, to respond to shocks smoothly. Recent survey evidence shows that the bulk of firms' adjustments to cope with shocks has primarily rested on employment rather than along other margins, such as wages and hours (Bertola et al., 2012,Fabiani et al., 2015). While wage-setting institutions have captured most of the attention in this debate, this paper focuses on the role played by collective voice mechanisms at the workplace level. Yet employee representation may allow more efficient contractual arrangements by allowing firm adjustments to take into account employee preferences over hours, wage and employment trade-offs.Employee representation, such as trade union representation or works councils, affects the distribution of decision rights and information between managers and workers, and thereforework organization, at the establishment level.1The presence of employee representation structures may oblige firms to disclose financial information and may impose specific procedures on how to implement certain decisions and major organizational changes.It may be thought that employee representation erodes organizational flexibility by imposing time-consuming consultation and decision-making processes, thus limiting the ability of firms to respond to market signals quickly. In this paper, we study whether or not this presumption is empirically grounded by focusing on the effect of employee representation on an important operational dimension of organizational flexibility–working-time flexibility. By allowing firms to smooth working hours according to workload variations, flexible working-time arrangements, such as flexitime and working-time accounts, may provide an alternative adjustment mechanism to cope with shocks. Flexitime allows employees to vary workday start and finish times and working-time accounts compensate overtime with days off. Employers may benefit from implementing such arrangements in different ways. For example, working-time accounts can provide a cost-effective adaptation of employment to demand changes, by reducing overtime bonuses and the costs of recruiting and training temporary workers. From the employee's perspective, flexible working-time arrangements may provide greater job security and promote a better work-life balance, by allowing employees to vary their working times according to personal needs (Seifert, 2001,Herzog-Stein and Zapf, 2014).2We examine whether European legal provisions establishing employee representation rights and requiring firms to inform and consult employees have resulted in increased employee representation, and whether this is associated with a greater use of flexitime and working-time accounts. We also explore the extent to which the changes observed are associated with differences in firms’ employment responses and employee motivation problems, and whether effects vary with the level at which pay bargaining takes place and with workforce composition.Identifying the causal effect of employee representation, and more generally, of work organization, is methodologically troublesome (DiNardo and Lee, 2004,Bloom and Van Reenen, 2011). Ideally, one would require exogenous variations in the presence of employee representation at the workplace level. In this paper, we exploit the quasi-experimental variation introduced by the implementation of a 2002 European Union (EU) Directive granting employees information and consultation rights beyond a certain firm size. The Directive 2002/14/EC on the Information and Consultation of Employees provides employees with minimum statutory rights to be informed and consulted by their employers on a range of key business, employment and work organization and restructuring issues (Hall, 2005). We focus on four countries (Cyprus, Ireland, Poland and the UK) in which the implementation (“transposition”) of the Directive implied major changes in nationallegislation.3The size-contingent nature of the Directive, which applies to firms employing 50 employees or more, creates quasi-experimental conditions. This setting allows us to use a difference-in-difference (DID) approach to compare the responses of eligible and non-eligible establishments. To conduct our empirical analysis, we rely on repeated-cross sectional establishment-level data from the European Company Survey. One major advantage of this survey is that it provides harmonized information on employee representation and working-time arrangements before and after the transposition of the Directive.Our results suggest that the Directive had a positive and significant effect on both the presence of employee representation and the utilisation of flexible working-time arrangements in eligible establishments. More precisely, the proportion of establishments with employee representation among those establishments affected by the Directive increases by 7 percentage points compared to the control group over the reform period. Furthermore, the utilisation of working-time accounts in the establishments affected by the Directive (the treatment establishments) increases by 5 percentage points compared to control establishments in the same period. In relation to the pre-reform situation, the magnitude of these effects is sizeable, representing increases of 32% and 34% respectively. Interestingly, the effect of employee representation on flexible working-time schemes is driven by establishments where no local wage bargaining takes place and those with a high proportion of female workers. Employee representation appears to play an important role in aggregating and communicating preferences for temporal flexibility, which are often thought to be stronger in the case of female employees (Goldin, 2014). The validity of our identification strategy is robust to a series of placebo tests in which we arbitrarily manipulate the size threshold and the pre-policy and post-policy periods. The results are not confounded with compositional changes of treatment and control groups over time. Moreover, our findings do not seem to reflect long-run differential trends in the utilisation of flexible working-time arrangements between affected and unaffected firms. Finally, we exploit additional variation provided by establishments located in countries in which the Directive implied either minor or no legislative changes and estimate a triple-difference (DDD) model, reaching similar conclusions.Our results are consistent with the idea that employee voice may foster flexibility along other margins of adjustment (hours) than employment in second-best scenarios in which incomplete contracting problems are pervasive. Employee representation implements a change in property relations by transferring partial control rights to employees or at least precluding shareholders (and managers) from making decisions in relation to certain matters without informing employees. Interestingly, the relaxation of shareholders' property rights and the limits imposed on managerial discretion as a result of the operation of employee voice mechanisms seem necessary to achieve certain valuable forms of organizational flexibility.The paper adds to the literature on shop-floor employee representation and works councils. Previous research has mainly focused on the German case, exploring the effects of representation on productivity (Addison et al., 2004), investment (Addison et al., 2007), employment (Addison and Teixeira, 2006,Jirjahn, 2010), and wages (Addison et al., 2007).4More recently, the role played by shop-floor employee representation in major European economies, particularly during the financial crisis of 2008–2009, has received increased scholarly attention (Askenazy et al., 2016,Amossé et al., 2016). Our paper relates to the literature on the economic effects of unionization (DiNardo and Lee, 2004), including a relatively smaller literature on the effects of employee representation on nonwage aspects of work (Buchmueller et al., 2004). Evidence about the relationship between employee representation and working-time flexibility is scant and mostly based on case studies (Berg et al., 2014,Herzog-Stein and Zapf, 2014).5In a study more closely related to ours,Heywood and Jirjahn (2009)analyse the relationship (also restricted to the German context) between works councils and family-friendly workplace practices, finding that the presence of works councils positively affects the use of flexiblework schedules. Due to the lack of exogenous variation in employee representation structures, the proper identification of causal effects has been a major concern about these studies.6By taking advantage of the quasi-experimental setting created by the implementation of the Directive, we provide for the first time causal evidence on the effect of employee representation on working-time flexibility.The paper also contributes to the literature on working-time flexibility. While previous research has mainly focused on technology as a key driver of flexible working-time utilisation, we highlight the role played by an important labour market institution–employee representation–in mitigating the kind of commitment problems that may undermine the implementation of such practices. Recent studies have suggested that working-time flexibility has a positive effect on firm productivity (Bloom et al., 2015,Beckmann, 2016) and promotes convergence in pay between genders (Goldin, 2014,Goldin and Katz, 2016). Our results suggest that employee representation may affect the gender pay gap through this interesting yet underexplored institutional channel.The paper is structured as follows.Section 2discusses the main hypotheses concerning the effect of employee representation on the utilization of flexible working-time arrangements.Section 3gives background information on employee representation in Europe and describes the data.Section 4explains the identification strategy based on the size-contingent implementation of the EU Directive on Employee Information and Consultation.Section 5presents the main results.Section 6provides evidence on heterogeneous effects depending on establishments' workforce composition (in terms of gender and skills) and on whether or not wages are negotiated locally.Section 7discusses our main identification assumptions and provides some robustness checks.Section 8concludes.",Gabriel,Virginie,None
"1. IntroductionThe number of post-baccalaureate certificates awarded has increased by 174% from under 15,000 in 2000 to just under 40,000 in 2015 (Delta Cost Project at American Institutes for Research).1Post-baccalaureate business certificates are typically aimed at students who majored in fields not related to business as undergraduates; for example, University of Maine’s website for The Certificate of Studies in Business Administration notes “It is ideal for non-business majors interested in getting grounded in the principles of business with aspirations of platforming into more in-depth business administrationeducation and development.” A business certificate may be a way to try out whether anMBA programis a good fit, as some programs specifically target students who are interested in pursuing an MBA in the future.Despite this growth in the number of post-baccalaureate certificates, there is a lack of causal evidence on labor market outcomes for individuals holding such a certificate. Currently, these certificate programs are not eligible for federal financial aid, though there have discussions in Congress to expand aid eligibility to include these programs.2Before policy makers decide to subsidize these programs, they may be interested in learning more about the benefits of these programs. Post-baccalaureate certificates could augment human capital which should improve labor market outcomes. They may also serve as a signal in the labor market that the worker is more productive than a similar worker without a certificate. Additionally, people may use the certificate to signal to employers that they wish to change occupations.In this paper we explore whether having a post-baccalaureate business certificate increases the probability that a job applicant receives a callback from a potential employer. We do this using a correspondence study where we send fictitious résumés, which allows us to control for observable characteristics while randomly assigning whether a candidate has a post-baccalaureate certificate or not.3The correspondence study methodology has been employed to study callback rates based on such things as race (Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2004), age (Neumark et al., 2015), and not-for-profit schools versus for-profit schools (Darolia, Koedel, Martorell, Wilson, PerezArec, 2015,Deming, Yuchtman, Abulafi, Goldin, Katz, 2016). This approach allows us to estimate a causal impact of post-baccalaureate business certificates on callbacks, while controlling for potential self-selection issues, which (Gaulke, 2019) shows is an issue with other types of post-baccalaureate programs.We find causal evidence that post-baccalaureate business certificates do not significantly increase the likelihood of a callback for an interview. The point estimate is −0.005 (0.5 percentage point decrease) and the baseline callback rate is 11.6%. Across a variety of specifications, we consistently find null effects. This is consistent withNunley et al. (2016)which found that having a business major did not increase the likelihood of callback for a business-related job for those a few years out of college: if a business major is not enough to increase the callback rate, taking courses for a business minor in the form of a post-baccalaureate certificate program may also fail to increase the callback rate.Though we find little evidence in terms of increased callback rates, these programs are nonetheless costly to students. On the high end is Columbia, which while not explicitly giving a total cost for the program, does provide information about cost per point of enrollment, so we estimate a cost of $55,296 to complete an Advanced Graduate Certificate in Business.4On the lower end is Cornell which lists $3,600 for aBusiness Strategyand Competitive Advantage Certificate Program. Generally, other programs list prices that range from $6,000 to $10,000.5There is also a significant opportunity cost of these programs, since they typically take at least one year to complete.The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. InSection 2, we give more detail on the related literature. InSection 3, we describe the experimental design.Section 4reports the results and interpretation.Section 5concludes.",Amanda,Hugh,Sheryll
"1. IntroductionA lack of employment and job opportunities are often considered important causes of criminal behavior (Bell et al., 2018;Fishback et al., 2010). Recent world-wide recessions, with particularly high unemployment rates among traditionally crime-prone groups like young and low educated men, have accentuated the importance of understanding relationships between work and crime (Hoynes et al., 2012;Hauser and Baker, 2008). In this paper we use individual level data from Norway to study how the criminal behavior of employed men is affected by job displacement.There is a rich economic literature exploring the links between labor market conditions and crime.1Much of the empirical work draws on US data sources to estimate the relationship between area (usually state) unemployment rates and crime, with the general finding that unemployment has a modest but statistically significant positive effect on property crime rates, with little or no effect on violent crime rates.2These findings are consistent with traditional economic rational choice theories of crime, which predict that a reduction in licit earnings opportunities increases the allocation of time toward crime for profit (Ehrlich, 1973;Becker, 1968). The reliance on aggregate data has limited the ability of previous studies to investigate the mechanisms through which labor market conditions may affect criminal behavior. Moreover, when relying on area-level variation, typically in unemployment rates across US states, it is hard to credibly identify causal effects since a number of other factors co-vary with unemployment rates.We contribute to the existing literature by using individual-level crime data to provide individual-level estimates of the effects of job displacement on crime under a transparent identification strategy (similar to the strategy of e.g.Huttunen et al., 2018orBlack et al., 2015). Specifically, we investigate the impact of job separation associated with mass layoffs on the displaced workers’ engagement in crime. Workers suffering involuntary job loss represent an important subset of individuals through which weakening labor markets might affect crime. Focusing on job separations associated with plant mass layoffs allow us to investigate the impact of involuntary job loss while circumventing the most obvious forms of omitted variable bias: the select firing of specific workers based on unobserved attributes. Moreover, we can analyze a richer set of crime categories than others have, including alcohol/drug offenses and serious traffic offenses, and we can date crimes to the day-of-week they are committed, allowing us to discuss how displaced workers’ variation in time availability on work days versus weekends may affect crime. Our analysis draws on Norwegian register data that include a rich array of socioeconomic anddemographicvariables for the entire resident population, as well as all criminal charges brought against any resident from 1992 through 2008. Individual employment spell records allow us to calculate employment counts by plant and year, from which we can identify separations and mass layoffs. Our main analytic sample consists of 361,385 different men, 18–40 years old, who were employed with at least two years of tenure in the baseline year. Our difference-in-differences (DID) approach compares the evolution of criminal charge rates in a “treated group” of male workers who were separated from their plant of employment during a period of mass layoff (the displaced), to the evolution in charge rates of similar workers employed in plants that did not undergo a mass layoff (the comparison group). Pre-separation employment rates are similar across the two groups, however pre-separation crimes rates are somewhat higher in the displaced group, necessitating the DID approach.3Our estimated effects are unbiased under the assumption that the difference in crime rates observedpre-displacementwould have continued in equal magnitude into the post-displacement period had the displacements not occurred. The fact that pre-displacement crime rate differences appear stable throughout the pre-displacement period lends credibility to this assumption.We find that job displacement leads to a sizable increase in criminal charge rates of about 20 percent in the year of displacement, with declining effects in the subsequent years. Job displacement increases crime for all studied crime categories. In a relative sense, estimated effects are most pronounced for property crimes. Our estimate indicates that job displacement raises the likelihood of property crimes by about 60 percent in the year of displacement. The relative size of effects appears smaller for other crime categories (violence, alcohol/drug, serious traffic violations), but significant effects are estimated throughout, and with similar (though small)leveleffects across all categories.4The effect of displacement on crime presumably operates, at least in part, through workers’ labor market detachment. Based on rational choice theories of crime (e.g.Becker, 1968), a displaced worker has incentives to shift the allocation of time toward illicit earnings opportunities (i.e. property crime) since displacement reduces legal earnings opportunities. Additionally, displacement lessens the opportunity cost of a worker's time during the period of unemployment (or under-employment), with implications for both property and non-property crimes (Ehrlich, 1973). Our analysis finds that displacement reduces employment earnings over the immediate years following displacement by 10–15 percent, and displacement substantially increases the likelihood of being unemployed or of working less than full-time. As in prior studies, the particularly large increase in property crimes provides support for rational choice theories emphasizing the role ofearning replacementas a motivation for crime by the displaced. On the other hand, the significant effects on non-property crimes indicate broader mechanisms are also at work, including a potential role fortime availability.Our analysis sheds further light on thetime availabilitymechanism by exploiting data we have on theexact dateeach recorded crime occurred. Except for property crimes, we find more dramatic increases in crimes committed on work days (Monday-Friday) than on weekends. This suggests that not having to go to work, associated with a decline in structured daily routines and a reduced opportunity cost of time, is an important channel through which displacement affects non-property crimes. The effects we observe for violent crimes and drug/alcohol-related offenses are also in line with theories that highlight the importance of self-control, financial concerns, frustration and mental distress in determining criminal and counterproductive behavior (Mani et al., 2013;Agnew, 1992; Gottfredson andHirschi, 1990).These findings make novel contributions to the existing empirical literature on job loss and crime. We find credible evidence that displacement increases violent (as well as property) crime rates, a fact that has only weak support from most of the area-level studies. We find credible evidence that displacement also affects crimes like traffic offences and drugs/alcohol-offences, an area where no other credible evidence currently exists. The large effects on alcohol/drug crimes may be particularly noteworthy in the economics literature, since they are not straightforwardly explained by the rational crime theory and thus likely speak to psychological effects of job displacement. Our day-of-week analysis is also novel to the literature and provides empirical support for the importance of time availability.The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.Section 2discusses theoretical mechanisms through which plant closure could affect criminal behavior, and relates them to the Norwegian context.Section 3presents the empirical strategy, andSection 4describes the data.Section 5presents our results, including robustness checks, andSection 6explores mechanisms.Section 7concludes.",Mari,Torbjørn,Kjetil
"1. IntroductionIn this study, I investigate the heterogeneous earnings effects of the Job Corps by gender. In particular, I show thatgender differencesin labour market opportunities contribute to the overall effect heterogeneity. To this end, I apply the translated quantile decomposition ofBitler et al. (2014). Furthermore, I extend this approach to incorporate average translated effects.The Job Corps is the largest U.S. labour market programme targeting disadvantaged youth. It provides academic, vocational, and social training, as well as health care counselling and job search assistance, for an average duration of eight to nine months.Blanco et al. (2013),Chen and Flores (2015), andLee (2009)show that the Job Corps has positive wage effects for both genders. This effect is expected to increase earnings through higher hourly wages and greater labour supply.2The female labour supply is expected to be more elastic to wage changes than is the male labour supply (see, e.g., the discussion inBargain, Orsini, Peichl, 2013,Killingsworth, Heckman, 1986). However, several studies observe a tendency that the Job Corps increases the gender earningsinequality. In a large-scale experimental evaluation,Schochet et al. (2008)show evidence of higher average earnings gain from the Job Corps for males than for females. Moreover,Eren and Ozbeklik (2014)report more positive quantile earnings effects for males than for females. These findings contrast with the empirical evaluations of many other active labour market programmes (ALMPs).Meta studiesperformed byBergemann and van den Berg (2008)andCard et al. (2018)report evidence of higher ALMP returns for females than for males. In this study, I highlight one potential mechanism behind the unexpected findings for the Job Corps.Frumento et al. (2012)investigate the effect heterogeneity for various socio-economic groups using a principal stratification approach with strong functional form assumptions. They observe that individuals with worse initial conditions (in terms of education, labour market experience, race, and gender) profit less from the Job Corps than do those with good labour market opportunities.3Expected earnings can be viewed as an aggregate measure of labour market opportunities.Quantile regressionscan identify (distributional) heterogeneity by expected earnings.Eren and Ozbeklik (2014)report larger earnings differences for the Job Corps at higher quantiles than at lower quantiles. Such a pattern can be expected if the Job Corps is more effective for groups with better labour market opportunities, that is, those with high earnings even without training. Higher opportunity costs for participants with better earnings opportunities can explain this positive relationship between earnings opportunities and Job Corps returns. It is well documented that a larger share of females is located in the lower part than in the upper part of the earnings distribution. Thus, unexpected effect heterogeneity can arise in favour of males from structural gender earnings inequality rather than from gender differences in Job Corps trainability. The latter could arise from programme content that is, for example, more aligned to the needs of one gender. In this study, I decompose those potential channels using the translated quantile approach ofBitler et al. (2014).For an example of the relevance of the translated quantile approach, assume the need to determine assignment criteria for offering participation in the Job Corps that do not increase gender inequality. If structural gender earnings inequality leads to heterogeneity, a non-discriminatory assignment rule offers participation to males and females with balanced labour market opportunities. If Job Corps trainability differs by gender, then other dimensions of the Job Corps programmes need to be better aligned with the specific training demands of males and females. For example, vocational training offered during the programme could meet the needs of males better than the needs of females.My findings, consistent with the existing literature, provide suggestive evidence for larger quantiletreatment effectsfor males than for females. Structural gender earnings inequality possibly accounts for 82% of the average effect heterogeneity by gender. Trainability differences by gender appear to play only a minor role. Even though the effects are statistically insignificant, these findings suggest that the offer to participate in the Job Corps does not disfavour females with earnings opportunities that are equal to those of males. However, it seems that the Job Corps amplifies the existing structural earnings inequality in favour of males. Randomly offering participation in the Job Corps to eligible individuals increases the average earnings opportunities by 8% after four years but could possibly also increase the average gender earnings gap by 8% within the eligible group. An allocation scheme that balances the earnings structures of the selected programme participants by gender could yield similar average returns but tends to have a lower impact on gender earnings inequality.Furthermore, I report effect heterogeneity by gender and parenthood. While mothers tend to profit more from Job Corps than do fathers, the results suggest the opposite for women and men without children. I document that differences in the earnings structure by gender and parenthood can account for a large proportion of this heterogeneity (on average, 71%). This suggests the within-group earnings structure is an important factor for between-group effect heterogeneity. Accordingly, the within-group earnings structures should receive more attention when rules used to award Job Corps offers are designed.The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.Section 2reviews the institutional background of the Job Corps and the related literature.Section 3describes the experimental data.Section 4explains the quantile transformation approach.Section 5presents the main empirical results.Section 6describes effect heterogeneity by gender and parenthood, and the final section concludes the paper.

"1. IntroductionOver the last decade, policymakers have shown increasing interest in government interventions in the market for child care. TheOECDhas discussed the introduction of early childhood programs in several reports (Field, Kiczera, Pont,OECD); in Germany, South Korea, Canada and the Scandinavian countries, governments have been pushing to expand access to subsidized care. In the US, President Obama proposed to make “high-quality preschool available to every child in America” in his State of the Union address2013.An important argument in favor of governments subsidizing and facilitating child care availability is the claim that child care helps reconcile work and family responsibilities, thereby increasing mothers’labor force participation(OECD, 2006). A positive impact on labor supply may also mean that the public cost of providing child care is partly mitigated by increases in thetaxbase or reduced benefit dependence.In this paper, we estimate the labor supply and tax impacts of child care using a large increase in child care availability for toddlers (age 2) in Norway following a reform from 2002 to expand child care to cover demand. The reform increased government subsidies to investment in and running of child care institutions, and generated large variation in the supply of child care between municipalities and over time. Our estimation strategy exploits the difference in child care expansion between municipalities following this reform to get credible estimates on how child care affects the labor supply of mothers and fathers, as well as other potential caregivers. Because child care for toddlers was strongly rationed in this period, changes in the availability should be driven primarily by the changes in supply as a result of the reform, and not by changes in local demand. To guard against omitted variable bias, we nonetheless document that our estimates are robust to controlling for a large set of observable characteristics and to a range of specification checks.An important improvement over much of the literature is that we observe a continuous measure of the individual use of child care throughout the year. This allows us to implement an IV strategy, using the availability of child care as an instrument for the actual enrollment, which accounts for the intensity of child care use. Our estimates reflect, therefore, how a full year of child care enrollment affects mothers’ labor supply, rather than the direct effect of additional child care slots that open at some point during the year, which is estimated in most of the literature. There are at least two reasons why accounting for the intensity is important. First, new child care places are typically created in August, at the start of the school year. This mechanically gives a maximum child care use of around 42% for most children, i.e. 5 out of 12 months. Second, to the limited extent that child care places are not utilized to capacity, child care institutions have quite extensive discretion to scale provision to actual use, by e.g. adjusting employee hours. In this case, treating child care places as uniform independent of utilization will overestimate the cost of provision. A further improvement over much of the previous literature is that we identify both cohabiting and single mothers, as well as fathers andgrandparents.This is among the first papers to provide evidence on how large-scale, universal child care for toddlers affects parental labor supply.1In contrast, the sizable literature on child care and mothers labor supply has been focused mostly on child care for preschoolers (age 3–6), for whom theree are important reasons to believe that the impact on parental labor supply may differ. Descriptively, young children who are not in child care are much more likely to be cared for by one of the parents in the home (often the mother), while older children are more often cared for by informal childminders, like relatives, friends, or nannies. This may be due both to a stronger reluctance among parents of young children to use informal child care arrangements, or to less supply of informal care for young children. Either way, we would expect that the availability of child care for young children may have a stronger potential to increase labor supply of parents than availability of care for older children.Our results indicate that child care for toddlers has substantial effects on mothers’ labor supply. A married or cohabiting mother induced to use a full year of child care by the reform is 32 percentage points more likely to be employed, compared to mothers who do not use child care at all.2This is over a baseline of 63% participation before the reform, and associated with an earnings increase of 66,000 NOK (8,000 USD) for cohabiting mothers. We also investigate persistence in the labor supply response, finding positive impacts 1–3 years later. For single mothers, we find contradicting and imprecise results that preclude strong conclusions.Proponents of subsidized child care commonly claim that parts of the cost of such subsidies are offset by the increased tax revenues or reduced benefits generated by the additional income of working mothers. Using data on actual tax payments, we can go beyond back-of-the-envelope calculations found in previous literature to show that the increased taxes caused by child care use is, at least in our case, insignificant and relatively small. Specifically, our estimates suggest an average tax rate of about 14% on the extra income, much lower than the average tax rate. At the same time, the increased access to child care and higher employment does not seem to lead to significant reductions in benefits, which would further have reduced public spending.3For fathers, we find no labor supply response. This may indicate that mothers are still the primary caretakers, staying home when child care is not available. Meanwhile, estimates on working age grandparents show that there is no response among maternal grandparents, but modest effects on the labor supply of paternal grandparents. Interestingly, while paternal grandmothers work more, paternal grandfathers work less when the child is using child care. This may suggest that paternal grandmothers are important informal caregivers to some 2-year olds, while there is an indirect income effect on grandfathers.We contribute to the rapidly growing literature estimating how child care availability affects parental labor supply. Most of the previous literature studies pre-school children at ages 3–6, and find modest effects.4For younger children, evidence is more limited, but some recent studies indicate that effects might be larger for this group than older children, in line with our findings.Goux and Maurin (2010), for instance, study a cutoff to school start for 2- and 3-year olds in France, estimating that about one single mother enters employment for every four 2-year olds enrolled. In comparison, they do not find effects on single mothers of 3-year olds or cohabiting mothers.Givord and Marbot (2015)study an increase in child care subsidies and estimate that the reform caused small but significant increases in the labor supply of mothers of 2-year olds, but not 3-year olds.Carta and Rizzica (2018)study a reform that expanded access to highly subsidized child care to 2-year olds in Italy in the mid-2000s, reporting effects of 5–7 percentage points on the labor participation of mothers.Bauernschuster and Schlotter (2015)study the introduction of a legal right to care in Germany for 3-year olds and find impacts of similar magnitude to what we find in the current paper, while the estimates for a Spanish child care reform expanding access for 3-year olds are around half as large (Nollenberger and Rodríguez-Planas, 2015). Estimates for the Netherlands inBettendorf et al. (2015)are modest. Finally, estimates for 1–3 year old children are zero or negligible in studies from South Korea, Germany and Sweden (Busse, Gathmann, 2018,Lee, 2016,Lundin, Mörk, Öckert, 2008).An important issue in comparing estimates across studies, is that the intensity of treatment, and hence the implicit scaling of estimates, differs widely.Goux and Maurin (2010), for instance, estimate a fuzzy RD-design using French census data, whereschool enrollmentis instrumented with an age cutoff and the outcome is stated labor force participation. This generates estimates per child enrolled in school on a flow measure of labor supply. In contrast,Carta and Rizzica (2018)follow much of the literature on preschool aged children to consider reduced form effects on yearly measures of labor supply directly. To interpret these estimates, they consider changes in child care access that do not capture the intensity of use. Since new child care places according to the authors were opened in September, the utilization rates in the first year should be expected to be much lower than in following years. In this case, the estimates reported will understate the effects of the child care expansion on labor supply over a full year.Our IV-strategy resolves the issue of partial treatment and scales the effect to the increased use of child care caused by the expansion. This should, on the one hand, ensure that our estimates are closer to the expected impact of the child care expansion over time, when child care places are available throughout the year. It should, on the other hand, facilitate the application of our estimates in other contexts, where the take-up rates may be expected to differ from what we observe in our data. Our IV-estimates can arguably be compared more directly to those inGoux and Maurin (2010), given that actual use in France was substantial after enrollment. In contrast, estimates inCarta and Rizzica (2018)should be scaled by the intensity of the reform to give ATT-estimates before being compared to our reduced form estimates. These latter estimates are in fact quite comparable in size.Mixed support for a tight link between parental labor supply and child care availability or prices is disappointing from a policy perspective, since increasing mothers’ labor force participation is a key policy goal in many countries. Our estimates suggest that the modest effects could be explained by two things: First, the take-up of child care in the initial periods following child care expansion may not be complete. Indeed, in our case, the start of the child care year in August implies that the children who occupy the newly expanded slots will usually attend at most five months of care in the first year. Our study allows to refine previous estimates by exploiting data on the intensive margin of child care use rather than relying on crudely aggregated data. Second, as emphasized by e.g.Havnes and Mogstad (2011), substitution into formal care from informal sources rather than home care would suggest that effects of child care are smaller than might be initially expected. In this case, rather than releasing mothers to the labor market, child care is taken up by mothers who are already working and relying on some form of informal care arrangement. Our results then suggests that informal sources of care may be less important as an alternative to formal care for younger compared to older children. Both alternatives imply that the potential for child care policies to stimulate mothers’ labor supply may be larger than suggested in much of the recent literature on preschool children.The paper proceeds as follows: We first cover the institutional setting and the child care reform inSection 2, whileSection 3presents the registry data used for estimation, the samples of interest and somedescriptive statistics.Section 4presents our IV method withfixed effects. Results are found inSection 5, including persistence analysis. We perform a range of robustness checks to support our estimates inSection 6, whileSection 7concludes.

"1. IntroductionIn spite of the huge amount of international literature on hiring and wage subsidies, targeting a vulnerable category of unemployed people (i.e. long-term-unemployed), little is known about their possible side effects at amacroeconomiclevel. Moreover, little is known about the implementation and effectiveness of such policies in Italy. Additional information on these topics would, nonetheless, be extremely useful. Policy makers should be conscious of all possible consequences of the policies they are implementing. Moreover, italian unemployment rate in 2017 was 3.6 percentage points higher European Union average and those of a particularvulnerable groupsuch as long-term unemployed (defined as workers unemployed from at least 12 months) was 3.1 percentage points higher1It is therefore crucial to understand whether targeted policies can be considered powerful tools in the italian fight against long-term unemployment. Our study wishes to provide this information. We estimated the impact of a targeted policy implemented in Italy: Law 407/90. According toBrown and Koettl (2012)classification, it was an incentive to create (permanent) employment targeting long-term unemployed (LTU) people. It provided tax credits to firms hiring long-term unemployed with a permanent contract. It was implemented from 1990 to the end of 2014 and widely used by firms. Furthermore, we checked for the possible side effects of this policy. Our results show that the positive effects of targeted policies are strong and significant, while there are no side effects such as displacement or postponed hiring effects.As underlined inBrown (2015), targeted subsidies may have negative consequences at a macroeconomic level. In presence of the subsidy, firms may hire subsidized unemployed people instead of unsubsidized ones with similar characteristics (and, consequently, a similar vulnerability level), penalizing the latter. This side effect is called displacement effect. Moreover, when eligibility is defined by certain conditions (as in targeted policies), the presence of asymmetric information on government’s side may induce agents to cheat in order to appear eligible when they are not.Brown (2015)called this side effect asymmetric information effect. In the context of subsidies targeting long-term unemployed, the effect of asymmetric information may be that employers who decided to hire an unsubsidized worker wait to hire him/her until he/she is subsidized. This side effect is called postponed hiring effect. Among the studies estimating the impact of hiring subsidies, only few of them took into account of possible displacement or postponed hiring effects (Calmfors, Forslund, Hemström, 2002,Blundell, Dias, Meghir, Van Reenen, 2004,Bucher, 2010,Boockmann, Ammermueller, Zwick, Maier,Schünemann, Lechner, Wunsch, 2013).Blundell et al. (2004)andSchünemann et al. (2013)found no significant displacement effect. Nevertheless, the policySchünemann et al. (2013)were studying had no significant effect either.Calmfors et al. (2002)andBucher (2010), instead, found a strong and significant displacement effect. The first work is a literature review of different empirical studies. However, they present a single study trying to estimate the displacement effect. It consisted of a survey to firms, hence its results should be taken with caution. Indeed, the use of a survey to collect data may produce several measurement errors, i.e. due to a misunderstanding between the interviewers and the interviewed, to the misreporting of the true attitude by the interviewed, etc.Visser et al. (2000). The second work, instead, is based on a theoretical model, relying on strong assumptions. Finally, onlyBoockmann et al. (2007)tested for postponed hiring effect, and concluded there were not. Therefore, previous literature is unclear on the presence of displacement effect while there is few evidence on postponed hiring effects. This is surprising considering that knowledge on these effects not only would give the policy makers a more complete overview on these programmes, it is also necessary to make a correct estimation of policy impact. Indeed, displacement and postponed hiring effects mostly affect the outcome of individuals that are more likely to be part of the control group used in counterfactual evaluation. Therefore, when this approach is used, they would bias policy impact estimation. We tried to fill this gap of information providing a convincing empirical analysis on the presence of displacement and postponed hiring effects.To the best of our knowledge, italian literature on hiring subsidies targeting disadvantaged categories of individuals is even smaller.Anastasia et al. (2012)studied the impact of a subsidy incentivizing the switch from a temporary to a permanent contract and targeting women and under-30-year-old youths. The authors exploited the age threshold to apply aregression discontinuity design(RDD). They found a positive and significant effect. Their analysis focused only on the Veneto region. The lack of italian literature on the implementation of targeted hiring subsidies in Italy is surprising given that italian labour market is characterized by a particularly high level of both unemployment and long-term unemployment. Our work contribute to the Italian literature, being the first study analyzing Law 407/90 and one of the few studies providing empirical evidence on the effectiveness of targeted policies.We exploited an administrative micro-database, namely the Integrated Sample of Compulsory Contracts Notifications (CICO) database, provided by the Ministry of Labour and Social Policies. We had access to these data thanks to an agreement between Dipartimento di Scienze Sociali ed Economiche of Sapienza University of Rome and the National Insitute for the Analsyis of Public Policies (INAPP). The database contains reliable information on contracts stipulated from 2008 to 2016 for a sample of individuals. Contract information is communicated to the Ministry directly by the employers.FollowingSchünemann et al. (2013), we applied a regression discontinuity design to estimate the impact of Law 407/90. We used the days of unemployment as a forcing variable and added dailyfixed effectsto the standard model. In order to select the bandwidth, we introduced and applied a new methodology. To motivate it, in the following, we will discuss why the methods commonly employed for bandwidth selection (Calonico, Cattaneo, Farrell, 2018,Calonico, Cattaneo, Titiunik, 2014,Cattaneo, Frandsen, Titiunik, 2015,Imbens, Kalyanaraman, 2012,Li, Mattei, Mealli, 2015) can’t be used in this framework. And, more generally, in frameworks where the forcing variable is time-varying and the treatment may affect sample composition. We partially followedSchünemann et al. (2013)to check for the presence of displacement and asymmetric informatione effects, i.e., we compared the differences in hiring before and after policy ending, for values of the forcing variable far from and close to the threshold.From the analysis, it emerged Law 407/90 had a strong, positive and significant effect on LTU hiring. The estimated impact was meaningfully higher than in previous studies using eligibility as treatment. This may be due to the high take-up rate and to country characteristics. We did not detect any displacement or postponed hiring effects.The remainder of the paper is organised as follow: inSection 2a brief literature review is presented. InSection 3information is provided on the causes of LTU duration dependence, the role of ALMPs contrasting them and the policy studied. InSection 4the data and the sample used are presented. InSection 5the methodologies used in each estimation are described, the necessary assumptions are discussed and the results are presented. InSection 6we summarize the conclusions of this study.",Alessandra,Marco,Guido
"1. IntroductionIn many countries, subsidies are commonly used to promote employment amongdisadvantaged groups, for example, among the youth, elderly, or disabled. Such policies are often implemented as temporary countermeasures in response to unanticipated severe recessions.Economic theoryshows that subsidies can increase employment by reducing the effective wages paid by employers, but the empirical question of the cost-effectiveness of the policy then comes into play. It is difficult to estimate the effect of subsidies because doing so requires one to estimate the number of jobs that would have been created otherwise. This problem becomes even more challenging when the policy is implemented only briefly and is targeted at a specific local area. In such cases, it is difficult to construct a reasonable counterfactual trend of employment without the policy in place.In this study, we evaluate a temporary and place-based employment subsidy program in South Korea (Korea hereinafter) that was intended to promote employment retention and spur localjob creationin a specific cityTong-Yeong(TY, hereinafter), which was experiencing a severe recession. A prolonged slump in oil prices and theGreat Recessionof 2008 decreased the volume of new shipbuilding orders. Therefore, all major shipbuilding companies suffered financially, leading to considerable job losses, especially in the municipalities whose economies relied substantially on the shipbuildingindustry. Among the eight largest shipbuilding municipalities in Korea, TY, a medium-sized coastal city in the southern region of Korea, was affected the most. To prevent the local industry crisis from spiraling into a recession in the overall local labor market, the Ministry of Employment and Labor (MOEL) designated the city a Special EmploymentPromotionZone (SEPZ) in January 2013, offering employment subsidies to local firms if they retained existing jobs or created new jobs for local residents. The program offered considerable benefits. It covered up to 90% of wage costs over six months if employers retained their employees instead of downsizing. Assuming a company received the maximum amount of subsidy per day, that is, 50,000 KRW, the program could reducelabor costsby 55% considering the average wage in TY in 2013 and 2014. Moreover, the program subsidized the hiring of local residents at a rate ranging between 33% and 50% of the wages for one year. In this study, we aim to estimate the effect of this policy on employment in the labor market of TY.Our study is mainly related to two strands of literature. First, because the subsidy program considered herein was geographically targeted at a specific city, our study relates to the strand of literature that evaluates place-based policies. Governments often implement several active labor market measures to create local jobs in economically poor areas or in areas where job prospects are weak (Neumark and Simpson, 2015). Many studies have evaluated the effectiveness of such policies, but their results have been mixed. The studies closest to our study are those that explore the Enterprise Zone (EZ). Among such studies, a few studies found little or no effect of place-based policies on employment (Wilder and Rubin, 1996;Bondonio and Greenbaum, 2007;Neumark and Kolko, 2010), while others found that place-based policies positively impact local employment (O'Keefe, 2004;Ham et al., 2011;Busso et al., 2013;Freedman, 2013).Second, our study is broadly related to studies evaluating the impact of employment subsidies that are not necessarily limited geographically. Even though it is theoretically obvious that subsidies increase employment, at least in the short run, regardless of the assumption of perfect competition or friction in labor markets, the empirical results have surprisingly been mixed. Most studies have focused on wage subsidies targeted at disadvantaged groups, such as the disabled, youth, or female workers. This might explain why a few empirical results are inconsistent with theoretical predictions.Katz (1998)argued that targeted wage subsidies for disadvantaged groups might stigmatize the said groups, making these policies somewhat less effective than more broadly targeted subsidies. This means that temporary and non-targeted subsidies might have the potential to stimulate employment growth. Only a few studies on more broadly targeted subsidies (Neumark and Grijalva, 2017;Cahuc et al., 2019), especially those on subsidies implemented temporarily during recessions, have been reported that are relevant to the subsidy program examined herein.1The subsidy program considered in our study was implemented temporarily in one city for two years. Because the municipalities surrounding the city could potentially be influenced by the program through the spillover effect, it is difficult to apply the standard difference-in-differences (DID) method to analyze the effectiveness of the program. Therefore, we use the synthetic control method developed byAbadie et al. (2010)andAbadie et al. (2015). Specifically, we construct a synthetic control unit that provides the counterfactual trend of employment growth rate, against which we can compare the actual evolution of the employment growth rate in the target city in the post-treatment period. We obtain this counterfactual trend by using data from other cities and counties in Korea, with specific weights assigned to the data to ensure that the resulting synthetic control unit best reproduces the adjusted employment growth rates in the target city before implementation of the employment subsidy program.We use administrative records from the National Unemployment Insurance (UI) system. An advantage of using UI data is that only the workers covered under UI are eligible for the subsidy program, so our employment measure from the UI data should include all of those beneficiaries. However, because the UI coverage rate among wage workers is not 100%, our results should be interpreted as the effect of the subsidy on UI-covered wage workers rather than on all workers, including non-UI-covered workers and self-employed individuals.To summarize our main findings, first, we find that the SEPZ program had little impact on employment in the local labor market in its first year. In fact, less than one-third of the government budget allocated to the program in the first year was used. This result is consistent with the previous finding that employment subsidy programs are usually underutilized initially (Katz, 1998). However, in the second year (the program was extended for a year), the program started generating a positive effect on employment. The magnitude of the effect is relatively small, especially given the possibility that our estimates are biased upward. Moreover, the effect is concentrated in the last two quarters of the second year. According to the estimates obtained with the synthetic control method, the program increased the employment rate by approximately 0.5 percentage points. We conduct various robustness checks and find that our main results are robust to different outcomes, specifications, and donor pool restrictions. Especially, we find that our results are robust when we restrict the sample to those areas where shipbuilding is the major industry. This suggests that our results are not specific to the context of a particular industry but are more generalizable. Moreover, the positive effect that appeared in the last two quarters of the program seemed to persist for several months after the end of the program. Finally, we find that the positive effect is stronger in the non-manufacturing sector and appears for both male and female workers.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.Section 2presents the historical background of the program and the city of TY, as well as institutional details about the SEPZ program in Korea.Section 3introduces the data and constructs the sample for applying the synthetic control method.Section 4presents a simple theoretical framework and our main findings.Section 5presents the results of various robustness checks and subsample analyses.Section 6presents our concluding remarks and discusses a few policy implications.",Hyejin,Jungmin,None

"1. IntroductionWhen evaluating candidates for executive positions, employers often amend the professional track record of mothers with a maternity allowance.Promotionguidelines usually rationalize these maternity allowances by claiming that motherhood not only constitutes a human right but raising children also provides considerable social benefits. As compared to other time consuming extra-professional activities which may also have adverse effects on job performance, the time constraint imposed by motherhood is thus viewed to have an altogether different significance that deserves to be taken into account when making promotion decisions. It is, of course, conceivable that this common justification of maternity allowances amounts to not much more than expressive rhetoric in the sense ofHillman (2010); but whatever the true reason for providing maternity allowances may be, considerations of fairness and moraljusticedominate the public and professional discourse.In this study, I explain the use of maternity allowances in meeting promotion standards without having recourse to arguments relating to fairness and moral justice. The basic idea rests on the assumption that productive people are not only productive on their jobs but also in many other activities. In particular, highly productive female professionals are, if they choose to have children, also exceptionally productive in their role as mothers. Inacademia, for example, highly proficient researchers are better able to keep their research ongoing while on maternity leave or when being burdened by raising young children. If productivity is comprehensive in this regard, female professionals can diminish the fuzziness that all measures of professional productivity suffer from, by having children. Having children is an informative and credible signal of productivity if less productive women find it impossible to combine their professional careers with motherhood.My argument is closely related to the story line of the well-known labor-market signaling models in the tradition ofSpence, 1973,Spence, 1974) andStiglitz (1975).1In these models, the signal is also costly and entails an activity that is potentially useless from a labor-market point of view (education providing edification as compared to human capital). The difference between my model and traditional labor-market screening models is that I consider two types of signals that determine the promotion decision: motherhood and an imprecise measure of professional productivity.2I show that by granting suitable maternity allowances, employers may enable highly productive professionals to signal their superiority by having children, whereas less productive professionals will remain childless. Even if highly productive professionals can send the fertility signal without maternity allowances, maternity allowances can still be introduced by the management because by doing so the likelihood of promoting lower ability candidates is reduced.I base the structure of my model on stylized facts from the academic job marked because in academia evaluations and promotions follow especially transparent rules that rely to a large extent on readily available objective, but nevertheless fuzzy, bibliometric measures of research productivity. The Research Excellence Framework (REF) that evaluated the research productivity of British higher education institutions in the 2008–2013 period is a case in point. A maximum of four studies per researcher served as the basis of assessing the quality of their output. When a researcher submitted fewer studies, the missing studies were penalized by assigning them the lowest quality. An exception was however made for researchers who were constrained in their research production by individual circumstances, notably maternity. For each discrete period of statutory maternity leave, researchers could reduce the number of studies by one. The maternity allowance for each child born in the six-year assessment period thus amounted to 25% of the adopted standard.Even though my model explicitly refers to the academic labor market, the conclusions carry over to other market settings because the model portrays the backdrop of promotion decisions at the executive level in any line of occupation. It does so by portraying employees who derive pleasure from successfully attending to their professional responsibilities, i.e. the employees pursue their professional careers not merely for a living. By succeeding professionally, they rather seek to confirm their identity and to gain self-fulfillment.The interaction between employer and employees is portrayed from a decidedly managerial perspective; technically speaking, the interaction is reduced to a partial equilibrium setting that is common in personnel economics. The alternative would be to embed the described signaling mechanism in the entire labor market environment of, let's say, university graduates aspiring for identity-creating professions and to investigate thegeneral equilibriumconsequences of widely used maternity allowances. In such a model, female graduates would choose which firms or academic institutions they apply to by making their decision contingent on their heterogeneous profiles and the potential employers’career developmentprograms in the form of maternity allowances. The employees would thus self-select themselves into specific career tracks, implying that the promotion decision rules become part of their choice set. Different firms or university departments would then face a different ability composition of their junior faculty and chose their respective maternity allowances accordingly. Since incremental changes in the promotion policies have negligible effects on the junior faculty intake, a partial-equilibrium model, starting off at the stage when the promotion policies are changed, does not neglect a great deal of information that is essential from a managerial point of view.Apart from the assumption that professional careers are to a substantial extent pursued for gaining self-fulfillment and the partial-equilibrium modelling strategy, four stylized facts of professional careers constitute the main structural elements of my model. In the following section, I introduce and substantiate these stylized facts by briefly describing some pertinent aspects of the relationship between research productivity and motherhood. I then proceed to present the model, derive its equilibrium behavior, and discuss some of its properties and implications.",Heinrich,None,None
"1. IntroductionA growing literature argues that early environments affecting childhood health may influence significantly adult health and socioeconomic status (Almond and Currie, 2011). If so, then investments in early childhood health may have particularly large returns and public policy targeted at infant and child health should be encouraged, particularly when private investment is constrained, for example, among low-income families. In addition, if childhood health does have a lasting effect, then associations between adult socioeconomic status and adult health may overstate the importance of socioeconomic status because child health may have influenced both these adult outcomes.Infancy may be a particularly important time in life when the health environment could matter for later outcomes, and several studies have assessed this hypothesis using infant mortality to measure the health environment.Barker and Osmond (1986)andBen-Shlomo and Smith (1991)obtained associations between infant mortality and adult cause of death for birth cohorts born in England and Wales in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Although both studies found some evidence that higher rates of infant mortality were associated with higher rates of death, particularly from heart disease, associations were not consistent and adjusting for socioeconomic status eliminated significant associations (Ben-Shlomo and Smith, 1991). Similar studies using 19th century birth cohorts from countries other than England and Wales generally found evidence of scarring— birth cohorts that experienced relatively high rates of infant mortality experienced relatively high rates of adult mortality (Bengtsson and Lindstrom, 2000,Catalano and Bruckner, 2006,Crimmins and Finch, 2006,Bengtsson and Broström, 2009,Myrskylä, 2010,Schellekens and van Poppel, 2016). Studies of more recent birth cohorts byBozzoli et al. (2009)andCase and Paxson (2009)reported similar findings.Case and Paxson (2009)reported that infant mortality was positively associated with infectious disease and cognitive decline in adulthood, andBozzoli et al. (2009)found that infant (post-natal) mortality was negatively associated with adult height. A limitation of the studies just described is that they do not exploit plausibly exogenous variation in early-life conditions.1Therefore, it is unclear whether the associations obtained are causal. In addition, most of these studies examining the lasting impact of child health used samples of people born in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and results may not generalize to birth cohorts alive today.There are several studies that exploit more plausibly exogenous variation in early life (i.e., in utero or infancy) health conditions, for example,Almond (2006)who studied the 1918 flu pandemic, andBleakley, 2007,Bleakley, 2010) andLucas (2010)who studied eradicating malaria and hookworm.2These studies, and many quasi-experimental studies focused on famines, generally find evidence that early life health shocks are associated with worse adult health and socioeconomic status, which is consistent with a scarring effect of early life health conditions.3However, findings from these quasi-experimental studies are not uniform, as a few studies reported no significant association between early health shocks and adult outcomes (e.g.,Stanner et al., 1997,Kannisto et al., 1997,Lumey et al., 2011,Brown and Thomas, 2013). Similarly,van Ewijk and Lindeboom (2017)found largely null effects for prenatal cohorts exposed to the adverse effects of World War II in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands.We present new evidence on the relationship between infant health and later-life outcomes using plausibly exogenous variation in infant mortality in England at the onset of World War II. Our research makes several contributions to the literature. First, we focus on relatively recent birth cohorts. As noted, many studies have used 19th century birth cohorts. Second, we exploit plausibly exogenous variation in infant mortality. Third, as we explain in more detail below, we assess whether the health environment in infancy is particularly important vis-à-vis the health environment at other ages during childhood. Fourth, we examine whether fertility responses confound the effect of the infant health shock.4Finally, we assess whether effects of adverse infant health environment differ by family socioeconomic status and whether effects, if any, manifest at different ages over the life course.The key empirical fact that motivates our study is the spike in infant mortality (deaths under 1 year of age per 1000 births) in England in 1940 and 1941; infant mortality rose 17% between 1939 and 1941, although the increase is even larger than this value implies because infant mortality was declining steadily during this period. The increase in infant mortality was largely driven by a marked increase in post-neonatal deaths mainly from pneumonia and whooping cough. Historical evidence indicates that the rise in infant mortality during this period was due to a combination of a wartime food rationing, disease transmission in day nurseries, and unusually harsh winters (discussed in the following section). From 1942 onward, infant mortality fell back to its pre-1940 trend arguably because of priority rationing that favored pregnant women, less harsh winters, and improvement in health services in childcare facilities (seeFig. 1).Download :Download high-res image (86KB)Download :Download full-size imageFig. 1. Infant mortality (per 1000 births) in England—1931–1964.Source:Authors calculations from table “mort_lgd” in the database of “Birth & Death Statistics for local Government Districts from 1921-1974.”Notes:In the figure we plot aggregate infant mortality by year for those born in England between 1931 and 1964.Within England, the extent to which infant mortality increased varied markedly across regions. For example, infant mortality in London changed little between 1939 and 1941 while in Northeast England it rose by nearly 27%. Because the negative health shock was short lived, severe, and varied within the country, it provides a natural opportunity to test the relationship between exposure to an adverse, early childhood health environment and later-life outcomes.Using data from the British Household Panel Survey, we exploit the variation in infant mortality across districts and cohorts of birth to estimate associations between exposure to a higher infant mortality environment and adult outcomes, such as presence of various health conditions, employment, earned income, education, home ownership, and disability. Our findings suggest that the increase in infant mortality in the early 1940s is associated with worse health as an adult. Specifically, a onestandard deviationincrease in infant mortality is associated with approximately a 24% increase in reporting poor/very poor health; a 35% increase in reporting a disability; a 10% decrease in the probability of having a job at the time of the survey; a 17% increase in reporting no annual real income; and a 9% decrease in reporting top tercile annual real income. Notably, these associations manifest mainly in later life, particularly after age 55. Another important finding of our study is that childhood socioeconomic status, as measured by father's occupation, does not appear to have moderated the adverse association between infant mortality and adult outcomes.",Jeffrey,Robert,Anthony
"1. IntroductionThe literature on performance-pay contracts has focused on two primary functions of bonuses: providing incentives for effort (Holmstrom, 1979) and attracting more productive workers (Lazear, 2000).1The basic premise of this framework is that a contractible measure of the worker’s performance is available to allow for the firm to offer a contract that ties the worker’s pay to her performance. The availability of contractible performance measures may be a plausible assumption for certain occupations (e.g., CEOs and professional athletes) or for simple tasks that produce measurable output (e.g., installing windshields and picking fruit).2However, asPrendergast (1999)notes, the lack of contractible performance measures induces many firms to pay their employees according to some subjective performance measures.When the environment is characterized by non-contractible output and asymmetric learning regarding the match quality between the firm and the worker, bonuses may also serve as a communication device (Fuchs, 2015,Suvorov, van de Ven, 2009). The rationale behind this idea is the following: the firm that privately learns about the match quality can use bonus payments to credibly communicate itsprivate informationto the worker. If the firm conveys to the worker favorable information about her current performance in a credible way, then the worker revises upward her belief concerning the match quality. This alters the worker’s effort provision (Suvorov and van de Ven, 2009) and separation decision (Fuchs, 2015). Despite the intuitive plausibility of this idea, its relevance to firms has not been well understood, primarily because previous analyses do not consider a hierarchical firm, and therefore, they are silent about the role of wages. In particular, the question of why firms do not simply offer wage increases instead of bonuses to provide workers with feedback regarding their performance remains unsettled.3To address this gap in the literature, I undertake a theoretical and empirical investigation of the signaling role of bonuses. In the theoretical part, I take the same approach as in earlier analyses by treating discretionary bonuses as a communication device; however, I depart from them by incorporating asymmetric learning and on-the-job search into a job assignment model. In this setup, both wages and bonuses are endogenously determined, and each serves distinctly different roles in terms of the worker’s turnover decision. In the empirical part, I employ a single-firm dataset to examine the extent to which the model’s predictions are consistent with the data.I consider a three-period model in which firms compete against each other to hire a worker in the first period and then to retain the same worker in the subsequent periods while workers choose a firm to work at in each period. Firms consist of low- and high-level jobs, and workers areex anteidentical. A worker’s effective output at a given job level is a function of the worker’s performance, which is in turn determined by the quality of the match between the worker and the firm, and the worker’s human capital. Several features of the output function are worth noting. First, the worker’s likelihood of performing well increases with the match quality (in the terminology of the model, high performance is referred to as producing high output). This means that the expected match quality depends positively on the worker’s performance at the current firm. Second, a worker’s expected output is higher at the high-level job if the match quality is sufficiently high. Thus, the worker receives apromotion(i.e., she is assigned to the high-level job) if her performance has been good enough to convince the firm that the match quality is sufficiently high. Third, the worker accumulates both general and firm-specific human capital over time; thus, the current firm has an incentive to retain the worker regardless of her current performance.At the beginning of each period, workers choose either to remain at the current firm or to switch firms to maximize their expected utility. Following the on-the-job search literature, the worker influences the job offers she receives from the market (e.g.,Benhabib, Bull, 1983,Mortensen, 1986). For simplicity, I assume that there are either good jobs or bad jobs in the market; the worker can transfer a higher level of human capital to a good job than to a bad job. Because transferring higher levels of human capital results in a higher wage (Gathmann and Schönberg, 2010), being offered a good job is desirable for the worker; thus, the worker exerts costly effort in a job search to increase the probability of receiving an offer for a good job. By contrast, because the retention costs increase as the worker’s outside option becomes more attractive, the firm becomes worse off if the worker receives an offer for a good job.The environment is characterized by asymmetric learning in the sense that the match quality between the firm and the worker is not initially observed by either party; however, the firm gradually learns about it by privately observing the worker’s output. After privately observing the worker’s output in a given period, the firm decides whether to pay a bonus. Conversely, the worker, who does not observe her own output, uses the bonus payment to form a belief concerning the match quality and then decides how much effort to devote to search activities. Importantly, the worker devotes less effort to a job search as the expected value of remaining at the firm increases.The key result of the model is that bonuses and wage increases serve distinctly different roles in altering the worker’s separation decision. To see the intuition behind this result, consider the effect of bonuses. Because the worker is paid a bonus only if her current performance is high, a bonus induces the worker to revise upward her belief concerning the match quality with the current firm. Consequently, the worker’s valuation of remaining at the current firm increases because a worker is paid higher wages and is more likely to receive a promotion (which is also associated with a wage increase) as the match quality increases.4Better career prospects, induced by the bonus payment, lead the worker to put less effort into a job search; consequently, she receives a good job offer less frequently. This results in a lower probability of separation because a worker is less likely to switch firms as the market offer becomes less attractive. Hence, bonuses are negatively related to turnover. Note that bonuses are paid prior to the worker’s job-search-effort choice and, therefore, before the current firm submits its bid to retain the worker in the following period. Thus, by offering a wage increase the firm cannot affect the worker’s job search behavior even though both the bonus payment and the wage increase reveal identical information about the match quality. Hence, both bonuses and wage increases arise in equilibrium: the firm pays bonuses to signal a good match with the worker and determines its wage offer for the following period to respond to the offers the worker receives from outside firms.The model yields testable implications that concern how bonuses are related to future wages and promotions and how bonuses and wage increases are related to turnover. These implications are the following: (i) earning a bonus is positively correlated with future wage increases and promotions; (ii) bonus size is positively correlated with future wage increases and promotions; (iii) earning a bonus in the current period is negatively correlated with turnover, holding the wage increase for the current period and the bonus earned in the previous period constant; (iv) the size of a bonus payment for the current period is negatively correlated with turnover, holding the wage increase for the current period and the bonus earned in the previous period constant; (v) the wage increase for the current period is negatively correlated with turnover, holding bonuses paid in the current period and those paid in the previous period constant.To test the implications of the model, I use the dataset initially analyzed byBaker, Gibbs, Holmstrom, 1994a,Baker, Gibbs, Holmstrom, 1994b.5Several features of this dataset render it appropriate for the current analysis. First, consistent with the theoretical model, bonuses are discretionary in the sense that the firm does not sign a formal contract that ties bonus payments to the worker’s performance.6Second, the dataset includes information about hierarchical levels, so that promotions can be observed. Finally, it also provides performance ratings submitted by the workers’ supervisors. As discussed in detail below, even though performance ratings are based on the subjective assessments of supervisors, they provide information regarding worker performance and thus are useful for testing the theory.The empirical analysis provides support for the model’s testable implications. Consistent with the first two implications, bonuses are positively related to wage increases and promotions in the ensuing periods. The results show that a worker is more likely to receive a wage increase if the worker earned a bonus either in the current year or in the previous year. In addition, earning a bonus is associated with a higher wage increase. The same results also hold for bonus size. That is, earning a larger bonus is associated both with a higher likelihood of receiving a wage increase and with higher wage increases. Finally, bonuses are associated with a greater likelihood of earning a promotion even though the effect of bonuses earned in the previous year is weaker than the effect of bonus payments for the current year.To test the model’s predictions of how pay variables are related to turnover, I estimate regressions in which variables concerning bonuses and wage increase are used, in addition to a set of control variables, to predict turnover. The results are consistent with the theory indicating that both earning a bonus and the size of the bonus earned in the current year are negatively correlated with turnover even after controlling for wage increase, performance ratings and workerfixed effects. The results concerning bonuses earned in the previous year are mixed. Consistent with the theory, these coefficients are negative but their statistical significance depends on which control variables are included. Specifically, the effect of earning a bonus in the previous year on turnover is statistically significant either when performance ratings are not included or when they are included along with worker fixed effects. A similar pattern is observed for the size of the bonus earned in the previous year. Finally, the results also provide support for the fifth prediction: holding the bonuses earned in the current year and those in the previous year constant, the wage increase received in the current year has a negative and significant effect on turnover.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.Section 2discusses the related work in the literature.Section 3presents the theoretical framework, in which I present the model setup, derive the equilibrium behavior and then discuss the testable implications.Section 4presents the empirical analysis.

"1. IntroductionDuring the last couple of decades, a number of western economies have implementedlabor market reformsthat directly or indirectly (through decreasing complementary institutions, seeChecchi and Lucifora, 2002) were targeted at affecting unionization costs. Examples for these actions are Right-to-work laws in some states in the US, the ‘Tarifeinheitsgesetz’ in Germany (which only allows the largest union in a firm to set the wage) or the ban on closed shop unions in the UK in the late 1980s. Changes in those institutional arrangements (implicitly) influence unionization costs by setting (or changing) the legal framework under which unionization takes place.A primary motivation for implementing these policies is the notion that with higher costs, workers refrain from forming a union.1De-unionization thenlowers wagesand improves the labor market allocation and hence welfare. This argument, however, may be misguided for at least two reasons. First, the union will adjust its wage setting strategy in light of the new institutional framework. There may be situations in which workers refrain from forming a union, but still existing unions will increase wage demands to make up for the higher costs they (implicitly or explicitly) have to bear. When or whether this will happen remains an open question. Second, not only does the unions’ behavior change, but the behavior of active and prospective firms changes as well. If the policy, for example, leads to de-unionization and lowers wages, firms with less productive technologies might be induced to enter the market. This is basically the ’Scandinavian’ argument that higher unionization drives inefficient firms out of the market (seeAgell and Lommerud, 1993). But it also affects the decisions of already active firms, because the composition of theindustryin unionized and non-unionized firms changes. Again, the induced effect of the change in unionization costs remains largely unexplored.There exist numerous theoretical studies on how unions and union wage bargaining affect the economy. Those range from very early contributions within neoclassicallabor market models(for exampleOswald, 1982) to more recent contributions such asKrusell and Rudanko (2016)who analyze the effects of unionization in a labor market that is characterized by search frictions. We deliberately do not add to this literature. The aim of our paper is to analyze the allocative effects of changes in unionization costs when taking the extensive margins of firm and union formation into account. We thereby provide a more comprehensive understanding of how policies that aim at increasing unionization costs affect the productivity distribution of firms, wageinequalityand welfare.To this end, we set up a model where firms are heterogeneous in productivity, operate under conditions ofmonopolistic competitionand face market entry as well as fixed production costs (seeMelitz, 2003). Given the expected structure of the industry, firms not only decide on how much to produce, but also whether to enter the industry. Unions act at the firm-level as wage setting monopsonists and face unionization costs (seeBreda, 2015,Kuhn, 1998).2Workers only form a union and delegate wage setting power to it if the (expected) acquired rent is at least as high as individual (i.e. average) unionization costs. If workers refrain from forming a union, the firm pays the competitive wage.We derive the equilibrium allocation under a set of simplifying assumptions, which helps us finding closed form solutions. First, we assume productivities to be Pareto distributed (Axtell, 2001,Helpman, Melitz, Yeaple, 2004). Second, we assume that consumer preferences are quasi-linear to disentangle income effects from firm-selection effects (Chor, 2009,Cole, Davies, 2011, among others). Third, we assume that marginal and average unionization costs are constant.3In equilibrium, the distribution of unionization is endogenous. Low-productivity firms are not unionized. Profits that could be captured by wage setting are too low to cover unionization costs and workers refrain from forming a union. Firms with intermediate productivity levels are unionized. When setting the wage in these firms, the union follows a limit wage strategy, which implies setting a wage that leaves the firm with zero profits. This is optimal, because the utility maximizing unconstrained wage would lead to negative profits implying that firms exit the market, leaving the union with zero utility. For high-productivity firms, the union sets the unconstrained wage.4The equilibrium productivity distribution is driven by the firm’s decision to enter the market, i.e. to incur entry costs, and by the firm’s decision to produce conditional on the productivity that has been drawn. As long as the firm’s expected profit exceeds entry costs, it enters the market. If, in addition, operating profits were positive, it would start production. The free entry and zero profit conditions then determine the cutoff productivity, which not only determines the lower productivity bound, but also the average productivity in the industry.We show that an increase in unionization costs has two countervailing effects on the productivity distribution in the economy. First, unions will increase their wage demands to make up for the cost increase if this is possible without driving active firms out of the market. This will be the case for high productivity firms. These firms have then to pay higher wages, charge higher prices and cut back on production. This increases the incentive to enter the market, because competition from these high-productivity firms is weakened. Simultaneously, some firms are freed from unionization, because the accruable profits in these firms are lower than the unionization costs. Workers do not form a union and the wage declines to competitive levels. This decreases the incentive to enter the market, because competition becomes more fierce.For low levels of unionization costs (which translates into a high degree of unionization), the first effect dominates and vice versa. The relation between unionization (costs) and (average) productivity is U-shaped. With unionization costs initially very low, the fraction of firms that pay the unconstrained wage is large and that of the limiting wage paying firms is low. Then a large fraction of firms face the wage increase caused by higher unionization costs, implying that the incentive for market entry dominates.By the same token, we can show that the relation between unionization costs and wage inequality (as measured by the Gini coefficient) is hump-shaped. The intuition again is that with higher unionization costs, workers in high-productivity firms enjoy wage increases, whereas those in low- and intermediate-productivity firms face wage decreases due to de-unionization. The first effect dominates for low levels of unionization costs and vice versa. Concerning welfare, we show that the relation between unionization costs and welfare is U-shaped. First, because income equals the value of the economy’s endowment, i.e. the value of labor endowment and the right to form unions, income monotonously declines if unionization costs increase. Second, if unionization costs are low, the reduced cutoff productivity implies that firms are, on average, less productive, which raises the price index and thus reduces consumption. Only if unionization costs are sufficiently high, a welfare-enhancing effect of lower unionization exists due to the increase in cutoff productivity and the reduction of the price index.Our paper adds to the literature on unionization costs and endogenous unionization. A focus in this literature is the strategic effect in forming a union either on the side of workers in the light of free-riding (seeBooth, 1985orBooth and Chatterji, 1995), or on the side of the firm by the means of management opposition against union formation (seeCorneo, 1995) or strategic hiring to prevent unionization (seeTaschereau-Dumouchel, 2017). We abstain from these strategic considerations to isolate the ’pure’ effect of union formation on the wage structure, productivity and firm entry. In this respect, the paper byKuhn (1988)is closest to what we consider. He analyzes ageneral equilibriummodel ofoccupational choicewhere heterogeneous households choose to become entrepreneurs or workers. Union formation then distorts thisoccupational decision. We complement his analysis by taking the various fixed cost margins, which entrepreneurs face and which affect their market entry and production decisions, directly into account. With this, we get a more detailed picture of how unionization costs affect the productivity distribution of firms and how it changes the wage distribution as well as welfare.We also contribute to the strand of literature that deals with the relationship between wage inequality and (de-)unionization. Empirically, there is strong evidence that the decline in unionization causes wage inequality to rise (seeAddison, Bailey, Stanley Siebert, 2007,Dustmann, Ludsteck, Schönberg, 2009,Machin, 1997). The most common explanation for this result is the compression effect of unions, i.e. the wage dispersion across individuals with similarskill levelsis lower undercollective bargaining(seeAcemoglu, Aghion, Violante, 2001,Açıkgöz, Kaymak, 2014,Card, Lemieux, Riddell, 2004). As unionization rates decline, the compression effect has become weaker, with negative consequences for the wage distribution. Our paper introduces a further theoretical explanation by showing that an increase in unionization costs increases wage inequality because (a) the distribution of active firms changes and (b) still remaining unions adapt their wage strategies.As unionization costs have an impact on firm-selection, our paper also identifies a new mechanism through which a link between unionization and the productivity distribution is created. There are some other studies that find explanations for this phenomenon.Braun (2011)andde Pinto (2019)show that average productivity depends on the level under which bargaining takes place. Industry unions imply more intense firm-selection than firm-level unions.Montagna and Nocco (2013)analyze the effects of an increase in thebargaining poweron firm-selection if wages are productivity-specific.Montagna and Nocco (2015)also investigate these effects but assume that bargaining power differs across countries. Both studies find that average productivity unambiguously declines if unions become more powerful. This is in contrast to our study where the relationship between unionization costs and average productivity is U-shaped. A variation of the bargaining power is thus not tantamount to a change of unionization costs.Our paper is also related to the literature on de-unionization. A focus of this literature is to reconcile the observed decrease of unionization and the occurrence of skill-biased technological change. One argument is that skill-biased technological change raises the implicit costs of high-skilled labor to remain unionized, see, for example,Acemoglu et al. (2001)orAçıkgöz and Kaymak (2014). In contrast,Dinlersoz and Greenwood (2016)consider a situation in which only low-skilled labor is unionized, but where skill-biased technological change affects the labor (and capital) demand decision of firms, which then affects the choice of the union concerning the wage setting and which firms to target. Technological change may then result in de-unionization because it changes the union’s trade-off favoring higher wages over more firms being unionized. Our set-up is conceptually close to this paper, although we do not consider a dynamic model, but allow for monopolistic competition and firm entry. The main difference, however, is that we analyze and stress the comparative static effects of policy measures that influence unionization costs and do not directly explain the evolution of de-unionization.The remainder of our paper is structured as follows. InSection 2, we lay out the basic environment of our model and describe the timing of events. The partial equilibrium is determined inSection 3, while the general equilibrium is described inSection 4. The impact of unionization costs on productivity, welfare and wage inequality is investigated inSection 5, where we present an analytical approach and a numerical example. InSection 6, we discuss the robustness of our model.Section 7concludes.",Marco,Jörg,None
"1. IntroductionThe global financial crisis, although it emerged in the USsubprime mortgagemarket, has induced harsh worldwidespillover effectsto the real economy. One of the short-run consequences of such an abrupt downturn was a 19.1% increase in global unemployment in 2009 with respect to 2007 (International Labour Office, 2010). In the same period, the Euro Area (EA) unemployment raised by only 2 percentage points (Pissarides, 2013). However, the major EA economic turmoil had yet to begin. The outbreak of the sovereign debt crisis has forced peripheral EA countries (especially Greece, Ireland, Spain, and Portugal) to request financial assistance packages from the troika. These heavily indebted countries had to implement severeausteritymeasures to correct for their fiscal imbalances, which in turn triggered high and persistent unemployment (Dias, 2017,Lane, 2012,Lucarelli, 2011). In March 2013, the EA unemployment rate reached 12.1%, its highest level since EA inception. This led the European institutions to identify market labour disequilibrium as an obstacle to efficientmonetary policytransmission mechanism and a driver of high adjustment costs due to idiosyncratic shocks such asGreat Recessionor the sovereign debt crisis. In a recent paper,Krištić et al. (2018)found evidence of a certain degree of unemploymenthysteresisin the EA countries.In the crisis aftermath, most economic indicators started to pick up and the EA headed towards a slow and steady expansion. However, since the beginning of 2015, the labour market has experienced imbalances. Although official unemployment figures have not significantly changed, immigration pressure has influenced agents’ unemployment expectations (European Commission, 2018). This background has led us to analyse the effect of news on consumer unemployment expectations.We add to the literature in four specific aspects. First, we aim at designing a survey-based unemployment sentiment indicator (USI). While macroeconomists have long ago used survey data to build confidence indicators, these are mostly designed to track households’ financial decisions (Białowolski, 2019) ormacroeconomicaggregates such asinflationor economic growth (Batchelor, 1982,Hansson et al., 2005). The construction of unemployment expectations indexes seems to be quite neglected in the literature.Hutter and Weber (2015)andClaveria (2019)are among the very few existing studies addressing this issue. We use qualitative survey data from the Consumer survey conducted by the European Commission (EC) to compute households’ expectations and design a consumer USI.Consumer surveys ask respondents about a very wide set of economic issues ranging from their spending intentions to thegeneral economicsituation influencing those decisions. The EC builds upon this abundance of survey data and constructs a set of widely utilized survey-based indicators by choosing particular survey questions and weighting their respective response balances (Sorić et al., 2016). We use an assumption-free approach based on empirical modelling to inspect whether the information content of the survey mostly reflects consumers’ perceptions about the past or their future expectations. We followClaveria et al. (2017)approach to quantify qualitative survey data on the direction of change. This data-driven procedure based on evolutionary computation allows us to find the combination of survey questions that best tracks unemployment rates. Evolutionary computation can be regarded as a subfield of artificial intelligence, and is being increasingly applied to automated problem-solving in economics (Álvarez-Díaz, 2019,Claveria et al., 2019a,Claveria et al., 2019b).Some of the features of empirical modelling are particularly indicated to deal with the problem at hand. On the one hand, this approach is especially suitable for finding patterns in large data sets with little or no prior information about the system. On the other hand, empirical modelling allows to simultaneously evolve both the structure and the parameters of the models without imposing any assumptions regarding agents’ expectations. In this study we apply ametaheuristicbased on symbolic regression (SR) via genetic programming (GP). This modelling approach is characterised by the implementation of evolutionary algorithms for the search of the space of mathematical expressions that best fit a given dataset. SeeDabhi and Chaudhary, 2015,O'Neill et al., 2010,Poli et al., 2010, andWhite et al. (2013)for a detailed review of the main issues of GP.Empirical studies of this sort mostly resort to quantifying population-wide consumer sentiment or expectations (Manski, 2018). However, even the early empirical studies (Zagórski and McDonnell, 1995), as well as the more recent ones (Sorić and Čižmešija, 2013,Easaw et al., 2013,Toussaint-Comeau and McGranahan, 2006) have shown that economic sentiment is remarkably heterogeneous across socio-economic or socio-demographic groups. We consider the observed heterogeneity by segregating the data provided by the EC consumer survey into strata according to age, income, education, gender, and occupation. For each consumer category within individual stratification variables, we apply GP and calculate a group-specific USI and assess its out-of-sample forecasting performance. The purpose of this empirical strategy is to scrutinize whether socio-demographics indeed do play a role in governing consumers’ unemployment sentiment.Finally, our last contribution stems from a more recent line of research, investigating how agents respond to economic news (Nguyen and Claus, 2013). We measure the reactions of consumer unemployment sentiment to various economic news at a disaggregate level, taking into account each individual socio-demographic group. This approach allows us to test for possible asymmetries in consumers’ reaction to positive and negative news, building upon the renowned prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979).The structure of the paper is as follows. The next section reviews the existing literature. InSection 3we present the methodological approach, describing the data and the experimental set-up. Empirical results are provided inSection 4. Finally, the discussion and conclusions are drawn inSection 5.",Petar,Ivana,Oscar
"1. IntroductionA common finding in the empirical literature on unemployment insurance (UI) is a notable increase in the number of people leaving unemployment around the time of benefit exhaustion (see surveys byCard et al., 2007a, andBoone and van Ours, 2012). The spike in the exit rate from benefit receipt or from registered unemployment is typically more pronounced than the spike in the job finding rate. The latter spike can be viewed as evidence of the distortionary effect of UI as it suggests that some unemployed wait until their benefits expire before they return to work (Card et al., 2007b). Therefore, themagnitudeof the spike in the job finding hazard is of particular importance. Moreover, also theshapeof the hazard around that point — how the job finding hazard evolves before and after benefit exhaustion — provides valuable information to differentiate between competing theoretical models of the behavior of unemployed workers and employers.Standard job search models have difficulties in explaining the spike in the job finding hazard (e.g.Mortensen, 1977). These models predict an increasing pattern for the hazard rate at the end of the entitlement period, but they do not explain why the hazard rate drops after benefit exhaustion.Boone and van Ours (2012)develop a search model with storable job offers where job applicants and firms can agree on a delay in job starting, leading to a sharp spike at the time of benefit exhaustion. Their study was motivated by an observation that the job finding rate increases sharply only in the last month of benefit eligibility in the Slovenian data.DellaVigna et al. (2017)propose an alternative search model with reference-dependent preferences where unemployed workers reduce their search effort after benefit exhaustion once they get used to the lower income level.1In this model, the job finding rate increases in anticipation of the drop in income and declines smoothly after the benefit decline. They show that the model can explain the smooth declining pattern of the job finding hazard after the benefit cuts in Hungary. These and other models that could explain the spike in the job finding hazard at benefit exhaustion can have quite different policy implications for UI design. The reference-dependent model, for example, suggests that a UI scheme with multiple benefit cuts over the course of the unemployment spell might be advantageous.Several studies have provided evidence on the evolution of the hazard rates around the time of benefit exhaustion (often as a by-product of the analysis of policy effects on unemployment duration).Card, Chetty, Weber, 2007a,Card, Chetty, Weber, 2007breview earlier empirical evidence and conclude that studies using administrative register data have found little evidence of notable increases in the job finding rate at benefit exhaustion. They also provide new results for Austria and find a large spike in the exit rate of registered unemployment but only a modest spike in the job finding rate. However, some recent studies, such asvan Ours and Vodopivec (2006),Boone and van Ours (2012),Røed and Westlie (2012),Geerdsen et al. (2017)andDellaVigna et al. (2017), present evidence of much larger increases in the job finding rate close to benefit exhaustion in other countries.We argue that, in many applications, difficulties in measuring the time to benefit exhaustion are likely to lead to poor estimates of the hazard rates around the time of benefit exhaustion, which can lead to misleading conclusions. These difficulties arise from certain common institutional features and due to the fact that direct information on benefit eligibility over the course of unemployment spells is rarely available.In this study, we analyze the shapes of the hazard rates around benefit exhaustion using matched register data on 770,000 unemployment spells in the Finnish labor market. An exceptional feature of our data is that we can measure accurately the length of the remaining entitlement period over the course of the unemployment spell. This is important because the benefit entitlement may not elapse during labor market training programs, which are commonly counted as part of the unemployment spell, and because the benefit entitlement elapses at a reduced rate when the benefit level is temporarily lowered due to earnings from marginal employment. As a result, the maximum number of days on UI benefits (and equivalent benefits) can exceed the maximum duration of UI benefits, which is defined for full-time unemployment, and the difference in the length of these two periods varies across individuals. These institutional features are not specific to Finland but apply to many other countries as well.2A consequence is that the commonly used duration measures, such as the time spent on benefits, the duration of registered unemployment, and non-employment duration, do not coincide with the elapsed time of benefit entitlement for a non-negligible share of UI recipients. If the measurement problem in benefit duration is ignored, the increase of the hazard rates at benefit exhaustion will be underestimated and the level of the hazard rates following benefit exhaustion will be overestimated.In our data, the biased results based on the time spent on benefits imply an increase of about 100% in the job finding hazard in the last week of benefit eligibility, with no evidence of changes in the hazard rate before or after that spike. However, when the time to benefit exhaustion is accurately measured using detailed UI records, the job finding rate peaks sharply in the last week of benefit eligibility (an increase of about 280%), after which it drops immediately below the level preceding the increase at the end of the entitlement period. Our results on the shape of the job finding rate around the exhaustion day are more in line with the predictions of the search model with storable job offers than with the predictions of the reference-dependent model. However, we do not find evidence that the average duration of the jobs starting at the end of the entitlement period would be particularly long, as predicted by the model with storable job offers.A key lesson of our analysis is that the estimates of the hazard rates close to benefit exhaustion based only on unemployment duration data should be interpreted with some caution. If one wishes to draw conclusions (e.g. about the distortionary effects of UI or the relevance of theoretical models) from the shape of the hazard rates, additional data on remaining benefit eligibility at different stages of the unemployment spell may be needed. If such data are not available, one should pay great attention to the treatment of training program participants, part-time unemployed and possibly other groups whose benefit entitlement may elapse at a reduced rate.The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. The next section describes the Finnish UI scheme.Section 3describes the data and sample restrictions.Section 4presents the empirical findings. The final section concludes.",Tomi,Hanna,Jouko
"1. IntroductionSickness insuranceincreases the utility for the working population through risk-sharing, which allows for intertemporal consumption smoothing. However, as sickness in many cases are difficult to verify, the policymaker faces the problem of balancing the benefits associated with a generous insurance program with thedisincentiveeffects of the same program. This requires knowledge of both the beneficial effects and how people respond to incentives within respective program. While there is strong empirical evidence of rather substantial effects of economic incentives on short-termsickness absence(e.g.,Aaviksoo, Kiivet, 2016,De Paola, Scoppa, Pupo, 2014,Johansson, Palme, 2002,Johansson, Palme, 2005,Pettersson-Lidbom, Thoursie, 2013,Puhani, Sonderhof, 2010,Ziebarth, Karlsson, 2010,Ziebarth, Karlsson, 2014), the evidence on how economic incentives affect absence behavior among long-term sickness absentees are both much scarcer and less coherent. For example,Ziebarth (2013)report that moral hazard is unlikely to be of any greater importance among long-term sickness absentees, whileMarkussen et al. (2011)report that absence behavior among long-term sickness absentees is substantially affected by economic incentives. Generally, one might expect a weaker behavioral response to economic incentives among long-term sickness absentees because these individuals are more likely to have a reduced work capacity that leaves little room for such adjustments. However, the estimates of such behavioral responses could potentially also be diluted by counteractive (unintended) dynamic incentives. For example, costs associated with entering the insurance program – e.g., waiting periods, lower short-term replacement rates, and lengthy screening processes – will provide not only (intended) economic disincentives to report sick but also (unintended) incentives to remain absent among those who have already become absent. If these costs are high enough relative to the (effective) replacement rate,1and if there is imperfect screening of program eligibility, a forward-looking individual might choose to stay absent beyond what is actually necessary.2,3Such responses to dynamic incentives can be referred to as “forward-looking moral hazard”.4In this study, we test empirically for the presence of forward-looking moral hazard in sickness insurance (SI) by exploiting a 1991 reform of the Swedish SI program. For long-term sickness absentees the reform unintendedly introduced dynamic disincentives to (return to) work: The replacement rate for short- and medium-term absences was reduced from 90% of foregone earnings to 65 and 80%, respectively. Meanwhile, the replacement rate for longer absences remained unchanged at 90% of foregone earnings. Hence, the return to work was now associated with a potential future cost of re-entering the insurance program. That is, long-term absentees received 90% of foregone earnings while remaining absent from work, but after having returned to work they would have received only 65% in case of a relapse that required a new absence. Forward-looking moral hazard implies that long-term sickness absentees (on average) would respond to the potential future cost of returning to work by prolonging their current absence.This study is related to two different fields of research. First, it is related to the scarce and inconclusive literature on the responsiveness to economic incentives among long-term sickness absentees. Only three studies have investigated how long-term sickness absence is related to the replacement rate for such absence. These three studies report rather different findings: On the one hand, in Norway, bothNordberg and Røed (2009)andMarkussen et al. (2011)report substantial increases in return-to-work when approaching the one-year limit in the SI program, when absentees are transferred from a sickness benefit with a replacement rate of 100% to a rehabilitation benefit with a replacement rate of 66%.5On the other hand, in Germany,Ziebarth (2013)report that reducing the replacement rate from 80% to 70% for long-term absence affected neither the incidence nor the duration of long-term sickness absence. A few studies have investigated how changes in the waiting period or the replacement rate for short-term absences affect long-term absence decisions. The findings from these studies are also mixed:Ziebarth, Karlsson, 2010,Ziebarth, Karlsson, 2014andAaviksoo and Kiivet (2016), report no or negligible impact on longer-term sickness absence, whileJohansson and Palme (2005),Pettersson-Lidbom and Thoursie (2013),De Paola et al. (2014)andPollak (2017)report that individuals seem to prolong (shorten) their sickness absence as a consequence of the increased (reduced) costs of short-term absence.Obviously, these latter studies acknowledge that for long-term sickness absentees the changes in the replacement rate for short-term absences (or waiting period) affected the expected, or potential future, cost of returning to work. Their findings also suggest that long-term sickness absentees are indeed forward-looking. Importantly, however, increasing the direct costs of short-term absence would also affect the composition of the population of long-term absentees through dynamic selection (i.e., the population of long-term absentees would be more negatively selected on health),6which would generate patterns of long-term sickness absence that are similar to those generated by forward-looking moral hazard. Thus, the identification of the forward-looking effect of a change in the potential future costs of returning to work is exceedingly difficult, because in most situations policies would simultaneously affect the direct cost of either short- or long-term absence. None of the previous studies cited above – includingJohansson and Palme (2005)that investigated the same 1991 reform – have separated the effect of a change in the potential future cost of returning to work from the effect of a change in the direct cost of absence and from the compositional effect through dynamic selection. The novelty of the present study is that we exploit that for long-term sickness absentees the 1991 reform (i) introduced a potential future cost of returning to work without affecting the direct cost of (long-term) absence, and (ii) did not apply to ongoing absences, to ensure that the estimate of the effect of the potential future cost of returning to work is not contaminated by an effect of a change in the direct cost of (long-term) absence and allows us to avoid any compositional effects from dynamic selection. Hence, we can (arguably) estimate the causal effect of the potential future cost of returning to work.7Second, the present study is also related to a growing literature on the empirical testing for forward-looking behavior. This field mainly concerns consumer demand in various contexts. Most of these studies have found evidence of forward-looking behavior (e.g.,Alpert, 2016,Aron-Dine, Einav, Finkelstein, Cullen, 2015,Chevalier, Goolsbee, 2009,Einav, Finkelstein, Schrimpf, 2015,Gruber, Kszegi, 2001,Kaplan, Zhang, 2017,Pierani, Tiezzi, 2011,Tiezzi, 2005), while others report results that are supportive of myopia (e.g.,Abaluck, Gruber, Swanson, 2015,Dalton, Gowrisankaran, Town, 2015,Long, Marquis, Rodgers, 1998). Most closely related to this study isAutor et al. (2014)that investigated dynamic incentives in a private long-term disability insurance (DI) program in the U.S. They report that workers seem to account for the expected duration of their disability in their decision on whether to seek benefits for impairments, suggesting that disabled workers are forward-looking.8Our contribution is threefold: First, we provide the first causal evidence of forward-looking moral hazard in sickness insurance. Second, we add to the sparse literature on how absence behavior among long-term sickness absentees respond to economic incentives in general. Third, we add to the literature on the empirical testing for forward-looking behavior. We find that the potential future cost of returning to work, which was introduced by the reform through the reduction of the replacement rate for shorter-term absence, causally decreased the transition back to work among long-term sickness absentees. This finding suggests that long-term sickness absentees not only respond to economic incentives but they are indeed forward-looking. Placebo and sensitivity analyses support our claim of a causal interpretation. Heterogeneity analyses also suggest that individuals who were likely to have a higher perceived risk of relapse were more likely to prolong their current absence.The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we describe the Swedish SI program, the 1991 reform, and themacroeconomicenvironment at the time. InSection 3, we explain the empirical strategy and the choice of reform cohort (i.e., study group) and comparison cohort (i.e., control group). InSection 4, we describe the administrative register data covering the entire Swedish working-age population. We present the results, including placebo, sensitivity, and subgroup analyses, and an assessment of dynamic selection inSection 5. Finally,Section 6concludes.",Marcus,Per,Martin
"1. Introduction“If I were giving a young man advice as to how he might succeed in life, I would say to him, pick a good father and mother, and begin life in Ohio.” [Wilbur Wright, 1910]In reality, someone who aspires to succeed never has the option of choosing the environment he or she is born into; however, a positive environment – both at home and in the largercommunity– may be crucial for a person’s lifelong success. At present, a century after Wilbur Wright’s advice, how true is it that being born to good parents will significantly improve the odds of success? Or is it now the case that good parents must also be rich and members of a specific social group.1Using a panel dataset, I address such questions for rural India.2Estimating mobility across generations for developing countries is fraught with challenges, three of which are addressed in this paper. First, in most developing countries, panel datasets with reliable measures of income are not available. As a result, analyses ofintergenerational mobilityfor developing countries often rely on cross-sectional datasets. These studies usually adopt a co-resident sample approach or predict a parent’s economic status based on limited information available during the offspring’s generation. Findings in the mobility literature suggest that these approaches could introduce bias in the IGE estimates.3I address this challenge for rural India by compiling a panel dataset that links fathers in the Human Development Profile of India (HDPI, 1994) with their sons in the Indian Human Development Survey (Desai et al., 2012). For a given father-son pair, father is the head of the household who is matched to a 16–22 year old son in the 1994 round, and then this son is re-surveyed 18 years later in the 2012 round. An advantage with the IHDS dataset is that it was not restricted to co-resident households. It followed split households and collected data even for sons who were not co-residing with their fathers in 2012.Second, a majority of the people in developing countries are self-employed in agriculture or business, which means that the commonly reported wage andsalaryincome in developing country surveys omits net earnings from these activities. In this paper, I address this issue by using detailed information on net household earnings from the HDPI-IHDS panel dataset which accounts for net earnings from over fifty income sources. However, this net earnings amount is reported only at the household level, which brings us to the third challenge. Working with household income requires scaling for household size. To this end, I use a scaling approach hailed as a best practice in the development literature (Deaton and Zaidi, 2002).Results from the benchmark model suggest that the OLS IGE estimate lies between 0.28 and 0.37. A higher IGE estimate reflects higher persistence in economic status across generations, and thus, lower intergenerational income mobility. Group-wise analysis finds that Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (SC/ST) as well as SC-ST-Muslim groups have higher within-group mobility when compared to the rest. The findings from the comparison across groups are rather dismal. The analysis finds that India’s progress in cross-group equality is positive but disappointingly slow. How slow is the slow rate of convergence? Ceteris paribus, if the speed of convergence stays the same, a 0.74 between-groups coefficient suggests that about seven generations will be needed to reduce the gap between groups to 10% of what it was in 1994. The slow convergence rate is also comparable to the high black-white between-groups coefficient found for the US (Hertz, 2008,Margo, 2016).The findings from this paper contribute to the recent literature that estimates income mobility for India. In particular, this paper relates to two recent studies. First, focusing on intergenerational income mobility for the historically disadvantaged castes and tribes in India, (Hnatkovska et al., 2013) find an IGE estimate of 0.55 for SC/ST households and 0.61 for non-SC/ST households. Noting that “panel studies on individual households are not widely available in India,” the authors use the successive rounds of the National Sample Survey – an Indian cross-sectional dataset. Besides using a panel dataset, the current study is able to update the findings inHnatkovska et al. (2013)for at least three reasons: it does not restrict the sample to co-resident households, it does not use reported earnings of father and son from the same year, and it uses a comprehensive measure of annual income which is arguably a better proxy for long-term income than the reported wage and salary income from the previous week. Next, the current analysis is also related toHnatkovska et al. (2012). The authors find that, during 1983 and 2004-05, the rate of convergence between SC/STs and non-SC/STs was positive. However, their analysis is silent on the pace of convergence. Using the same dataset, I show that the rate of convergence is indeed positivebutremarkably slow.The current study also contributes to the broader literature that estimates income mobility for developing countries. As discussed above, analyses focusing on developing countries pose many challenges. The current study examines a few methodological challenges and adopts appropriate strategies to address them. For example, the structure of households in most developing countries is such that multiple adult members besides parents contribute to the household income, and given the prevalence of farming and other informal occupations, it is often very difficult to isolate the contribution of individual members from the total household income. Furthermore, it may not even be desirable to isolate an individual member’s contribution as the expenditure shares of household members may not be proportionate to their income contributions. I address this and many such crucial issues for the case of rural India. Lessons can be learned from this study for future studies of intergenerational income mobility in developing countries.Finally, the findings from group-wise analysis contribute to the raging debate surrounding India’s affirmative action policies fordisadvantaged groups. These policies have been in place for more than sixty years, and in many regions they fill up as much as half of the available positions in educational institutions and public sector jobs. Going beyond the usual discourse onpovertyrates and the need for affirmative action, the current study posits that we also need to think about equitable access to opportunities and assess the shortcomings in the existing affirmative action policy resulting in the slow cross-group rate of convergence.The remaining paper is organized as follows. InSection 2, I present evidence of intergenerational mobility from other developing countries.Section 3describes the data. IGE estimates for rural India are presented inSection 4. IGE estimates by socio-economic groups are presented inSection 5. InSection 6, I present various robustness exercises. Finally,Section 7discusses the main findings.",A.R.,None,None
"1. IntroductionWorkers with irregular or on-callwork schedulesconstitute up to 17% of the workforce in the US. Such irregular schedules are common throughout a wide spectrum of occupations.1For instance, in health care, nurses and doctors may work day shifts in the beginning of the week, followed by night shifts at the end of the week. Moreover, many other jobs include “on-call” responsibilities, where employees check into work when summoned, typically due to fluctuating special events or peak hours, and often times these workers are given little notice in advance.2Students in higher education also frequently face irregular starts times across weekdays since courses are often divided into Monday/Wednesday/Friday and Tuesday/Thursday blocks.A likely consequence of an irregular work or school schedule is an irregular sleep schedule. While many studies have investigated the impacts ofsleep durationon various outcomes3, more recent studies have considered the impacts ofsleep regularity. Sleep duration is simply the total amount of daily sleep one receives, while sleep regularity is the variation in the amount of sleep one receives across days, as determined by the consistency of the individual’s sleep and wake times.4Prior studies, mostly from the physiology literature, have documented correlations between sleep regularity and numerous outcomes, including worker productivity (Åkerstedt, 2003,Ferri, Guadi, Marcheselli, Balduzzi, Magnani, Di Lorenzo, 2016), job satisfaction, chronic fatigue, and cardiovascular symptoms (Ferri et al., 2016), obesity (Spruyt et al., 2011), and behavioral and emotional stability (Pesonen et al., 2010). Overall, individuals who have irregular sleep schedules tend to experience negative health outcomes and to be less productive.Irregular work and school schedules may adversely impact individuals through channels other than sleep as well. For example, theEconomic Policy Institute (2015)documents correlations between irregular work schedules and work-family conflict and stress. Irregular schedules likely also interact with “time-of-day” effects, where worker and student productivity are tied to the interaction between (a) the type of task being done and (b) what time-of-day the task is done. For instance,Pope (2015)documents how, holding start time constant, students tend to be more productive in the morning, and schools can improve learning by moving math (a time-of-day-sensitive course) to the morning and other classes, like English, into the afternoon. Relatedly, a popular literature has investigated the circadian rhythm, a 24-h internal clock that cycles the body between sleepiness and alertness at regular intervals throughout the day; for instance, most adults experience a dip in energy between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. Given sleep irregularity adversely impacts the circadian rhythm, schedule regularity (conditional on sleep) may interact with circadian cycles as well.5A notable shortcoming from the prior literature is the absence of an identification of a causal channel between schedule regularity and outcomes. It is inherently difficult to generate exogenous variation in individual schedule regularity, as it would require variation in start times both (i) within individuals and across days, and (ii) across individuals. Namely, one would need to compare individuals who (exogenously) experience inconsistent start times against those who start their days at the same time and (presumably) sleep the same amount every day. Prior studies have done these comparisons by using naturally occurring data i.e. by comparing individuals across ex-post various (sleep) schedules. An obvious likely pitfall from these comparisons is that schedule and sleep regularity are related to unobservable characteristics; for instance, it may be that individuals who opt into irregular schedules and engage in irregular sleep patterns tend to live unhealthier lifestyles, which itself is the true channel for their negative health outcomes.In this paper, we focus on the causal role of schedule regularity in an educational setting. In general, researchers and policymakers have increasingly been interested in the link between school start times and student success. Early studies documented a positive correlation between sleep duration and academic achievement (e.g.,Pagel, Forister, Kwiatkowki, 2007,Wahlstrom, 2002,Wolfson, Carskadon, 1998), while more recent studies have identified a causal link from delayed school start times to improvedstudent performance(Carrell, Maghakian, West, 2011,Edwards, 2012,Heissel, Norris, 2017). With regard to sleep regularity, studies have suggested it may be a stronger predictor than sleep duration in determining student success (Phillips, Clerx, OBrien, Sano, Barger, Picard, Lockley, Klerman, Czeisler, 2017,Smarr, 2015,Trockel, Barnes, Egget, 2000). In fact, in thePhillips et al. (2017)study, students who slept relatively little, but otherwise had a consistent sleep schedule, outperformed those who experienced, on average, higher levels of total sleep but with a higher variance in their amount of daily sleep. The discussions around these correlations have expanded to major media outlets, including CNN, USA Today, and the Independent.6,7Primary and secondary schools spanning 44 states have taken measures to delay start times. On a national level, the “ZZZ’s to A’s Act” was introduced in April 2017 to the US House of Representatives which calls on the US Secretary of Education to make policy recommendations related to the link between school start times and adolescent health, well-being, and performance.8,9A causal relationship between schedule regularity and student performance, if shown to exist, would have critical implications for policies related to school schedules. At the post-secondary level, students could improve their outcomes by selecting classes that grant them a consistent start time. At the secondary school level, “zero-periods”, where students attend an additional class before their regular school starts on particular weekdays, would have an especially detrimental effect on student performance since they harm both sleep duration and schedule regularity. Additionally, to help improve total hours of sleep, secondary schools often grant a “free-period” during a student’s first-period. While this could improve sleep duration, it may also impair sleep regularity, and thus have an overall adverse effect on student performance.10Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, given the physiological basis for the theory of how sleep influences outcomes, identifying a causal link would likely have implications for the aforementioned correlational studies on how sleep influences worker productivity and individual health outcomes.This paper is, to our knowledge, the first to identify the causal effects of schedule regularity on student performance. To do this, we utilize a setting where college students are randomly assigned to highly-varying course schedules during their first two semesters of enrollment. Some schedules have a consistently early/late start time across the week, while others have a high spread; start times could be as early as 6:30 a.m. or as late as 3:05 p.m. Our analysis, at its core, simply compares students randomly assigned to schedules with highly fluctuating daily start times against students who have relatively consistent late/early start times across the week. Our setting is particularly capable of identifying the causal effect of schedule regularity on student performance since previous studies, though occasionally equipped with random assignment, had little to no variation in school start times bothwithinstudents (across weekdays) andacrossstudents.Our analyses utilize data from a single large university in Vietnam. All incoming freshmen are randomly assigned to a schedule of courses for their first year based on their declared major. We have no reason to believe that students in this setting would be any more or less affected by school schedules than the typical student in the general population. This is especially true since the literature suggest the issues with student daytime fatigue are largely biological and are only conditional on the student’s gender and progression through adolescence (Heissel and Norris, 2017).11In our primary sample of freshmen, the average age was 18.3 years and 43.0% were female.Our primary dataset utilizes the entire population of over 165,000 student-classroom observations across a four year period (2011–2015) from the university. Like prior studies, we estimate boosts in students performance in response to a later school start time. In response to a one hour delay in start time, we precisely estimate a 1.4 percentage point reduction in the probability a student receives a zero in the course and a 0.022standard deviationincrease in class grade for morning classes.12When we consider the full sample of classes, thesetreatment effectsshrink closer to zero, suggesting that later start times had less effect on student performance in afternoon classes.13We do not find, however, evidence in support of a causal link between schedule regularity and student achievement. Students who are randomly assigned to school schedules with relatively consistent daily start times do not outperform their peers who are assigned highly-varying daily start times. These precisely estimated null treatment effects are consistent across a variety of specifications, including estimation of models with classroom and studentfixed effectsand various measures of spread of daily start times. In our preferred specification, we can rule out detrimental effects larger than 2.5% of a standard deviation on student performance in response to a one standard deviation increase in the spread of a student’s daily start times across the week.Following our initial results, in the spring of 2018, we conducted a large survey at the university asking students to report their course schedules and their average number of hours of sleep by weekday. Though results from this survey can merely provide suggestive evidence,14the purpose of the survey was to investigate whether and how randomly assigned schedules correlate with student sleep. In the context of null results for schedule regularity, the survey can help to understand whether schedules were actually impacting sleep in our setting. We find that on days with later school start times, students sleep more, and students with highly fluctuating start times across weekdays experience greater sleep irregularity (have a higher standard deviation of sleep hours across weekdays). We also find that students are more likely to attend class the later it is, and that a greater variation in schedule and sleep volatility is correlated with moreabsenteeism. Student academic satisfaction, however, is unrelated to improved sleep duration or sleep regularity.Altogether, while our findings reconfirm earlier studies that delayed start times positively influence student success, we find little importance for consistency in start times across the week. Our results directly suggest that schedule consistency is a relatively unimportant input in the human capital production process. Assuming the channel between schedules and sleep is causal, our results further imply that correlations identified by the prior literature in sleep regularity and outcomes may be driven by selection - individuals who choose irregular sleep schedules tend to be less productive or healthy.The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows.Section 2discusses the institutional features, data, and summary statistics.Section 3introduces oureconometricspecification and tests for randomization.Section 4presents our results.Section 5concludes.",Lester,Vasil,Phuc
"1. IntroductionIn parallel with extensive evidence of women havinglower wages, poorer job conditions, and being worse off in terms of discrimination, job content andpromotionopportunities, female workers are frequently found to have equal or higher levels of job satisfaction than men (e.g.Clark, 1997,Sousa-Poza and Sousa-Poza, 2003,Kaiser, 2007,Blanchflower et al., 1993). After numerous confirmations of this result, this empirical finding is now referred to as thegender-job satisfaction paradox.The aim of this paper is to contribute to this body of literature, along the avenue traced byClark (1997), by providingeconometricevidence that the existence and the extent of the paradox can be explained by exposure to gender unequal socio-economic settings. To this end, we use micro data from the special module on well-being of the 2013 EU-SILC in combination with various genderinequalitycountry-level indicators. The paper adds to the existing knowledge on the topic by: (i) providing extensive and recent cross-country evidence on the existence and size of the gender-job satisfaction paradox in Europe (32 countries, year 2013); (ii) estimating the paradox and its relationship with gender inequality indicators by means of econometric methods able to account for potential misspecification and comparability issues.Our results show that, once all observables are controlled for, higher exposure to gender-unequal settings in early stages of life corresponds to women's higher levels of reported job satisfaction. Such evidence is consistent with the idea that women's lower expectations of their job positions, shaped by growing up in gender unequal settings, might be at the root of the paradox. This interpretation is in line with the body of evidence showing thatcultureand institutions shape social norms, preferences and beliefs (Guiso et al., 2006,Tabellini, 2010,Lippmann et al., 2016) that, especially if formed during crucial developmental age, persistently affect individual behaviour (Alesina and Fuchs-Schundeln, 2007). We also show that, independently from the effect of unequal settings in early stages of life, employment in typically male occupations reverses the paradox (i.e., in male occupations women have lower job satisfaction), supposedly (in our interpretative framework) by enabling women to revise their beliefs and align expectations to those of men. Attaining higher levels of education, by contrast, does not play any direct role in the paradox.The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. In the next section we review and discuss the main existing studies on job satisfaction and the gender paradox. We elaborate in particular on the contributions that explain how women's expectations and preferences are shaped by gender inequality observed in the labour market and by beliefs in gender roles. InSection 3we describe the data, the empirical methods and the estimated levels of the job satisfaction gender gap across Europe. InSections 4and5we augment the empirical model in order to account for the effect of exposure to (current and past) gender equality/inequality settings on the job satisfaction paradox.Section 6summarizes and concludes.",Cristiano,Marko,None
"1. IntroductionImmigration is not a random process; rather, immigrant selection depends on the conditions in both the origin and destination countries. When Poland joined the European Union in 2004, Polish workers were allowed to migrate without policy restrictions to some European countries, including the United Kingdom. Germany, in contrast, opted for a 7-year transitional period before opening itsborders, so Polish migration was still partly regulated by stricter flow controls. Germany and the UK could be considered major destination countries for Polish emigrants, accounting for about 49 percent of the emigrant flow from Poland in 2007 (Dustmann et al., 2015). Given the importance of Polish emigration between 1998 and 2008, a better understanding of migrant selection is crucial because of its possible consequences, affecting both theinequalitylevel in sending countries and immigrantlabour market integrationin the destination countries.1The study of (unobservable) selection of migrants began withBorjas (1987)and was extended to the case of both observableandunobservable selection inBorjas (1991). TheBorjas (1987)model showed that if the return to skills is higher in the origin than in the destination country, the emigration probability is higher for lower skilled than for higher skilled workers, and vice versa. Individuals with below (above) average skills may benefit more from moving to a country with lower (higher) levels of inequality. The model implies that across-country inequality differentials affect emigrantskill levels.This paper examines the self-selection of emigrants from Poland within the EU, in particular those migrating to the United Kingdom and Germany between 1998 and 2008. I draw on a unique individual-level labour market dataset from Poland, which provides both pre-immigration labour market characteristics and final destination country, to present fresh evidence on the selection patterns across the two destination countries, and the factors that drive them. I use education to proxy observable skills, and I estimate unobservable factors based on residual wages from wage regressions for a sample of individuals, including both emigrants and those who stay. This information is used to provide an extensive description of the observable and unobservable skills of emigrants to both destination countries. I then test for the familiar predictions of theBorjas (1987)simple framework to understand the mechanism driving the described data patterns, using the same empirical strategy asGould and Moav (2016), and measure the role of across-country inequality. I estimate the probability to emigrate as a function of skills and of skill prices (proxies for inequality) in both source and destination countries. I determine the relative prices of education and residual wages, respectively, by calculating the difference in return to education and the inherent levels of residual inequality between the destination and source countries. The latter is measured by thestandard deviation, as inJuhn et al. (1993),Gould (2002)andGould and Moav (2016), and high residual wage inequality corresponds to high rewards to unobserved skills. Hence, whereas the relative skill prices explain differences in observable and unobservable composition between emigrants and non-emigrants, the average wage differences between destination and source countries explain the differences in the average probability of migrating to that country (a scale effect).Overall, my analysis makes a twofold contribution to the literature on migrant selection. Firstly, there is very little research focused on European migration, especially within the EU. Most of the literature has over-concentrated on Mexican migrants on their path to the U.S. Particularly valuable is my focus on a country not yet studied but which experienced high emigration rates over the period analysed. Differently fromBorjas et al. (2019)who focus on emigration from a rich EU country (Denmark), Poland is to be considered the largest emerging country within the European context. Before the 2004 accession, average monthly earnings were 4 times lower in Poland than the average in the EU15 countries2and, typical of transition economies, the country experienced large fluctuations in the unemployment rate, from 10 percent in 1998 to 19 percent in 2004, and back to 7 percent in 2008.3Simultaneously, the emigration rate increased from 0.5 percent to 2.17 percent (Dustmann et al., 2015), making Poland a very interesting case study. My second contribution broadens the scope of the emigrant selection literature by assessing, in a new scenario, the role of differential levels of inequality of both observable and unobservable skills as an economic incentive to migrate. I implement the empirical analysis ofGould and Moav (2016)for this case and extend it to the comparison of two destination countries, reviewing the role of migration policies as possible drivers of the observed outcomes. As argued byBorjas et al. (2019)there is a need for further evidence to improve the understanding of the role of residual wage inequality in determining emigrant selection. The literature has so far pointed out the importance of focusing not only on observable skills but also on unobservable skills, allowing for the possibility that individuals with identicaleducation levelshave different levels of unobservable skills (Borjas, Kauppinen, Poutvaara, 2019,Gould, Moav, 2016). The theoretical model is applicable only to individuals who are employed, nevertheless, my dataset allows me to analyze the characteristics of individuals who were unemployed before they emigrated. I therefore provide a novel contribution on the descriptives of this interesting sample, showing how employed and unemployed emigrants are very similar across most characteristics.I find that Polish emigrants to the UK are more similar to non-emigrants with regards to education, while Polish emigrants to Germany are disproportionately more likely to fall into the middle of the distribution of education. With regards to unobservable characteristics, Poles in the UK are negatively selected, while emigrants to Germany have no different residual wages than the underlying Polish population. These data patterns partially support the prediction of the model. In particular, I find that the probability to emigrate decrease with residual wages for emigrants to the UK, consistent with the evidence of higher residual inequality in Poland than in the UK. Yet, I observe that residual wages are not positively correlated with the probability to emigrate for emigrants to Germany, despite residual inequality being lower in Poland than in Germany. Finally, in no cases does the probability to emigrate decreases with education, a result the model would predict given the higher return to education in Poland versus the UK and Germany; however, this finding confirms most of the results on observable selection uncovered in the literature. FollowingGould and Moav (2016), I test the model further to check for systematic variation across occupation in the returns to both observable and unobservable skills that would bring more insights to the results, which are nevertheless confirmed also within occupation. I find in fact that the lower return to unobservable skills in the UK versus Poland, within occupational sectors, creates an incentive for Polish individuals with below-average residual wages to emigrate to the UK, while the higher unobservable returns in Germany versus Poland do not entice Poles with above-average residuals to leave. Finally, a higher return to education in the home country compared to the destination does not induce low-educated Poles to leave the country. This result confirms the findings ofGould and Moav (2016). Yet, I further contribute to the literature by taking an additional step and looking at the return to education of a different reference group in the destination country, the Polish immigrants. In this case, results are more supportive of the model predictions even within occupations.Additional implications of the Borjas model that are confirmed for the UK but not for Germany highlight the importance of other confounding factors (networks, migration policies, etc.) in defining migrant selection patterns. That is, existing networks, policies and visa requirements can interfere with the selection process by influencing both the size and characteristics of migration (Abramitzky, Boustan, Eriksson, 2012,Gould, Moav, 2016). For instance, after migration restrictions in the UK were abolished in May 2004, emigrants from Poland were free to work in the country without any extra requirements. Under these conditions, migration flows occurred solely as a consequence of individual economic decisions, while in Germany, selection was probably still driven by migration policies (see section below). Interestingly, these results may also imply that migration flows are determined by factors that remain unobserved by immigration officers but are crucial in defining migration quality and thus relevant for policy making (Bertoli et al., 2016). Therefore, the UK versus Germany comparison allows me to qualitatively compare selection in a situation with no barriers to migration, to one with a more policy-regulated scenario.The advantage of using pre-migration data is its ability to provide a full picture of the bases for emigrant selection. In fact, most studies that use pre-migration information designate unobservable skills and previous earnings as major components of the selection process. Indeed,Kaestner and Malamud (2013),Fernández-Huertas Moraga (2013), andAmbrosini and Peri (2012)all show that emigrants from Mexico fall into the middle of the education distribution but are more negatively selected in terms of earnings. This negative selection can partly be explained by differential returns to labour market skills: not only is a mere 5 percent of the earnings gap explainable by observable characteristics, but most selection happens on unobserved characteristics (Ambrosini and Peri 2012). In closely related work,Gould and Moav (2016), who use pre-migration labour market data for Israel to measure observable and unobservable selection for a set of emigrants assumed to move to the U.S., demonstrate that the emigration probability increases with education whereas unobservable skills exhibit an inverse U-shaped pattern. These authors thus claim that unobservable skills can be decomposed into general and country specific, and that above certain levels the benefits of migration decrease. Overall,Borjas et al. (2019)emphasize that any analysis of migrant earnings based on observable characteristics alone can understate the actual selection, because of the major role played by unobservable characteristics. To support this claim, they show that in a sample of emigrants to Denmark, more than half of the differences in expected earnings between movers and stayers can be ascribed to differences in unobserved characteristics.4Within the same context as my study (the EU), this most recent contribution studies migrant selection from a more egalitarian country to other European countries and to the United States. The empirical results are in fact in line with the predictions of the model, finding that the earnings distribution of emigrants stochastically dominates that of the individuals who stay in Denmark.5I contribute to the literature by demonstrating how the model predictions also apply to a less egalitarian country within the European Union, where unobservable characteristics also play a major role in selection.The remainder of my empirical investigation unfolds as follows:Section 2describes the migration policies in place in the two destination countries;Section 3introduces the data and presents the observed patterns of selection for the two destination countries;Sections 4and5investigate the possible mechanisms that could drive the observed patterns as well as giving an interpretation of the results and some extensions;Section 6concludes the paper.",Anna,None,None
