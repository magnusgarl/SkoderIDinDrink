Seater,,Male,Male,,Male,"Macroeconomists typically divide government economic activity into four broad classes: spending, taxation, deficits, and monetary policy. There is, however, a fifth class of activity that may well have important effects on economic activity but that nevertheless has received little attention in the macroeconomic literature: regulation. Although microeconomists have analyzed both the causes and effects of regulation for decades, macroeconomists have joined the discussion only much more recently, with a number of empirical studies suggesting that regulation has significant macroeconomic effects. Goff (1996) apparently was the pioneer, using factor analysis to construct a measure of total regulation in the United States and finding a type of Granger-causality effect of regulation on the path of output. Subsequently, development of several excellent sets of regulation data in cross-sections and panels of countries has led to many new studies of regulation’s economic impact; see Nicoletti et al. (2000, 2001), Bassanini and Ernst (2002), Djankov et al. (2002, 2006), Nicoletti and Scarpetta (2003), and Loayza et al. (2004, 2005) for cross-section studies and Bandiera et al. (2000), Alesina et al. (2003) and Kaufman et al. (2003) for panel studies. Almost all these studies conclude that regulation has deleterious effects on economic activity. Existing measures of regulation have two important limitations, however, that restrict their usefulness in quantifying regulation’s effects on the time path of the aggregate economy: (1) restriction to a small subset of regulations and (2) a short time dimension. For example, the OECD data set, used in several of the studies cited above, considers only product market and employment protection regulation (Nicoletti et al. 2000). The time span of the data ranges from none at all (the cross-section data sets) to a maximum of 20 years (the panel data sets of Nicoletti et al. 2001, and Kaufman et al. 2003). Restricting attention to a subset of regulations is problematic because, as we document below, the included regulations often are highly correlated both contemporaneously and intertemporally with the omitted regulations, leading to omitted variables bias in any regression analysis. A short time dimension makes analysis of dynamics difficult or impossible. We construct a new measure of federal regulation in the US that overcomes these limitations, and we use our measure to analyze the macrodynamic effects of regulation. Our measure includes literally all federal regulations over a period of 57 years. It is complementary to the existing measures, covering different dimensions of the body of regulation and useful for addressing different types of questions. Our measure is designed for time series analysis and thus is particularly well-suited to examining the impact of regulation on macroeconomic dynamics. We use our series in an equation derived from endogenous growth theory to examine regulation’s effect on the time paths of output and total factor productivity (TFP) and secondarily on the paths of labor and capital services. The major effect is on the growth rate of output. We find that regulation added since 1949 has reduced the aggregate growth rate on average by about 2 percentage points over our sample period. As usual with the compound effect of growth rates, the accumulated effect of a moderate change in the growth rate leads to large effects on the level over time. In particular, our estimates indicate that annual output by 2005 is about 28 % of what it would have been had regulation remained at its 1949 level. Regulation also affects the dynamic adjustment paths of all variables, altering both the trend and level of each variable and usually having both contemporaneous and lagged effects. The effect of regulation on TFP is especially noteworthy. Increases in regulation explain much of the productivity slowdown of the 1970s. Regulation’s effects differ for output, TFP, capital, and labor, implying that regulation alters the allocation of resources. Where our findings are comparable with those of previous cross-section and panel studies, they generally are consistent with them. In particular, our estimated growth rate reduction of about 2 percentage points is in line with results obtained from the cross-section and panel studies.",1

Auer,,,Male,,,Male,"The sample criterion for this study is that information on the country’s level of economic development (GDP per capita in 2003 from the World Bank development indicators) and on the “quality” of its institutions is available. Regarding the latter measure of institutional quality, the only set of indicators that is arguably not strongly based on ideology, tries to measure institutional outcomes only (as opposed to general economic outcomes), and is available for a wide set of countries are the World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators from Kaufmann et al. (2005). I focus on the score for the “Rule of the Law” for most of the analysis. Countries with less than half a million inhabitants in 2004 are excluded from the paper, yielding a sample size of \(151\) countries.Footnote 5
 To discern the direct effect of endowments on growth from the institutional channel, it is expedient to construct a valid control group in which only the direct effect of endowments is present. This raises the question of how to find a consistent classification scheme to allocate countries into either “colonies” or “noncolonies”. Colonization is clearly defined in biology, where it describes the process by which a species spreads into new areas to form a new settlement separated by open ground from the original colony (see, for example, Encyclopedia Britannica 2010). In the social sciences, the definition is less concise; Kohn (2012), in her contribution to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, defines colonialism as a “broad concept that refers to the project of European political domination from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries.” Colonization “involved the transfer of population to a new territory, where the arrivals lived as permanent settlers while maintaining political allegiance to their country of origin.” As a result the colony lost its sovereignty over social, economic, and government structures. Following these generally accepted concepts, the history of a country that is classified as a “former colony” should thus satisfy two main criteria. The first criterion is that the colony must have been characterized by a substantial loss of sovereignty during the \(16\)th to the early \(20\)th century, where I define a “substantial loss of sovereignty” to be the case if the country was an official colony, was under the control of an empire-affiliated organization, such as the Dutch and British East Indies Companies, had the status of protectorate, or lost sovereignty over its foreign policy following a military conflict with an imperialist empire. The second criterion is that the colony and colonizer are physically separate (i.e., colonies and their colonizer empire do not form a contingent empire), which is makes it possible to unambiguously distinguish colony and colonizer (otherwise, questions such as whether Hungary was a colony or a reigning part of the Austro-Hungarian empire arise) and constitutes a prerequisite to set up completely independent institutional arrangements in each colony and its colonizing nation. With this definition, \(56\) countries are classified as noncolonized nations, and \(95\) are classified as former colonies. Online Appendix Table A1 lists all \(151\) countries included in this study, specifies whether each is classified as a former colony or a noncolony, and provides further information on endowments and geography. In the Online Appendix of this paper, I extensively discuss the detailed historical information that has been used to classify countries into these two groups.Footnote 6

Civil conflicts have persistent devastating effects on economic development (Collier and Hoeffler 2004; Collier et al. 2009), and their legacy involves more than physical and human capital destruction. Civil conflicts often entail the persistent breakdown of civic and economic cooperation within society. We are motivated here by our recent theoretical work (Rohner et al. 2013), arguing that war leads to a collapse of trust and social capital which in turn sows the seeds of more ethnic conflict. Yet, there are also instances in which wars appear to cement rather than destroy cooperation. Historically, wars promoted nation building in Europe (Tilly 1975). The aftermath of World War II in Western Europe was characterized by strong institutional development involving social cooperation, renewed national identity and sustained high economic growth (Eichengreen 2008). Interestingly, Osafo-Kwaako and Robinson (2013) find no evidence that warfare is associated with future state building or political centralization in Africa. However, at a more micro level, Bellows and Miguel (2009) report evidence of positive social capital developments in Sierra Leone after the devastating civil conflict of 1991–2002.Footnote 1 The goal of this paper is to address two questions: First, is there evidence of causal effects of war on inter-ethnic trust? Second, how do such effects differ across different dimensions of trust and social capital? We document causal effects of ethnic conflict on trust and ethnic identity using individual, county-level and district-level data from Uganda. An ethnic mosaic consisting of more than 50 groups, Uganda is a natural environment for such a micro-study. Ethnic conflicts have been pervasive since independence in 1962. Since 1985, Uganda has been ruled by the National Resistance Movement (NRM) led by Yoweri Museveni, whose main constituency is the Bantu-dominated South. His government has faced opposition and armed rebellion in several parts of the country, especially in the “Acholiland” region (in North Uganda), where the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) was active until 2006, and close to the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the insurgency led by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) was been active until 2004. Our empirical strategy exploits an exogenous change in the policy against internal insurgency that occurred in 2001, after the September 11 terrorist attack. The declaration of the “war on terror” was a turning point. In earlier years, the international community had tried to promote negotiated settlements of the Ugandan conflicts.Footnote 2 In 2001, the US Patriot Act declared the LRA and the ADF terrorist organizations. Fearing retaliation, the ruling Sudanese National Islamic Front that had offered sanctuary and military help to the LRA until then, withdrew its support to the rebel army. Museveni’s government seized this opportunity to launch a military crackdown on rebel armies in different fronts, particularly in the regions neighboring Sudan where the LRA had lost the logistic support from its basis in Sudanese territory. The ADF was soon annihilated and ceased any significant military activity within Uganda after 2004. Military action against the LRA started in March 2002, when the army launched “Operation Iron Fist” against the rebel bases in South Sudan. The LRA responded by attacking villages and government forces in Northern Uganda. Military activity and reprisals peaked in 2003. In 2005, the LRA moved its bases to the Democratic Republic of Congo, while the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for its leader Joseph Kony. A cease-fire between the LRA and the government of Uganda was signed on September 2006, with the mediation of the autonomous government of South Sudan. Figure 1 shows the total number of geo-referenced fighting events and of fatalities related to the conflict between 1997 and 2010 from Armed Conflicts Location Events Data (ACLED). Between 2000 and 2008 ACLED reports nearly 2,500 fighting events resulting in almost 10,000 fatalities. Consistent with the narrative above, there was a sharp increase in 2002–2005, followed by a decline, and very low levels of violence have been recorded after 2006. The escalation of violence in 2002–2005 is not merely an Acholi phenomenon. A large number of conflict episodes was recorded all over Uganda in this period (see Fig. 2). The figure shows the annual number of fighting events (left-hand scale) and the number of fatalites (right-hand scale) in Uganda during 1997–2010. Source. ACLED (2011) The figure shows the districts and counties of Uganda and the location of fighting events. The bold black lines display the district borders whose names are also listed in the map. The thin grey lines show the county borders. The circles correspond to the locations of fighting events between 2000 and 2008 (from ACLED 2011) We are interested in assessing the effects of this surge in violence on different measures of trust and ethnic identity. To do so, we exploit two waves of survey data from Afrobarometer (2000, 2008), a repeated cross section including information on various measures of trust and socioeconomic characteristics at the individual level.Footnote 3 Our strategy is to regress individual trust in year 2008 on spatial measures of intensity of fighting during 2000–2008, controlling for a large number of individual, ethnic and spatial characteristics. Most important, we control for the average trust at the district level in 2000, in order to filter out cross-district heterogeneity resulting from long-standing factors.Footnote 4
 We address concerns about reverse causality and omitted variables through two complementary strategies. First, we adopt an instrumental variables strategy. Our identification relies on an external political shock—i.e., the US declaring the main rebel movements of Uganda to be terrorist organizations, and the Khartoum government withdrawing support of those groups—affecting the intensity of fighting, but having no direct effect on trust measures. Since political shock affected the probability of fighting differentially across geographical areas, with a larger escalation of violence being observed close to the Sudanese border, we use the distance of each county from Sudan as an instrument for the number of fighting events.Footnote 5
 We also consider an alternative strategy where the identification relies on the within-county variation in conflict intensity involving different ethnic groups. ACLED provides information about the rebel groups and ethnic militias that were involved in each conflict event. In most cases, these groups can be linked to ethnic affiliations. We can then regress our measures of trust on the number of fighting events involving different ethnic groups within each county, controlling for both county and ethnic group fixed effects. Our hypothesis is that respondents should be affected particularly by local events involving their own ethnic group. Our main finding is that the intensity of fighting has a negative and statistically significant effect on “trust towards other people from Uganda”. The estimated effect is quantitatively large, and robust to instrumenting fighting intensity by distance to Sudan. A one-standard-deviation increase in fighting (corresponding to 45 additional episodes of violence) translates into a 46 % standard deviation decrease in trust (corresponding to 22 percentage points). This is a very large effect, corresponding to about half of the difference between the Netherlands, the eighth most trusting country in the world, and the three countries with the lowest trust levels (Peru, Brazil and the Philippines). The effect is stronger when fighting events involve the respondent’s ethnic group. Fighting has no significant effects on “trust in known people” and on “trust in relatives”, suggesting that fighting induces distrust mainly towards people outside the ordinary social network. Moreover, people living in counties experiencing more fighting report a large increase in a self-reported measure of “ethnic identity”, i.e., they identify themselves more strongly with their own ethnic group relative to other forms of affiliation, including Ugandan nationality. This result is robust to the inclusion of ethnicity fixed effects. The response is stronger for people owning a radio, who are likely to be better informed about events associated with the conflict. Moreover, the results are not driven by the Acholi region, the most tormented by the conflict between the LRA and the government. Excluding all counties of core Acholiland does not affect the estimates. In Rohner et al. (2013), we argue that by undermining trust, conflict hinders economic cohesion in ethnically divided societies. Although a thorough empirical investigation of this question would require a longer time span of data, in an extension we consider the economic effects of ethnic conflicts. Ideally, one would like to study how the dynamics of GDP per capita at the county level are affected by exposure to conflict. However, regional GDP data are not available for Uganda. We resort to proxying these with the average intensity of nighttime light recorded by U.S. meteorological satellites at the county level. We document an interesting interaction effect: given the intensity of fighting, post-conflict economic recovery depends on the ethnic fractionalization of each county. Fighting has a negative effect on the economic situation of highly fractionalized counties 4 years after the end of the conflict outburst, but has no effect on less fractionalized counties. This paper is part of a large literature on inter-ethnic conflict. Earlier contributions focus on characteristics of the political process (see, e.g., Horowitz 2000), while more recent formal theories study the effect of population characteristics (see, e.g., Esteban and Ray 2011; Rohner 2011). Different from these papers, our study suggests that ethnic identity may be endogenous relative to the conflict dynamics.Footnote 6
 While we examine the effect of conflict on social capital, over the last decade a large empirical literature has studied the opposite channel, i.e., how different measures of ethnic diversity predict the outbreak of civil wars.Footnote 7 However, there is also a growing number of micro-level studies dealing with the impact of conflicts on human capital, in particular the educational attainment of cohorts exposed to war, in different countries (see Akresh and de Walque 2010; Blattman and Annan 2010; Leon 2012; Shemyakina 2011; Swee 2008). There is also a literature in medicine documenting that child soldiers or children who experienced war are more likely to experience depression and post-traumatic stress or anxiety (see Barenbaum et al. 2004; Dyregrov et al. 2000, and Derluyn et al. 2004). The studies above focus on human rather than social capital. More directly related to our work is the recent literature on the effect of individual war experience on political participation and local collective action (see, e.g., Bellows and Miguel 2009; Blattman 2009, and Humphreys and Weinstein 2007). Besley and Reynal-Querol (2012) study the historical legacy of pre-colonial conflict in Africa and find that historical conflict is negatively correlated with trust levels today. There is also a conflict-related literature based on lab and field experiments, including Fearon et al. (2009), Gilligan et al. (2010), Miguel et al. (2011), Voors et al. (2012), and Whitt and Rick (2007). Cassar et al. (2013) run experiments in Tajikistan and find that conflict exposure reduces trusting and fair behavior, especially in interactions with people from the same area. They explain this finding as due to the nature of the Tajik war, in which clear frontlines were absent and much violence took place within villages. Our paper is related also to the literature linking trust and social capital in communities to past history and ethnic fragmentation.Footnote 8 While Alesina and La Ferrara (2000) finds that participation in social activities is lower in ethnically heterogeneous communities, Alesina and La Ferrara (2002) shows that a recent history of traumatic experiences and discrimination, poverty, low education and ethnic diversity correlate with low trust. Ashraf and Oded (2011) and Ashraf and Galor (2013) link cultural diversity of societies to their long-run development. They find that genetic diversity has a hump-shaped effect on comparative economic development: on the one hand diversity results in more distrust, lower coordination, less cooperation and more social unrest; on the other hand, a wider spectrum of traits makes is easier to implement advanced technological paradigms. Using Afrobarometer and historical data, Nunn and Wantchekon (2011) find that individuals in sub-Saharan African countries whose ancestors belonged to ethnicities that were subject to a high intensity of enslavement report lower trust levels today. Our results are complementary to theirs. While they emphasize persistent effects of events that occurred long time ago, we show that large contemporaneous shocks can change beliefs and social capital. In a similar vein, Guiso et al. (2009) document that bilateral trust across countries depends on the number of years in which the two countries have been in war during the last millennium. Different aspects of the relationship between trust and growth are studied by Algan and Cahuc (2010) and Giuliano and Spilimbergo (2009). A number of papers document that business links are more stable between people of the same ethnic groups (Fafchamps 2000; Fisman 2003). These papers are related to the findings in our paper that fighting appears to have larger post-war economic effects in ethnically fractionalized counties. Finally, our paper is related to the limited literature on the consequences of the conflict in Uganda. Bozzoli et al. (2011) analyzes the effect of conflict on individual expectations in Northern Uganda. Their paper is complementary to ours insofar as it documents the effect of differential exposure to conflict. However, they use a different dataset (the Northern Uganda Livelihood Survey) which covers only the population living in six Northern districts. This survey is only available for 2007, so pre-conflict attitudes cannot be controlled for. Using also data from Northern Uganda, Fiala (2013) analyses the economic consequences of being internally displaced. A recent paper by De Luca and Verpoorten (2011)—carried out independently, and posterior to the first version of our paper—studies the effect of conflict in Uganda on associational membership and trust.Footnote 9
Deininger (2003) analyzes household survey data for Uganda and finds that households more heavily affected by civil strife are less likely to engage in (non-farm) enterprise expansion or startup and are more likely to close down an existing enterprise. Vargas Hill et al. (2008) document that in Uganda agricultural “cooperatives were much less likely (...) to exist in communities that had recently experienced civil conflict”. Section 2 provides an overview of the historical context of the Ugandan conflict. Section 3 describes the data and empirical strategy. Section 4 discusses the main empirical results regarding the effect of conflict on measures of trust and ethnic identity. Section 5 performs some robustness checks. Section 6 analyzes two important extensions focusing, respectively, on spatial\(\times \)ethnic variation in violence, and the economic effects of ethnic conflict. Section 7 concludes. A number of additional statistics and robustness tests and a detailed data description are found in the Appendix.",1
18,3,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-013-9092-2,Can specific policy indicators identify reform priorities?,Aart Kraay,Norikazu Tawara,,Male,Male,,Male,"Strong institutions, including a sound regulatory environment for private sector economic activity, are widely considered to be crucial to successful economic development. This consensus has been informed by a large empirical literature linking various measures of regulatory and institutional quality to differences in economic growth performance across countries. Out of necessity, much of this literature has relied on fairly broad summary measures of institutional and regulatory outcomes. For example, in one of the most widely-known papers in the institutions and growth literature, Acemoglu et al. (2001) proxy for institutional quality using the risk of expropriation, as perceived by analysts at a commercial risk rating agency. In another pioneering paper, Mauro (1995) relates cross-country differences in growth and investment to perceptions of overall corruption from commercial risk rating agencies. Turning such influential findings into concrete policy advice for countries seeking to improve the regulatory and institutional environment has, however, been more difficult. One reason for this has been the shortage of systematic cross-country data on specific policies that governments might implement in order to influence the institutional outcomes that have been identified as important correlates of growth and development. Recognizing this gap, a number of organizations have in recent years developed highly detailed indicators of specific laws, regulations, and policies that plausibly influence broad institutional outcomes such as perceptions of the business regulatory environment or public sector integrity. In this paper, we consider two such datasets, both covering large cross-sections of countries: (i) the Doing Business project of the World Bank, which reports 38 indicators of specific rules and regulations relevant to the business environment, and (ii) the Global Integrity Index, which reports over 300 specific policy indicators relevant to public sector accountability mechanisms. The promise of such detailed indicators is to provide guidance on reform priorities, by pinpointing specific policy levers under the control of policymakers that can be changed in order to improve institutional quality, ultimately leading to better growth performance.Footnote 1 However, realizing this promise requires an understanding of the relative magnitude of the partial effects of each of the specific policy indicators on the corresponding outcomes that policymakers might want to improve. For example, a policymaker considering business regulatory reform would want to know whether investor perceptions of the quality of the business environment respond more to streamlined procedures for specific regulatory processes, or to reduced fees for these same processes. The same policymaker would likely also want to know whether the answer depends on which particular measure of investor perceptions of the business environment is used. On this crucial question of partial effects of specific policy indicators on outcomes of interest, empirical evidence has not kept pace with the proliferation of detailed indicators relevant to the regulatory environment and institutional quality. Confronted with such large numbers of potential policy indicators, one common empirical approach has been to simply average them together into a composite measure that can be related to outcomes of interest. This, however, embodies the unappealing assumption that the partial effects on outcomes of all of the components of the composite policy indicator are equal.Footnote 2 Another approach is to pick a subset of specific policy indicators to relate to outcomes, which may be misleading if the chosen policy indicators are correlated with other policy measures that also matter for the outcome of interest. In this paper, we illustrate the challenges of linking specific policy indicators to regulatory and institutional outcomes, without imposing unappealing prior restrictions about the relative importance of individual indicators. We do this in three steps. First, we identify a set of intermediate outcome variables which we think a policymaker might reasonably want to influence through reforms to specific policies captured in our two datasets. In the case of Doing Business, which focuses on business regulation, we choose as outcome variables seven closely-related subjective measures of the quality of the regulatory environment, as perceived by a variety of firm survey respondents and expert assessments. In the case of Global Integrity, which focuses on public sector accountability mechanisms, we choose seven subjective measures of perceptions of corruption. A key feature of these outcome measures is that they tend to be quite highly correlated across countries. For example, the median pairwise correlation among the seven measures of perceptions of the regulatory environment is 0.68. Second, we use Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to systematically document the partial correlations between the many detailed policy indicators and the seven outcome variables of interest. As discussed in more detail below, BMA is a powerful tool for systematically identifying robust partial correlates of outcomes when there are many potential explanatory variables and the precise empirical specification is unknown. Third, having identified a set of important partial correlates for each outcome variable, we investigate how similar these sets are across different outcome variables. For any given outcome variable, we find that the BMA procedure readily identifies a small number of specific policy indicators that are strongly partially correlated with the outcome of interest. However, this good news is tempered by an important negative finding: there is a great deal of instability across similar outcomes in the set of policy indicators which the BMA procedure identifies as important for each outcome. To take a specific example, two of our outcome variables for the Doing Business indicators are assessments of the quality of the business environment produced by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) and the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessments (CPIA). Both measures are conceptually similar, summarizing respondents’ views of the quality of business regulation and the restrictiveness of international trade. In the set of 110 countries for which data on both outcomes are available, these two measures are correlated at 0.78. Yet despite the similarity of these two outcome variables, we find little correspondence in the specific policy indicators that are identified as their important partial correlates. For example, the BMA procedure identifies legal protections for creditors as the most important partial correlate of the CPIA outcome variable. However, it ranks only 19th most important for the EIU outcome variable. More systematically, for each outcome variable, we identify a set of 10 policy indicators that are the most important partial correlates of the outcome. Comparing these sets of important policy indicators across outcomes, we find little overlap: for example, despite the high correlation between the EIU and CPIA outcome variables noted above, only three indicators fall into the set of top ten important correlates for both of these outcome variables. Moving beyond these two specific outcome measures, we find that not one of the 38 specific policy indicators in the Doing Business dataset turns up as an important correlate of all seven outcome variables, and just one turns out to be important for six out of seven outcome variables. Conversely, we find that 29 out of the 38 policy indicators turn up in the set of important partial correlates for at least one outcome. This suggests a great deal of instability across outcomes in the set of important policy indicators. We find a similar degree of instability in the set of important correlates across alternative measures of corruption when we perform the same exercise using the Global Integrity dataset. This key instability finding can be interpreted in two alternative ways. One possibility is that there is a common model linking the same small set of policy indicators to each of the outcomes, but the available data and empirical techniques that we deploy are not able to conclusively identify the set of policy indicators included in this common model. Another possibility is that the true mapping from policy indicators to outcomes in reality is different across the different outcome variables, and this is reflected in our finding of instability in the set of important indicators across outcomes. We discuss these two alternative interpretations in more detail later in Sect. 5.6 of the paper. Importantly, however, we note that both interpretations share the same implication: policymakers will find it difficult to use these kinds of datasets of highly-detailed policy indicators to isolate a small number of specific reforms that are likely to matter for the set of outcomes they are interested in influencing. Our results should not be interpreted as a criticism of the specific policy indicator datasets we use in the paper—in our view both Doing Business and Global Integrity are credible and careful data gathering exercises. Nor do we view our findings as a critique of Bayesian Model Averaging as a technique for isolating robust partial correlations when there is little prior information about the true empirical specification—as we discuss in more detail below, our findings are not driven by key assumptions required to implement the BMA methodology. Rather we view our empirical results as a cautionary tale for creators and users of cross-country datasets of highly specific policy indicators. While such indicators can serve a useful role in documenting differences in regulatory and institutional practices across countries, it may be difficult to use them as a roadmap to reforms in the real world, where policymakers must choose to spend their political capital on a limited set of high-impact reforms. Our main finding of instability of explanatory variables across similar outcomes is most closely related to Ciccone and Jarocinski (2010), who document a high degree of instability in the set of important growth determinants, when the dependent variable of economic growth is calculated using alternative revisions and updates of the widely-used Penn World Table dataset. We share with that paper an emphasis on the instability of BMA results across different closely-related outcome variables. Our work differs however in that they focus on a set of quite broad growth determinants, including many historical and geographical features of countries as well as initial conditions that, while relevant for growth, are not amenable to specific policy interventions. In contrast, our emphasis is on understanding the links between specific policy levers and intermediate outcomes that policymakers might want to influence using these levers.Footnote 3
 The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2, we describe the Doing Business data and the corresponding set of outcome variables. In Sect. 3, we explain the Bayesian Model Averaging methodology, and Sect. 4 contains our main results using the Doing Business dataset.

One group of studies puts civil war at the forefront of the underdevelopment trap and highlights the economic, social and political disintegration that has followed many conflicts (Collier et al. 2003; Collier and Hoeffler 2004). Another long tradition in economic and political history characterizes war and inter-group competition as preconditions for nation building, state formation, and market development (Tilly and Ardant 1975; Tilly 1985; Greif 2006). Given the importance of institutions and social norms for growth and development, much is likely to depend on the social and institutional legacy of conflict, which has been described as “the most important but least understood of all war impacts” (Blattman and Miguel 2010, p. 42). Intriguingly, a number of recent studies show that exposure to conflict intensifies certain positive prosocial elements within individuals (Bauer et al. 2011; Bellows and Miguel 2009; Blattman 2009; Voors et al. 2012) and communities (Gilligan et al. 2011). Other theoretical and empirical work, however, points to negative consequences of conflict on inter-ethnic trust and trade (Rohner et al. 2011a, b). Our work contributes to this micro-behavioral literature by considering the effects of violence on trust. We focus on trust due to the growing body of evidence that cultural attributes in general and trust in particular are vital determinants of economic performance. Trust plays an essential role in promoting cooperation and generalized trust is fundamental to initiating trade with anonymous others—a prerequisite of successful market development (Fafchamps 2006). At a more macroeconomic level, trust has been associated with institutional quality (Knack and Keefer 1997; La Porta et al. 1997), financial development (Guiso et al. 2004), entrepreneurship (Sapienza et al. 2006, GDP growth (Algan and Cahuc 2010), and trade (Guiso et al. 2009). Our research examines experimental and survey evidence of the effects of civil conflict on trust and market development in a case study of the post-Soviet Republic of Tajikistan. We report the results of a series of experiments and a survey designed to investigate whether, more than 10 years after the end of the conflict, the 1992–1997 Tajik civil war has left any imprint on preferences and social norms that are thought to sustain the development of impersonal exchange. We consider the effects that conflict exposure might exert on behavioral measures of trust towards different groups and on individual stated and revealed preferences for participation in markets, participation in collective action and on the strength of kinship ties. Our findings point to negative and persistent, yet heterogeneous, effects of violence on the norms that support impersonal exchange, in particular on trust within local communities. Victimization during the civil war is associated with a 40 % average decrease in trust (the amount sent by the first mover in the trust game) when respondents are matched to another individual from the same village. Survey-based evidence on actual behavior and stated preferences corroborates experimental findings. Consistent with the decrease in local trust in the experimental games, former victims are both less likely and less willing to participate in local markets, especially when they do not have a personal connection with the trader they are dealing with. Our results also indicate that experiences of victimization are associated with reinforced kinship-based norms of morality and behavior, at the expense of the rule of formal law. However, such negative effects of violence are heterogeneous and depend in part on the nature of infighting within local communities. The negative effects are more pronounced in regions where opposing groups inter-mix and where local allegiances were, and still are, split. This leads us to speculate that effects of conflict on local norms are mediated both by the specificity and the salience of war-time divides. This, in turn, may explain why the emerging literature on conflict and pro-sociality has found both positive and negative effects. We hypothesize that the nature of fighting in the Tajik civil war, characterized by localized intra-group conflict, explains the observed disruption of norms and preferences among victims of violence. As a largely intra-Tajik war, people were unable to apply basic cues to identify friend from foe within their communities. As perpetrators of violence and authors of denunciations may still be close by, victims should be especially wary and guarded about whom they can trust.Footnote 1
 The effect should thus be most stringent in areas where the population was, and still is, of inter-mixed political allegiance. We rely on regional variation in the nature of fighting during the civil war in order to test this mechanism further. We build an index of political polarization at the village level. We find that the association between conflict exposure and undermining of local trust, willingness to trade and strength of kinship is only present in villages that are above the median in terms of political polarization but absent in villages that are below the median. This result is robust when, instead of actual political polarization, which could be an outcome of the conflict, we rely on political polarization predicted by the physical distance to Afghanistan and to Uzbekistan—both widely recognized as important entry points for weapons and insurgent transit into Tajikistan during and after the civil war (Abdullaev and Barnes 2001). We also contrast the effect in the two regional polar-opposite cases: the Pamir region where no community infighting occurred, and the environs of the capital city Dushanbe, one of the most inter-mixed regions of the country. Consistent with our interpretation, negative results are strongest in the Dushanbe region but absent in Pamir. Our results suggest that civil war may have particularly deleterious effects in regions where opposing groups inter-mixed. This last implication is consistent with recent findings by Rohner et al. (2011b) that ethnic conflict in Uganda has hindered cohesion in ethnically divided districts but has had little effect in ethnically homogenous districts. We assess trust through lab-in-the field experiments. We utilize a simplified version of the trust game under two treatment conditions: Same Village, in which the anonymous second player is someone who lives in the same village as the first player, and Distant Village, in which the second player might come from anywhere in Tajikistan, therefore naturally a more abstract concept. The experiments are then followed by an in-depth survey. We carried out our study with 426 randomly selected individuals in 17 villages in four regions of Tajikistan (Dushanbe, Khatlon, Gharm and Pamir). We chose Tajikistan in part because, as a Soviet creation, market development was prohibited prior to the onset of the conflict, thus making it a compelling case for studying market foundations. Tajikistan is also at the heart of a region whose strategic importance is matched only by its instability, at the crossroad between the Xinjiang region of China, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, all of which have experienced civil unrest in recent years. To address concerns about selection into victimization, we employ three strategies. First, we use a selection on observables strategy. Our results are robust to controlling for a large number of characteristics, including the determinants of victimization, religiosity, active participation in combat, and to including as an additional regressor a measure for altruism based on the dictator game to address the concern that people were selected into victimization on the basis of their pro-social preferences. Second, because of the very localized nature of the conflict, all specifications include village fixed effects. Village fixed effects enable us to isolate the variation in violence experienced across neighbors within the same village. Third, we focus our analysis on different sub-samples. We restrict our attention to individuals who were too young to be systematically targeted—those who were 14 or younger at the beginning of the conflict. We also consider the sub-sample of people who have never moved in order to rule out that our results are due to selective migration. Taking all the evidence together, our analysis indicates that selection into victimization is unlikely to be the factor driving our results. Another concern is that our results are driven by Tajikistan’s post-war environment rather than exposure to violence during the conflict. An analysis with survey data collected in 1996, roughly 6 months before the signing of the final peace agreement, suggests that this is not the case. The next section reviews the relevant literature. Section 3 presents some background on the Tajik civil conflict and discusses our main hypotheses. Section 4 presents the experimental design and the survey methods. Section 5 describes the empirical strategy. Section 6 discusses the results and Sect. 7 concludes.

Mulholland,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Empirical research to explain cross-country output per worker differences has expanded greatly since the introduction of new data, particularly the Penn World Tables of Summers and Heston (1988) and Barro and Lee’s schooling data (Barro and Lee 2001). Recent advances have been based mostly on development and growth accounting. With some presumed knowledge of a common production function, it is possible to decompose countries’ output per worker levels and growth experiences into the relative contributions of measured inputs and the efficiency with which those inputs are used, commonly called total factor productivity (TFP). Growth accounting seeks to understand what proportion of output variation, output growth, and output growth variation can be understood through input variation, input growth, and input growth variation, and what proportion is left to TFP. The typical answer has been that most output growth can be accounted for by input growth, but that the variation in output levels and growth rates is mostly accounted for by variation in TFP levels and growth rates.Footnote 1 These results have spurred a search for a theory of TFP.Footnote 2
 The contribution of this paper is to apply the methodology of cross-country growth accounting to a panel data set covering the states of the United States from 1840 to 2000. We construct original per worker estimates of human capital, physical capital and land at the state level covering 1840–2000. These data cover 28 states for the entire period, with other states becoming available later, generally, around the time of statehood. We then use growth accounting to estimate the contributions of measured inputs and TFP to output growth, and variation of input growth and TFP growth for output growth variation. Using states as a growth accounting laboratory offers four main advantages when compared to countries. First, sectoral level data are available for states in output, physical capital, land and human capital, making it possible to do sectoral growth accounting exercises. Second, state level data is available from the mid-nineteenth century to the present, while cross-country data (c.f. Heston et al. 2008) is typically only available for the post-war period.Footnote 3 Third, output per worker has converged among states in a way that it has not among countries, allowing us to ask whether the main accounting results hold throughout the convergence process. Fourth, for many readers more familiar with the institutions and laws of states than of countries, it will be easier to identify the other factors that are, of necessity, left out of accounting exercises. To some extent TFP is famously merely a “measure of our ignorance.”Footnote 4 A priori we expect the greater mobility of capital and labor, more common institutions, common language, common currency and common trade policy for the US states to have a larger effect on the share of growth rate variation explained by input growth variation. Instead we find the opposite. There are more detailed sectoral data available for states than for countries, and additionally, data is available for a longer period. We compute physical capital stocks for three disaggregated sectors, farming, manufacturing and non-manufacturing and non-farm. These data for the farm and manufacturing sectors are drawn directly from historical measures of, or proxies for, each state’s value added or income and capital stocks, while our measures for the remaining sector require some imputation. Our measure of land covers the farm sector and includes adjustments to account for the innate productivity differences of different land types, and different areas of the country. When combined with measures of human capital, the labor force, and output by state and sector from Turner et al. (2007), hereafter TTMB, we have sufficient data for our accounting exercises. Turner et al. (2011), hereafter TTSM, describes the construction and robustness of these data in more detail.Footnote 5 We conduct both growth accounting and variance decomposition of growth for each sector, and find that our state aggregate growth accounting and variance decomposition of state aggregate growth results are robust across time, across sectors, and across regions. We find three main results. First in an environment of 1.8 % per annum per worker output growth, output per worker converged substantially over the 160 years of our survey. The output of the 90th percentile state relative to the 10th percentile state averaged 3.4 in the nineteenth century. The ratio was between 1.8 and 2.5 in the first half of the twentieth century, and was less than 1.7 in the second half of the twentieth century. We find that the convergence of TFP explains seventy percent of the convergence, whereas convergence of inputs only captures thirty percent. Second, we find that output per worker growth is explained mostly by measured input growth, but the variation in those output per worker growth rates is accounted more by the variation in TFP growth than by variation in input growth. In particular input growth can explain between three-fifths to three-quarters of output per worker growth, but variation of input growth rates accounts for only one-quarter of the variation of growth rates across states. Third, the dramatic convergence in log output per worker, and sectoral log output per worker is mostly captured by convergence in log TFP or sectoral log TFP. Only thirty percent of the falling standard deviation of log output per worker or log sectoral output per worker arises from declining standard deviation of log input per worker or log sectoral input per worker.Footnote 6
 Our paper is relevant to both the literature that aims to understand the growth experience of the United States in particular (c.f. Jorgenson 2005), and that which aims to understand the growth experience across countries (c.f. Caselli 2005). We are aware that our methodology is simpler than many of the papers in this portion of the literature, and concede these papers include more detailed accounting and often include more factors than our study. That said, the reason we adhere to our relatively simple methodology is to make as direct a comparison as possible to the cross-country literature. Also, relative to both sets of literature, we offer an accounting exercise that contains a much longer timeframe than typically available. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the creation and attributes of our panel data set briefly, with further description available in the companion paper Turner et al. (2011), hereafter TTSM. Section 3 performs the aggregate growth accounting exercises. Section 4 contains robustness checks, with alternative time periods, alternative input measures, and sectoral growth accounting exercises. The results from both the growth accounting and the variance decomposition of growth rates are robust to different input measures, different time periods, and across sectors of the economy. Section 5 examines the convergence of log output per worker or log sectoral output per worker. As with growth rate variations, the majority of the observed convergence in log levels of output per worker arises from convergence in log levels of TFP. Section 6 concludes.",1
18,4,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-013-9096-y,"Luddites, the industrial revolution, and the demographic transition",Kevin Hjortshøj O’Rourke,Ahmed S. Rahman,Alan M. Taylor,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In this section we build a theoretical version of an industrializing economy in successive steps, keeping the points enumerated in the introduction firmly in mind. Section 1.1 goes over the production function and technologies. Here we develop a method for endogenizing the scope and direction of technical change, keeping endowments fixed. Section 1.2 then merges the model with an overlapping generations framework in order to endogenize demographic choices, and hence endowments, taking technology as given. These two parts will then form an integrated dynamic model which we use to analyze the industrialization of England during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. We begin with the static general equilibrium of a hypothetical economy. The economy produces a final good \(Y\) from two “intermediate inputs” using a CES production function where \(A_{l}\) and \(A_{h}\) are technology terms, \(L\) is unskilled labor, \(H\) is skilled labor, and \(\sigma \) is the elasticity of substitution between the two intermediate inputs. Heuristically, one might think of the final good \(Y\) as being “GDP” which is simply aggregated up from the two intermediates. By construction, \(A_{l}\) is L-augmenting and \(A_{h}\) is H-augmenting. We will assume throughout the paper that these intermediates are grossly substitutable, and thus assume that \(\sigma > 1\).Footnote 2 With this assumption of substitutability, a technology that augments a particular factor is also biased towards that factor. Thus we will call \(A_{l}\)
unskilled-labor-biased technology, and \(A_{h}\)
skill-biased technology. We assume that markets for both the final good and the factors of production are perfectly competitive. Thus, prices are equal to unit costs, and factors are paid their marginal products. We can then describe wages as which in turn implies that the skill premium, \(w_{h}\)/\(w_{l}\), can be expressed as From the above we can see that, so long as the maintained assumption \(\sigma >1\) holds, and holding fixed the supply of factors \(H\) and \(L\), a rise (fall) in \(A_h\) relative to \(A_l\) implies a rise (fall) in the demand for skilled labor relative to unskilled labor, and in our model this will generate a rise (fall) in the skill premium, all else equal. Similarly, holding \(A_h\) and \(A_l\) constant, a rise (fall) in \(H/L\) will lead to a fall (rise) in the skill premium, all else equal. Later on, however, as we develop our model, we will explore how supplies of factors change endogenously in the long run in response to changes in the skill premium. For the moment, we begin by developing a model of how changes in the technology parameters \(A_h\) and \(A_l\) themselves will depend, among other things, on factor supplies and wage rates. In order to endogenize the evolution of factor-specific technology levels \(A_{l}\) and \(A_{h}\), we model technological development as improvements in the quality of machines, as in Acemoglu (1998). Specifically, we assume that researchers expend resources to improve the quality of a machine, and receive some positive profits (due to patents or first-mover advantage) from the sale of these new machines for only one time period.Footnote 3 We then define the productivity levels \(A_{l}\) and \(A_{h}\) to be amalgamations of quality-adjusted machines that augment either unskilled labor, or skilled labor, but not both. In our model, costly innovation will be undertaken to improve some machine \(j\) (designed to be employed either by skilled or unskilled labor), get the blueprints for this newly improved machine, use these blueprints to produce the machine, and sell these machines to the producers of the intermediate good. After one period, however, new researchers can enter the market, and we find that newer, better machines will drive out the older designs. In this fashion we simplify the process of “creative destruction” (Schumpeter 1934; Aghion and Howitt 1992) whereby successful researchers along the quality dimension tend to eliminate the monopoly rents of their predecessors. Let us now make technology levels explicit functions of these quality-adjusted machines. \(A_{l}\) and \(A_{h}\) at time \(t\) are defined as the following: where \(0<\beta <1\). \(M_{l}\) are machines that are strictly employed by unskilled workers, while \(M_{h}\) are machines that are strictly employed by skilled workers. \(q_{z}(j)\) is the highest quality of machine type \(j\) used in sector \(z\). The index \(j\) runs over \([0,1]\), and \(z\in \{l,h\}\). Note that these technological coefficients may thus be interpreted simply as functions of different types of ‘capital per worker’ in each sector \(z\); however, the capital in this case is specialized and quality-adjusted. The specifications here imply constant returns to scale in the production of the skilled- and unskilled-intensive intermediate goods. In the end, we care less about micro differences in machine qualities than about macro effects on total factor productivity. To draw conclusions about the latter we note that our problem will have a symmetric equilibrium at the sector level, implying that aggregation is straightforward. In particular, all machines indexed by \(j\) in the (0,1) continuum will on average be of symmetric quality, as inventors will be indifferent as to which particular machines along the continuum they will improve. As such we can alternatively write Eqs. (5) and (6) as where \(Q_{z}\) simply denotes the uniform and symmetric quality of all machine types \(j\) used in sector \(z\in \{l,h\}\). The term \(Q_{z}\) can therefore be taken outside the integral. Increases in this index directly increase the total factor productivity of sector \(z\). We also assume that machines last one period, and then depreciate completely. Now consider a representative firm that competitively produces the unskilled intermediate. (For brevity, much of what follows will deal with only this \(L\)-using unskilled sector. Analogous results hold for the \(H\)-using skilled sector). The firm’s maximization problem is stated as where \(p_{l}\) is the price of the unskilled-intensive intermediate good, and \(p(j)\) is the price of machine \(M_{l}(j)\) faced by all producers of the intermediate. Hence the firm chooses an amount of unskilled labor to hire and amounts of complementary machines to employ, taking the price of its output, the price of machines, and the price of raw labor as given. From the first order condition on \(L\) we have Solving for the price of the intermediate we have \(p_{l} = \frac{w_{l}}{\beta A_{l}}\). From the first order condition on machine \(j\) we can get the total demand for machine \(M_{l}(j)\)
 Innovation in a sector takes the form of an improvement in the quality of a machine by a certain multiple. Innovators expend resources up front to develop new machine blueprints, which they use to produce and sell a better-quality machine (all in the same time period). We assume that innovation is deterministic; that is, individuals who decide to do research will improve the quality of a machine with a probability of one. We also assume that there is a ‘quality ladder’ with discretely-spaced rungs. If innovation in sector \(j\) occurs, the quality of machine \(j\) will deterministically rise to \(\varepsilon Q_{l}\), where \(\varepsilon > 1\) denotes the factor by which machine quality can rise. If on the other hand innovation does not occur, the quality of machine \(j\) remains at \(Q_{l}\). If someone does go ahead and innovate, they are assumed to have sole access to the blueprint for one period; after that the blueprint is public. Once the researcher spends the resources necessary to improve the quality of machine \(j\), she becomes the sole producer of this machine, and charges whatever price (call it \(p(j)\)) she sees fit. Thus she receives total revenue of \(p(j)M_{l}(j)\). Here we must make the distinction between the cost of producing a machine, and the cost of inventing a machine. We discuss the costs of invention in the next sub-section. Here, we assume that the marginal cost of producing a machine is proportional to its quality, so that better machines are more expensive to make—a form of diminishing returns. Indeed, we can normalize this cost, so that total costs are simply \(Q_{l}M_{l}(j)\). Thus the producer of a new unskilled-using machine will wish to set the price \(p(j)\) in order to maximize \(V_{l}(j) = p(j)M_{l}(j) - Q_{l}M_{l}(j)\), where \(V_{l}(j)\) is the value of owning the rights to the new blueprints of machine \(j\) at that moment in time. The question for us is what this price will be. Note that it will not be possible for the owner to charge the full monopoly markup over marginal cost unless the quality increase \(\varepsilon \) is very large. This is because all machines in sector \(j\) are perfect substitutes (they are simply weighted by their respective qualities); by charging a lower price, producers of older lower-quality machines could compete with producers of newer higher-quality machines. To solve the problem, we assume that producers of new machines engage in Bertrand price competition, in the spirit of Grossman and Helpman (1991) and Barro and Sala-i-Martin (2003). In this case the innovator and quality leader uses a limit-pricing strategy, setting a price that is sufficiently below the monopoly price so as to make it just barely unprofitable for the next best quality to be produced. This limit pricing strategy maximizes \(V_{l}\) and ensures that all older machine designs are eliminated from current production. In an appendix we describe in detail how we can solve for this price; here we simply note that our solution yields Note that this price is higher than the marginal cost of producing new machines, and so there is always a positive value of owning the blueprint to a new machine. Plugging this price into machine demands and these machine demands into our expressions of \(V_{l}\) and \(V_{h}\) gives us for unskilled-using and skilled-using machines, respectively. Notice that \(\Psi \) is simply a constant greater than zero. Before an innovator can build a new machine, she must spend resources on R&D to first get the blueprints. Let us denote these costs as \(c_{l}\) (for a new unskilled-labor using machine). The resource costs of research will evolve due to changing economic circumstances. Specifically, the “price” of a successful invention should depend on things like how complicated the invention is and how “deep” general knowledge is. To capture some of these ideas, let us assume that the resource costs of research to improve machine \(j\) in the unskilled-intensive sector are given by and that the resource costs of research to improve machine \(j\) in the skilled-intensive sector are given by where \(\phi >0\) and \(\alpha > 1\). In this setup, \(\alpha \) can be considered a “fishing-out” parameter—the greater is the complexity of existing machines, the greater is the difficulty of improving upon them (see Jones 1998 on the idea of fishing out). The variable \(B\) is our measure of current general knowledge that we label Baconian
knowledge. The general assumptions in each sector are that research is more costly the higher is the quality of machine one aspires to invent (another sort of diminishing returns), and the lower is the stock of general knowledge. Baconian knowledge \(B\) thus influences the level of technology \(A\). But what are the plausible dynamics of \(B\)? We allow general knowledge to grow throughout human history, irrespective of living standards and independent of the applied knowledge embedded in technology levels. According to Mokyr (2005, pp. 291–2), Bacon regarded “knowledge as subject to constant growth, as an entity that continuously expands and adds to itself.” Accordingly, we assume that the growth in basic knowledge depends on the existing stock. Furthermore, we assume that Baconian knowledge grows according to how much skilled labor exists in the economy.Footnote 4
 Specifically, we assume the simple form: Thus we assume that increases in general knowledge (unlike increases in applied knowledge) do not arise from any profit motive, but are rather the fortuitous by-product of the existence of a stock of skilled workers, as well as of accumulated stocks of Baconian knowledge. But in our model, as we shall see, a skilled worker is just an educated worker, so it is here that the link between productivity growth and human capital is made explicit. We now have a mechanism by which growth in general knowledge (\(B\)) can influence the subsequent development of applied knowledge (\(A_{l}\) and \(A_{h}\)). Our functional forms (15) and (16) assume that low Baconian knowledge entails large costs to machine improvement, while high Baconian knowledge entails lower costs. In our model, \(B\) never falls since (17) ensures that changes in \(B\) are nonnegative. Hence, general knowledge always expands. This is not a historically trivial assumption, although it is accurate for the episode under scrutiny: Mokyr (2005, pp. 338–9) notes that knowledge had been lost after previous “efflorescences” (Goldstone 2002) in China and Classical Antiquity, and states that “The central fact of modern economic growth is the ultimate irreversibility of the accumulation of useful knowledge paired with ever-falling access costs.” Turning to the decision to innovate in the first place, we assume that individuals can spend resources on research to develop and build machines with one quality-step improvement. But they will do so only if it is profitable. Specifically, if \(\pi _i = V_i - c_i \ge 0\) then research activity for \(i\)-type machines occurs, otherwise it does not. Thus, As these expressions make clear, applied innovations will not be profitable until Baconian knowledge reaches a certain critical threshold where benefits exceed costs. The natural world needs to be sufficiently intelligible before society can begin to master it (Mokyr 2002). Thus our model embodies the idea that growth in general Baconian knowledge is a necessary but not sufficient condition for output growth. Finally, which type of applied innovations happen first? It turns out that due to a “market size” effect, the sector that innovates first will be the one using the abundant factor, since it is there that there is the greatest potential demand for new machines. We can state this result in the following proposition: If \(Q_{l} = Q_{h}\) and \(L>H\), initial technological growth will be unskilled-labor biased if and only if \(\sigma > 1\). Given \(Q_{l}\) = \(Q_{h}\), the costs of innovation are the same for skilled and unskilled-labor-using machines, and are falling at the same rate. Hence, to show that initial growth will be unskill-labor-intensive, we must demonstrate that initial conditions are such that \(V_{l} > V_{h}\). First, note that we can plug the limit price from (12) into our machine demand Eq. (11), and use the result in our technology coefficient expressions (7) and (8) to get We plug these into the value expressions (13) and (14). After simplifying a bit, we get Computing the ratio of these last two expressions, we see that our condition for innovation to occur first in the \(L\) sector is given the maintained assumption that \(Q_{l}=Q_{h}\). From this we can see that the relative gains for the innovator are larger when the factor capable of using the innovation is large (the “market-size” effect) and when the price of the factor is large (the “price” effect). To get everything in terms of relative factor supplies, we can use (4), (20) and (21), to get a new expression for relative wages: Finally, by plugging this relative wage into the above inequality, and again using the fact that \(Q_{l} = Q_{h}\), and then simplifying, we have Given that \(L/H > 1\), this inequality can only hold if the exponent is negative, which (since \(0 < \beta < 1\)) is true only when \(\sigma > 1\). \(\square \)
 In other words, provided that labor types are grossly substitutable, the initial stages of industrialization have to be unskilled-labor-intensive simply because there are more unskilled laborers in the workforce than skilled laborers. So, to grossly simplify the history of innovation, for most of human existence the inequalities \(\pi _{l} < 0\) and \(\pi _{h} < 0\) held strictly, since Baconian knowledge was so low. Once \(\pi _{l} \ge 0\), industrialization could occur. Once both
\(\pi _{l} \ge 0\) and \(\pi _{h} \ge 0\), robust modern economic growth could occur. With the dynamics of technology defined, we close the model by specifying the dynamics of endowments. Here we adopt a variant of a fairly standard overlapping generations model of demography suited to unified growth theory (cf. Galor and Weil 2000). In a very simplified specification, we assume that ‘adult’ agents maximize their utility, which depends both on their current household consumption and on their children’s expected future income. In an abstraction of family life, we assume that individuals begin life naturally as unskilled workers, accumulate human capital, and then employ that human capital as adults. An agent begins in the first period of life as an unskilled worker; as an adult in the second period of life she is a skilled worker (supplying whatever human capital she accumulated as a child). Thus her welfare will be affected by both types of wages; and given these wages, her adult income will be higher, the higher is her endowment of human capital. Our modeling of demography is as follows. Only ‘adults’ are allowed to make any decisions regarding demography. Specifically, the representative household is run by an adult who decides two things: how many children to have (denoted \(n_{t}\)) and the level of education each child is to receive (denoted \(e_{t}\)). The number of children must be nonnegative and to keep things simple all households are single-parent, with \(n=1\) being the replacement level of fertility. In terms of mapping from data to theory and vice versa, the way to think of \(n\) in the baseline model is as the multiplicative change in population size over a generational period, where \(n\) is the cumulative births per adult (since all adults die). In our model only fertility choice is being modeled, with changing mortality rates being ignored. \(n\) therefore simply equates births per adult to gross population growth per adult, so in the baseline case \(n\) will be calibrated to the population growth rate. In an appendix robustness check we add exogenous shocks to mortality levels, using historical data, to the model specification; we show that adding these, in addition to endogenous fertility shocks, can help us better match the data over the long timeframe of the industrial revolution era without changing the qualitative features of the model’s predictions. The education level is constrained to the unit interval, \(e \in [0,1]\), and is the fraction of time the adult devotes to educating the young. An individual born at time \(t\) spends fraction \(e_{t}\) of her time in school (chosen by her parent), while spending the rest of her time as an unskilled laborer. At \(t+1\), the individual (who is by this time a mature adult) uses whatever human capital she had accumulated as a child. Allowing for the costs of child-rearing, we assume that the household consumes all the income that the family members have generated. At time \(t\) there are \(pop_{t}\) adults, each of whom is an individual household planner. These planners wish to maximize the sum of current household consumption and the future skilled income generated by their children. That is, the representative agent born at time \(t-1\), who is now an adult at time \(t\), faces the problem where \(c_{t}\) is current consumption per household, \(n_{t}\) is the fertility rate, and \(h_{t+1}\) is each child’s level of education. Note that here we assume that agents base their expectations of future wages \(w_{h,t+1}\) on current wages \(w_{h,t}\) in myopic fashion. We assume a simple education technology to map time input \(e\) to human capital \(h\): where \(\Omega > 0\) and \(k>1\). Crucially, this equation embodies increasing returns to the input \(e\), a plausible assumption in low-to-medium schooling environments. Footnote 5
 We now must specify more precisely how household consumption, and the endowments of unskilled and skilled labor, are functions of rates of fertility (\(n_{t}\)) and education (\(e_{t}\)). These variables are related to each other via the following budget constraints and assumed production relations: where \(0 \le \tau \le 1\), \(0 \le x_{1} \le 1\), and \(x_{2} \ge 0\). The first term in (27) is the skilled income generated by the parent minus the parent’s opportunity cost of child-rearing and education. The second term in (27) is unskilled income from the children who spend \(1-e\) of their childhood as unskilled workers. Thus we see that when children are not being educated for a fraction of time \(1-e\), they increase the family’s unskilled income, but this will reduce their own future skilled income because they will receive a lower endowment of \(H\) for use in the next period when they grow up. The final term in (27) is the resource costs of the childens’ education. Note that while having more children involves only an opportunity cost of time \(\tau \) per child (which is duly multiplied by the skilled wages of the parent), each unit of education per child involves both an opportunity cost (captured by \(x_{1}\)) and a resource cost (of some amount \(x_{2}\)). The first of these effects is now totally standard. Having more children typically requires parents to spend more time on child rearing, and having educated children requires more time still.Footnote 6 The second of these effects reflects the costs of educating the offspring to make them more skilled. It is also increasing in the number of children. Our set up is slightly different in that we have both time and resource costs in education per child. We treat both \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\) as exogenous unit costs. In principle these might shift in response to changes in school productivity, input costs, or public policies that subsidize the cost of education. As long as the education cost contains some non-wage elements, and is therefore not linear in \(w_h\), the general assumption that higher wages will lead to more affordable education will be preserved. Public education policies played an increasing role in Britain towards the end of the nineteenth century, and that story and its political economy origins are discussed in Galor and Moav (2006). Although we do not examine the effects of shifts in \(x_{2}\) in this paper, the presence of this term generates sharp income effects which are important for our account of the growth process, as for a given level of \(x_{2}\), growth implies increased affordability of education. Allowing \(x_{2}\) to fall would a fortiori encourage a switch towards skill-biased growth, further enhancing our story. For the purposes of being conservative, and since this effect has been explored elsewhere, we keep \(x_{2}\) constant. There is no doubt but that educational costs were high relative to working class incomes in the early nineteenth century, and that they imposed a binding constraint on the ability of many families to educate their children. Humphries (2010, Chap. 10) provides many examples of children who were prevented from attending school because of the costs involved. School fees could be as high as 18 pence (1.5 shillings) per week. This compared with average weekly wages of 9 shillings and 7 pence in agriculture in 1824, or wages of the order of 20 shillings per week in the textile industry. In addition, there were costs of materials—a copy book might cost a shilling, while some schools might insist on suitable clothes. All this was enough to deter many families, especially when taken together with the opportunity costs of childrens’ time. From the mid-century on, however, adult wages were rising: by the 1890s weekly wages were over 13 shillings in agriculture, and something of the order of 30 shillings in the textile industry (Bowley 1898, 1902). The income-elasticity of education is a potentially important effect in this period, despite its omission from prevailing theories. For example, as noted by Mitch (1982, 1992), influential historians such as Schofield (1973) and West (1975), who might not agree on broader questions, thought rising incomes were important causally, allowing poorer families (with no access to credit) to be able to afford human capital investments. In his own empirical analysis, Mitch (1992, pp. 84–86) finds mixed support for the hypothesis.Footnote 7
Humphries (2010) finds that boys who were lucky enough to have access to free or subsidized schools remained in education for 14 months longer than those whose parents had to pay full fees, suggesting that the costs of education mattered for schooling choices. Similarly, while the sons of casual laborers received less education than the average boy, sons of tradesmen or service providers (who were comparatively well-off) received more. Finally, on the equations defining factor endowments, (28) reflects the idea that only children work as unskilled laborers. (29) illustrates the usable human capital in the economy. This is the total stock of human capital after reflecting the opportunity cost for parents in child-rearing and educating their children. We note that, in this setup, increases in fertility rates will immediately translate into increased levels of unskilled labor, while increases in education will eventually translate into increased levels of skilled labor next period. Thus given our discussion above, wage changes will immediately change the overall population level, and will eventually change the level of human capital in the economy. Given (27), the individual born at \(t-1\) will choose a pair of \(\{n_{t},e_{t}\}\) that maximizes (25), taking perceived wages as given. The first-order condition for the number of children is: The left-hand side illustrates the marginal benefit of an additional child, while the right-hand side denotes the marginal cost. At the optimum, the gains from an extra unskilled worker in the family and more skilled income for children in the future precisely offsets the opportunity and resource costs resulting from additional child-rearing. The first order condition for education is: Again the left-hand side is the marginal benefit and the right-hand side is the marginal cost, this time of an extra unit of education per child. At the optimum, the gains received from more skilled income by children offset the foregone unskilled-labor income and the extra time and resource costs associated with an extra educational unit for all children at \(t\).",1

While part of this growth is attributable to factor accumulation, innovation, and rising revenues from natural resources, the unusually fast pace is also due to the diffusion of technology from more advanced countries that has been termed “catch-up.” Will these countries continue to grow quickly until they catch-up to the technology frontier and then grow through innovation, or will growth slow down while these countries are significantly behind the frontier where they can better exploit externalities from technology diffusion? Emerging economies are not the only countries that have experienced catch-up. Many European countries grew faster than the United States during the 1970s and 1980s. However, early in the 1990s their GDP per capita relative to the U.S. began to stabilize at a value significantly below unity, perhaps providing evidence for the future path of these rapidly growing low income countries. Additionally, over the previous two decades a number of upper-middle income developed countries like Portugal and Italy have been growing at rates slower than innovating countries at the technology frontier like the United States. Are they falling behind despite their best efforts to keep up with the leader, or are there free-rider incentives to let others innovate and push out the frontier that might make falling behind optimal? If the intensity of technology diffusion is endogenous, might some middle-income countries choose to “fall-back” in their relative technology level in order to consume more and grow through the diffusion of new innovations from the frontier?Footnote 1 While there may be other explanations for this behavior, in this paper we provide a simple theory that highlights this fall-back motive to better understand incentives to invest in technology diffusion and innovation and the corresponding output distribution and growth implications. There already exists a large literature studying endogenous innovation and imitation, starting with the early stages of the endogenous growth literature, and a survey or summary of this literature is beyond the scope of this paper. Some of the important contributions are Jovanovic and Rob (1989), Grossman and Helpman (1991), Rustichini and Schmitz (1991), Segerstrom (1991), Aghion et al. (2001), and Mukoyama (2003). Empirical explorations of the early Nelson and Phelps (1966) model based on the theory of technological catch-up (Gerschenkron 1962; Lucas 2009) suggest that the rate of productivity growth depends on the distance to the technology frontier, modulated by factors like human capital (Benhabib and Spiegel 1994, 2005) or political constraints and inertia (Parente and Prescott 1994). Despite presenting compelling empirical findings on the role of technology diffusion in explaining growth, these early papers do not explicitly model economic variables that affect the rate of diffusion as subject to economic choice. Levels of human capital or the political institutions, even if measured, are taken as exogenous. Some of the later literature, for example Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1997), endogenize the investment expenditures in “imitation,” but typically differentiate between leaders, with exogenously specified low innovation costs, and followers, with high innovation but low imitation costs. A related approach is to endogenize the decision to undertake research expenditures that increase the probability of adopting the leader’s technology. For example, in Aghion et al. (2005) countries differ in their profitability as well as their research costs: some find it profitable to engage in investments to optimize their probability of technology adoption, while others with high costs or low profitability may choose zero investments in adoption and keep falling behind.Footnote 2
\(^{,}\)
Footnote 3 More recently in a related approach, Acemoglu et al. (2012) explore the choice of social institutions that may limit inequality via a redistributive social welfare state and thereby reduce the incentives to innovate, compared to a social system that encourages “cutthroat capitalism” and innovation that advances the world technology frontier. They show that in the presence of technology spillovers from the world technology frontier both social systems will coexist in a best response equilibrium. Damsgaard and Krusell (2010) also explore the dynamics of innovation across countries where TFP growth can be driven by spillovers from the TFP technology frontier, which itself is an average of country TFPs and therefore endogenous. The main contribution of our paper is a stylized model in which agents optimally choose the amount to invest in improving growth through innovation as well as through technology adoption. We examine how the efficiency of technology diffusion determines whether agents will ultimately catch-up to the frontier, catch-up part of the way to the frontier and then slow down, fall-back and continue to grow through technology diffusion, or conduct autarkic innovation with no contribution from technology diffusion. In our baseline model, agents are identical except for their initial productivity levels: they do not differ in their costs of investment, production or adoption technologies, or preferences. All agents can affect the rate at which their productivity deterministically grows with expenditures that facilitate technology adoption or innovation at some consumption cost, and they do so optimally. The optimal choice for an agent is a portfolio of imitation and innovation investments, both of which affect the rate at which their productivity grows depending on the relative return of each investment. Innovation is a simple technology with constant marginal productivity that does not benefit from externalities. As imitation facilitates technology diffusion from an agent at the frontier, the productivity of imitation will depend on characteristics of both the agent itself and the agent it is imitating.Footnote 4 This relationship is modeled with a catch-up function that determines the amount of technology diffusion that occurs for a marginal investment in imitation. This catch-up function for technology diffusion nests some of the standard diffusion models, including the logistic, the Gompertz, and the Nelson–Phelps (confined exponential). In this framework technology adoption is gradual. The rate of growth of productivity due to imitation depends on investments that facilitate technology diffusion as well as on a measure of the ease of adopting existing superior technologies—the distance to the technology frontier.Footnote 5
\(^{,}\)
Footnote 6
 Engaging in imitation has a trade-off: the agents gain the advantage of higher productivity as they exploit the diffusion externality, but if they move closer to the frontier, diffusion becomes less efficient and more investment is necessary to maintain their productivity relative to the frontier. These competing forces can eventually balance, where an agent chooses an equilibrium productivity that is permanently below the technology frontier. Moreover, if agents have high relative productivity but the returns to innovation are insufficient, they may choose to endogenously fall-back to a lower relative productivity level to gain the advantage of more efficient technology diffusion. Very low productivity agents, on the other hand, may invest to increase their productivity until the trade-offs are in balance. There is an equilibrium ratio of productivity to the technology frontier defining the innovator threshold. All agents above this threshold choose to invest only in innovation, while all agents below the threshold entirely focus investment expenditures on facilitating technology diffusion. The innovator threshold will depend on the return of innovation relative to imitation for the agents, where the catch-up function determines the rate of technology flow for a unit investment in imitation.Footnote 7
 We define a balanced growth path (BGP) as a path where the productivities of all agents grow at the same rate. Starting from an arbitrary initial distribution, we study the long run distribution of productivities on the BGP, its dependence on fundamental cost and efficiency parameters, and the uniqueness and stability of this equilibrium. We explore how the productivity distribution becomes segmented between those who pursue imitation and those who specialize in innovation. All innovators grow at the same rate, and therefore the ratio of their productivity to the technology frontier remains unchanged. In the limit, the ratio of every imitator’s productivity to the technology frontier converges to a common value that lies below the threshold. All imitators grow at the same rate as the frontier technology with growth only driven by technology diffusion. Imitators do not necessarily disappear in the limit, nor is there universal convergence to the frontier. However, if investment in productivity growth is significantly more efficient through innovation than through adoption, the threshold ratio above which agents only invest in innovation may be zero. Similarly, if the technology for diffusion is sufficiently inefficient, agents who optimally specialize their expenditures on technology diffusion are nevertheless left progressively behind, so that their productivity ratio to the technology frontier converges towards zero. Last, we find that a uniform increase in the productivity of both innovation and imitation will not distort the proportion of agents conducting innovation, but will change the equilibrium productivity of imitating agents. In Sect. 6, we extend the model to allow for heterogeneity and scale effects. In this setup, countries with the same productivity level may produce different levels of output due to scale effects and differing factor endowments. We show that a non-degenerate stationary distribution still exists. Countries of different scale can nevertheless grow at the same rate precisely because technology diffusion acts as a counterbalance to scale effects, allowing growth at the frontier to pull along the followers. An alternative approach to modeling technology diffusion is to consider how agents might adopt the technology of other agents spread throughout the productivity distribution, typically adopting technologies much closer to the mean productivity than the frontier. The recent works of Lucas and Moll (2013) and Perla and Tonetti (2013) endogenize technology adoption as an optimal search decision made by agents taking draws from the distribution of existing technologies. They then study the endogenous evolution of the productivity distribution that results from this search process, without giving agents access to an innovation technology. Both Lucas and Moll (2013) and Perla and Tonetti (2013) work within a stochastic search framework where searching agents copy the technology of a random agent in the economy and immediately make a discrete jump to the new productivity level. Another approach, taken by Luttmer (2011), studies how imitation by new entrants can drive aggregate growth, with the productivity of incumbents evolving according to an exogenous stochastic process as opposed to a controlled innovation decision.Footnote 8 In a recent paper König et al. (2012) obtain rich dynamic results that are similar to ours in that agents optimally choose both to imitate and innovate. In their model innovation is stochastic along a quality ladder while imitation generates stochastic productivity gains through random matching of firms. They characterize the long-run distribution of productivities resulting from innovation and imitation. Our deterministic framework is simpler and features a portfolio choice where agents choose between imitation and innovation. Studying this new mechanism in isolation allows a clear understanding of the incentives to invest in technology diffusion. The endogenous evolution of the frontier generates the key economic incentives for both catch-up as well as fall-back. Both innovation and imitation persist in the limit, and we analytically characterize the full dynamics of catch-up and fall-back, together the with limiting distribution of relative productivities.",1

In almost all industrialized countries, women went from being the property of their husbands and/or their fathers, with very few legal rights, to possessing the same political rights and most of the same economic rights as men. Why did this process occur? And, in particular, why does the spread of women’s rights across the globe appear to be positively correlated with economic development?Footnote 1
 The objective of this paper is to shed light on the relationship between women’s rights and development by focusing on a fundamental economic right: property rights. Property rights include “the legal rights to acquire, own, sell and transfer property, collect and keep rents, keep one’s wages, make contracts, bring lawsuits, and, if seeking divorce, maintain some of the marriage assets and keep control and guardianship of the children.”Footnote 2 These are rights that married women did not exercise in full either in Europe or in the US until the legal system was reformed. Under most legal systems (e.g. those based on Roman civil law, which influenced most of continental Europe, or those based on English common law, like the majority of US colonies), married women lost, if not ownership then, at a minimum, control over their physical (inanimate) property. Upon divorce, they lost guardianship over their children as well. Why did married women eventually obtain property rights in the US and in Europe?Footnote 3 Why did men lose some of the advantages of their privileged status? This paper examines the hypothesis that, over time, economic development—by which I mean primarily a process of capital accumulation and declining fertility—altered the balance of male interests regarding women’s rights. That is, although men in general benefited from a patriarchal society in which women enjoyed few economic and political rights, they also suffered from the system’s welfare consequences for their daughters. My hypothesis is that, at a sufficiently high level of wealth and/or at a sufficiently low level of fertility, a man’s conflicting interests from being both a husband and a father (of girls as well as boys) were resolved in favor of the latter. This eventually led men to favor granting women greater economic rights. This argument is examined in a dynamic model and its implications are studied empirically using variation across US states in the timing of married women’s property acts. The theoretical argument is developed in the context of an economy with endogenous growth in which parents care about their own utility from consumption and the average welfare of their children. In this economy, individuals marry and have children. They then produce, consume, and bequeath capital to their children. Under a patriarchal system in which married women have no property rights (also denoted the “no rights” regime), the household allocation decisions are made entirely by the husband. In an economy where women have the same property rights as men (also known at the “equal property rights” regime), the household allocation weighs both spouses’ welfares equally. At each point in time, one can compare men’s welfare under the two systems of property rights to determine whether reform will occur. The theory yields three main predictions. First, it predicts that growth will eventually lead men to prefer the equal rights regime over the patriarchal one. Male preferences over the system of property rights are shown, however, to be non-monotonic with respect to their level of household wealth. Second, the theory predicts that lower fertility will lead to earlier regime change. This relationship is monotonic. Thus, ceteris paribus, states with lower fertility should reform their property regime sooner. Third, it predicts that states with legal regimes that are initially more favorable to married women should see property rights reform happen later. The main intuition for why the development process eventually leads to reform relies on the asymmetric effect that higher wealth or lower fertility has on the welfare of sons versus daughters. Under the patriarchal regime, both factors improve the welfare of sons more than that of daughters. This is because the patriarchal system effectively imposes an implicit tax on a father’s efforts to increase his daughter’s welfare. Greater bequests do not increase a daughter’s welfare by the same proportion as a son’s since the benefits from the bequest are captured primarily by the daughter’s husband (i.e., by the father’s son-in-law). As household wealth increases, the disparity in sons’ versus daughters’ welfare levels does as well, exacerbating the welfare cost of the patriarchal regime relative to a system of equal property rights. At the same time, greater household wealth makes it less burdensome for a man to share more equally consumption with his wife. I show that there exists a critical level of wealth or fertility at which a father is better off sacrificing the extra consumption benefits he obtains from patriarchy in order to ensure that his sons-in-laws sacrifice their consumption benefits in favor of his daughters. The empirical investigation uses variation across US states in the timing of property rights reform and other key variables. Beginning in the 1840s, US states and territories reformed the laws governing married women’s ownership and control of (real and personal) property and earnings. This was a relatively lengthy process beginning with Massachusetts in 1846 and (for the purposes of this analysis) ending in 1920, with all but four out of 48 states having granted these rights by then. In a series of specifications, I find that states with higher “survival-fertility” tended to reform later.Footnote 4 This positive correlation is robust to the inclusion of a variety of variables, including state fixed effects. Causality cannot be established as there is no instrument for fertility. Using child mortality as a proxy for fertility, however, allows me to rule out some alternative transmission channels. In addition, as implied by the theory, I find that states with legal systems that were relatively more favorable to women (those with a system of community law rather than common law) tended to reform their property laws later. There is no robust relationship, on the other hand, between state per-capita wealth and property rights reform. The paper also examines the degree of empirical support for some alternative explanations for property rights reform. To study the role of women’s bargaining strength, I use various measures of the latter such as women’s relative scarcity or variation in the dates in which states granted suffrage to women. I show that these measures are unable to explain the variation across states in granting property rights. I also explore whether underinvestment in children’s human capital played a role in the reform of women’s property rights, as suggested in Doepke and Tertilt (2009), by using variation across states in the passage of compulsory schooling laws. I show that the data does not support this alternative hypothesis. Lastly, robustness to other measures and dating of key variables is also discussed. The paper is organized as follows. The next section presents a literature review of the main work in this area followed by some historical background on married women’s property rights in the US in the 1800s. Section 3 presents the model, derives the main theoretical results, and discusses the roles of the various assumptions and extensions of the model. Section 4 examines the empirical evidence regarding the relationship between women’s property laws between 1850 and 1920 in the US and state levels of per-capita wealth, survival-fertility, and different legal systems using a variety of estimation methods. Section 5 examines other hypotheses and checks robustness and Sect. 6 concludes. An Appendix collects the proofs and presents some moments of the data.",1
19,1,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-013-9099-8,Inequality and growth: the neglected time dimension,Daniel Halter,Manuel Oechslin,Josef Zweimüller,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Over the past two decades, theoretical work has come up with a substantial number of channels through which inequality may affect economic growth. These contributions have made clear that the impact of inequality on growth is rather complex: Higher inequality may have positive as well as negative consequences for economic performance; moreover, some of these consequences tend to materialize quickly (short-term effects) while others are likely to affect growth only in the medium or long run (lagged effects). This ambiguity is also mirrored in the substantial empirical literature which finds both significantly positive and negative effects—and sometimes no effects at all.Footnote 1
 This paper takes a fresh look at the inequality-growth relationship, both from a theoretical and an empirical perspective. There are two basic contributions. First, the paper introduces a parsimonious theoretical model of inequality and growth that allows for positive as well as negative effects of inequality. The model builds on the observation that the positive effects are mostly short-term effects while the negative consequences tend to set in with a lag. Our theoretical framework is highly tractable and allows us to systematically explore how changes in inequality may affect economic performance at different moments in the future. Second, guided by our theoretical framework, we empirically investigate the inequality–growth relationship, relying on a more comprehensive inequality dataset that covers up to 106 countries over a period from 1965 to 2005. Our model is designed to capture an interesting pattern in the theoretical literature on inequality and growth. As mentioned above, it appears that the growth-enhancing effects of inequality tend to set in quickly while the negative channels are rather slow. To see this, consider some of the main theoretical channels. On the one hand, inequality is said to promote growth by fostering aggregate saving (Kuznets 1955; Kaldor 1955); by promoting the realization of high-return projects (Rosenzweig and Binswanger 1993); or by stimulating R&D (Foellmi and Zweimüller 2006). On the other hand, inequality is expected to hamper growth by promoting expensive fiscal policies (Perotti 1993; Alesina and Rodrik 1994; Persson and Tabellini 1994); by inducing an inefficient state bureaucracy (Acemoglu et al. 2011); by hampering human capital formation (Galor and Zeira 1993; Galor and Moav 2004); by leading to political instability (Bénabou 1996); or by undermining the legal system (Glaeser et al. 2003). Most of the positive effects (e.g., those operating through convex saving functions, market imperfections, or incentives for innovation) rely on purely economic mechanisms. It is therefore plausible to assume that they materialize in the short term. Most of the negative effects, however, involve the political process, the change of institutions, the rise of socio-political movements, or they operate through changes in the educational attainment of the population. Thus, arguably, these effects materialize only with a considerable lag. Our empirical findings are consistent with this basic pattern in the theoretical literature. We find that the short-term effect of inequality on economic performance is positive while the lagged effect is negative. More precisely, our core results suggest that an increase in inequality has a positive impact on the average growth rate of real GDP per capita in the subsequent 5-year period. On the other hand, we find that such an increase reduces the average growth rate in the 5-year period following the initial one. Moreover, the lagged effect tends to be more important quantitatively so that the long-run effect of higher inequality tends to be negative. So, overall, our analysis echoes findings in the more recent literature using panel data (e.g., Forbes 2000, who finds a positive short-term effect) as well as earlier cross-country regression results (e.g., those in Alesina and Rodrik 1994, who find a negative long-run effect). We rely on a sample that spans eight 5-year periods (from \(1965\) to \(2005\) ) and includes up to \(106\) countries. The primary source of the income inequality data is the widely-used Deininger and Squire (1996), henceforth “DS”, dataset.Footnote 2 The secondary source, to which we resort whenever a suitable DS observation is not available, is the UNU-WIDER (2008) World Income Inequality Database (WIID2c). We construct two alternative income inequality time series. The first one uses only “quality-1” WIID observations to amend the DS data while the second one relies on “quality-1” and, secondarily, “quality-2” WIID observations. The advantage of the second series is that the number of missing observations is substantially lower (while a less precise measurement of inequality might be a drawback). It turns out, however, that the basic empirical findings are largely unaffected by the choice of the inequality time series. Our main estimator is the System GMM estimator pioneered by Arellano and Bover (1995) and Blundell and Bond (1998). An important advantage of this estimator (over the related first-difference GMM estimator) is that it also exploits the cross-sectional variation in the data—which accounts for a large share of the total variation.Footnote 3 The System GMM estimator has a one- and a two-step variant, both of which are used in practice. We also apply both alternatives and report the associated results. To scrutinize our empirical analysis further, we experiment with different specifications and growth spells of different length (i.e., 10-year instead of 5-year spells). We find that these additional estimation results corroborate the basic empirical pattern outlined above. Finally, we estimate some of the core specifications using the first-difference estimator as this estimator requires a less restrictive set of assumptions. Yet, perhaps unsurprisingly in the light of the above discussion, the estimated impact of inequality is no longer statistically significant. However, in qualitative terms, some of the results are in line with those based on the preferred System GMM estimator. The present paper is part of a small literature that tries to get a better grasp of the empirical picture with respect to the inequality-growth relationship. Earlier contributions include Banerjee and Duflo (2003), Voitchovsky (2005), and Castelló-Climent (2010). The first-mentioned paper presents evidence suggesting that changes in inequality (in any direction) are associated with reduced growth in the short run; as a result, the standard regression equation might be mis-specified in a way that—misleadingly—makes differences-based estimators indicate a positive relationship. Voitchovsky (2005), by contrast, argues that inequality coming from the top end of the income distribution is indeed likely to promote economic growth while bottom-end inequality tends to be harmful. She therefore suggests controlling separately for inequality coming from different parts of the distribution (and finds supportive evidence in a panel of rich countries). Finally, in line with Barro (2000), Castelló-Climent (2010) argues that the consequences of inequality may be different for poor and rich countries (and indeed finds a positive impact in the subset of the richest economies but a negative one in the large group of less affluent countries). None of these papers, however, deals specifically with the time dimension. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews theoretical arguments and, based on this review, introduces a simple model of inequality and growth. In Sect. 3, we present the empirical analysis. Section 4 concludes.",1

Answering this question is of great importance, not only in order to explain the contemporary differences in prosperity across the world but also for contributing to our understanding of the economic potential for the developing countries of today. The economic evolution from stagnation to growth is a key topic in unified growth theory (see Galor and Weil 2000; Galor 2011). This branch of growth theory explains, in a single coherent framework of analysis, how economies evolve through three fundamental stages of development—from a pre-industrial epoch of stagnation, into a phase of transition which paves the way for a state of sustained economic growth. According to this, in the pre-industrial world, stagnation in living standards, as measured by real income per capita or real wages, is the result of Malthusian stagnation inspired by Malthus 1798: increasing income per capita is a temporary phenomenon since it induces population growth which eventually feeds back and lowers income due to diminishing returns to labor. In this environment even permanent technological improvements will merely increase living standards temporarily and instead lead to a larger population in the long run. However, with the Industrial Revolution this era of stagnation is replaced by a transition phase—the post-Malthusian regime, where income per capita continues to spur population growth but is no longer stagnant since the feedback effect from diminishing returns to labor is counteracted by intensifying technological progress and capital accumulation (Galor 2011). The empirical evidence of Malthusian stagnation for the period 1–1500 CE has been offered recently by Ashraf and Galor (2011) , based on cross-country analysis. For the period beyond this, i.e. from around the mid-1500s when relevant time series data become available, there are a number of studies, focusing on England, which test the dynamic implications of Malthusian stagnation based on annual series of vital rates (births and deaths) and real wages (see e.g. Lee and Anderson 2002; Nicolini 2007; Crafts and Mills 2009). Although the obtained results differ in this literature there seems to be some agreement that at least part of the Malthusian theory is supported (see Sect. 6). This paper revisits these time series for pre-industrial England. However, the main contribution relative to the previous studies of this period is that our econometric framework explicitly allows for the possibility that England might already have been in its transition phase. In particular, while still building on a simple model of Malthusian stagnation we are able to derive and test the econometric implications, i.e. in terms of vector auto regressions (VARs) and cointegration, which seem broadly consistent with the idea of a post-Malthusian regime as described (and explained) by Galor (2011) . From a methodological point of view this paper is thus organized in two steps: in the first we present our model of Malthusian stagnation which builds on three assumptions. The first two are the fundamental Malthusian mechanisms, i.e. that there is a positive effect from income per capita on population growth and that aggregate production exhibits diminishing marginal returns to labor. According to the Malthusian theory the former effect takes place through increased fertility (the preventive check) and/or decreased mortality (the positive check), while the latter mechanism is usually motivated by the presence of a fixed production input, e.g. land.Footnote 2 These two assumptions are then combined with the idea that shocks, or at least some shocks, to technology tend to persist. The latter may for example reflect the cumulative nature of technical knowledge (methods of cultivation and fertilization etc.).Footnote 3 Based on these three assumptions we show how one may analyze the Malthusian model econometrically either as a stationary VAR in the real wage and the vital rates or as a non-stationary VAR, that is a cointegrated VAR (CVAR), in the levels of population and technology.Footnote 4 This analysis provides a coherent way to address existing problems and issues identified in the literature, such as endogeneity of all variables (Lee 1973; Nicolini 2007), sluggish adjustment mechanisms (Lee 1993a), and different orders of integration of interacting variables (Bailey and Chambers 1993; Lee and Anderson 2002).Footnote 5 In the second step we use this econometric framework as a platform for formulating our simple testable hypothesis which we interpret as being consistent with a post-Malthusian regime, where real wages no longer stagnate but remain to have a positive effect on population growth. This hypothesis shows how Malthusian stagnation, in the form of the stationarity of real wages and vital rates, ceases when the adjustment of the former to population is absent. When this is the case the impact on real wages of say, a rise in the technological level remains since there is no downward correction in these when population starts growing. The cumulative property (non-stationarity) of technology is therefore transmitted fully into real wages and further into the vital rates via the Malthusian checks. In particular, this implies cointegration between real wages and vital rates and in addition, if technology has a trend that this will be inherited by real wages. Our post-Malthusian hypothesis thus amounts to a restricted CVAR that arises directly from the otherwise stationary Malthusian VAR (in the real wages and vital rates) when assuming that the size of the population has no effect on real wages. In the Malthusian set-up the independence of real wages on population can only result from the absence of diminishing marginal returns to labor. Although we do not rule out this possibility we show that there is another more plausible interpretation. The basic idea is that instead of simply reflecting the absence of diminishing returns to labor, the lack of influence from population on real wages should rather be viewed as the net-outcome of a Boserupian and/or Smithian positive scale effect from population size on technology, and thus real wages, which offsets the negative Malthusian effect as implied by diminishing returns (see Boserup 1965; Kremer 1993). Thus, we show how one can interpret the lack of stagnation as associated with the post-Malthusian regime and the corresponding CVAR as a result of endogenous technological progress that is driven by population growth and which counterbalances the effect from diminishing returns. We find that a VAR model estimated for the period ca. 1560–1800, based on the data on real wages from Allen (2001) and the vital rates from Wrigley and Schofield (1989), clearly suggests that stationarity as implied by Malthusian stagnation can be rejected. More importantly, our CVAR, which we associate with the post-Malthusian regime, can indeed account for this non-stationarity. The statistical significance of the estimated cointegration relationships describing the positive and preventive checks suggests that population growth was driven by real wages primarily due to preventive checks (working through marriages), whereas there are no or weak positive checks. Moreover, we are able to document the stability of the parameters of the estimated CVAR as well as the robustness of our conclusions to the use of the alternative real wage series from Clark (2005). In some respects, our findings support earlier work. In particular, the finding that pre-industrial England was not “purely Malthusian” is consistent with the work of Nicolini (2007) and Crafts and Mills (2009), where the former in particular highlighted the point that there seems to be insufficient evidence for the hypothesis that population growth lowered real wages. However, we also make significant contributions compared to these previous studies. First of all, finding evidence consistent with a CVAR in real wages and vital rates which can be linked explicitly to the post-Malthusian regime, is new. Secondly, we find a stable preventive check for a much longer period than in the previous analyses. A reason for the latter difference in results may be that we estimate the preventive and positive check parameters as cointegration parameters, that is, as parameters in a non-stationary VAR, as opposed to parameters in a stationary VAR, which is likely to influence the computations of the statistical significance [see e.g. Hoover et al. (2008) for a general discussion of this]. However, by the use of recursive estimation methods, we are in fact able to demonstrate that stationarity of the real wage and vital rates as found in previous studies is likely to be a fragile result, since it seems to be driven by the inclusion of a rather short, rather volatile and, we believe, likely non-representative period in the beginning of the sample (1541 to the mid 1560s). In contrast, non-stationarity, in particular of the type implied by what we term, for the sake of simplicity, our Malthusian–Boserupian model, seems to characterize the majority of this pre-industrial period. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: a simple model of Malthusian stagnation is laid out in the next section. As it has previously posed some difficulties to include marriage behavior (as the foundation for the preventive check) we distinguish between the model with and without the marriage rate.Footnote 6 Section 2.2 derives the econometric implications of both the model with and without marriages and shows that each of these can be represented either as a CVAR in the levels of technology and population size (Sect. 2.2.1), or as a stationary VAR in the observable real wage and vital rates (Sect. 2.2.2). To facilitate the exposition Sect. 2.3 summarizes the conclusions from the technical analysis thus far and shows how previous analyses may be reinterpreted in terms of our econometric framework. In Sect. 3 we show that mean reversion (the “degree of stationarity”) in the VAR in real wages and vital rates will be weak when the negative marginal returns effect is close to zero, and we use this as the basis for deriving the CVAR associated with our post-Malthusian hypothesis. There, we also show that, in addition to the absence of diminishing returns to labor, there is another potential reason for why stationarity of the VAR should cease. This naturally corresponds to the absence of the second Malthusian assumption, i.e. that population growth is independent of income, and we derive the CVAR corresponding to this. In Sect. 3.2 the Malthusian–Boserupian interpretation is laid out. We confront the data in Sect. 4, where we first document the presence of non-stationarity/cointegration (Sect. 4.2), and then test the two CVARs to see whether any of these can account for this (Sect. 4.3). The evidence is clearly in favor of the CVAR corresponding to the post-Malthusian hypothesis. In Sect. 5 we investigate the stability of the parameters of this CVAR as well as the robustness to the use of Clark’s real wage data. We compare our results to those of previous studies in Sect. 6, and sum up and conclude in Sect. 7.",1
19,2,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-013-9100-6,The democratic transition,Fabrice Murtin,Romain Wacziarg,,Male,Male,,Male,"Over the last two centuries, many countries underwent a democratic transition, moving from autocratic regimes with low popular participation in political decision-making and weak constraints on the exercise of executive power to more democratic regimes with broader political participation and greater limits on the exercise of political power. Figure 1 displays the average democracy score for a balanced panel of countries since 1800, using a commonly used measure of democracy (the Polity index). While democratization happened in fits and starts, and did not happen everywhere, there is a general upward trend: the democratic transition. The democratic and economic transitions. The balanced sample is composed of Austria, Belgium, Chile, Denmark, France, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States over the 1800–2000 period. Log GDP per capita is taken from Maddison (2006) and democracy is the Polity index. Missing observations are interpolated The democratic transition partly overlaps with other socioeconomic trends, chiefly the demographic transition, and the process of industrialization and modernization with which it is associated. As shown in Fig. 1, the average level of GDP per has followed the same upward trend as the democracy index in a balanced panel. What are the links between these two transitions? In particular, to what extent did socioeconomic modernization affect the transition toward democratic institutions? This paper takes a long view of history, going back to 1870, to untangle the relationships between democratization and socioeconomic modernization, captured by expanding primary education and rising per capita income levels. We focus mainly on the question of whether education and income are determinants of democracy, and seek to assess their respective impacts on the long-term process of democratization. We examine the two-way relationship between education (or income) and democracy in a large panel of countries starting in 1870, using a variety of modern dynamic panel data methods, including system GMM and recently developed dynamic panel bias correction methods. In a first step, we address the link from economic development to democracy, concentrating on two dimensions of socioeconomic modernity: GDP per capita and average years of schooling among the adult population. In a second stage, we investigate the potential effect of democracy on childhood education, measured by the average years of schooling completed by young cohorts, as well as on the (log) level or the growth rate of GDP per capita. This paper is related to a large literature on the dual relationship between economic development and democracy. One strand of this literature investigated the relationship going from economic development to democracy. In “A Bill for the More General Diffusion of Knowledge” (1779), Thomas Jefferson argued that education was a cornerstone of democracy: “the most effectual means of preventing tyranny would be, to illuminate, as far as practicable, the minds of people at large, and more especially to give them knowledge of those facts, which history exhibiteth, that, possessed thereby of the experience of other ages and countries, they may be enabled to know ambition under all its shapes, and prompt to exert their natural powers to defeat its purposes”. This view was shared by other observers throughout history. For instance, Tocqueville (1835) noted that mass education was a significant factor in sustaining the vigor of democracy in the United States, a leading country in terms of educational attainment over the nineteenth century:Footnote 1 “the education of the people powerfully contributes to the maintenance of the democratic republic. That will always be so, in my view, wherever education to enlighten the mind is not separated from that responsible for teaching morality”.Footnote 2 Building on ideas that go back in time as far as Aristotle, Lipset (1959) argued in a seminal article that improvements in economic standards would ultimately lead to democratization: “the more well-to-do a nation, the greater the chances that it will sustain democracy” . Lipset’s modernization hypothesis received empirical support from Barro (1999), who found, among other variables, that GDP per capita and primary schooling were positive determinants of democracy in a large sample of countries spanning the period from 1960 to 1995. More recently, Boix (2011) found evidence of a positive effect of income per capita on democratization over a long period, and Treisman (2011) found evidence of a positive effect of income on democracy, more strongly over the medium run than over the short run.Footnote 3 However, neither contribution uses dynamic panel data estimation methods nor examines the effect of education variables. In contrast to studies finding evidence supportive of the modernization hypothesis, in two recent studies Acemoglu et al. (2005); Acemoglu et al. (2008) revisited and questioned the empirical significance of the effect of income on democracy. They found that, after controlling for country fixed-effects, GDP per capita was no longer a significant determinant of democracy.Footnote 4 In other recent studies, Bobba and Coviello (2007) as well as Castelló-Climent (2008) re-examined the evidence. The former isolated a significant effect of GDP per capita using a system-GMM estimator, while the latter found a significant effect of education attained by the majority of population, even after controlling for fixed-effects. However, Benhabib et al. (2011) recover a significant effect of GDP per capita even when controlling for fixed effects once taking into account the censoring of the democracy index. In sum, there remains a debate on the validity of Lipset’s hypothesis, a debate to which the current paper contributes by taking a long view of history, applying dynamic panel econometric methods, and focusing on the role of education in addition to income. Another strand of the literature explored the consequences of democratization on economic performance and on the expansion of schooling. The evidence in favor of such effects is mixed. For instance, Barro (1997) found a nonlinear effect of democracy on growth, with an initial increase in growth and a negative relation once a given level of democracy has been reached. Tavares and Wacziarg (2001) uncovered a positive effect of democracy on human capital accumulation and a negative effect on physical capital accumulation, while Rodrik and Wacziarg (2005) found a positive short-term effect of democratization on economic growth, but no effect at longer horizons and no effect when democracy was sustained for long periods. More specifically related to education, Lindert (2004) documented how the extension of the franchise in Europe’s rising democracies gradually led to the introduction of public funding for education over the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, but he did not provide empirical evidence on the direction of causality between schooling and democracy. The two-way relationship between education and democracy is at the core of an important debate on the fundamental sources of economic prosperity. Does education help raise the quality of institutions as well as productivity, or is an efficient institutional framework a prerequisite for expanding education levels and economic growth? The issue of the direction of causality between education and democracy has ignited a debate between the advocates of institutions as the prime engine of growth (Acemoglu et al. 2001, 2002), and the proponents of a different thesis, who view human capital as the root cause of economic development (Glaeser et al. 2004, 2007; Glaeser and Campante 2009). Sorting out the respective effects of democracy and education upon each other would shed some light on this broader debate. This paper makes three contributions that jointly set it apart from the existing literature. First, using the Morrisson and Murtin (2009) dataset of educational attainment in 74 countries since 1870, we find strong empirical support for the modernization hypothesis. Second, we show that primary schooling, more so than GDP per capita, and more so than secondary and tertiary education, has been a major factor in the democratic transition over 1870–2000. Third, using state-of-the-art dynamic panel data techniques such as system GMM and a recently developed bias-correction estimator by Bun and Carree (2005), we address the issue of reverse causality and find no robust evidence of an effect of democracy on education or GDP per capita. In doing so, we incorporate recent advances in dynamic panel data methods, and address issues of weak instruments, instrument proliferation and violations of stationarity assumptions that have been found to be endemic to cross-country analyses relying on dynamic panel specifications. Section 2 describes empirical regularities related to democracy and development over the 1870–2000 period. Section 3 describes the econometric specification and estimation methods used in this paper. Section 4 reports empirical tests the modernization hypothesis using a long time series, while Sect. 5 addresses the reverse relationship, from democracy to education and income. The last section concludes.",1

Cook,,,Female,,,Female,"Following the emancipation of slaves after the Civil War, race-related violence escalated in the South in the 1870s and spread to other parts of the country by the end of the nineteenth century. Such conflict was often related to the absence or diminished enforcement of the rule of law.Footnote 2
 Major race riots are one indicator of hate-related violence. As reported in Table 1, these events were occasionally politically motivated and were sometimes associated with mob violence and election disputes; blacks were usually, but not always, the targets of race riots. This paper includes only riots that resulted in major violence and loss of life and property and that received national media coverage. There were many smaller riots. Yet, data have not been systematically collected on minor riots, and I exclude them from this paper. In the historical literature there is no universally-accepted set of sufficient conditions that would predict race riots during this period. Race riots frequently had legal and political consequences, such as the imposition of martial law and the ousting of democratically elected black and moderate white officials, along with economic consequences, such as looting of black business districts and destruction of entire black farms, firms, and residential neighborhoods.Footnote 3 Riots were largely concentrated in the South before 1900 and in the North after 1900. The effects of violence on black economic activity would have been both direct—for example, black inventors’ workshops were located in the affected business districts—and indirect—for example, riots lower the value of commercial and residential property (Collins and Margo 2003), which would reduce financing opportunities and increase operating costs. Riots often had consequences far beyond their cities and states of origin. The East St. Louis race riots in May and July 1917 involved a mob of nearly 3,000 white men, several lynchings, as many as 150 black deaths, and extensive damage to black homes and white firms, including a warehouse of the Southern Railway Company (Garvey 1917/1983; New York Times
1917). In support of the victims and in protest of the failure of East St. Louis and other authorities to protect their citizens, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) organized a “silent march” of 15,000 people down Fifth Avenue in New York City in late July 1917. Historian John Hope Franklin writes, “It was the epidemic of race riots that swept the country early in the century that aroused the greatest anxiety and discomfort among the African-American population.... Riots were perceptibly increasing, and their dramatic nature had the effect of emphasizing the insecurity of blacks throughout the country” (Franklin and Moss 1994, p. 313). Lynching also may be considered a proxy for absence of the rule of law.Footnote 4 Whereas race riots involved opposing groups, lynchings typically involved a group taking action against a specific individual or individuals. In addition to killing the victim, often a secondary objective was the externality a lynching produced—to intimidate the victim’s family, community, or ethnic or racial group.Footnote 5 A lynching signaled that personal security—and with it the freedom to work and innovate—was not guaranteed.Footnote 6
 Table 1 shows that lynchings peaked for black and white victims in the 1890s.Footnote 7 Most lynchings occurred in the South, and most victims were African American. As the table indicates, the average number of lynchings with African American victims each year varied greatly. Although data on lynching are recorded through 1968, the practice had largely stopped by 1930. Media coverage of lynchings spread awareness of the violence. For much of the nineteenth century, lynchings received local coverage in black- and white-owned newspapers, and nationally through newspapers in major urban areas and publications of the NAACP, other national civil rights organizations, and nascent anti-lynching movements.Footnote 8 International attention grew through newspapers and organizations, including the British Anti-Lynching Committee formed in 1894 to protest the lynchings of southern blacks. Although the direct effect of lynching was likely primarily local, its indirect effect—a growing and general sense of diminishing protection in the courts and among law-enforcement bodies—was national.Footnote 9
 Other measures associated with violence are the timing and extent of Jim Crow legislation, which often legitimated acts of violence and created or reflected the social and political environment of the day. A flurry of laws promoting segregation followed the period of Reconstruction. As Table 1 shows, laws advancing segregation were primarily related to education and public facilities.Footnote 10 Segregation laws had two direct effects. First, and most important, they were proxies for latent violence. Jim Crow legislation formalized customary practices and allowed few legal safeguards for minorities. Residents of a given state understood that violence would occur if the laws were not obeyed. Litwack (1998) argued that lynch mobs and the courts were the de facto enforcers of Jim Crow laws.Footnote 11 In explaining “racial cleansings” in which blacks were abruptly driven out of counties both North and South, Jaspin (2007) offered an additional direct effect of segregation laws. He argued that the greater the number of and adherence to Jim Crow laws, the fewer the encounters between African Americans and whites and the greater the degree of anxiety, mistrust, and suspicion between the races, which could lead to spontaneous outbreaks of violence.Footnote 12 In this paper, the number of segregation laws was included to capture the taste for and degree of segregation and latent violence across states. Passage of segregation laws also decreased access to patenting institutions and to social networks and institutions that support invention and innovation.Footnote 13 The offices of patent attorneys (all white at the time) were in “white-only” commercial districts, hindering African American inventors from applying for patents.Footnote 14 With little recourse to the courts, African Americans would have found it nearly impossible to fight patent infringement, even if they had been represented by white attorneys.Footnote 15 Networking opportunities were also limited. Segregation of public buildings led to “Negro Day” during major scientific fairs or “Negro fairs” that were completely separated from major exhibitions.Footnote 16 Unequal access to education, which became increasingly important to patenting over the course of the twentieth century, also likely deterred patenting.
 Figure 1 shows that, before the early 1900s, patenting rates among African Americans followed a pattern increasingly similar to that of the larger inventor population, albeit at a much lower level. Like overall patent rates, African American patent rates were procyclical, increasing with economic booms.Footnote 17 Black patent activity became countercyclical at the turn of the century. As Fig. 2 suggests, black inventors began responding to incentives or conditions that did not affect other inventors. Specifically, a rise in race-related violence coincided with greater divergence in patenting rates between black and white inventors. I test the validity of this apparent correlation statistically using new data on African American inventors as described below.

19,3,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-014-9103-y,Africa is on time,Maxim Pinkovskiy,Xavier Sala-i-Martin,,Male,Male,,Male,"In 2012, the World Bank confirmed that the world as a whole reached the Millennium Development Goal poverty target 5 years ahead of the deadline in 2015. However, this impressive achievement was mainly attributed to the growth performance of East and South Asia, and of China in particular. In particular, the 2013 United Nations Development Program notes that “Extreme poverty rates have fallen in every developing region, with one country, China, leading the way...Poverty remains widespread in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia, although progress in the latter region has been substantial (United Nations 2013).” It is also believed that most of the recent African growth is due to rising oil and natural resource prices, which entails a redistribution of income from mineral-poor countries to mineral-rich countries (Collier 2006). Moreover, gains from natural resource wealth are believed to accrue to very narrow elites and to be irrelevant for poverty reduction. In this paper, we combine national accounts estimates of African GDP with survey estimates of African inequality under parametric assumptions to estimate income distributions for African countries, and compute their poverty rates for the period 1990–2011. Our results show that the conventional wisdom that Africa is not reducing poverty quickly enough to achieve the MDGs on time is wrong. In fact, since 1995, African poverty has been falling steadily. Moreover, contrary to the commonly held idea that African growth is largely based on natural resources and helps only the rich and well-connected, we show that Africa’s income distribution has become, if anything, less rather than more unequal than it was in 1995, and therefore, that a great deal of this growth has accrued to the poor. We find that the African countries for which we have a reasonable amount of inequality dataFootnote 1—which contain 78 % of Africa’s population and 32 out of its 47 countries—will achieve the Millennium Development Goal of halving poverty in the target year of 2015. Our sensitivity analysis suggests that, changing our procedure in various ways, including changing the GDP series used, changing the surveys used, and employing different assumptions for the behavior of inequality at the end of the sample period for which data is poor, delays this date by at most 5 years.Footnote 2 Moreover, not only has poverty fallen in Africa as a whole, but this decline has been remarkably general across types of countries that the literature suggests should have different growth performances. In particular, poverty fell for both landlocked as well as coastal countries; for mineral-rich as well as mineral-poor countries; for countries with favorable or with unfavorable agriculture; for countries regardless of colonial origin; for both democratic and nondemocratic countries, and for countries with below- or above-median slave exports per capita during the African slave trade.Footnote 3
 For countries with fewer than two income or consumption surveys, we cannot capture the trend of inequality and therefore must be cautious. However, if the behavior of their within-country inequality is similar to that of the remaining African countries for which we do have data, we can analyze poverty reduction in all of Africa. Based on this analysis, we conjecture that the MDG will be achieved in Africa as a whole by 2018, three years after the target. We show that this conjecture is robust to a variety of assumptions on the evolution of within-country inequality in countries with poor survey data, although all of these conjectures are somewhat ad hoc, unlike our analysis of the African countries with reasonable survey data. The primary reason for the MDG being achieved a few years late is the aftermath of the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (hereafter, DRC; formerly, Zaire), which devastated the country and from which it is still in the process of recovery. According to our calculations, Africa without Congo will achieve the millennium development goal of halving the 1990 poverty rate by 2014. Two papers closest in spirit to ours are Sala-i-Martin (2006) and Pinkovskiy and Sala-i-Martin (2009), which use nonparametric and parametric methods of recovering within-country income distributions from grouped survey data and aggregate country distributions to obtain the world distribution of income. However, while they forecast that the world as a whole will achieve the MDGs before 2015, they did not make such a prediction for Africa because Africa’s growth spurt was still in its early stages at the time of writing. Bourguignon and Morrisson (2002) analyzed the world distribution of income by combining national accounts and survey-based inequality measures, but their paper considered a period before the African growth began. Other researchers, e.g. Chen and Ravallion (2004, 2010), have noted that world poverty (and, in 2010, African poverty) is falling, but concluded that the speed of the African poverty decline is small because they used survey means rather than national accounts data as anchors for the within-country inequality distributions. We will discuss the role of using national accounts rather than survey means in Sect. 2. Recently, Young (2012) estimated Africa’s growth rate using changes in demand for goods consumed by the poor as expressed in the Demographic and Health Surveys, and argued that the national accounts substantially underestimate African growth rates. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief description of the data and the statistical procedure to estimate the income distributions of African countries and of groups of African countries in every year in the sample period. Section 3 describes the evolution of the income distributions for African countries with reasonable survey data. Section 4 analyzes the evolution of poverty rates for African countries with reasonable survey data and provides robustness checks. Section 5 discusses the evolution of poverty for various African regions. Section 6 discusses African inequality. Section 7 discusses poverty reduction in countries without good survey data and makes conjectures on poverty in Africa as a whole. Section 8 concludes.",1

M. Florax,William A. Masters,Male,Male,Male,Male,"This paper addresses the role of physical geography in the timing and location of urbanization. Our central hypothesis is that, for any given place, higher local agricultural potential and lower physical barriers to transport facilitate the earlier establishment of cities and subsequent economic growth in the associated region. This relationship could help explain late urbanization and the persistence of rural poverty in geographically disadvantaged regions, and help guide intervention to overcome agricultural and infrastructural obstacles to economic transformation. Our focus on the initial formation and early growth of cities is consistent with new work that links events in the distant past to countries’ current state of economic development (Galor 2011; Nunn 2014). Many of these studies rely on variation in geography and climate to explain economic outcomes, either directly or indirectly. Sokoloff and Engerman (2000) showed that climate and soils favorable to plantation crops led to institutions that concentrated and preserved power among landholding elites. Similarly, Acemoglu et al. (2001) linked differences in disease ecology and the mortality of colonial settlers to the kinds of institutions they established in the New World, Nunn (2008) exploits variations in terrain and elevation to identify the impact of Africa’s historic slave trade on modern outcomes, and Nunn and Qian (2011) find that the parts of Europe and Asia naturally more suitable for growing potatoes experienced accelerated rates of population growth and urbanization after potatoes were imported from South America. Meanwhile, a related stream of work focuses on people rather than places, looking for population traits acquired long ago, their transmission across generations, and their persistent effects on economic development (Spolaore and Wacziarg 2013). In this literature, the roots of economic growth are traced back to events such as early technology adoption (Comin et al. 2010), ethnolinguistic diversity (Michalopoulos 2008) and genetic diversity (Ashraf and Galor 2013), which in turn may be traced back to physical geography. Jared Diamond’s Guns, Germs, and Steel is among the most popular expositions of geography’s role in shaping human history (Diamond 1997). Diamond focuses on soil fertility and the presence of edible plants, potentially domesticated wildlife, and infectious diseases, tracing their role in the development of ancient societies around the world. Olsson and Hibbs (2005), in a direct test of Diamond’s hypotheses, use continent size, east-west orientation, climate, and availability of potentially domesticated plants and animals to explain the timing of a region’s transition into sedentary agriculture. In their empirical results, they find significant evidence in support of Diamond’s hypothesis. Putterman (2008), in an extension of Olsson and Hibbs (2005), refines the analysis by observing these variables’ effects on population density in the year 1500 as well as on modern-day income, controlling for the transmission of agricultural technologies via migration. A more formal test of the hypothesis of historic populations correlating with modern economic outcomes appears in Putterman and Weil (2010). Additional evidence in support of the geography hypothesis is presented in Ashraf and Galor (2011), who show that the date of a population’s first transition into agriculture, as determined by its location’s suitability for agriculture, helps explain the level of population density and technological achievement thousands of years later. However, more recently, Ashraf and Galor (2013) show that the aforementioned hypothesized relationship between the date of urbanization and present-day income does not hold when continent fixed effects are accounted for. This gives reason to suspect that it may not be the timing of urbanization but rather, unobservable (or mis-measured observable) factors at the continent level that drive the findings of the relationship between early urbanization and modern-day incomes.Footnote 1
 Urbanization at a given location is a readily observed and particularly interesting aspect of economic history. One can think of city formation as among the most visible manifestations of a break from farm households’ Malthusian dependence on local natural resources, to increasing reliance on man-made capital, specialization and agglomeration (Lucas 2000).Footnote 2 Variation in the timing of urbanization has been linked to differences in institutional quality, total factor productivity, and geography (Gollin et al. 2002; Ngai 2004). Economic transition itself entails a variety of contemporaneous changes, including rising productivity in both agriculture and manufacturing; sectoral shifts in employment, output and expenditure from agriculture to manufacturing and services; and a demographic transition in mortality, fertility and the age structure of the population (Kuznets 1973; Williamson 1988). We focus on just one aspect of economic transition, which is the shift from rural to urban residence. Our approach to economic geography utilizes global grid cell data, disaggregating the whole world into regular cells defined only by their latitude and longitude. One of the first papers on economic growth to exploit such data directly is Masters and McMillan (2001), who test a variety of possible influences on cell-level population density, and then aggregate cell-level attributes to the country level to test their relationship with national per capita income growth. More recently, Nordhaus (2006) disaggregates all economic activity into \(1^{\circ }\) by \(1^{\circ }\) cells, and finds the level of activity to be highly correlated with climate and topography. Economic data rendered in grid cell units, as opposed to political, administrative, or other geographic regions, offer important advantages for empirical analysis. Such regions are smaller than most countries or even provinces, and thus offer a larger number of distinct observations. The boundaries of each observation are defined arbitrarily in regular intervals of geographic coordinates and not subject to the potential endogeneity of administrative boundaries.Footnote 3 The corresponding challenge is to allocate socioeconomic activity across grid cells, with the underlying data originally being collected on the basis of administrative boundaries. We begin by motivating our model specification in terms of the broader literature on agriculture’s link to urbanization and economic growth. We then present the data, whose spatial autocorrelation rules out the null hypothesis that the timing of urbanization occurs in a spatially random fashion. Spatial dependence can be due to spatially correlated omitted variables, or to spatial interactions between cells through common institutions, trade, migration, investment and other channels (McMillen 2003). To control for many different types of distance-dependent spatial processes, we employ a very general spatial econometric approach that uses neighbors’ information to provide a heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) estimator (see Anselin 2000, p. 931). The specific HAC-approach we use is a non-parametric estimator for spatial data developed by Kelejian and Prucha (2007). Using these statistical controls for unobserved influences on the timing of urbanization, we find that each cell’s agro-climatic suitability for agriculture still correlates closely with earlier city growth in a statistically significant way, with a particularly strong link at early stages of urbanization. Access to low-cost transportation also facilitates city growth, particularly in its later stages. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 motivates the examination of geography’s relationship to economic transition. Sections 3, 4, 5 introduce the data and the econometric model, and present and discuss the empirical results. Section 6 concludes.",1

Justin Cook,,,Female,,,Female,"The great disparities in productivity that are seen throughout the world today are not new. As of 500 years ago great variations in technology, state development, and industry were obvious across states and continents; most notable is the distinction between Europe and sub-Saharan Africa. Europe was in the middle of the Renaissance, had complex systems of state organization, numerous divisions of labor, and was making great strides in seafaring, while Africa was vastly under populated and relatively under developed. What are the causes of variations in historic development? It is known that Eurasia contained advantages in initiating and spreading agriculture, but are there other factors which led to larger precolonial populations? Why did Europe in particular have an advantage over other Eurasian states? This paper argues the variation in an important food source, milk, is significantly related to economic development in the precolonial era. The Neolithic Revolution changed the environment in which humans lived.Footnote 1 Furthermore, this change occurred at different times for different peoples; implying, certain groups have had a longer time to adapt to the new environment. In the words of Clark (2008, p. 6; Galor and Moav 2002), “The Darwinian struggle that shaped human nature did not end with the Neolithic Revolution but continued right up until the Industrial Revolution.” A major adaptation to the agricultural lifestyle is the ability to consume milk, or to be lactase persistent.Footnote 2 Milk is an additional resource that some could consume, while others could not. In the Malthusian economy of the precolonial era, this variation in the consumption of milk is hypothesized to be associated with the productivity of workers. In accordance with the Malthusian theory of Ashraf and Galor (2011), the increased productivity of lactase persistent workers led to a temporary increase in income and a permanent increase in populations. I therefore seek to explain differences in population density in 1,500 CE as a function of a country’s frequency of lactase persistence. Frequencies of lactase persistence are available by ethnicity for the second half of the twentieth century (Ingram et al. 2009a). A central assumption is that these frequencies have not changed much over the past 500 years.Footnote 3 However, it is unlikely that country-level ethnic compositions are unchanged since 1,500 CE; therefore, a measure of ethnic compositions for 1,500 CE is needed. Through the use of migration data for the past 500 years, I am able to back out ethnic compositions for the year 1,500 CE. And assuming gene frequencies have remained relatively stable over this period, this allows for the creation a country-level measure for the frequency of lactase persistence in 1,500 CE.Footnote 4
 The constructed measure of lactase persistence has a positive and significant association with population density in 1,500 CE. My baseline estimate states that a one standard deviation increase in the fraction of lactase persistent individuals within a country is associated with roughly a 40 % increase in population density. This relationship is robust to the inclusion of a number of valid controls as well as differing sample specifications. In particular, the effect of lactase persistence is not driven by the overarching advantages of an earlier transition to agriculture, which have been documented extensively (see e.g., Hibbs and Olsson 2004; Putterman 2008). A number of papers have established an empirical link between the past and current economic events (for review, see Nunn 2009).Footnote 5 The current work seeks to build upon this research by contributing to the explanation of historical differences in development. One of the most comprehensive works in explaining precolonial populations, and therefore, precolonial development, is Diamond’s Guns, Germs, and Steel (1997). Diamond’s main argument is that societies on the Eurasian continent contained a geographical advantage in both initiating and spreading agriculture. In particular, the geographical advantages of Eurasia are the number of domesticable species (plants and animals) and the East-West orientation of the continent, where the former is associated with an ease of initiating agriculture and the latter an ease of agricultural diffusion. These advantages allowed for an earlier transition to, and a more widespread use of, agricultural practices; which in turn, allowed for large populations, the development of cities and states, the specialization of labor, and, ultimately, a head start in the acquisition of material prosperity. Diamond’s hypothesis is tested by Putterman (2008) and Hibbs and Olsson (2004), who find a positive correlation between agricultural transition dates and wealth levels in 1,500 CE. The most tangible difference between the two papers is in the way agricultural transition dates are calculated: Putterman uses archaeological facts in calculating the dates for particular countries, while Hibbs and Olsson use biogeographic and geographic conditions in order to estimate the transition dates for regions. Instead of archaeological evidence or environmental estimates, I use an observed genetic difference between societies as a predictor of past economic development. This genetic difference is primarily driven by differences in culture; and through the process of natural selection, this information has been passed through generations of humans until today. In other words, the use of genetic variations provide a quantitative measure of historic differences that may be used to measure the usage or availability of a cultural or environmental advantage that is conferred to some societies and not others. A number of recent papers explore the effect that genetics may have on aggregate economic outcomes (see, e.g., Ashraf and Galor 2013; Spolaore and Wacziarg 2009). In general, these papers use broad genetic variation measures between, and within, particular countries to explore differing economic outcomes, historic and current. This paper differs by the use of a particular gene variant, not differences in the general genetic make-up of a population. The current work uses variation in an expressed genetic trait which has been naturally selected for since the Neolithic Revolution. To my knowledge, this is the first paper to explore the effect of a single genetic adaptation on aggregate economic conditions. A similar work by Nunn and Qian (2011) explores how the introduction of the potato to the Old World has affected populations in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. They show that exogenously determined soil conditions, which are favorable for potato production, account for 25–26 % of the population increase from 1700 to 1900 and 27–34 % of the increased urbanization rate in the same time period. Both the current work and that of Nunn and Qian explore how the addition, or varied use, of a particular food source affects historic populations. A slight difference, however, is found in quantifying the spread of the respective food sources; Nunn and Qian use soil conditions, whereas I use the observed differences of an underlying genetic variation. The role of natural selection since the Neolithic Revolution has also been studied in recent research. Theoretically, Galor and Moav (2002) establish a unified model that captures the evolution of both man and economic outcomes, while Galor and Michalopoulos (2012) show the selection for particular traits since the beginning of agriculture. Empirically, Galor and Moav (2007) show adaptation since the initiation of agriculture has a statistically significant relationship with contemporary variations in aggregate health measures. The work of Galor and Moav (2007) implies that differences have developed since the Neolithic Revolution and that these differences may be correlated with differing economic outcomes. The first direct evidence of milk consumption is from Northwest Anatolia in 7,000 BCE (Evershed et al. 2008). The practice of dairying diffused to Eastern Europe by 6,000 BCE and to Britain by 4,000 BCE (Craig et al. 2005; Copley et al. 2003). Outside of Eurasia, the first evidence of dairying occurred roughly 7,000 years ago in North African grasslands, which are presently found in the Saharan Desert (Dunne et al. 2012). The consumption of milk today ranges from cows in Europe, America, Australia, and Africa to camels and goats in the Middle East, reindeer in the Arctic, mares and asses in the Eurasian steppe, and water buffalo in Southeast Asia (World Health Organization 2009).Footnote 6 There is considerable evidence that milk stimulates growth, increases bone density, and provides essential vitamins and minerals (Hoppe et al. 2006). Milk is an incredibly complex liquid that contains fats, proteins, vitamins, and minerals. Along with quality advantages to diet, milking also allowed early farmers and pastoralists to obtain a greater number of calories from a fixed number of cattle. Through the qualitative and quantitative attributes of milk, greater populations could be supported for a fixed quantity of land. In terms of the Malthusian theory of Ashraf and Galor (2011), workers able to consume milk were able to produce greater levels of output (e.g., milk, cheese, etc.). The increased level of output associated with lactase persistent workers led to a temporary wage increase for these workers. This increase in wage for a segment of the population resulted in a greater demand for offspring amongst this segment, which ultimately increased the population while keeping output per worker, or income, constant. This had two effects: First, this provides a theoretical relationship between lactase persistence and population density in the precolonial era. Second, this is the basic premise for the natural selection of lactase persistence. The quantitative advantages in the ability to digest lactose are apparent. Consider two farmers (or pastoralists) with identical numbers of cattle (or some other milk producer). One of the farmers is able to digest milk, while the other is not. The farmer who is able to digest milk immediately gains an additional resource from his set herd of cattle. Moreover, the farmer who is able to digest milk can now support a larger family, which in turn has the effect of increasing the population and increasing the percent of lactase persistence within the population. It is not necessarily the case that strict specialization in milk production is required to increase population densities. This paper argues that the supplementation of the additional resource is enough to improve precolonial population levels. Horticulture can supply vastly more calories per acre than any husbandry technique (Cooper and Spillman 1917). A homogenous diet of a few grains, however, led to adverse health effects in early farmers (Cohen and Armelagos 1984). The addition of fats, proteins, vitamins, and minerals found in milk provided a healthy balance to the early farmer’s diet, which, in turn, allowed for longer lives and greater populations. According to the World Health Organization (2009, p. 3): “The profile of amino acids in milk complement those in grains and cereals, which is of considerable benefit in communities where grains and cereals predominate.” Additionally, Nunn and Qian state (2011, p. 7): “\(\ldots \) a single acre of land cultivated with potatoes and one milk cow was nutritionally sufficient for feeding a large family of six to eight.”Footnote 7 Considering two societies with equal resources, the society that is able to digest milk gains a qualitative dietary advantage that improves health and therefore population. In addition to the direct effects of consumption, the availability of milk may have increased the fecundity of early sedentary women. Postpartum amenorrhea, or infertility, is positively related to the length of time an infant weans (Jain et al. 1970; World Health Organization 1998). The use of animal milk as a substitute for mother’s milk reduces weaning time, thereby shortening the postpartum infertility period.Footnote 8 Implying, a mother who had access to milk would have been able to give birth to a larger number of children over her life span, providing another mechanism for the hypothesized positive relationship between dairying and populations. A sugar found in milk, lactose, is responsible for the exclusivity in consumption. The enzyme required to break down lactose, lactase, is found within the small intestine.Footnote 9 If this enzyme is not present, the lactose will pass to the colon causing diarrhea or cramping to occur (Simoons 1969). Like all mammals, humans produce lactase from birth until the end of weaning in order to digest the numerous nutrients that are passed from mother to offspring.Footnote 10 Certain populations of humans, however, have acquired an allele, or gene variant, that allows for the production of lactase throughout their adult lives; this is known as lactase persistence.Footnote 11 Considering that the vast majority of humans, and all other mammals, are unable to produce lactase beyond the weaning period, it must be the case that the inability to drink milk into adulthood is the original state (Simoons 1969). Accordingly, the ability to digest milk, or to be lactase persistent, is one of the most famous cases for continued evolution in humans (Ingram et al. 2009a). The Neolithic Revolution radically changed the environment for humans, and this change occurred at different times for different peoples. This implies that certain groups have had a longer time to evolve, or adapt, to the new environment, and one adaptation is the continued production of lactase. Burger et al. (2007) show that the allele, or gene variant, that allows for lactase persistence in Europeans is absent, or rare, in early Neolithic Europeans. Additionally, Plantinga et al. (2012) explore the frequency of the gene variant associated with lactase persistence amongst Late Neolithic (5,000–4,500 YBP) populations of southwest Europe, finding a frequency well below modern levels. Considering that Europeans have the highest levels of lactase persistence in the world, the findings of Burger et al. and Plantinga et al. imply that the ability to digest lactose into adulthood is a new phenomenon that gives a significant advantage to its possessors. Toward this end, Bersaglieri et al. (2004) find that the differences in lactase persistence frequencies are due to a strong positive selection of an allele that allows for milk consumption occurring in the past 5,000-10,000 years, a time range that is consistent with the domestication of cattle and other milk producing domesticates. This advantage is estimated in Bersaglieri et al. (2004) who find that the ability to continually produce lactase has a selective advantage between .014 and .15: this implies that a population of 1,000 individuals that are able to produce lactase throughout their lives will have between 14 and 150 more offspring per generation compared to individuals without the ability to produce lactase.Footnote 12 Furthermore, the gene variant that confers lactase persistence is the “textbook” example of a selective sweep (Nielsen et al. 2005; Ingram et al. 2009a).Footnote 13
 If no cattle were available, and therefore no milk, then no advantage is had by producing lactase past the weaning period. Therefore, the availability of milk is a necessary condition for the rise in frequencies of lactase persistence. This co-evolution of dairying and lactase persistence is formally known as the “Cultural Historical Hypothesis” and is attributed to Simoons (1970). According to Simoons: Such an advantage most likely would occur in groups, not necessarily pastoral, that not only enjoyed a plentiful milk supply, but that had other foods inadequate in amount and quality, and that did not process milk into products low in lactose. Under these conditions, the lactase aberrant adults would better multiply, and would more successfully defend their families against others. And in their numerous descendants, high levels of adult lactase activity would come to prevail. The “Cultural Historical Hypothesis” has received considerable attention lately with the discovery that the origination of lactase persistent alleles have coincided with the proposed dates of the domestication of cattle (Coelho et al. 2005; Mulcare 2006; Bersaglieri et al. 2004; Tishkoff et al. 2007). One concern in establishing the relationship between the frequency of lactase persistence and precolonial development is that lactase persistence may just be a proxy for the origination of animal husbandry; whereby the frequency of lactase persistence is an increasing function of the years since the domestication of a particular mammal. While it is true that the availability of milk, or cattle, is a necessary condition for the evolution of lactase persistence, it is not, however, a sufficient condition. Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Near East, and the Middle East have had access to milk for as long, or longer, than Northern Europeans, yet these areas have significantly lower levels of lactase persistence (Simoons 1978). Differences in dairying also have a cultural significance. The use of lactase persistence frequencies intends to measure the advantages of dairying, not animal husbandry. A further, and potentially more problematic, concern is reverse causality. As will be explained in Sect. 2, the data for lactase persistence are for contemporary populations. The use of historic population density and contemporary frequencies of lactase persistence provides for the possibility that higher population density led to an increase in the frequency of lactase persistence. One mechanism for this potential reverse–causal relationship is tied to the role of infectious disease, which is more prevalent in dense populations. Holding constant relevant factors, population size remains constant during the Malthusian era. Infectious disease, which has a positive association with population density, leads to an increase in the mortality rate, and given the consistency of the population, this increase in mortality will also be associated with an increase in the birth rate. This process effectively leads to a greater turnover of the population within a country, thereby accelerating the selection of favorable traits such as lactase persistence. Therefore, population density in 1,500 CE could potentially lead to differential selection of lactase persistence and in the process create a positive statistical relationship between the two variables that is independent of the hypothesized increase in carrying capacity from dairying. The potential for this source of bias, however, is unlikely given the relatively short period of 500 years, or 20 generations. From simple simulations it can be shown that the majority of the selection for the lactase persistence trait occurs shortly after the adoption of dairying, and that any changes in the last 500 years are small. Furthermore, other traits–lessened skin pigmentation and blue eyes–that have no hypothesized relationship to a country’s carrying capacity and have also have undergone recent selection, show no positive relationship with population density, providing little support the acceleration of selection from population turnover due to increased infectious disease loads. However, given the concern of reverse causality and the possibility of omitted variables tied to the cultural adaptation of dairying, a strict interpretation of lactase persistence causing differences in population density should be avoided.Footnote 14

Destructive egalitarian envy dictates the darkest pages of history; hierarchical and creative emulation narrates its splendor.
 Gonzalo Fernández de la Mora (1987), Egalitarian Envy
 The interplay between culture and economic activity has recently become the centerpiece of a vibrant interdisciplinary research agenda.Footnote 1 Trust, religion, family ties, and risk attitudes are among the attributes argued to have profound effects on economic outcomes.Footnote 2 Although concern for relative standing, envy for short, is widely recognized as a salient feature of individuals interacting in a society, there is no agreement on how it affects the economy, either directly, through its impact on incentives to work and invest, or indirectly, through its connection to institutions and social norms.Footnote 3 In some parts of the world people engage in conspicuous consumption and overwork, driven by competition for status, while in others they hide their wealth and underinvest, constrained by the fear of malicious envy. This paper develops a unified framework capturing qualitatively different equilibria that emerge in the presence of envy, depending on the economic, institutional, and cultural environment. It sheds new light on the implications of envy for economic performance and social welfare and examines its changing role in the process of development. Throughout the paper envy is taken to be a characteristic of preferences that makes people care about how their own consumption level compares to that of their reference group. This operational definition implies that envy can be satisfied in two major ways: by increasing own outcome (constructive envy) and by decreasing the outcome of the reference group (destructive envy).Footnote 4 Given the two sides of envy, individuals face a fundamental trade-off. On the one hand, they strive for higher relative standing. On the other hand, they want to avoid the destructive envy of those falling behind. The way this trade-off is resolved shapes the role of envy in society. The basic theory is set up as a simple two-stage dynamic “envy game” between two social groups or individuals who are each other’s reference points. In the first stage of the game each individual may choose to allocate part of his time to productive investment that, combined with initial endowment, raises his future productivity. In the second stage the available time is split between own production and the disruption of the other individual’s production process. The optimal allocation of time between productive and destructive activities in this setup depends on the scope of available investment opportunities, disparity of investment outcomes, and tolerance for inequality, the latter endogenously determined by the level of property rights protection (effectiveness of destructive technology) and the strength of social comparisons. The unique equilibrium of the game belongs to one of three qualitatively different classes whose features are broadly consistent with the conflicting evidence on the role of envy across societies. If the initial inequality is low, tolerance for inequality is high, and peaceful investment opportunities are abundant, the familiar “keeping up with the Joneses” (KUJ) equilibrium arises. In this case individuals compete peacefully for their relative standing, and the consumption externality leads to high effort and output. These are typical characteristics of a consumer society prominently documented for the U.S. by Schor (1991) and Matt (2003). Higher inequality, lower tolerance for inequality, and scarce investment opportunities lead to the “fear equilibrium,” in which the better endowed individual anticipates destructive envy and prevents it by restricting his effort. Such envy-avoidance behavior is typical for traditional agricultural communities in developing economies, where the fear of inciting envy discourages production (Foster 1979; Dow 1981). It is also characteristic for the emerging markets, where potential entrepreneurs are reluctant to start new business that can provoke envious retaliation of others (Mui 1995). Finally, if the distribution of endowments is highly unequal, and tolerance for inequality is very low, as is investment productivity, a “destructive equilibrium” arises, in which actual conflict takes place and time is wasted to satisfy envy.Footnote 5
 The qualitatively different nature of these equilibria leads to opposite effects of envy on aggregate economic performance. In the KUJ equilibrium stronger envy increases effort and output by intensifying status competition, while in the fear equilibrium it reinforces the envy-avoidance behavior further discouraging investment. To explore the endogenous evolution of the role of envy in the process of economic development, the basic model is embedded in an endogenous growth framework, in which productivity rises due to learning-by-doing and knowledge spillovers. Rising productivity expands investment opportunities and the society experiences an endogenous transition from the fear to the KUJ equilibrium: envy-avoidance behavior, dictated by the destructive side of envy, eventually paves the way to emulation, driven by its constructive side. Over the course of this fundamental transition envy feeds back into productivity growth by constraining or spurring investment, depending on the type of equilibrium. In the dynamic setting, inequality and tolerance parameters not only affect economic outcomes at a given point in time but also determine the division of the transition process into alternative “envy regimes” and the overall long-run trajectory of the economy. The transition from fear to competition can be delayed or accelerated by various factors affecting the strength of social comparisons and the relative attractiveness of productive and destructive effort, such as religion, political ideology, institutions, and exogenous productivity spillovers. The striking difference between alternative equilibria is also reflected in a comparative welfare analysis. While better institutions and wealth redistribution can move the society from the low-output fear equilibrium to the high-output KUJ equilibrium, such change need not be welfare enhancing if it triggers the “rat race” competition. That is, individuals may be happier in the fear equilibrium, since the threat of destructive envy constrains the suboptimally high efforts that would have been induced in the KUJ equilibrium. However, in the long run, from the viewpoint of future generations, policies that shift the society to a KUJ trajectory contribute to improving social welfare due to additional productivity growth. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the evidence on the two sides of envy. Section 3 lays out the basic model and examines comparative statics. Section 4 looks at the long-run dynamics. Section 5 conducts the welfare analysis. Section 6 concludes. The Appendix contains the detailed versions of some key results.

Why did China take longer to modernize? At first glance, China’s later industrialization appears puzzling. Unified growth theory suggests that the transition from stagnation to growth is driven by the positive interaction between population expansion and technological progress and its impact on the demand for human capital and the onset of the demographic transition (Galor 2005, 2011). All else equal, China, one of the most technologically advanced and certainly the most populous nation in the world throughout most of history, should be an early industrializer. While differences in geographical endowment, institutions, culture, and diversity could help explain the Great Divergence between China and Europe (Jones 1981; Landes 1998; Pomeranz 2000; Ashraf and Galor 2013), these differences seem unsatisfactory in explaining the economic divergence between China and Japan. Traditional accounts typically attribute Japan’s earlier industrialization to the Meiji Restoration. According to this view, Qing China (1644–1911) and Tokugawa Japan (1600–1868) were both governed by despotic rulers who were uninterested in promoting economic growth.Footnote 1 Their paths diverged only after 1868, when the Tokugawa regime was overthrown and the new Meiji government introduced drastic reforms that transformed Japan. As Beasley (1972) put it, During the middle decades of the nineteenth century China and Japan both faced pressure from an intrusive, expanding West. ... Emotionally and intellectually, Chinese and Japanese reacted to the threat in similar ways. ... Yet they differed greatly in the kind of actions that this response induced. ... The Meiji Restoration is at the heart of this contrast, since it was the process by which Japan acquired a leadership committed to reform and able to enforce it. For Japan, therefore, the Restoration has something of the significance that the English Revolution has for England or the French Revolution for France; it is the point from which modern history can be said to begin. Recent reassessments have put the Chinese and Japanese economies on the eve of the modern age in better standing. It has been shown that, like Western Europe, China and Japan experienced widespread commercialization and proto-industrialization during the early modern period (Pomeranz 2000). However, the revisionist view, too, tends to play down the differences between pre-1850 China and Japan, and focus instead on their similarities (Pomeranz 2000; He 2013). Indeed, early modern China and Japan had much in common. Both depended heavily on small-scale, labor-intensive, and rice-based agriculture. Both were ruled by stable and sophisticated governments long before the arrival of the West. Furthermore, they shared a common cultural, institutional, and technological heritage. As a result of active cultural borrowing from China, Tokugawa Japan was also deeply influenced by Confucianism. Chinese administrative codes played an important role in shaping the way that the Tokugawa shogunate was run (Jansen 1992). Existing evidence suggests that living standards in China and Japan were comparable during this period (Maddison 2001; Baten et al. 2010; Allen et al. 2011; Broadberry 2013).Footnote 2
 We point to an important empirical observation that fits neither traditional nor revisionist perspectives, however. As Figure 1 illustrates, from 1650 to 1850, tax revenue per capita was significantly higher in Tokugawa Japan than in Qing China, and the gap widened over time.Footnote 3 In our estimates, the Chinese state’s annual revenue on the eve of the Opium War (1839–1842) was equivalent to 2 % of its national income at the maximum, while the comparable number for the Tokugawa shogunate was more than 15 %.Footnote 4

Sources: Shogunate’s land tax from Ohno (1996); Japan’s population estimates from Hayami and Miyamoto (1988); China’s tax revenues from Sng (2014); China’s population estimates from Perkins (1969) What were the reasons for these diverging revenue trends? The existing literature offers two hypotheses for China’s low tax revenue in general: the absence of warfare and the ideology of benevolence. Economic historians have shown that warfare was a major driver for European states to expand fiscal capacity (Hoffman and Rosenthal 1997; O’Brien 2005; Dincecco et al. 2011; Gennaioli and Voth 2011). In this view, the absence of interstate competition in China and the resulting low fiscal demand were the primary reasons for low taxation in China (Rosenthal and Wong 2011). Alternatively, China historians have argued that low taxation was mainly a reflection of the Confucian ideology of “benevolent rule” (Elliott 2009; Rowe 2009). However, neither of these hypotheses can fully explain the diverging trends in China and Japan because Tokugawa Japan, too, experienced no interstate competition and shared the Confucian ideology of benevolence.Footnote 5 If anything, the European experience suggests that China, not Japan, should have developed a higher fiscal capacity because it was exposed to military threats from Inner Asia. In this paper we focus on geography as a primary factor. China was a sprawling land empire with vast inner frontiers, while Japan was a small island nation. We propose that the difference in their geographical size and heterogeneity led to a much more acute problem of political control in the former than in the latter.Footnote 6 In pursuing our research, we follow the methodology of comparative and historical institutional analysis proposed by Greif (1998). That is, we first develop a context-specific model based on historical details to theoretically examine the nature of the problems that the rulers in China and Japan faced and then check its implications using comparative historical evidence. Between 1650 and 1850, both nations were ruled by stable dictatorships. Following Olson (1993), we model stable dictators as “stationary bandits” who understand that excessive exaction in the short run would be counterproductive in the long run.Footnote 7 However, the ruler’s encompassing interest is by itself insufficient to guarantee good governance. Because dictators cannot rule alone and have to rely on agents to govern, a principal–agent problem is inherent in dictatorships.Footnote 8 Unless the interests of the ruler and the agents are well-aligned, in the absence of perfect monitoring, the agents tend to pursue their self-interest at the ruler’s expense. For example, they may extort the taxpayers and thereby increase the likelihood of rebellion. We hypothesize that in a stable dictatorship, agency problems increase with its geographical size and heterogeneity. Given premodern information technologies, it is costly for the ruler of a large domain to monitor the agents closely. This gives the agents strong incentives to extort the taxpayers. To prevent overexploitation that could foment rebellion, the ruler has to keep taxes low and government small. By contrast, in a smaller domain, lower monitoring costs allow the ruler to impose heavier taxes without risking popular resistance. If the sole purpose of taxation is to support the consumption of the ruling class, whether it enriches the ruler or his agents will not matter to the taxpayers. However, unlike corruption, taxation is rarely a pure rent-seeking activity. The ruler, as the owner of his domain, may use the tax receipts to invest in public goods to keep his property productive. If so, the competition between the ruler and the agents over the economic surplus may have an impact on social welfare, especially in the long run. To formalize our hypothesis, we build a dynamic principal-agent model and analyze optimal taxation and public goods provision in a stable dictatorship. The ruler taxes the peasants through agents and invests part of the tax revenue in a local public good that protects the economy from exogenous shocks (e.g., natural disasters). If the ruler under-invests in the public good, the risk of a large shock destroying the economy increases. The static predictions of the model are straightforward: holding monitoring technology constant, as the geographical size of the ruler’s domain increases, bureaucratic expropriation worsens and per capita tax revenue falls due to managerial diseconomies of scale. New insights come from the dynamic implications. While one may expect economic expansion to generate more tax revenues and higher public good investments, this is not always the case. The model predicts that economic expansion could actually hurt the ruler because it also exacerbates agency problems. When monitoring cost is sufficiently high, bureaucratic expropriation will outpace economic expansion. It is only when monitoring cost is low that economic change is likely to bring net benefits to the ruler as well as the population. Our model provides a potential explanation for the tax revenue dynamics in China and Japan documented in Fig. 1. To further check its implications, we examine the provision of local public goods (coinage, transportation network, urban management, forest protection, famine relief) in the two regimes. In line with the model’s prediction, we find that, compared to the Chinese emperor, the Tokugawa shogun displayed a greater capability to provide these public goods over a longer period of time. We take the size of domains in China and Japan as exogenous in our analysis. Given the high agency costs, one may ask if China’s vast size was ever optimal. In a broader framework, such as Alesina and Spolaore (1997), the ruler determines the size of his domain by balancing the accompanying costs and benefits, where agency costs are just one such factor. In the case of China, we conjecture that the benefits of political integration—peace and risk sharing among contiguous regions—outweighed high agency costs, thereby justifying its size. We do not model this, however, to keep the scope of our analysis manageable.Footnote 9
 To our knowledge, this study is the first comparative analysis of state capacity in preindustrial Asia.Footnote 10 The European experience indicates that most states had a strong fiscal system in place before industrializing (Dincecco 2011; Johnson and Koyama 2014a, b). Indeed, there is a growing body of theoretical and empirical research highlighting the importance of state capacity in facilitating modern economic growth (Acemoglu 2005; Besley and Persson 2009, 2013; Dincecco and Prado 2012; Dincecco and Katz 2014). Studies also show that a proactive state could accelerate the transition from stagnation to growth by implementing policies that promote human capital formation (Doepke 2004; Doepke and Zilibotti 2005; Galor and Moav 2006; Galor et al. 2009).Footnote 11 In light of these works, our finding of an increasingly weak state in China in contrast to Japan might help explain the puzzle of China’s late industrialization. This paper builds directly upon Sng (2014), who studies the impact of geographical size on the principal–agent problem in late imperial China. Our work significantly extends his model by incorporating public goods provision and offers new comparative empirical evidence by bringing Japan into the picture. Our approach is complementary to Brandt et al. (2014), who provide a comprehensive survey of the long-run evolution of the Chinese political economy since the tenth century. Importantly, four recent contributions also explore the impact of geographical proximity and size on the quality of political and corporate governance. Stasavage (2011) finds that in preindustrial Europe, high communication and travel costs prevented representative assemblies in large polities from convening regularly and functioning effectively. Using contemporary data from 127 countries, Olsson and Hansson (2011) detect strong negative effects of territorial size on the rule of law. Giroud (2013) shows that a reduction of travel time (a proxy for monitoring costs) between company headquarters and plants has positive effects on plant-level productivity and profits. Campante and Do (2014) provide strong evidence that isolated capital cities in US states are associated with lower accountability, greater levels of corruption, and worse public goods provision. These studies show that distance and size are a challenge to good governance not only in premodern regimes in Asia and Europe, but also in modern states and corporations.
 The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section. 2 provides the historical background. Section 3 presents the model and derives predictions. Section 4 provides comparative historical evidence. Section 5 concludes.",1

Understanding why this is the case continues to motivate research on economic growth. Yet it is worth bearing in mind that the absence of growth is not unusual in a long-run historical perspective. What is unusual is actually the phenomenon of economic growth, as stagnation seems to have been the norm during most of human history (Galor 2005). This makes it important to understand why all societies failed to grow until recently; if key mechanisms that prevented growth historically can be exposed, it might leave important clues as to why some societies appear to stagnate at low levels of income to this very day. In this light it is problematic that important aspects of the pre-industrial growth record remain ill understood. In particular, existing theories ignore the dynamics of human body size and its links to population dynamics and average living standards. This state of affairs is problematic in two related respects. First, ignoring body size prevents a full understanding of the forces that engendered stagnating income per capita levels during most of human history. Evidence surveyed below strongly suggests that societies throughout history faced a fundamental body size—population size trade-off; a trade-off involving how many children to bear, and how well to feed each of them. This evidence indicates that episodes of rising income should have instigated intensified investments in offspring body size (in addition to child quantity). But in this case the standard Malthusian positive check may not suffice to bring the growth process to a halt as the tendency for diminishing returns to labor input would be counterbalanced by body-size-induced productivity gains. If so, what (other) mechanisms contributed to the observed long-run constancy of income per capita prior to the take-off? Why did episodes of technological change fail to generate step-wise improvements in income per capita in tandem with rising body size? By ignoring the dynamics of body size during the Malthusian epoch the existing literature cannot address these central issues.Footnote 1
 Second, by ignoring body size the existing literature is largely silent about the determination of the level of income per capita during Malthusian times: “the level of subsistence”. Biologically, subsistence requirements are inescapably linked to the size of the human body; bigger bodies are more energy requiring. Without an adequate theory of the long-run determination of human body size the notion of subsistence remains obscure, and predictions about comparative income differences across pre-industrial societies become untenable. As a consequence the existing literature cannot fully describe the economic circumstances prevailing prior to industrialization. The present paper proposes a theory of long-run growth according to which body size as well as “subsistence requirements” are endogenously determined. Parents face a trade-off between how many children to have and how well to feed each of them. At the same time they are constrained by income and metabolic consumption requirements. A positive shock to income will induce parents to expand fertility and nutritional investments in their children. However, in the following period a “physiological check” sets in: adults of the next generation are larger and as such more energy requiring. This limits fertility and nutritional investments per child, and serves to equilibrate the economy. As a result, the economy remains in a state of stagnation even though parents invest in child quality. The differential timing of the take-off to sustained growth has helped to shape the current global distribution of per capita income (Galor 2005, 2010; Lucas 2000; Cervellati and Sunde 2013; Dalgaard and Strulik 2013). Yet in order to understand the occurrence, timing and speed of the transition it is necessary to fully understand the country-specific economic circumstances that prevailed at the time of the take-off. The present paper proposes a theory of how key preconditions were formed and how they varied at the eve of the “industrial revolution”. The model features overlapping generations. Individuals live for two periods; childhood and adulthood. Children are passive recipients of nutrition, determined by the parent, who is the economically active agent; we ignore matching in the marriage market and allow agents to reproduce asexually. The economic components of the model are fairly standard. A unique output good is produced using body-size-augmented labor, land, and technology; since we are focusing on pre-industrial times, technology is assumed to be parametrically fixed, and land is also a fixed factor of production. Accordingly, diminishing returns to labor input prevail. Aside from this the theory builds on three novel elements. First, besides own consumption parents derive utility from the quantity and quality (i.e., nutrition) of their children. Both quality and quantity are normal goods. Second, the metabolic rate of the parent, our conceptualization of “subsistence”, is increasing in both body size and fertility. The parent is required in each period to cover these needs. Whereas body size is predetermined at the time of optimization, fertility is a control variable. Theory and empirical evidence from biology provide this important “physiological” constraint, right down to the functional form and its parameters. The substantive implication of the constraint is that if the number of children is expanded the parent faces elevated consumption needs due to pregnancy, leaving less resources for quality investments in the offspring. Taken together these two elements generate a natural size-number trade-off which is strongly supported by empirical evidence reviewed below. The third element is the law of motion for body size, which we derive from first principles, starting at the cellular level. The substantive implication of it is that more nutrition during childhood leads to larger adults. These elements interact in the following way. A positive productivity shock will induce parents to have more children and invest in more nutrition per child. The better nourished children will grow up to be larger adults than their parents. However, their elevated body size implies that they will be more energy-requiring adults. This prevents them from providing the same amount of nutrition per child that their parents provided, even if their productivity and income is the same as that of their parents. Thus the increase in body size is “checked” by rising metabolic needs, a fact, which puts downward pressure on nutritional investments as well as expenditure on family size. Consequently, growth does not take hold, and the economy remains in a state of stagnation. The new steady-state is characterized by unaltered body size, constant income per capita, and higher population density. Hence, within a country, episodes of technological change should neither lead to rising income per capita nor to greater average body size; the only lasting impact from technological advancement would be greater population density. These predictions are consistent with what appears to be known about pre-industrial development in Europe. In particular, historians have documented that average height of Europeans exhibited no significant trend over the two millennia preceding the take-off into sustained growth (Kunitz 1987; Koepke and Baten 2005), whereas it is well known that population density gradually rose (interrupted, chiefly, by the Plague). This does not mean, of course, that European average body size remained exactly constant. Across centuries average body size did undergo marked changes. But any gains in average stature proved to be temporary in nature; they eventually eroded away, preventing a time trend from emerging. The model allows for an improved understanding of these dynamics; qualitatively, as explained above, but also quantitatively. To demonstrate the latter, we begin by calibrating our model such that it replicates the evolution of European population from year 0 c.e. to 1,800 c.e. Subsequently we ask the model to “forecast” changes in body size over this period, which we then compare to available data. The calibrated model proves to be rather effective in “predicting” the evolution of body size in Europe, during the two millennia that preceded the fertility transition and the take-off to growth. In order to gauge the relevance of the models’ steady state predictions we turn to regression analysis. The key issue is whether productivity has a differential impact on population density and body size, as predicted by the model. In examining this claim we study two separate samples, both of which should be describable by a Malthusian model on a priori grounds. Our first sample consists of ethnic-groups from Murdock’s (1967) Ethnographic Atlas, which we have augmented by data on population density and body size (weight) drawing on published studies in anthropology and ethnography. In some respects this is an ideal setting for a falsification test of the theory as these societies certainly had not undergone the demographic transition at the time of observation. In fact, many are hunter-gatherers. At the same time one is left wondering if the theory also speaks to more modern societies. Hence, our second sample involves pixel-level (\(1\times 1\) degree latitude/longitude) information stemming from contemporary nation states that had not undergone the demographic transition at the end of the twentieth century. Needless to say, these countries are not randomly selected; they are all characterized by a non-decreasing total fertility rate until the end of the twentieth century. However, it is important to observe that the sample is not selectively constructed at the sub-national level, which is where we attempt to elicit information about the validity of the theory’s predictions. In order to overcome concerns about reverse causality, we employ “external” (geographically determined) measures of productivity that capture the richness of the environment of the ethnic-group or land suitability for crop growth within a particular (pixel sized) region. In either setting we find a strong positive impact on population density from the external productivity measures, yet an economically and a statistically insignificant impact on body size. In order to minimize the risk that our OLS results are caused by the influence from confounding factors we include a demanding set of productivity determinants reflecting geography, culture and institutions. Despite this we find, in both settings, that productivity works to elevate population density but not body size, as predicted by the model. The present paper is related to the literature on growth in the very long run, which models Malthusian stagnation and the transition to modern growth (e.g., Galor and Weil 2000; Galor and Moav 2002; Lucas 2002; see Galor 2005 for a survey). Particularly related is research which aims to understand the mechanics of pre-industrial development (e.g., Aiyar et al. 2008; Ashraf and Galor 2011; Sharp et al. 2012; Voigtländer and Voth 2009). In contrast to the present paper, however, these studies ignore the evolution of body size, and assume the level of subsistence consumption is exogenously given (if introduced at all).Footnote 2
 The paper is also related to the anthropometric history literature, where height and fertility has been discussed in a unifying way. Weir (1993), in particular, provides a perspective on the quality-quantity trade-off that is similar to ours, and uses it to conceptually motivate an empirical analysis of the impact from the French fertility transition on height developments.Footnote 3
 The paper proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2 we survey evidence on the quantity-quality trade-off between fertility and body size. Section 3 develops the model. Section 4 proves existence, stability, and provides comparative statics, whereas Sect. 5 examines comparative dynamics. Section 6 examines the ability of the model to quantitatively account for the dynamics of the Western European economy prior to the fertility transition, and Sect. 7 examines key steady state predictions of the model by way of regression analysis. A final section concludes.",1

It reproduces the standard result that, at intermediate levels of financial depth, there is a positive relationship between the size of the financial system and economic growth, but it also shows that, at high levels of financial depth, more finance is associated with less growth. The idea that a well-working financial system plays an essential role in promoting economic development dates back to Bagehot (1873) and Schumpeter (1911). Empirical evidence on the relationship between finance and growth is more recent. Goldsmith (1969) was the first to show the presence of a positive correlation between the size of the financial system and long-run economic growth. He argued that this positive relationship was driven by financial intermediation improving the efficiency rather than increasing the volume of investment (this is also the channel emphasized by Grenwood and Jovanovich 1990, and Bencivenga and Smith 1991). However, Goldsmith made no attempt to establish whether there was a causal link going from financial depth to economic growth.Footnote 1
 In the early 1990s, economists started working towards identifying a causal link going from finance to growth. King and Levine (1993) were the first to show that financial depth is a predictor of economic growth and Levine and Zervos (1998) showed that stock market liquidity (but not the size of the stock market) predicts GDP growth. More evidence in this direction came from Levine et al. (2000) and Beck et al. (2000) who used different types of instruments and econometric techniques to identify the presence of a causal relationship going from finance to growth.Footnote 2 Rajan and Zingales (1998) provided additional evidence for a causal link going from financial to economic development by showing that industrial sectors that, for technological reasons, are more dependent on external finance grow relatively more in countries with a larger financial sector.Footnote 3
 These efforts notwithstanding, the causality issue has not been fully resolved. Our paper is thus subject to the same types of criticism that have been levied against the existing literature on finance and growth. However, we think that our exploration of non-monotonicities in the link between finance and growth is relevant because, even though no single paper by itself demonstrates that finance has a causal effect on growth, we agree with Levine’s (2005, p. 867) assessment that: “While subject to ample qualifications (...) the preponderance of evidence suggests that both financial intermediaries and markets matter for growth even when controlling for potential simultaneity bias.” We also contribute to the literature on causality by using an identification strategy which, to the best of our knowledge, has not yet been used to analyze the finance-growth nexus. In the presence of heteroskedasticity in the regression’s residual, this methodology allows identifying causal relationships even in the absence of external instruments (Rigobon 2003; Lewbel 2012). We provide a non-technical explanation of identification through heteroskedasticity and then show that our results are robust to controlling for endogeneity with this novel technique. While most empirical papers study the relationship between financial depth and steady state growth, Aghion et al. (2005) develop and test a theory in which financial depth can speed convergence to the steady-state but has a limited effect on long-run growth.Footnote 4 We show that the presence of a non-monotonic relationship between finance and growth is robust to controlling for the convergence effect of financial depth. There seems to be a contradiction between the empirical literature that finds a positive effect of financial depth on economic development and the literature that has shown that credit growth is a predictor of banking and currency crises (e.g., Kaminsky and Reinhart 1999; Schularick and Taylor 2012). However, the fact that a large financial sector may increase volatility does not necessarily mean that large financial systems are bad. It is possible that countries with large financial sectors pay a price in terms of volatility but are rewarded in terms of higher growth (Ranciére et al. 2008). Loayza and Ranciere (2006) reconcile these two findings by using a panel error correction model to jointly estimate the short- and long-run effects of financial depth. They find that a positive long-run relationship between financial depth and economic growth coexists with a negative short-run relationship between these two variables, and that this negative short-run relationship is mostly driven by financial crises. These authors, however, do not allow for a non-monotonic effect of financial depth. In this paper, we use different datasets and empirical approaches to show that the marginal effect of financial depth on output growth becomes negative when credit to the private sector reaches 80–100 % of GDP. This result is consistent across different types of estimators (simple cross-sectional and panel regressions as well as semi-parametric estimators) and data (country-level and industry-level). When our paper was first circulated there was limited work which considered a non-monotonic relationship between financial and economic development.Footnote 5 Our result of a non-monotonic relationship between finance and growth has been corroborated by many other authors who estimated models similar to ours by using different datasets, empirical methodologies, and studied productivity growth instead of GDP growth (papers that broadly support our findings include Cecchetti and Kharroubi 2012; Pagano 2012; Eugster 2013; Law and Singh 2014; Aizenman et al. 2015). The threshold at which we find that financial depth starts having a negative effect on growth is similar to the threshold at which Easterly et al. (2000) find that financial depth starts having a positive effect on volatility. This finding is consistent with the literature on the relationship between volatility and growth (Ramey and Ramey 1995) and that on the persistence of negative output shocks (Cerra and Saxena 2008). However, our results are not purely driven by crises and volatility. We show that our finding of a non-monotonic relationship between financial depth and economic growth is robust to controlling for macroeconomic volatility, banking crises, and institutional quality. Our results differ from those of Rioja and Valev (2004) who find that, even in their “high region,” finance has a positive, albeit small, effect on economic growth. This difference is due to the fact that their threshold for the “high region” is set at 37 % of GDP. The threshold is thus much lower than the level of financial depth at which we find that finance starts having a negative effect on growth. Our results are instead consistent with the “vanishing effect” of financial depth found by Rousseau and Wachtel (2011). If the true relationship between financial depth and economic growth is non-monotonic, models that do not allow for non-monotonicity will lead to a downward bias in the estimated relationship between financial depth and economic growth. We use a standard bias formula and a simple Montercarlo simulation to show that this downward bias increases with the size of the financial sector. Over the last twenty years financial sectors have grown rapidly. Therefore, it is not surprising that exercises that use recent data find a vanishing effect of financial depth. Our argument is that this vanishing effect is not driven by a change in the fundamental relationship between financial depth and economic growth, but by the fact that models that do not allow for a non-monotone relationship between financial depth and economic growth are misspecified.",1

Murphy,,,Male,,,Male,"Economists have always considered the study of economic growth important, yet only recently have they given attention to how that growth became more the rule than the exception. For the major part of human history, income per capita seems to have remained at subsistence level, with improvements (if any) in the standard of living only marginal or temporary (Clark 2005, p. 507; Ashraf and Galor 2011). Barely two centuries ago this ceased to be the case, and an era of sustained growth began. Economic historians have studied this phenomenon with great interest over the years, and recently the topic has regained appeal in mainstream economics, mainly thanks to the development of unified growth theory (UGT). Models in this literature put into a single theoretical framework both pre-industrial stagnation and modern economic growth, and the change from one to the other (Galor 2011). In all of them, the demographic transition plays a key role. By avoiding the dilution of physical capital and land, increasing the investment in human capital, and temporarily augmenting the size of the labour force, the systematic fall in birth rates paves the way for economic growth (Galor 2011, p. 46). Yet UGT provides only one possible narrative, and many studies in fact disagree on what drives that decline, potential candidates ranging from biological and environmental conditions to socio-cultural factors and economic motivations (Guinnane 2011; Galor 2012). Identifying the forces that contributed to the fall in fertility, either to validate the internal logic of these models or to think further about the mechanisms at work in them, is of crucial relevance for understanding the path of Europe’s economic growth. The present paper sheds light on this issue by providing a quantitative assessment of the factors that help explain differences in fertility within France during the transition. France is arguably the most iconic case in the European fertility decline. The evolution of birth rates during the nineteenth century was rather unequal in the various corners of the continent, but even to the naked eye, distinct regional patterns are easily identifiable (Flinn 1981, pp. 30–31; Guinnane 2011, pp. 590–592). Downward trends were common, yet timing of the initial fall sometimes differed. A sense of the different experiences can be seen in Fig. 1, which depicts (smoothed) series of crude birth rates for England and Wales, France, and Sweden over the long term. The patterns of England and Wales and Sweden are representative of most regions in Europe. Fertility fluctuates around a relatively high mean in pre-industrial times, and then a decline begins at some point after the mid-nineteenth century and continues through to the interwar period. Although following the general overall pattern, the French decline arguably began 50 years earlier than in any other part of the continent.Footnote 1 Since, in contrast to other places in Northern Europe, France was relatively less urban and industrialised (see e.g., Heywood 1995), this timing has been particularly difficult to reconcile, for example, with arguments suggesting economic forces drove the fall in births. Further, the evidence we have of fertility rates within the country also shows certain peculiarities. Figure 2 plots the widely used \(I_{g}\) index of marital fertility, a measure of the proportion of legitimate births with respect to the maximum biologically attainable (Coale and Watkins 1986) for all départements at different dates in the century.Footnote 2 In those maps it is easy to identify at least two areas of low fertility, the valley of the Seine (Bassin Parisien) and the Garonne (Bassin Aquitaine), and two ‘islands’ of high fertility, the region of Bretagne in the north-west and the Massif Central in the centre-south-east. Although fertility is decreasing throughout the period, the large differences across regions show certain persistence. As early as 1831 one can find départements such as Gironde or Eure with indices below 0.40—evidence of fertility limitation—while as late as 1901 places like Finistère or Côtes-du-Nord still had indices above 0.70—showing little or no limitation at all.

Sources: my own maps, constructed using data from Coale and Watkins (1986, pp. 94–107) Of course, alternative arguments to explain either feature are not lacking, but only to a limited extent have they been subject to careful empirical scrutiny. The timing of the early onset of the French decline has probably received most attention, and recent studies seem to agree that the French Revolution, or events related to it, played a central role in triggering the fall.Footnote 3 On the reasons behind the differences across regions, the evidence is less clear. Most of the components that were to shape modern theories of fertility determinants (Van de Kaa and Dirk 1996; Guinnane 2011), such as the role played by fluctuations in wealth, the value of children and the costs of rearing them, or the degree of religious faith, to mention a few, were already present in early discussions on the French decline more than 100 years ago (Spengler 1938, pp. 168–174). Despite the wealth of theoretical ideas, however, only a few have found support or rejection in sound quantitative analysis. Many of the studies on the topic have remained for some time descriptive and conjectural (Van de Walle 1974, pp. 6–7). The works of scholars like Etienne van de Walle or David Weir brought a more systematic approach to the subject,Footnote 4 and from the late 1970s to the early 1990s several refined the measurements of regional fertility (Van de Walle 1974; Bonneuil 1997) and extensively explored their dynamics (e.g., Van de Walle 1974; Weir 1983; Wrigley 1985a, b). A few studies did assess the relevance of some factors in explaining differences across the country (e.g., Van de Walle 1976; McQuillan 1984; Watkins 1991), but the overall picture that emerges from them is far from clear.Footnote 5 Moreover, as Brown and Guinnane (2007) have warned us as of late, many of the findings coming from these works may well be flawed. As they argued convincingly, much of the literature on fertility decline, especially that stemming from the European Fertility Project (Coale and Watkins 1986), relied upon highly aggregated data and empirical strategies that ignored relevant aspects of the time dimension, most likely leading to unreliable conclusions (Brown and Guinnane 2007, pp. 580–589). Recent research has dealt with these critiques for other regions of the continent (e.g., Galloway et al. 1994 for Prussia; Brown and Guinnane 2002 for Bavaria; Dribe 2009 for Sweden), but the French case remains poorly understood. Given the particular importance of France in the demographic transition debate, and its consequent relevance for the discussion on UGT, in this paper I assess quantitatively which factors contribute towards explaining differences within the country during the transition. Taking advantage of the persistent heterogeneity in fertility across départements in the nineteenth century, I study the correlates of fertility under various specifications. I assess the relationship between factors such as infant mortality, urbanisation, industrialisation, income, financial development, education, religiosity, and political participation, and the levels of fertility, introducing (departmental and time) fixed effects to control for some unobservables. In a series of estimations, I also use climatologic data to instrument infant mortality to produce 2SLS estimates that account for some of the potential endogeneity problems. I then look into spatial dependence to assess the relevance of diffusion arguments. Although a good part of the debate on fertility decline has been set-up in terms of diffusion versus adaptation hypotheses (Carlsson 1966), and the study of diffusion on fertility dynamics in a sound, quantitative manner has been used already in an historical perspective (e.g., Tolnay 1995), this has rarely been integrated into any empirical study of the European fertility decline.Footnote 6 By introducing spatial dependence along with other covariates, I can assess whether the diffusion and adaptation hypotheses can simultaneously contribute towards explaining fertility. My results show that wealth was positively correlated with larger families, whereas higher literacy and the reduction of the educational gender gap (increase in female versus male literacy) were negatively correlated. Once I control for other variables, there is no indication that infant mortality, urbanisation, or industrialisation had any effect whatsoever. The level of religiosity (which I measured using two alternative proxies) is consistently relevant to explain fertility and has the expected (positive) sign. All these effects are present even in specifications that control for spatial dependence, which also turns out to be strongly significant, thus providing support for the diffusion hypothesis. These results give support to some of the main building blocks of the UGT. They also hint that the diffusion of cultural or other factors were partly driving fertility dynamics along with economic incentives, and suggest both components should be included in the theoretical models to provide a more comprehensive answer for why and how the decline occurred.",1

20,3,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-015-9117-0,The longevity of famous people from Hammurabi to Einstein,David de la Croix,Omar Licandro,,Male,Male,,Male,"Having gathered estimations on adult life expectancy from various times and places, Clark (2007, Tables 5.2 and 5.3) argues that there was no trend in adult longevity during the Malthusian stagnation era, i.e. until about the industrial revolution. There is, moreover, extensive evidence showing that adult life expectancy has increased markedly and continuously since the beginning of the nineteenth century. The importance of the economic growth process in fostering such improvements has been stressed by Fogel (1994). Country wide statistics for Sweden, England and France show the emergence of a trend for generations born in the nineteenth century, although little information is available for those born earlier.Footnote 1 The earliest evidence of improved adult life expectancy is provided by Wrigley et al. (1997). They reported an important reduction in adult mortality in the English population in the middle of the eighteenth century. On top of that, some authors who looked at small prominent groups of households, such as the English aristocrats Hollingsworth (1977), identify the beginning of the change one century earlier for these groups than for the overall population. The question of the timing of the rise in longevity finds a nice echo in what the contemporaries of the industrial revolution wrote about the history and prospects of life expectancy. Malthus (1798) believed that “With regard to the duration of human life, there does not appear to have existed from the earliest ages of the world to the present moment the smallest permanent symptom or indication of increasing prolongation.” Writing a few years before Malthus, Condorcet (1795), instead, anticipated the emergence of large improvements in longevity: “One feels that transmissible diseases will slowly disappear with the progresses of medicine, which becomes more effective through the progress of reason and social order, ...and that a time will come where death will only be the consequence of extraordinary accidents, or of the increasingly slower destruction of vital forces.” In this paper, we aim to document the long stagnation period and identify the time at which longevity, defined as the average lifespan of individuals of a given cohort, started to increase above its plateau mean. To this aim, we built a new dataset of around 300,000 famous people born between the Twenty-fourth century BCE (Hammurabi, king of Babylonia, is among the first) and 1879 CE, the year of Albert Einstein’s birth. Vital dates were taken from the Index Bio-bibliographicus Notorum Hominum (IBN), which also contains information on multiple individual characteristics, including place of birth and death, occupation, nationality, religion and gender, among others. This very comprehensive tool, covering 3000 biographical sources from all countries and historical periods, enables us to go beyond the current state of knowledge and to provide a global picture. Existing estimations are local and start, at best, in the sixteenth century.Footnote 2
 The main contribution of this paper is fourfold. First, it documents, using a worldwide, long-running, consistent database, that there was no trend in adult longevity until the second half of the seventeenth century, longevity of famous people being at about 60 years during this period. This finding is important as it provides a reliable confirmation to conjectures that life expectancy was rather stable for most of human history and establishes the existence of a Malthusian epoch. Indeed, the existing literature tends to show that technical advancements has not generated an increase in the standard of living over the years 1, 1000 and 1500 (using the GDP per capita of Maddison (2010)). This view is confirmed and extended by our study as indeed, standards of living, as measured by longevity, had not changed over nearly 4000 years within the period that is conventionally viewed as the Malthusian epoch. Second, it shows that permanent improvements in longevity preceded the Industrial Revolution by at least one century. The longevity of famous people started to steadily increase for generations born around 1650, reaching a total gain of around 9 years for Einstein’s cohort. The rise in longevity among the educated segment of society hence preceded industrialization, lending credence to the hypothesis that human capital may have played a significant role in the process of industrialization and the take-off to modern growth. Third, using information about locations and occupations available in the database, we also found that the increase in longevity did not occur only in the leading countries of the seventeenth–eighteenth century, but almost everywhere in Europe, and was not dominated by mortality reductions in any particular occupation. Hence, the results found in the existing literature about some local groups of nobles generalize to the whole class of elite people, including writers, scientists, artists, master craftsmen, etc. Fourth, the rise in longevity is associated primarily with the recanalization of age specific mortality rates, not with a change in the characteristic length of life as measured by the lifespan. This suggests that the rise in longevity we observe in the seventeenth–nineteenth century does not reflect changes in the biological lifespan of humans but rather improvements in its environment. People in the IBN belonged to the upper classes of human societies, including the richest, most powerful and influential individuals, with the highest human capital. In this sense, the observed break occurred around 1650 can be seen as a tipping point in the longevity of the upper classes. Since, as in most studies in economics history, the IBN is not a random sample, we were concerned with the several selection and composition biases that may affect our results. As individuals need to have acquired some reputation to be recorded in the IBN, the sample suffers from a form of selection bias that we refer to as the notoriety bias. People with the potentials to become famous but dying young are excluded and, inversely, only those that are old enough to become famous are included. In addition, there are other biases related to changes in the composition of the sample, in terms of gender, occupation and location. To deal with the different types of selection and composition biases faced by the IBN, we created a measure of conditional longevity that controls for all observed individual characteristics, including occupation dummies, reflecting differences in the notoriety bias across occupations. As additional robustness, we interacted the nine large occupational categories with the time dummies to take into account for possible unobservable changes in standard that may affect the selection bias. Finally, we also documented some of these biases by comparing our results with existing data from different times and places. The notoriety bias is related to the well-known problem in statistics of left truncation. Most people in the IBN did not get notoriety from birth, but after reaching some status (as for example, a military rank, a political responsibility, or any hierarchical position in a public or private organization) or accomplishing some important achievement (writing a book, painting a picture, making a scientific discovery, founding a city). To compute age specific death rates and life expectancy, one needs to know the population at risk for all ages, i.e. the population of already famous people susceptible of dying. Since the IBN is silent about the age at which people became famous, we cannot estimate life expectancy. For this reason, we used the alternative measure of longevity, equal to the mean lifetime of all observed famous people, and only requires their vital dates. As far as the standards for being famous have not significantly changed over the sample period, we should expect that longevity and life expectancy co-move, longevity being systematically larger. However, over such a long period, these standards might likely have changed. The introduction of the printing press, for example, has multiplied the number of published biographies, likely making the standards to be famous less strict. If it were the case, changes in longevity may be associated to unobservable changes in the definition of being famous, totally uncorrelated with changes in life expectancy. To deal with this problem we made the following out-of-sample test. For the population of cardinals of the Catholic Church and the population of knights of the Golden Fleece, whose nomination dates are available, we have computed both longevity and life expectancy at age 25. We found in both population that longevity and life expectancy co-move and show a break at the second half of the seventeenth century, consistently with the behavior of the IBN famous people longevity. This establishes that, even in cases where the conditions to be included into the sample changed dramatically over time (for example the age at elevation of catholic cardinals rose from 40 in the sixteenth century to 50 in the middle of the nineteenth century), the tipping points in longevity and life expectancy are the same. Famous people are those with a high level of human capital. The community of European famous people, such as scientists, artists, and entrepreneurs, is seen by Mokyr (2011) as being at the root of the Industrial Revolution. The early increase in their longevity has a specific relevance for economic growth, and may support the hypothesis that improvements in longevity were one cause of the industrial revolution. One mechanism for this effect could be through facilitating knowledge accumulation (see Lucas (2009) and Bar and Leukhina (2010)). For Lucas, “a productive idea needs to be in use by a living person to be acquired by someone else, so what one person learns is available to others only as long as he remains alive. If lives are too short or too dull, sustained growth at a positive rate is impossible.” Another possible mechanism relates to the provision of incentives for investment in human capital (see Galor and Weil 1999; Boucekkine et al. 2002; Soares 2005; Cervellati and Sunde 2014 and de la Croix and Licandro 2013). For Galor and Weil, “Changes in mortality can serve as the basis for a unified model that describes the complete transition from the Malthusian Regime to the Modern Growth Regime. Consider the effect of an initial reduction in mortality (due to an exogenous shock to health technology or to standards of living). The effect of lower mortality in raising the expected rate of return to human capital investments will nonetheless be present, leading to more schooling and eventually to a higher rate of technological progress. This will in turn raise income and further lower mortality...”. Famous people were also very much living in cities. We know that cities were unhealthy places, with higher mortality rates. It therefore appears remarkable that despite the increase in population density in the course of urbanization, longevity first remained relatively stable, then started to increase, suggesting perhaps that there was a gradual improvement in the capacity of individuals to live a longer life. Or perhaps that literate people (who are being sampled) had learned how to cope with the hazard of an increase in population density in cities. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we describe the data and measure the unconditional longevity of famous people. Section 3 defines the universe from which the sample is drawn, reports a list of potential composition and selection biases, discusses the gap between longevity and life expectancy, and provides the out-of-sample test. In Sect. 4, we provide an estimation of famous people conditional longevity, after controlling for the reported biases. We also study whether changes in longevity were general to all locations and occupations. An analytical description of the observed changes is provided in Sect. 5 through the lenses of the Gompertz-Makeham survival law and the Compensation Effect of Mortality. In Sect. 6, we compare, for some specific geographical locations and time periods, the longevity of IBN famous people with existing case studies. Finally, in Sect. 7, we suggest a set of criteria that any good interpretation of these events should meet, advance some possible explanations and conclude.",1

Liberal democracies, the standard argument goes, with written constitutions, separation of powers, bills of rights, check and balances, regular elections and competitive parties, allow people to control and discipline the elected officials and give them voice to oust out inept and corrupt individuals from power (Sen 2000; Rivera-Batiz 2002). However, there is limited empirical evidence that, by itself, the extension of democratic liberties leads to improvements in the quality of government. In this paper, we suggest that the performance of democratic institutions depends on the level of education of the electorate. Our hypothesis is that education enhances political engagement and participation and increases citizens’ ability to make good (ex ante) electoral choices and to evaluate (ex post) the actions of elected officials.Footnote 1
 We take this idea to the data and show that the correlation between democracy and the quality of government is not statistically significant in countries with low levels of education and is positive and statistically significant in countries with high levels of education. We also find a positive and often statistically significant marginal effect of education on the quality of government in democratic countries and no significant effect of education in non-democratic countries. This ancillary result suggests that democracy is of critical importance to channel the political benefits of education into government performance. In discussing our findings, we acknowledge that causality is hard to establish because our explanatory variables are likely to be endogenous and we do not have good external instruments for education and democracy. While we use difference and system-GMM estimations that use lagged values and changes of the dependent and explanatory variables as internal instruments, we recognize that such internal instruments cannot fully address endogeneity concerns. We deal with this issue by running a set of Monte Carlo simulations aimed at testing the robustness of our results and show that even the presence of extreme endogeneity would not reverse our findings. By showing that education and democracy complement each other in promoting good governance, our paper reconciles the results of the literature on the relative merits of democracy and education. In particular, our results are consistent with the work of Acemoglu et al. (2001, 2008), Persson and Tabellini (2006, 2008, 2009), and Besley and Persson (2011) who emphasize the importance of inclusive political institutions in explaining cross-country differences in income per capita.Footnote 2 However, our findings are also consistent with the literature that looks at human capital accumulation as a basic source of economic growth (Glaeser et al. 2004). Given that a measure of institutional quality similar to our quality of government variable has been shown to be associated with economic growth (Hall and Jones 1999), our results can also explain why studies that do not allow for heterogeneity do not find evidence of an impact of democracy on growth (Barro 1996, 2000; Przeworski et al. 2000). The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the economic and political science literatures on the links between democratic institutions and governance. Section 3 presents our empirical investigation. Section 4 discusses endogeneity. Section 5 concludes and uses a simple calibration exercises to show the implications of our results for economic growth. Evolution of democracy, education, and quality of government",1
20,4,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-015-9119-y,Modern gender roles and agricultural history: the Neolithic inheritance,Casper Worm Hansen,Peter Sandholt Jensen,Christian Volmar Skovsgaard,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Wide disparities in gender roles exist across countries and regions as can be observed in, for example, the large cross-country variation in female labor force participation rates (Alesina et al. 2013). The existence of these disparities has become a concern for policy makers. One manifestation of this is the third Millennium Development Goal, which aims at promoting more equality in gender roles (United Nations 2011). Whether or not an appropriate policy can be designed to reach this goal arguably depends on research to provide an understanding of the underlying causes of the variation in gender roles. Recent research has taken up the challenge and suggests that, to some extent, the observed divergence can be explained by cultural beliefs, which are strongly rooted in history, about the proper role of women in society (Fernandez 2007; Fernandez and Fogli 2009; Alesina et al. 2013).Footnote 1
 This paper follows this line of research and proposes the hypothesis that societies with long histories of agriculture have stronger patriarchal values and beliefs that give rise to less equality in gender roles.Footnote 2 We test the hypothesis by studying the relation between the timing of the Neolithic Revolution, which is the prehistorical transition from a hunter-gatherer to an agricultural society, and contemporary gender roles as measured by female labor force participation and other indicators of equality in gender roles. The idea is that the Neolithic Revolution puts societies on a path on which patriarchal norms and beliefs are adopted. Societies with earlier Neolithic Revolutions have been subject to these cultural beliefs more intensely and for a longer period of time. For these reasons, such beliefs are likely to become more ingrained and may still serve as a stumbling block for more equality in gender roles in terms of female labor force participation as well as female participation in politics. If so, this would be important for our understanding of the role of culture for gender roles, and would be highly relevant for policy makers, who want to promote gender equality. In a world sample of countries, we document robust negative relationships between years of agriculture in 1500 CE and different measures of equality in gender roles, such as female labor force participation and female seats in parliament. As the proposed mechanism operates via informal institutions (i.e., culture) rather than formal institutions, we also test the hypothesis using a sample of European regions. In particular, exploiting the within-country variation in the data in this sample, we find evidence of a negative association between years of agriculture and female labor force participation. Moreover, when we study the mechanism among immigrants and children of immigrants living in the US, we obtain the same conclusion.Footnote 3 The evidence from the latter two samples is therefore consistent with a cultural mechanism. The proposed hypothesis builds on the work of Ashraf and Galor (2011), Diamond (1987), Iversen and Rosenbluth (2010) and others. Diamond (1987) proposes that not only did the move to agriculture lead to an increase in social inequality, but gender inequality also increased. Diamond (1987, p. 66) describes the mechanism as follows: “Freed from the need to transport their babies during a nomadic existence, and under pressure to produce more hands to till the fields, farming women tended to have more pregnancies than their hunter-gatherer counterparts.” Footnote 4 Moreover, as argued by Galor (2011, p. 167), the Malthusian Epoch was characterized by technological progress being channeled into population growth with a minuscule effect on income per capita. Ashraf and Galor (2011) provide evidence consistent with this using the timing of the Neolithic Revolution as a proxy for technological advancement. Thus, societies with early Neolithic Revolutions arguably experienced higher levels of fertility, which left women with less time to other activities than child rearing. As a consequence, patriarchal values are likely to have become stronger in these societies. An alternative mechanismFootnote 5 builds on the work by Iversen and Rosenbluth (2010), who emphasize the task division within the househould. They note that evidence suggests that hunter-gatherer societies were characterized by more independent women as compared to agricultural societies. First, some evidence from present-day hunter-gatherers indicate that the gathering activity of women provides more than half of the daily calorie intake of their communities as discussed below. Second, meat—as provided by male hunting activity—may not have been strictly necessary for survival, and gathered food served as an independent, more secure source of calories.Footnote 6 We add evidence that societies relying more on hunting/gathering are more gender equal on a number dimensions. We show that the following outcomes are more likely in these societies: marriage customs which involve reciprocal gift exchange, matrilocality,Footnote 7 equal preference for boys and girls, equal punishment for pre-marital sex and equal division of inheritance. By contrast, the Neolithic Revolution set the stage for different social norms based on patriarchy.Footnote 8 Moreover, Iversen and Rosenbluth (2010, p. 32) argue that the move to agriculture created “a premium on male brawn in plowing and other heavy farm work.” This premium arises in societies which adopted cereal based agriculture rather than root crop agriculture. In fact, Ember (1983) and White et al. (1981) argue that agriculture based on cereals (as opposed to root crops) leads to lower female participation in agriculture. We discuss this in more detail below, but the authors stress that cereal production usually means that women spend more time on processing the cereals rather than working in the field. Interestingly, the transition to agriculture as recorded by Putterman and Trainor (2006) was a transition to cereal-based agriculture in Europe, Asia and Africa.Footnote 9 Consistent with these arguments, we report empirical evidence indicating that societies with relative more suitability for growing root crops (compared to cereal crops) had later Neolithic Revolutions and are more equal in gender roles today. We demonstrate this using both cross-country data, and subnational level data for African countries. Thus, the move to agriculture led to a division of labor within the family, where the man used his physical strength in food production and the woman took care of child rearing, food processing and production and other family-related duties. The consequence was that women’s role in society no longer gave “her economic viability on her own” (p. 32). In essence, the general shift in the division of labor associated with the Neolithic Revolution aggravated women’s outside options (outside marriage), and this increased male bargaining power within the family, which, over generations, translated into norms and behavior which shaped the cultural beliefs on gender roles in societies. Given the emphasis put on the plough by Boserup (1970) and Alesina et al. (2013), one question naturally arises: Is there evidence that the premium on male brawn existed without the presence of the plough? In fact, the archaeological evidence suggests that the plough is not necessarily required. Peterson (2002), for example, demonstrates that the muscle patterns of Neolithic males from the early cereal producing farming societies of the Southern Levant (present-day Jordan and Israel) are consistent with participation in timbering and tilling.Footnote 10 Importantly, the use of the plough cannot be inferred for the period studied (Peterson 2002, p. 49). Hinsch (2003) gives a second example for early Neolithic China 7000–8000 years ago where gender roles already appear to have existed. He observes that “excavation of Peiligang graves have revealed that work tools were often buried alongside the deceased. Some graves include stone agricultural and hunting implements such as shovels, axes, sickles, and arrowheads. Other graves lack these sorts of artifacts, but include tools for grinding grain. From this evidence, archaeologists have concluded that Peiligang work roles were allocated according to gender.” Bray (1984, p. 155) discusses when the plough was introduced in China and notes that Wang Chen attributed it to the spring and autumn period (771 until 476 BCE), but considers other dates, the earliest one being 3300 BCE. Thus, plough-use cannot be inferred for this case either. A final example is the field study by Draper (1975) of the !Kung tribe, described below, which suggests that a stronger gender division of labor arises in the absence of the plough. We also demonstrate that societies which have cereals as their main crop have lower female contributions to subsistence even when we control for presence of the plough. 
Alesina et al. (2013) provide evidence consistent with Boserup’s (1970) hypothesis that plough agriculture is behind present-day gender roles. In particular, they construct a measure of the share of the population that has ancestors who were engaged in plough-use. They note that one caveat associated with this approach is that they cannot measure whether the plough was adopted early, since a longer period of plough agriculture is likely to have led to stronger and more ingrained values and beliefs on appropriate gender roles. In contrast, we provide evidence consistent with an effect of how long ago agriculture was adopted on modern gender roles. A caveat is that when we use a world sample, it is not possible to interpret years of agriculture narrowly as, for example, years of cereal-based or plough agriculture because a few countries did not make the move to cereal-based agriculture. We can address this by considering sub-samples for Europe, Asia, and Africa where we can narrow down the interpretation since early agriculture in these areas were based on cereals.Footnote 11
 In sum, we provide new evidence consistent with the hypothesis that an early Neolithic Revolution, via its effects on cultural beliefs, is a source of modern gender roles. By doing so, we also contribute to the literature on the consequences of the Neolithic Revolution.Footnote 12
 The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the building blocks of the paper by presenting evidence on gender equality in hunter-gatherer societies and discussing how gender inequality may arise in the absence of the plough. In Sect. 3, we present the data used in the main analysis. Section 4 outlines the estimation framework. Section 5 contains main results. Section 6 presents interpretation. Section 7 concludes.",1
20,4,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-015-9116-1,Subnational leaders and economic growth: evidence from Chinese cities,Yang Yao,Muyang Zhang,,,Female,,Female,"Empirical studies in the literature have found that national leaders play an important role in economic growth. For example, Glaeser et al. (2004) find that poor countries in the 1960s, mostly governed by dictators, got out of poverty through good policies before they improved their political institutions. Using the sudden death of a leader as an exogenous shock, Jones and Olken (2005) find that the change of leaders has a significant impact on a country’s economic growth. These findings can be contrasted with the thesis that institutions are the more fundamental cause for economic growth (e.g., North and Thomas 1973; Acemoglu et al. 2005). This paper extends the above literature to studying subnational leaders using data collected on 312 Chinese cities for the period 1994–2010. The advantage of studying subnational leaders is that these leaders face the same national institutional setup so their role can be isolated from the role of national institutions. As a result, such a study can provide more decisive evidence for the question whether leaders matter for economic growth. In most countries, however, subnational leaders do not serve in more than one locality, making comparisons among them impossible because their observed performances are the results of a combination of their own abilities and local conditions. In this regard, China provides a unique opportunity for the study of subnational leaders. In the country, local leaders are engaged in a tournament in which they compete with each other for promotion (Li and Zhou 2005; Xu 2011). In the process, a large number of them are periodically shuffled between localities; those movers, or leaders who are shuffled, connect leaders serving in different localities in such a way that we can compare all the leaders in the connected cities, regardless when they served there. Tracing the leaders who served in more than one city, we construct connected subsamples of cities that had leaders moving between them. With the largest of those subsamples, we are able to adopt the decomposition method developed by labor economists for linked employer–employee data (Abowd et al. 1999; Bertrand and Schoar 2003) to estimate leaders’ relative contributions to local economic growth (leader effects) and to compare them across cities and over time. This approach is an improvement to the Jones and Olken test, which only accounts for within-locality variations. One potential problem of our decomposition exercise is that the leader effects thus measured may only pick up the heteroskedastic shocks that the cities received during leaders’ tenures. To rule out this possibility, we conduct several robustness checks including a study of the residuals first applied by Bertrand and Schoar (2003), a placebo test that perturbs leaders’ tenures within a city, and a city-specific AR(1) process. In addition to studying local leaders’ contribution to economic growth, we explore the link between the estimated leader effects and leaders’ chances of getting promoted. We keep in mind two aims for doing this. The first is to check the consistency of our first-step results. To the extent that the Chinese hierarchy—one that is modeled on the Soviet nomenklatura—promotes local leaders based on their personal abilities (Xu 2011), we should find a positive correlation between leader effects and leaders’ chances of promotion. We can then be more confident that our estimates of the leader effects reflect leaders’ true abilities if these effects have good predictive power for leaders’ chances of promotion. However, studying promotion of leaders introduces a complication to our econometric strategy. To the extent that leaders’ abilities affect both local economic growth and their chances of promotion, estimating their leader effects and promotion separately would suffer from the problem of simultaneity biases. Inspired by Abowd et al. (2006) and Buchinsky et al. (2010), we then take a system-of-equations approach to estimate the leader effects and their impacts on promotion together. Our second aim in studying promotion outcomes is to improve on the existing literature on the Chinese promotion tournament. We make two methodological contributions in this regard. First, the existing studies use the average growth rate over a leader’s tenure to predict his promotion. However, the growth rate may not entirely reflect a leader’s own capabilities, which presumably are the factor the government’s organizational department looks at. We are able to infer leader effects from local economic growth rates and use leader effects to predict leaders’ promotion; therefore, we provide a more informative test for the relationship between leader performance and promotion. Second, the existing studies all take a single-equation approach and thus can suffer from simultaneity biases. Our system-of-equations approach can address the problem. In addition to the two methodological contributions, our data enable us to provide more reliable estimates than those found in the current literature. The existing studies (e.g., Li and Zhou 2005; Xu et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2009) have all studied provincial leaders. One problem with this approach is that the number of observations is limited. In addition, political loyalty can become more important for promotion and performance becomes less important when one moves up the hierarchy (Landry et al. 2015). It is found that promotion of provincial leaders to the central level is often influenced by political factors (Opper and Brehmm 2007; Shih et al. 2012). The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives a description of the sources and structure of the data. Section 3 studies leaders’ contribution to local economic growth. We first lay out the baseline econometric specification linking local economic growth rates with the leader effects and describe the problem of indeterminacy implied by the specification. Then we show how a connected sample allows us to overcome the problem. Lastly, we present the empirical results and several robustness tests dealing with the potential heteroskedasticity in the data. Section 4 studies how leader effects influence leaders’ promotion. We first adopt a single-equation approach, and then we estimate leader effects and leaders’ promotion in a system of equations. Section 5 concludes the paper.",1
21,1,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-015-9122-3,Premature deindustrialization,Dani Rodrik,,,Male,,,Male,"Our modern world is in many ways the product of industrialization. It was the industrial revolution that enabled sustained productivity growth in Europe and the United States for the first time, resulting in the division of the world economy into rich and poor nations. It was industrialization again that permitted catch-up and convergence with the West by a relatively smaller number of non-Western nations—Japan starting in the late Nineteenth century, South Korea, Taiwan and a few others after the 1960s. In countries that still remain mired in poverty, such as those in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, many observers and policy makers believe future economic hopes rest in important part on fostering new manufacturing industries. Most of the advanced economies of the world have long moved into a new, post-industrial phase of development. These economies have been deindustrializing for decades, a trend that is particularly noticeable when one looks at the employment share of manufacturing. Employment deindustrialization has long been a concern in rich nations, where it is associated in public discussions with the loss of good jobs, rising inequality, and a potential decline in innovation capacity.Footnote 1 In terms of output, deindustrialization has been in fact less striking and uniform, a pattern that is obscured by the frequent reliance on value added measures at current rather than constant prices. In the United States manufacturing industries’ share of total employment has steadily fallen since the 1950s, coming down from around a quarter of the workforce to less than a tenth today. Meanwhile, manufacturing value-added (MVA) has remained a constant share of GDP at constant prices—a testament to differentially rapid labor productivity growth in this sector. In Great Britain, at the other end of the spectrum, deindustrialization has been both more rapid and thorough. Manufacturing’s share of employment has fallen from a third in the 1970s to slightly above 10 % today, while real MVA (at 2005 prices) has declined from around a quarter of GDP to less than 15 %.Footnote 2 Across the developed world as a whole, real manufacturing output has held its own rather well once we control for changes in income and population, as I will show later in the paper. The term deindustrialization is used today to refer to the experience mainly of these advanced economies. In this paper, I focus on a less noticed trend over the last three decades, which is an even more striking, and puzzling, pattern of deindustrialization in low- and middle-income countries. With some exceptions, confined largely to Asia, developing countries have experienced falling manufacturing shares in both employment and real value added, especially since the 1980s. For the most part, these countries had built up modest manufacturing industries during the 1950s and 1960s, behind protective walls and under policies of import substitution. These industries have been shrinking significantly since then. The low-income economies of Sub-Saharan Africa have been affected nearly as much by these trends as the middle-income economies of Latin America—though there was less manufacturing to begin with in the former group of countries. Manufacturing typically follows an inverted U-shaped path over the course of development. Even though such a pattern can be observed in developing countries as well, the turning point arrives sooner and at much lower levels of income today. In most of these countries, manufacturing has begun to shrink (or is on course for shrinking) at levels of income that are a fraction of those at which the advanced economies started to deindustrialize.Footnote 3 Developing countries are turning into service economies without having gone through a proper experience of industrialization. I call this “premature deindustrialization.”Footnote 4
 There are two senses in which the shrinking of manufacturing in low and medium income economies can be viewed as premature. The first, purely descriptive, sense is that these economies are undergoing deindustrialization much earlier than the historical norms. As I will show in Sect. 6, late industrializers are unable to build as large manufacturing sectors and are starting to deindustrialize at considerably lower levels of income, compared to early industrializers. The second sense in which this is premature is that early deindustrialization may have detrimental effects on economic growth. Manufacturing activities have some features that make them instrumental in the process of growth. First, manufacturing tends to be technologically a dynamic sector. In fact, as demonstrated in Rodrik (2013), formal manufacturing sectors exhibit unconditional labor productivity convergence, unlike the rest of the economy. Second, manufacturing has traditionally absorbed significant quantities of unskilled labor, something that sets it apart from other high-productivity sectors such as mining or finance. Third, manufacturing is a tradable sector, which implies that it does not face the demand constraints of a home market populated by low-income consumers. It can expand and absorb workers even is the rest of the economy remains technologically stagnant. Taken together, these features make manufacturing the quintessential escalator for developing economies (Rodrik 2014). Hence early deindustrialization could well remove the main channel through which rapid growth has taken place in the past. My focus in the present paper is on documenting deindustrialization trends against the background of these considerations, rather than on examining their normative consequences. I do spend some time to consider the underlying causes of these trends. I present a simple theoretical framework in Sect. 7 to help interpret the key empirical findings of the paper. Two important differences across country groups in particular need explanation. First, advanced countries as a group have managed to avoid output deindustrialization, unlike the bulk of developing countries. Second, among developing countries, Asian countries have experienced no output or employment deindustrialization. (Note that these patterns refer to outcomes after income and demographic trends are controlled for.) I do not attempt here a full-fledged causal explanation for the patterns. But the model is suggestive of the combinations of technology and trade shocks that can account for the observed heterogeneity. In brief, productivity improvements appear to have played the major role in the advanced economies, while globalization features more prominently in accounting for industrialization-deindustrialization patterns within the developing world. The conventional explanation for employment deindustrialization relies on differential rates of technological progress (Lawrence and Edwards 2013). Typically, manufacturing experiences more rapid productivity growth than the rest of the economy. This results in a reduction in the share of the economy’s labor employed by manufacturing as long as the elasticity of substitution between manufacturing and other sectors is less than unity \((\sigma <1)\). As I show in Sect. 7, however, under the same assumptions the output share of manufacturing moves in the opposite direction. To get both employment and output deindustrialization, we need to make additional assumptions: that the trade balance in manufactures becomes more negative or that there is a secular demand shift away from manufactures. (The math is worked out in Sect. 7.) Since the more pronounced story in the advanced countries is employment rather than output deindustrialization, a technology-based story does reasonably well to account for the patterns there. Further, the evidence suggests that a particular type of technological progress, of the unskilled-labor saving type, is responsible for the bulk of the labor displacement from manufacturing (Sect. 5). For developing countries, however, it is less evident that the technology argument applies in quite the same way. Crucially, the mechanism referred to above relies on adjustments in domestic relative prices. Differential technological progress in manufacturing depresses the relative price of manufacturing. In the case where \(\sigma <1\), this decline is sufficiently large that it ensures demand for labor in manufacturing is lower in the new equilibrium. The big difference in developing countries is that they are small in world markets for manufactures, where they are essentially price takers. In the limit, when relative prices are fully determined by global (rather than domestic) supply-demand conditions, more rapid productivity growth in manufacturing at home actually produces industrialization, not deindustrialization – in terms of both employment and output (as the model of Sect. 7 shows). So the culprit for deindustrialization in developing countries must be found elsewhere. The obvious alternative is trade and globalization. A plausible story would be the following. As developing countries opened up to trade, their manufacturing sectors were hit by a double shock. Those without a strong comparative advantage in manufacturing became net importers of manufacturing, reversing a long process of import-substitution.Footnote 5 In addition, developing countries “imported” deindustrialization from the advanced countries, because they became exposed to the relative price trends originating from advanced economies. The decline in the relative price of manufacturing in the advanced countries put a squeeze on manufacturing everywhere, including the countries that may not have experienced much technological progress. This account is consistent with the strong reduction in both employment and output shares in developing countries (especially those that do not specialize in manufactures). It also helps account for the fact that Asian countries, with a comparative advantage in manufactures, have been spared the same trends. In sum, while technological progress is no doubt a large part of the story behind employment deindustrialization in the advanced countries, in the developing countries trade and globalization likely played a comparatively bigger role. The outline of the paper is as follows. In Sect. 2, I discuss the data, various measures of deindustrialization, and the inverse-U shaped relationship between industrialization and incomes. In Sects. 3 and 4, I document the patterns of deindustrialization over time and across different country groups. In Sect. 5, I look at employment deindustrialization, differentiating across different labor types. In Sect. 6, I make the concept of premature deindustrialization more precise. In Sect. 7, I develop an analytical framework within which the empirical results can be interpreted. In Sect. 8, I conclude.",1
21,1,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-015-9121-4,Urbanization with and without industrialization,Douglas Gollin,Remi Jedwab,Dietrich Vollrath,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Developing countries have urbanized dramatically over the last 50 years. This episode of massive urbanization shares many similarities with the historical urbanization process of today’s developed countries. As in the historical experience, urbanization in today’s developing countries is closely linked to increasing income per capita. Indeed, the correlation is so strong that urbanization is often used as a proxy for income per capita in comparisons across time and space (De Long and Shleifer 1993; Acemoglu et al. 2002). There is also a virtuous circle between economic development and urbanization (Henderson 2010; Duranton 2013; Glaeser 2013; Jedwab and Vollrath 2015b). As countries develop, people move out of rural areas and agricultural activities into urban centers, where they engage in manufacturing and service activities (Gollin et al. 2002; Michaels et al. 2012). These non-agricultural sectors are generally thought to have high rates of productivity growth, and agglomeration effects in urban areas are also believed to promote further economic growth (Glaeser et al. 1992; Duranton 2008; Glaeser and Gottlieb 2009). The historical pattern in the European and Neo-European countries that have undergone significant urbanization (beyond 50 %) has been that urbanization has accompanied industrialization; with the factories came the cities. In many developing countries, however, urbanization has deviated from this pattern. Many of today’s developing countries have high rates of urbanization with little significant industry. Kuwait, Gabon, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Algeria, Angola and Nigeria are as urbanized as Uruguay, Taiwan, South Korea, Mexico, Malaysia, South Africa and China respectively, and yet the former countries have not industrialized to the same extent as the latter. This raises several questions. What has driven the urbanization process in Angola, Nigeria, and the others, in the absence of industry? Why have so many cities in today’s developing world never been factory cities, in stark contrast to the historical experience of today’s developed countries? If these cities have a different origin, does it matter for economic development? In this paper, we document that the expected relationship between urbanization and industrialization is absent in large parts of the developing world. The breakdown in this relationship occurs because of a large number of natural resource exporting countries that urbanized without significantly increasing the share of output from manufacturing and/or tradable services in GDP. Using a sample of 116 developing countries observed each decade from 1960–2010, we show that under a variety of specifications there is a statistically significant and economically meaningful association of resource exports with the urbanization rate. This is estimated holding constant the share of manufacturing and services in GDP. In our preferred specification, a one standard deviation increase in resource exports is associated with a 0.51 standard deviation increase in the urbanization rate, which equates to a roughly 13 % point increase. The effect of resource exports on urbanization holds not only in the cross-section but also in a panel that uses within-country variation for identification. These specifications are robust to adding region-decade fixed effects (Western Africa in the 1960s, etc.). Our results hold when incorporating a variety of controls for confounding effects. Different means of measuring the role of natural resource exports—as a percent of GDP, value per capita, or including only fuel and mining exports—do not qualitatively alter the results. Following the existing literature (Sachs and Warner 2001; Brückner 2012; Henderson et al. 2013b), we also use resource discoveries and international commodity price shocks as instruments for resource exports to provide further evidence of causality. One can think of our approach as being similar to a “difference-in-difference” estimator, where countries that find a new resource (e.g. Botswana discovering diamonds in 1968) are the treatment group. The control groups are countries that either never discovered a resource in this period or were producing a natural resource the entire time. The IV results are consistent with our cross-section and panel findings. Having established this relationship between natural resource dependence and urbanization, we then consider whether urbanization in resource-exporting countries differs substantially from urbanization in industrializing countries. In the cross-section, the strong positive relationship between income and urbanization is similar regardless of the source of urbanization. In fact, conditional on income per capita, urbanization rates are unrelated to the share of resource exports in GDP or the share of manufacturing and services in GDP. Urbanization is a function of income per capita across all countries. However, the composition of urban employment differs starkly between resource-exporters and non-exporters, holding constant income levels and urbanization rates. We use IPUMS census micro-data, labor force surveys, and household survey data to recreate the sectoral composition of urban areas for a sub-sample of 88 countries. Using this novel data set, we find that cities in resource-exporting countries are what we term “consumption cities”, with a larger fraction of workers in non-tradable services such as commerce and transportation or personal and government services.Footnote 1 Cities in countries that do not export significant resources, on the other hand, appear to be “production cities”, with more workers in industrial sectors such as manufacturing or in tradable services like finance. The differences between consumption cities and production cities are not limited to employment patterns. We show that, in addition, cities in resource-exporters tend to have higher poverty rates and shares of population in slums than non-exporters, holding constant income levels and urbanization rates. Unconditionally, however, resource exporters are better off than non-exporters on these various measures of urban welfare. Our interpretation is that the income boost from resource exports makes cities richer, but it does not appear to translate into improved quality of life to the same degree that an income boost through industrialization would provide. Our findings could be seen as an example of “premature urbanization” (rather than “premature deindustrialization” as in Rodrik 2013a). Whether this constitutes a resource curse is not clear. As we show, the high urbanization rates in resource exporters are driven by high incomes; so in that sense, there is no evidence for a resource curse. Yet the “consumption cities” of resource exporters may not offer all the welfare advantages of “production cities”.Footnote 2
 To understand how resources are related to urbanization, we develop a model of labor allocations between rural and urban areas that allows for two types of urban employment: tradables and non-tradables.Footnote 3 An exogenous increase in resource export earnings raises incomes, which in turn increases demand for all types of output. The export earnings from resources are used to purchase additional food and other tradable goods on the world market; meanwhile, the increased demand for urban non-tradables is met by an increase in labor in that sector. This result echoes the standard Balassa-Samuelson framework and also corresponds in some respects to a standard model of “Dutch Disease” (Corden and Neary 1982; Matsuyama 1992; Harding and Venables 2013), where resource exports lead to a contraction of employment in other tradable sectors but expand non-tradable employment. In our model, resource rents cause an increase in the urbanization rate as the rural sector contracts, and there is a shift in the composition of urban employment towards non-tradable workers. Urbanization generated by resource rents differs from urbanization generated by industrialization, which occurs when industrial productivity increases. In the latter, substitution effects pull labor into the urban industrial sector, in addition to the income effects which draw labor into non-tradable production. Our results illustrate that urbanization and industrialization are not synonymous and that significant amounts of urbanization can and will take place in response to income shocks from resource exports. But resource-exporting countries may urbanize without acquiring the industrial sectors that we typically associate with development. The “consumption cities” of resource-exporters may nevertheless exert an influence on growth.Footnote 4 These cities have higher shares of non-tradable service workers and lower shares of industrial sector workers. Much research in the growth literature (Lucas 2009; Duarte and Restuccia 2010; Rodrik 2013b) suggests that convergence is faster in industry than in services. This suggests that the source of urbanization (resource exports or industrialization), while inconsequential with regard to the level of urbanization, may be consequential for long-run development. To pick up the example of the countries mentioned above, Kuwait, Libreville, Riyadh, Tripoli, Algiers, Luanda and Lagos have relatively fewer workers in manufacturing and tradable services than Montevideo, Taipei, Seoul, Mexico City, Kuala Lumpur, Johannesburg and Shanghai respectively, in spite of similar aggregate levels of income and urbanization. It is not clear that resource-led consumption cities will generate the same kind of productivity growth associated with cities in industrializing countries. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a model of structural change that frames the empirical investigation to follow. Section 3 describes the data and presents stylized facts regarding resources and urbanization. Section 4 provides formal estimates of the relationship between resources and urbanization, while Sect. 5 empirically examines the consequences of resource-led urbanization. Section 6 concludes.",1
21,1,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-016-9125-8,Of maize and men: the effect of a New World crop on population and economic growth in China,Shuo Chen,James Kai-sing Kung,,,Male,,Male,"According to economic theories duly influenced by Malthus, the world before the eighteenth century was trapped within a Malthusian regime, as technological progress and land expansion primarily generated an increase in the size of the population but seldom income per capita.Footnote 1 China provides compelling evidence on this Malthusian process. The high-pressure demographic regime with positive Malthusian checks in China at the time implied that productivity growth was most likely transformed at much higher rates into population growth than it did in Europe (Voigtländer and Voth 2006). Indeed, With a population that almost tripled from 130 million in 1500 to 400 million in 1900 (Cao 2000; Ho 1959; Perkins 1969), China alone accounted for approximately one-third of the world’s population increase (Fig. 1), and yet per capita GDP remained stagnant at the subsistence level of roughly US$600 (in adjusted terms) for an even longer period (Maddison 2001). This paper uses systematic evidence about China as a whole to ask how a particular technology influenced growth in population and income. To answer that question, we thus construct a unique data set from historical gazetteers on the adoption of maize—a New World crop originated from today’s Mexico, to test whether the adoption of what essentially is a new agricultural technology has had the effect of boosting both population and economic growth—modern economic growth in short (e.g., Galor 2005, 2011), or just population growth. We choose to study the impact of New World crops because of the allegedly vast improvements in caloric and nutritional intake they brought to the Old World population. For example, Nunn and Qian (2011) find that the potato contributed to an increase in Old World population of 25–26 % between 1700 and 1900 and to a rise in urbanization of 27–34 %. This latter finding led them to the bold claim that population growth induced by the “Columbian Exchange”, which is defined as “the exchange of diseases, ideas, food crops, and populations between the New World and the Old World ....” (Nunn and Qian 2010: 163), may have played a causal role in moving the Old World into a new epoch of modern economic growth. Of the three New World crops—maize, sweet potato, and the potato—that China adopted, we study maize because it was the most suitable for cultivation in China, and because of data availability.Footnote 2
 By employing a difference-in-differences (DID) approach, we present evidence on the contribution of maize planting to population growth in China. Specifically, we find that maize accounted for an increase in population of nearly 19 % during 1776–1910—a magnitude that may be considered a lower bound estimate of the effect of all New World crops taken together or an upper bound estimate of the effect of maize alone. Our results are robust to the inclusion of a variety of controls ranging from alternative channels of agricultural innovation such as the multiple cropping of rice, to the direct “positive checks” of civil wars and epidemics. Population in China and the world. Source Cao (2000), Maddison (2001) Unlike the alleged growth effect of the potato, maize failed to deliver economic growth to this Middle Kingdom, regardless of whether we measure growth by urbanization or real wages. We thus present the very first evidence that massive population growth in the Old World, driven by the adoption of New World crops, was hardly a sufficient condition for Industrial Revolution—at least not in the case of China; China was still operating under a Malthusian regime even by the end of the nineteenth century.Footnote 3
 While our contribution is primarily empirical, the rich evidence our analysis provides on China’s Malthusian regime is important for understanding long-run economic growth in the tradition of the unified growth theory (Galor and Weil 2000; Galor 2005, 2011). More specifically, our study sheds much needed light on a fundamental puzzle underlying the sharp contrast between Europe and China in their trajectories of long-run economic growth, which recently has attracted tremendous scholarly interest (e.g., Broadberry and Gupta 2006; Jones 1981; Landes 2006; Lucas 2002; Pomeranz 2000; Pritchett 1997; Voigtländer and Voth 2006, 2013a, b; Rosenthal and Wong 2011). The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we provide a brief account of how maize was diffused in China, and in Sect. 3 we introduce our data and their sources and the variables employed in the empirical analysis. Our empirical strategies and baseline results are described in Sect. 4, whereas a host of robustness checks are discussed in Sect. 5. In Sect. 6, we present evidence on the relationship between maize planting and economic growth. Section 7 provides a brief conclusion.",1
21,2,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-016-9127-6,Birthplace diversity and economic prosperity,Alberto Alesina,Johann Harnoss,Hillel Rapoport,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Population heterogeneity is increasing in virtually all advanced economies due to immigration. Foreign-born individuals now represent about 10 % of the workforce in OECD countries, a threefold increase since 1960 and a twofold increase since 1990. High-skill migration is growing even faster, with a twofold increase during the 1990s alone.Footnote 1 As a result, the diversity of the skilled workforce (measured as the likelihood that two randomly-drawn skilled workers have different countries of birth) in a typical OECD country has increased by more than 3 percentage-points (from 0.19 to 0.22) within just ten years.Footnote 2
 What are the economic implications of higher diversity? Theory suggests that diversity has positive and negative economic effects. The former are due to complementarities in production, diversity of skills, experiences and ideas (think of a Dixit-Stiglitz production function). The latter arise from disagreements about public policies, animosity between different groups and conflict. The empirical literature has so far focused on ethnic and linguistic fractionalization, which were shown to exert negative effects on economic growth in cross-country comparisons (Easterly and Levine 1997; Collier 2001; Alesina et al. 2003, Forthcoming), with the possible exception of very rich countries (see Alesina and La Ferrara 2005, for a survey on these issues). Ashraf and Galor (2013a, b) focus on genetic diversity and show that it exhibits an inverse u-shaped relationship with income per capita. On balance the negative effects of diversity seem to dominate empirically. To put it differently, it has been relatively hard to empirically document the positive economic effects of diversity, which is the key objective of this paper. We examine the relationship between population diversity in birthplaces and economic prosperity and specifically make four contributions. First, we construct and discuss the properties of a new index of birthplace diversity. We build indicators of diversity for the workforce of 195 countries in 1990 and 2000, disaggregated by education level, and computed both for the workforce as a whole and for its foreign-born component. Empirically, ethno-linguistic, genetic and birthplace diversity are almost completely uncorrelated. Conceptually, ethno-linguistic, genetic and birthplace diversity also differ as people born in different countries are likely to have been educated in different school systems, learned different skills, and developed different cognitive abilities. Intuitively, this may not be the case for people of different ethnic or genetic origins who were born, raised and educated in the same country. Second, we investigate the relationship between birthplace diversity and economic development. We find that unlike ethnic/linguistic fractionalization, birthplace diversity remains positively related to long-run income after controlling for many covariates. This positive relationship is stronger for skilled migrants (workers with college education) in richer countries and economically meaningful. Increasing the diversity of skilled immigrants by 1 percentage-point raises long-run output by about 2 %. Third, we make progress towards addressing endogeneity issues arising from selection on unobservables and reverse causality. We show that our results are unlikely to be explained by positive selection on unobservables. To address reverse causality, we specify a gravity model to predict the size and diversity of a country’s immigration using bilateral geographic/cultural variables. We confirm the robustness of our OLS findings in 2SLS models. Fourth, we allow the effect of diversity to vary with bilateral cultural distance between immigrants and natives. We also investigate the effect of income per capita at origin. The productive effect of birthplace diversity is largest for immigrants from richer origin countries and for immigrants from countries at intermediate levels of cultural proximity. That is, the effect of diversity is inversely u-shaped in terms of cultural distance between immigrant and native workers. This suggests an optimal level of birthplace diversity in terms of cultural proximity.Footnote 3
 The current empirical evidence linking income and productivity differences to birthplace diversity is growing rapidly but is still limited when it comes to cross-country evidence. Existing studies have focused mainly on the United States. Ottaviano and Peri (2006) construct a measure of cultural diversity for the period 1970–1990 using migration data on US metropolitan areas and find positive effects on the productivity of native workers as measured by their wages.Footnote 4 Peri (2012) finds positive effects of the diversity coming from immigration on the productivity of US states, a result he attributes to unskilled migrants promoting efficient task-specialization and adoption of unskilled-efficient technologies, and more so when immigration is diverse. Ager and Brückner (2013) study the link between immigration, diversity and economic growth in the context of the United States about a century ago, at a time now commonly referred to as “the age of mass migration” (Hatton and Williamson 1998).Footnote 5 They find that fractionalization increases output while polarization decreases it in US counties during the period 1870–1920. Cross-country comparisons include Andersen and Dalgaard (2011), who find positive effects of travel intensity on total factor productivity which they attribute to knowledge diffusion of temporary migrants, and Ortega and Peri (2014), who analyze the connection between income per capita and migration in a cross-section of countries. They focus on the growth effects of openness and diversity of trade vs. migration and find the share of immigration to be a stronger determinant of long run output than trade. In contrast, we focus on the effect of intrapopulation diversity, comparing birthplace to other dimensions of diversity (ethnic, linguistic, genetic) and demonstrate the positive effect of the diversity arising from skilled immigration on income per capita. The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 briefly discusses theoretical channels and related literature on diversity and economic performance. Section 3 explains the construction and analytical decomposition of our birthplace diversity index; we also explore its descriptive features and patterns of correlation with other diversity/fractionalization indices. In Sect. 4 we provide data sources, develop our empirical model, and describe OLS results for birthplace diversity in a range of empirical specifications. In Sect. 5, we discuss unobserved heterogeneity and reverse causality, showing that they are unlikely to explain our results. In Sect. 6, we augment our birthplace diversity index to include cultural distance and income at origin. Section 7 concludes.",1
21,2,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-016-9126-7,Are the world’s poorest being left behind?,Martin Ravallion,,,Male,,,Male,"At the launch of the United Nations’ (2011) Millennium Goals Report, the U.N.’s Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that: “The poorest of the world are being left behind. We need to reach out and lift them into our lifeboat.” This view is heard often. A press release by the International Food Policy Research Institute carried the headline: “The world’s poorest people not being reached.”Footnote 1 On the occasion of the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty in 2014, the International Labor Organization’s Director-General, Guy Ryder, wrote that “Poverty is not yet defeated. Far too many are being left behind.” And the Vatican’s representative to the United Nations reaffirmed in 2015 that the poorest of the world are being left behind.Footnote 2
 Yet other observers appear to tell a very different story. They use aphorisms such as “a rising tide lifts all boats” or that “growth is good for the poor” (the title of a paper published in this journal) or that the poor are “breaking through from the bottom.”Footnote 3 Proponents of this alternative view draw on data in the form of survey-based measures of poverty or inequality. This paper tries to understand these seemingly conflicting views. The central issue is how we should assess progress against poverty. The main approach of economists and statisticians has been to count the poor in some way. One might track the proportion of the population living below some deliberately low poverty line or use a more sophisticated measure giving higher weight to poorer people. Bowley (1915) was a prominent early advocate of this approach. Since then, the theoretical foundations of the approach are found in a large literature on poverty measurement, in which various axioms have been proposed.Footnote 4 I dub this the counting approach. The common feature is that the measure of poverty is obtained by counting poor people, though possibly giving higher weight to the poorest. Typically, the measure of poverty is a population-weighted average of individual measures of poverty across the population (counting the non-poor as having zero poverty). The paper argues that the counting approach does not adequately address prevailing concerns about whether the poorest are being left behind during economic growth. Logically, for the poorest to not be left behind there must be an increase in the lower bound of the support of the distribution of levels of living. That lower bound can be called the consumption floor. An appealing concept of “level of living” in this context is permanent consumption (Friedman 1957). If the poorest person sees a gain in permanent consumption then (by definition) the consumption floor has risen. Human physiology makes it plausible that there is a positive floor, given the nutritional requirements for basal metabolism and normal activities. This can be called the “the biological floor.” However, given economic growth and (private and public) redistribution the actual consumption floor may well be above the biological floor. Prevailing measures of economic progress put little or no weight on progress in raising the floor. It is clear that the growth rate in the overall mean consumption will have a low (possibly very low) implicit weight on the growth rate in the floor, given that the share going to the poorest is likely to be low. What about measures of poverty? Each panel of Fig. 1 gives two cumulative distribution functions (CDFs). In each case, the upper CDF is the initial one and the lower CDF is for a later date. As drawn, no standard measure of poverty will show an increase (Atkinson 1987). The drop in the incidence of poverty at the indicated poverty line is similar in panels (a) and (b). In (a), the counting approach can reasonably claim that many of the poorest have been reached even though the floor has not risen, so some people still remain living at the same very low level. In panel (b), the same reduction in the poverty rate has come with a rising floor—implying that the poorest are left behind. Same reduction in the poverty count but different implications for the poorest. a Poorest left behind. b Same reduction in the incidence of poverty but without leaving the poorest behind The idea that we should judge progress in part by success in raising the floor is missing from all standard poverty measures. The concept of the consumption floor is conceptually distinct from existing poverty lines.Footnote 5 Naturally, any poverty line aims to reflect what “poverty” means in a specific society, on the understanding that (potentially many) people live below that level. The poverty line is a normative concept, while the consumption floor is a positive one. The most widely-used poverty measure, the “headcount index” attaches no value to success in raising the floor.Footnote 6 Those living at the floor will have the highest weight in the subset of poverty measures that penalize inequality among the poor though even then there is no assurance that adequate weight will be attached to progress in raising the floor.Footnote 7 Indeed, in most measures the weight on the individual poverty measure is the corresponding population density, which may well be quite low for the poorest. This neglect of explicit attention to the poorest appears to be due, at least in part, to the difficulties in identifying the floor.Footnote 8 While some theoretical formulations of the policy-evaluation problem have assumed that measuring the lowest level of living is straightforward,Footnote 9 that is clearly not the case in practice. The lowest observed consumption in a survey may differ appreciably from the lowest permanent consumption. Given the current interest in assuring that no one is left behind, this is a gap in the “dashboard” of development indicators. The difference between the two approaches, as illustrated by Fig. 1, begs some questions for which we currently have little idea of the answers: The consumption floor plausibly exists, but at what level? Has the growth we have seen in mean consumption and income in the developing world come with growth in the level of the floor? Has success against poverty judged by the counting approach also come with success in raising the floor? The task of addressing these questions calls for a method of estimating the level of the consumption floor. With ideal data—let us imagine a complete set of accurate measures of permanent consumption across the population—the problem is trivial; we just look for the lowest value. However, actual data are a very long way from this ideal. Instead, we confront a severe and fundamental data constraint. Standard household surveys only ask respondents about consumption or income over relatively short recall periods, and such data are certain to contain sizable transient components. It is also clear that poverty monitoring and social policy discussions are motivated by concerns about low levels of typical consumption. When we refer to the typical level of living of the poorest stratum we are acknowledging that consumption may be low (relative to permanent consumption) at one date for transient reasons (as exemplified by Fig. 2). Identifying the floor as the strict lower bound of observed consumptions or incomes would clearly be unsatisfactory as it is subject to transient factors, and measurement errors. We need a more robust approach that is still operational with the data available. Stylized representation of the relationship between current and permanent consumption The paper proposes an approach that can be implemented with readily available data. The method entails estimating the expected value of the consumption floor as a weighted mean formed over a stratum of people with low observed consumption levels, with higher weight for those who appear to be the poorer. These are not normative weights, but rather they reflect the likelihood that any observed consumption is in fact the floor. Specifically, under weak assumptions, it is shown that the lowest observed consumption has the highest probability of being at the floor, but that probability is less than one. When parameterized by a power function, the idea of the consumption floor can then be interpreted in terms of standard, readily available, poverty measures in the Foster et al. (1984) class. For various parameter values, the implied estimate of the consumption floor is around half of the international poverty line of $1.25 a day. The paper also finds that this estimate agrees quite closely with alternative sources, including an approach based on national poverty lines, when interpreted as the expected value of the consumption floor plus a relative component proportional to mean consumption. The paper then shows that, while the developing world has seen a high growth rate in mean consumption in the new millennium, and the counting approach shows much progress in reducing poverty, there has been little progress in raising the floor over the last 30 years. The distribution of the gains amongst the poor has meant that the expected value of the lowest level of living has advanced rather little. After reviewing the literature and policy discussions related to the idea of a consumption floor (Sect. 2), the paper describes the data to be used in this study (Sect. 3). Then it turns to the proposed measure of the floor and its empirical implementation (Sect. 4) as well as discussing the alternative approaches (Sect. 5). For comparison purposes, the paper then presents new evidence using the counting approach (Sect. 6). In the light of the paper’s main findings, Sect. 7 offers some observations on the coverage of social safety nets in developing countries. Section 8 concludes.",1

In Weber’s view (Weber 1904) the root of capitalism could be related to the emergence of Protestant ethical principles. These principles were more compatible with the secular activities attached to the new economic order than were those of Catholicism, since the Protestant principles emphasised individualism and work ethic and were favourable to individual achievement and success. However, some authors criticised Weber’s analysis arguing that capitalistic development pre-dated the Reformation (Tawney 1926) and most of the evidence to date has failed to confirm Weber’s hypothesis. Recent contributions have renewed the debate about the correctness of Weber’s thesis. Becker and Woessmann (2009) suggest that Protestantism affected economic activity in Prussia by increasing education through the precept of personal reading of the Bible rather than through the ethical principles suggested by Weber. Andersen et al. (2013) argue that the distribution of preferences for hard work and thrift in Europe nowadays fits better with the distribution of the Cistercian monasteries (whose diffusion largely pre-dated the Reformation), than with the distribution of the Reformation. Cantoni (2015)’s analysis of historical German data finds no effect of Protestant ethic on city growth. Arrunada (2010) points out that Protestants work longer hours and have a stronger sense of the rule of law than Catholics do. Basten and Betz (2013) exploit the conversion to Protestantism of part of a previously homogeneous region in Western Switzerland occurred in the sixteenth century to find that the area that remained Catholic is nowadays characterized by stronger preferences for leisure and redistribution compared to that converted to Protestantism. We add to this debate by investigating the relationship between religious ethic and one fundamental feature of capitalism and the market economy, i.e. entrepreneurship. We broadly define entrepreneurs to include all those individuals that risk on their own, self-organize their work schedule, often manage dependent employees and are residual claimants of the results of their ventures, in good and bad times. Hence, the entrepreneurs are captains of industry, business leaders in any economic sector but also professionals and small business owners. What are the individual motives for becoming an entrepreneur and does religious ethic play a role? According to the economic literature on entrepreneurship, the fundamental determinants of the individual decision to become entrepreneur are the presence of a generic entrepreneurship ability and risk attitude. (See Parker 2005 for a review). According to the psychological literature, a propensity for entrepreneurship depends on individual psychological traits, such as determination, risk aversion, the need for achievement, resilience, self-confidence, a sense of independence and sense of life (McClelland 1961; Cuervo 2005; Renneboog and Spaenjers 2012). McClelland (1961) suggests that all these attributes may be significantly influenced by the ethical principles inherent in Protestantism and Catholicism. In this paper we test this hypothesis and we ask whether and to what extent religious beliefs affect the decision of becoming an entrepreneur. The most relevant problem we see as inherent to this research question is that it is difficult to determine how deeply individuals internalise religious ethical principles. Whatever their formal affiliation to a particular denomination, individuals can differ substantially in the degree to which they adhere to their religion’s ethics and in the degree to which they take their religious affiliations seriously. Typically, people tend to report the denomination in which they were raised, regardless of their current degree of adhesion. Therefore, religious affiliation is often a poor proxy for the canons, ethics, and codes of conduct that each individual abides by.Footnote 1
 We propose a novel strategy to overcome such difficulty and estimate the effect of religious ethics on economic outcomes. Our research design exploits the fact that religious minorities tend to adhere more strongly to their denominations’ ethical principles than do those who practice the majority religion (see Nunziata and Rocco 2014 and the references therein) because religion is an important component of their identity that is worth defending against the influence of the majority. In addition, ministers of minority religions must work hard to preserve their herd, and minorities are subject to the pressure of the dominant religion (or, more generally, of the dominant culture) that only the more observant are able to resist. In comparing Catholic and Protestant minorities, we extract the differential effects of these diverse ethical principles on the propensity for entrepreneurship, under the hypothesis that religious minorities are alike in all other dimensions relevant to entrepreneurship.Footnote 2
 Our analysis focuses on Switzerland to take advantage of a number of favourable factors. First, Switzerland is homogeneous as regards its general economic conditions. It is one of the richest and most prosperous countries in the world, a sort of miniature of Western Europe that includes most of its linguistic groups, cultures and religions. In Switzerland, entrepreneurs represent the upper-end of the occupational distribution.Footnote 3 Second, Switzerland’s peculiar historical and religious background led Swiss cantons to host a variety of combinations of Protestant and Catholic minorities and majorities. Third, the denominations’ geographical distribution is historically determined with an almost perfect persistence over time. Fourth, Swiss Protestantism, represented by the Swiss Reformed Church, is relatively homogeneous in terms of its ethical principles, even though it derives from the Zwinglian tradition in the German cantons and from the Calvinist tradition in the French cantons. Our analysis of Swiss Census data shows that religious ethics significantly affect economic behaviour and outcomes. More precisely, adherence to Protestant ethical principles increases the probability that an individual will be an entrepreneur by between 1.5 and 3.2 % points with respect to Catholics (compared to a proportion of entrepreneurs equal to about 12 % of all active individuals), after controlling for a number of individual-level characteristics, including education and native language; geographical controls, including local activity rate and the proportion of active people involved in agriculture; and regional-by-time unobservable heterogeneity. Our research design rests on a number of critical assumptions. The religious minorities and majorities are assumed to be defined at the district level, regardless of the presence of religious groups of the same denomination in nearby districts and according to thresholds that, although reflecting both theoretical and practical considerations, maintain a certain degree of arbitrariness. Furthermore, the geographical distribution of religious groups is assumed to be historically determined and not the result of recent internal mobility. Finally, religious minorities are either assumed not to differ from the general population in key socio-economic dimensions unrelated to religious ethic, or, if they do, Protestant and Catholic minorities need to be different from non-minorities in a symmetric fashion. In particular, Protestant and Catholic minorities are assumed to experience similar contextual factors favouring or discouraging entrepreneurship. We discuss the plausibility of these assumptions and test the robustness of our findings to a long series of checks, including using alternative definitions of minorities and majorities at the canton, district and municipality level, allowing for non linear effects changing with the size of the religious minority, using the geographical distributions of denominations in 1870 and 1970, correcting for the effects of internal mobility, and a placebo test, where individual religious affiliation is randomly assigned. Our results survive each of these tests. The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides a background discussion of the differences between Protestantism and Catholicism in terms of their articles of faith and those differences’ implications for entrepreneurship. The data are presented in Sect. 3, the identification strategy in Sect. 4, and our main empirical results in Sect. 5. Sections 6 and 7 provide some additional analysis adopting, respectively, alternative definitions of religious minority and using alternative model specifications and samples. Finally section 8 concludes.",1
21,3,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-016-9130-y,The European origins of economic development,William Easterly,Ross Levine,,Male,Male,,Male,"Countries have followed divergent paths of economic development since European colonization. Some former colonies, such as the Congo, Guinea-Bissau, Malawi, and Tanzania, have experienced little economic development over the last few centuries, with current per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of about $2 per day. Others are among the richest countries in the world today, including Australia, Canada, and the United States, with per capita GDP levels of about $140 per day. Others fall along the spectrum between these extremes. To explain these divergent paths, many researchers emphasize that the European share of the population during colonization shaped national rates of economic growth through several mechanisms. Engerman and Sokoloff (1997) (ES) and Acemoglu et al. (2001, 2002) (AJR) stress that European colonization had enduring effects on political institutions. They argue that when Europeans encountered natural resources with lucrative international markets and did not find the lands, climate, and disease environment suitable for large-scale settlement, only a few Europeans settled and created authoritarian political institutions to extract resources. The institutions created by Europeans in these “extractive colonies” impeded long-run development. But, when Europeans found land, climate, and disease environments that were suitable for smaller-scale agriculture, they settled, forming “settler colonies” with political institutions that fostered development. This perspective has two testable implications: (1) former settler colonies with a large proportion of Europeans during colonization will create more inclusive political institutions that foster greater economic development than former extractive colonies with a small proportion of Europeans, and (2) colonial European settlement will have a stronger association with development today than current European settlement (the proportion of the population that is of European descent today) because of the enduring effect of institutions created during the colonial period. As an additional, potentially complementary mechanism, ES and Glaeser et al. (2004) (GLLS) note that the European share of the population during colonization influenced the rate of human capital accumulation. They argue that Europeans brought human capital and human capital creating institutions that shape long-run economic growth, as emphasized by Galor (2011). According to this human capital view, European settlers directly and immediately added human capital skills to the colonies and also had long-run effects on human capital accumulation. These long-run effects emerge because human capital disseminates throughout the population over generations and it takes time to create, expand, and improve schools. Furthermore, this human capital view suggests that a larger share of Europeans during colonization could facilitate human capital accumulation across the entire population both because it would increase interactions among people of European and non-European descent and because it might accelerate expanded access to schools, as emphasized in ES. This human capital view also yields two testable implications: (1) the proportion of Europeans during colonization will be positively related to human capital development and hence economic development today, and (2) the proportion of Europeans during colonization will matter more for economic development than the proportion of the population of European descent today because of the slow dissemination of human capital and creation of well-functioning schools. Although the political institutions and human capital views emphasize different mechanisms, they provide closely aligned predictions about the impact of colonial European settlement on current economic development. Other researchers, either explicitly or implicitly, highlight additional mechanisms through which European migration had positive or negative effects on development. North (1990) argues that the British brought comparatively strong political and legal institutions that were more conducive to economic development than the institutions brought by other European nations. This view stresses the need for a sufficiently strong European presence to instill those institutions, but does not necessarily suggest that the proportion of Europeans during colonization will affect economic development today beyond some initial threshold level. More recently, Spolaore and Wacziarg (2009) stress that the degree to which the genetic heritage of a colonial population was similar to that of the economies at the technological frontier positively affected the diffusion of technology and thus economic development, where European migration materially affected the genetic composition of economies. Putterman and Weil (2010) and Chanda et al. (2014) emphasize that the experiences with statehood and agriculture of the ancestors of people currently living within countries help explain cross-country differences in economic success. And, Comin et al. (2010) likewise find that the ancient technologies of the ancestors of populations today help predict per capita income of those populations. In all of these papers, the ancestral nature of a population helps account for cross-country differences in economic development, where European colonization materially shaped the composition of national populations.Footnote 1 As in the human capital view, the emphasis is on things that Europeans brought with them, such as technology. Although this considerable body of research emphasizes the role of European settlement during colonization on subsequent rates of economic development, what has been missing in the empirical literature is the key intermediating variable: colonial European settlement. While researchers, including AJR, have examined the European share of the population in 1900, this is well after the colonial period in several countries, including virtually all of the Western Hemisphere. To the best of our knowledge, researchers have not directly measured colonial European settlement and examined its association with current economic development. In this paper, we construct a new database on the European share of the population during colonization and use it to examine the historical determinants of colonial European settlement and the relation between colonial European settlement and current economic development. Although we do not isolate the specific mechanisms linking colonial European settlement with current levels of economic development as emphasized in each of the individual theories discussed above, we do assess the core empirical predictions emerging from the literature on the relationship between European settlement and economic development. In particular, we assess whether the proportion of Europeans during colonization is positively related to economic development today and whether the proportion of Europeans during colonization is more important in accounting for cross-country differences in current economic development than the proportion of the population of European descent today. We begin by compiling a new database on the European share of the population during colonization. For each country, we gather data from an assortment of primary and secondary sources for as many years as possible going back the sixteenth century. From these data, we construct several measures of European settlement that differ with respect to the date used to measure colonial European settlement. We first construct a country-specific measure based on the colonial history of each country. To do this, we use information on when Europeans first arrived in the country and when the colony became independent to select a date on which to measure colonial European settlement. For this country-specific measure, we seek a date, subject to data limitations, that is early in its colonial period but sufficiently after Europeans first arrived to allow for the formation of colonial institutions. We next construct measures that use a common date. For each country, we average the annual observations on the European share of the population over 1500–1800, 1801–1900, and 1500–1900. We obtain consistent results using these different methods for dating and measuring colonial European settlement. We then examine the historical determinants of colonial European settlement both to check the credibility of our new data and to examine differing views about the factors shaping European colonization. As a guide, we employ a very simple model of the costs and benefits of European settlement. Some determinants have already been discussed in the literature, such as pre-colonial population density, latitude, and the disease environment facing Europeans. Pre-colonial population density raises the costs to Europeans of obtaining and securing land for new settlers, and might also raise the benefits since the European often exploited and enslaved the indigenous population. Latitude raises the benefits of simply transferring European technologies (such as for agriculture) to the newly settled areas. A harsh disease environment facing Europeans raises the expected costs of settlement. To this list of common determinants of European settlement, we construct and examine an indicator of whether a large proportion of the indigenous population died from European-borne diseases during the colonization period. Indigenous mortality from European diseases is a tragic natural experiment that might help account for European settlement because it removed or weakened indigenous resistance to Europeans invading new lands, and made fertile land more readily available to settlers. The phenomenon is limited to lands that had essentially zero contact with Eurasia for thousands of years, since even a small amount of previous contact was enough to share diseases and develop some resistance to them. For example, trans-Sahara and trans-Indian Ocean contacts were enough to make Africa part of the Eurasian disease pool (McNeil 1976; Karlen 1995; Oldstone 1998). Historical studies and population figures show that only the New World (the Americas and Caribbean) and Oceania (including Australia and New Zealand) suffered large-scale indigenous mortality due to a lack of resistance to European diseases (McEvedy and Jones 1978). Thus, our measure of large-scale indigenous mortality from European-borne diseases is captured by a dummy variable for the New World and Oceania. Our examination of the historical determinants of colonial European settlement yields three findings. First, we find that colonial European settlement tends to be smaller (as a share of total population) in areas where there was a highly concentrated population of indigenous people and where there was not large-scale indigenous mortality during colonization. This finding provides the first direct empirical support for AJR’s (2002) hypothesis that in areas with a high concentration of indigenous people, Europeans did not settle in large numbers and instead established extractive regimes. This finding is a key building block in AJR’s (2002) theory of a “reversal of fortunes,” in which formerly successful areas, i.e., areas with a high concentration of indigenous people, became comparatively poorer due to the enduring effects of extractive political regimes. Second, Europeans tended to settle in large concentrations in lands further from the equator. Third, although biogeography—a measure of the degree to which an area is conducive to the domestication of animals and plants—explains human population density before the era of European colonization (Ashraf and Galor 2011), it does not account for colonial European settlement after accounting for indigenous population density. We next assess the two key predictions emerging from the political institutions and human capital views concerning colonial European settlement and current economic development and discover the following. First, colonial European settlement is strongly, positively associated with economic development today. This relationship holds after controlling for British legal heritage, the percentage of years the country has been independent since 1776, and the ethnic diversity of the current population. The strong, positive association between European settlement and economic development today is also robust to controlling for the mortality of the indigenous population during colonization, latitude, availability of precious metals, distance from London, ability to cultivate storable plants and domesticate animals, malaria ecology, and European mortality during colonization, as well as soil quality, access to navigable waterways, and continent dummy variables. However, the relationship between economic development today and the proportion of Europeans during colonization weakens markedly when controlling for either current educational attainment or government quality, which is consistent with the views that human capital and political institutions are intermediating mechanisms through which European settlement shaped current economic development. Second, the European share of the population during colonization is more strongly associated with economic development today than the percentage of the population today that is of European descent. Europeans during the colonization era seem to matter more for economic development today than Europeans today. This finding is consistent with the view that Europeans brought growth-promoting characteristics—such as institutions, human capital, technology, connections with international markets, and cultural norms—that had enduring effects on economic development. This result de-emphasizes the importance of Europeans per se and instead emphasizes the impact of what Europeans brought to economies during colonization. The estimated positive relation between colonial European settlement and current development is economically large. Based our parameter estimates, we compute for each country the projected level of income in 2000 if colonial European settlement had been zero. We then compare this counterfactual level of current income to actual current income and compute the share of current income attributable to colonial European settlement. The data and estimates indicate that 40 % of current development outside of Europe is associated with the share of Europeans during the colonial era. Though such projections must be treated cautiously, they suggest that the European origins of economic development deserve considerable attention. We check the robustness of the positive relation between colonial European settlement and current economic development in several ways. First, we were concerned that the relation between colonial European settlement and current development might breakdown when eliminating “neo-Europes,” such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States, or other countries that had a comparatively high proportion of Europeans during colonization. Thus, we redid the analyses while omitting countries with colonial European settlement greater than 12.5 %, which represents a natural break in the data that omits the neo-Europes, Argentina, and a few, small Latin American countries. Rather than the results breaking down when the sample is restricted to countries with a small proportion of Europeans during colonization, the estimates become larger. When examining only those former colonies with colonial European settlement less than 12.5 %, we find that the estimated positive relation between current income and colonial European settlement is more than double the estimate from examining the full sample of non-European economies. We were also concerned that the inclusion of many countries for which our data indicate zero colonial European settlement might affect the parameter estimates. Besides statistical robustness, the previous literature has not explicitly addressed whether colonial institutions with small European settlement during colonization are better or worse than those with no settlement. Even if small colonial European settlements created worse institutions than those created in areas with no Europeans during colonization, the positive things that Europeans brought with them, such as human capital or technology, could offset the negative development effects of worse institutions. Our data allow us to provide a first evaluation of these issues and to assess the few non-European countries that escaped colonization altogether. We address concerns about countries with “zero” Europeans during colonization in two ways. First, we omit all of these “zero” countries from the analyses and confirm the results. Second, we include a dummy variable for these “zero” countries and continue to find that colonial European settlement enters positively and significantly in the economic development regressions. We also find that the dummy variable for zero European settlement often enters with a positive coefficient, which provides some empirical support for the political institutions view that small European settlements that create extractive institutions are worse for current economic development than countries with essentially no European settlers during the colonial era. Combining the coefficient estimates on colonial European settlement and the dummy variable, the findings indicate that once colonial European settlement is above 4.8 %, any adverse effects from extractive institutions associated with small colonial European settlements were more than offset by other things that Europeans brought during colonization, such as human capital, technology, familiarity with global markets, and institutions, that had enduring, positive effects on economic development. Ample qualifications temper our conclusions. First, we do not assess the welfare implications of European colonization. Europeans often cruelly oppressed, enslaved, murdered, and even committed genocide against indigenous populations, as well as the people that they brought as slaves (see Acemoglu and Robinson 2012 for compelling examples). Thus, GDP per capita today does not measure the welfare effects of European colonization; it only provides a measure of economic activity today within a particular geographical area. Although there is no question about European oppression and cruelty, there are questions about the net effect of European colonization on economic development today. Second, we do not separately identify each potential channel through which the European share of the population during colonization shaped long-run economic development. Rather, we provide the first assessment of the relationship between colonial European settlement and comparative economic development and thereby inform debates about the sources of the divergent paths of economic development taken by countries around the world since the colonial period. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 defines and discusses the data, while Sect. 3 provides preliminary evidence on the determinants of human settlement prior to European colonization and the factors shaping European settlement. Section 4 presents the paper’s core results on the relationship between colonial European settlement and current economic development. Section 5 reports an exercise in development accounting to calculate what share of global development can be attributed to Europeans. Section 6 concludes.",1
21,3,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-016-9129-4,Military conflict and the rise of urban Europe,Mark Dincecco,Massimiliano Gaetano Onorato,,Male,Male,,Male,"The economic rise of Europe is a watershed historical event. Many scholars argue that cities played a central role in this rise (e.g., Smith 1776; Weber 1922; Pirenne 1925; Mumford 1961; Bairoch 1988; Hohenberg and Lees 1995; Glaeser 2011). One thousand years ago, the urbanization rate in Europe was less than 4 %. Even Rome was only 5–10 % of its size under the Roman Empire. By the start of the Industrial Revolution, however, Europe had become highly urbanized (van Bavel et al. 2013, pp. 392, 394). What explains Europe’s dramatic urban growth? This paper analyzes a main feature of European history: military conflict. According to Tilly (1992, p. 72), early modern Europe was at war in 78–95 % of all years. In this context, historical cities were “safe harbors” from conflict threats (Glaeser and Shapiro 2002). Historical cities held key defensive advantages over rural areas (e.g., fortifications). In the words of Adam Smith (1776, p. 250): “The inhabitants of cities and burghs, considered as single individuals, had no power to defend themselves; but by entering into a league of mutual defence with their neighbours, they were capable of making no contemptible resistance.” We argue that, to escape the destructive effects of warfare, rural inhabitants under the threat of conflict relocated to cities. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first city-level analysis of the relationship between military conflict and urban growth. To test this argument, we construct a novel database that spans the fall of Charlemagne’s empire to the start of the Industrial Revolution. We identify the geographic locations of all conflicts fought on land in Europe from 800 to 1799. In total, our data include more than 800 conflicts and nearly 700 cities. To measure city exposure to conflict threats, we geocode conflict and city locations at the local (grid cell) level. The results of our econometric analysis show a positive and significant relationship that runs from conflict exposure to city population growth. We find that conflict exposure was associated with a 6–11 % average increase in city populations per century. To put such magnitudes into perspective, average per-century city population growth between 800 and 1800 was 22 %. Our most conservative estimate thus suggests that conflict-related city population growth was responsible for roughly one-quarter of average per-century city population growth over this period. We show evidence that this relationship is robust. Our benchmark model accounts for time-invariant local characteristics and widespread shocks through fixed effects. To further address the possibility of omitted variable bias, we modify the benchmark model to include country-century interaction effects, which help account for the evolution of country-level features (e.g., nation-state building), and grid-cell specific time trends, which help account for unobservable time-varying local features (e.g., rural-urban wage differences). In addition, we interact century fixed effects with observable time-invariant local characteristics (e.g., Atlantic trade potential) that may influence city population trends. Finally, we control for city-level observable features including urban networks and political, educational, and religious characteristics. Larger cities may be more attractive targets for attackers. Country-century interaction effects and grid-cell specific trends help account for demographic trends at the national and local levels, respectively. To further address the possibility of reverse causation from urban size to conflict exposure, we control for pre-existing trends and mean reversion effects by interacting initial city populations with century fixed effects. In addition, we perform placebo tests and other tests for reverse causation. Such tests provide further evidence that the direction of causation runs from conflict exposure to city population growth and not vice versa. To complete our analysis of the safe harbor effect, we present evidence on conflict types and on city walls. Our paper contributes to the literature on the historical origins of state capacity. Warfare is a prominent explanation for nation-state formation in Europe (Tilly 1975, 1992; Mann 1986; Brewer 1989; Downing 1992; Besley and Persson 2009; Gennaioli and Voth 2014). Tilly’s (1975, p. 42) famous statement is: “War made the state, and the state made war.” According to the standard account, governments made institutional reforms that enabled them to finance military efforts and defend against survival threats. What this literature tends to overlook, however, is that institutional innovations at the city level were often historical precursors to state-level innovations (Stasavage 2011; Blaydes and Paik 2015). Our results show that before “war made the state,” war helped “make the city” by driving rural inhabitants under the threat of conflict to relocate behind urban fortifications. In this way, our results improve our understanding of the state formation process. In a related manner, our paper contributes to the literature on the historical origins of economic development. Scholars have linked historical warfare and state formation with modern prosperity (Bates 2010; O’Brien 2011; Rosenthal and Wong 2011; Dincecco and Prado 2012; Voigtländer and Voth 2013a, b). As described, our results show that warfare helps explain the historical transformation from countryside to city. Urban density facilitates economic activity by reducing the costs of exchange for goods, labor, and ideas (Glaeser 2011). Our results imply that warfare promoted historical development by driving rural inhabitants into cities where they could take advantage of agglomeration economies. In this regard, our paper offers a new way to understand the economic rise of urban Europe. The paper proceeds as follows. The next section develops our argument. Section 3 describes the database and measurement. Section 4 presents the econometric methodology and the main results. Sections 5 tests for robustness. Section 6 presents further evidence.

Within economics, an increasingly growing literature has established the role of variations in climatic and geographic conditions on a wide range of economic outcomes and their persistent effect on the vast inequality across the globe (e.g., Michalopoulos 2012; Nunn and Puga 2012; Ashraf and Michalopoulos 2013; Galor and Ozak 2016). This research advances the hypothesis that natural land productivity in the past, and its effect on the desirable level of cooperation in the agricultural sector, had a persistent effect on the evolution of social capital, the process of industrialization and comparative economic development across the globe. Places with favorable natural land productivity had a reduced incentive to cooperate in the development of agricultural infrastructure. While their favorable land endowment permitted their domination during the agricultural era, their lower incentive for cooperation resulted in a lower level of social capital which was crucial for the development of the industrial sector. Consequently, lacking some of the necessary elements for the emergence of industrialization, they were overtaken in the transition to the industrialization era. The fundamental hypothesis of this research originates from the realization that the evolution of the wealth of nations has been driven in part by the trade-off between land productivity and the associated level of cooperation and social capital, in different stages of development. The theory is based on an underlying mechanism consisting of five intermediate elements that account for the differential development of economies and their asymmetric transition from an epoch of Malthusian stagnation to a regime of sustained economic growth.Footnote 1 Each of the steps of the mechanism builds upon a comparison between high and low natural productivity places, while assuming everything else being constant. This allows to identify the partial effect of natural land productivity in the process of development. Crucially, the paper does not claim a reversal of fortune along the lines of Acemoglu et al. (2002) on colonized countries or Olsson and Paik (2013) on the Western reversal. The current analysis aims at identifying a reversal on the effect of land suitability on economic outcomes, where land suitability is one of the many forces that affected the fate of countries, without arguing that it is the dominating force. The first element of the mechanism suggests that whereas agricultural infrastructure can be beneficial to both productive and less productive places, yet less productive places had relatively more incentives to develop agricultural infrastructure, that could mitigate the adverse effect of the natural environment. Resources allocated to the development of agricultural infrastructure enhanced productivity indirectly, but came on the account of direct agricultural production. Hence, the opportunity cost of the construction of agricultural infrastructure was higher in more productive places and therefore investment in infrastructure was more beneficial in places with unfavorable land endowment. The second element establishes that the development of public agricultural infrastructure generated an incentive for cooperation. Since agricultural infrastructure is primarily a public good, collective action is essential for its optimal provision, in light of the incentive of individuals to minimize the allocation of their private resources to the production of public goods. Moreover, since collective action is conducive to cooperation, places with lower natural land productivity generated higher incentives for cooperation. Traditional forms of agricultural infrastructure include, among others, irrigation systems, storage facilities and drainage systems. Importantly, all major forms of agricultural infrastructure were associated with large-scale cooperation at the community or at the state level, and particularly in early societies, collective action and broad participation was required to undertake and construct the necessary infrastructure.Footnote 2
 The third element of the mechanism advances the hypothesis that the emergence of social capital can be traced to the level of cooperation in the agricultural sector, in the creation of infrastructure that could mitigate the adverse effect of the natural environment. Indeed, according to the social structural approach, differences in the manifestation of social capital are driven by the social interactions in which individuals are involved (Bowles and Gintis 2002). Similarly, the emergence and prevalence of norms that facilitate fruitful interaction (such as norms of mutual trust) can be traced to the need for large-scale cooperation (Henrich et al. 2001). Relatedly, Putnam (2000) suggests that social capital is primarily embedded in networks of reciprocal social relations. The fourth element of the mechanism suggests that social capital has persisted over time via different transmission mechanisms. Evolutionary theories, advance the social learning hypothesis, according to which norms and cultural traits that survive and are transmitted across generations are the ones that contribute to individual and group survival (Boyd and Richerson 1985, 1995; Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman 1981). The cultural transmission hypothesis suggests that preferences, beliefs and norms are intergenerationally transmitted via socialization processes such as social imitation and learning (Bisin and Verdier 2001). Political institutions are also argued to affect the transmission of social capital across generations (Tabellini 2008; Guiso et al. 2008). The fifth element of the mechanism suggests that social capital is complementary to both the agricultural and the industrial sector. This assumption is designed to capture the importance of social capital in promoting socioeconomic transitions to an industrialized regime. Evidence suggests, that economic activities such as commercial transactions, entrepreneurship, innovation, accumulation of human capital, credit markets and enforcement of contracts, all of which are building blocks of the industrial sector, are further enhanced in societies with high levels of social capital and trust. The proposed mechanism is aimed to identify the intermediate elements that can account for the emergence of social capital, the effect of natural land endowment on the evolution of economies, and their transition from agriculture to industry. To model this mechanism a Malthusian model is employed that models the transition. At early stages of development, the economy is in a Malthusian regime where output is generated entirely by an agricultural sector. Aggregate productivity in the agricultural sector, is partly determined by the natural land productivity, and can be further enhanced by agricultural infrastructure. A fraction of the labor employed in the agricultural sector is allocated to the production of the private good, whereas the remaining fraction to the production of agricultural infrastructure. Technological progress is a gradual process fuelled by knowledge creation, which is positively affected by the size of the workforce in agriculture. Resources generated by technological progress are channeled primarily towards an increase in population size, and the economy evolves towards a Malthusian equilibrium where income per capita remains stagnant along a dynamic path characterized by growing population and total factor productivity. The transition from agriculture to industry is driven by sustained growth in the latent productivity of the industrial sector. The indirect effect of cooperation on the industrial sector, through the accumulation of social capital, drives growth in the latent industrial productivity, which ultimately leads to the transition to industry. Once the industrial technology is adopted, the economy emerges into a Post-Malthusian regime of development, where the economy operates in both sectors. The endogenous growth of total factor productivity in the industrial sector, along with intersectoral labor mobility, generates a dynamic path characterized by endogenously growing population and income per capita. The interaction between natural land productivity, cooperation, social capital and the process of development is examined based on their coevolution in the agricultural stage of development and in the timing of the take-off from agriculture to industry. In the agricultural stage, an economy characterized by a relatively higher degree of cooperation in the development of agricultural infrastructure is associated with a relatively inferior Malthusian steady state in terms of the economy’s level of productivity per worker and the size of its working population. This inferiority, stems from the fact that the adverse effect of unfavorable land endowment is significant in the context of an economy that operates only in the agricultural sector, and therefore natural land endowments are crucial for agricultural output. The resulting level of cooperation in the agricultural sector, as triggered by natural land productivity, has also an effect on the timing of industrialization. The earlier take-off from the Malthusian steady state by a society with an unfavorable natural land endowment, stems from the fact that the beneficial effect of cooperation in the agricultural sector, as perceived by the effect of the emerging social capital on the advancement of knowledge, and therefore on the advancement of industrial productivity relative to that in agriculture, outweighs the adverse effect of unfavorable land endowment on agricultural production. The empirical section of this paper aims to establish the phenomenon of overtaking partly via the mechanism described above, as well as to establish that land suitability in the past is associated with more intense cooperation and higher levels of contemporary social capital. The analysis takes place in four layers exploiting exogenous sources of variations in land productivity across: (a) countries; (b) individuals within a country, (c) migrants of different ancestry within a country, and d) individuals residing in regions within a country. The cross-country analysis (a) allows to establish the overtaking and to further explore the suggested mechanisms associated with it. The individual (b), migrant (c) and regional (d) analysis allow to establish the reduced form effect of land suitability on the current levels of trust while capturing an increasing number of unobservables. Analytically, exploiting exogenous sources of variations in land suitability for agriculture across countries, the first part of the empirical analysis (a), establishes the following testable predictions of the theory: (i) the effect of natural land productivity on the economic prosperity was reversed in the process of development. While a favorable land endowment had a positive effect on development in the Malthusian era, its adverse effect on the production of agricultural infrastructure and thus cooperation, had a detrimental effect on economic prosperity in the modern era, (ii) cooperation, as reflected by agricultural infrastructure, emerged primarily in places where land was not highly productive and collective action could diminish the adverse effects of the environment and enhance agricultural output, and (iii) lower level of land suitability in the past is associated with higher levels of contemporary social capital which expedited the process of industrialization. Consistent with the predictions of the theory, the empirical analysis first establishes the change on the effect of land productivity in the process of economic development.Footnote 3 Following Ashraf and Galor (2011a), the research employs historical data on population density, as a proxy for productivity in the agricultural stage of development, as opposed to income per capita and examines the hypothesized effect of land suitability on population densities in the years 1 CE, 1000 CE and 1500 CE. Land suitability is proxied by an index of the average suitability of land for cultivation, based on geospatial data on various ecological factors including (i) growing degree days, (ii) the ratio of potential to actual evapotranspiration, (iii) soil carbon density, and (iv) soil pH.Footnote 4 The historical analysis reveals a positive and significant relationship between log land suitability and log population density in the year 1500 CE. To establish the change on the effect of natural land productivity, the analysis exploits cross country variations in land suitability, to explain the cross-country variations in log average income per capita in the years 1990–2000 CE. A number of potentially confounding factors and alternative hypothesis suggested by the related literature on comparative development are accounted for such as the geography channel, institutions, disease environment, ethnic fractionalization and religion shares. Importantly, as suggested by the theory, it is not the direct effect of land suitability that drives the change in its effect, but instead the portable component associated with land suitability, namely the social capital that emerged as the outcome of cooperation. In the absence of migration, the country’s level of social capital is captured by its natural land endowment. However, in the post-colonial era, where mass migration has taken place, the level of social capital in each country reflects the weighted average of land suitability among its ancestral population. Hence, in order to capture this distinction, two empirical strategies are adopted that address potential concerns on migration. Second, the empirical analysis establishes that higher suitability of land for agriculture is associated with a lower level of cooperation in the agricultural sector, as reflected by the potential for irrigation and the actual fraction of irrigated land. The measure of irrigation potential captures the potential productivity boost due to irrigation. Consistently with the predictions of the theory, the empirical analysis reveals a statistically significant and robust negative effect of the log land suitability on the potential for irrigation and on the fraction of irrigated land in the year 1900. The adverse effect of natural land productivity on cooperation in earlier periods is further examined based on several proxies of cooperation: (a) communication in the year 1 CE, (b) transportation in the year 1 CE, and (c) medium of exchange in the year 1 CE. According to the theory, sophisticated means of communication, transportation and medium of exchange have been catalysts in the advancement of large-scale cooperation, and thus, under-development of these technologies reflects the adverse effect of land suitability on the extent of cooperation. Third, having established the intermediate elements of the mechanism linking land suitability of agriculture with the current levels of trust, the analysis establishes the adverse effect of natural land productivity on social capital as reflected by the contemporary level of generalized trust. Similarly to first hypothesis, the measure of land suitability is ancestry adjusted to capture the portable component of natural land endowment, namely social capital. The second part of the empirical analysis reexamines the hypothesis using a sample of individual data from the four waves of the WVS (1981–2002). The analysis explores the effect of ancestry adjusted natural land productivity on the current levels of individual trust, accounting for geographical and institutional characteristics. Importantly, in contrast to the cross country analysis, this disaggregated individual data allows to account for individual controls, such as education, religious denomination, age and gender. In line with the results of the cross country analysis, a 10 % point increase in land suitability, is associated with a 2 % points decrease in probability that an individual is trustful. The third part of the empirical analysis examines the hypothesis using the European Social Survey (ESS) sample, and in particular the sample of first and second generation migrants residing in ESS countries. This approach allows to explicitly identify the portable cultural component associated with their country of origin. In line with the hypothesis advanced in the paper, this section establishes that a ten percentage point increase in land suitability at the country of origin, is associated with a 4 percentage points decrease in the probability that a migrant is trustful. The last part of the analysis again employs the ESS sample, of natives residing in NUTS 1 regions within a country. This approach allows to controls for country fixed effects and thus an even larger number of unobservables. The findings of this section suggest that even when exploiting sub-national variations in land suitability for agriculture, it confers a negative effect on individual trust today even after controlling for country, regional and individual characteristics. The analysis is concluded by extensive robustness checks for each of the empirical approaches of the paper. These checks explore not only alternative specifications but also a number of competing hypotheses. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the related literature. Section 3 presents a model that derives the testable hypotheses. Section 4 presents all four layers of empirical findings consistent with the proposed hypotheses. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes.",1
21,4,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-016-9132-9,The economic consequences of the Spanish Reconquest: the long-term effects of Medieval conquest and colonization,Daniel Oto-Peralías,Diego Romero-Ávila,,Male,Male,,Male,"This paper shows that the legacy of history is particularly pervasive in Spain. We provide evidence to show that a historical process that ended more than five centuries ago, the Reconquest, is very important to explain Spanish regional economic development. The so-called Reconquista is a milestone in Spanish history. For a period of almost eight hundred years that started in 711 with the invasion of the Iberian Peninsula by the Muslims, what is now mainland Spain experienced a process fairly akin to colonialism. Throughout this long period, and after an initial phase of mere resistance, the Christians located in the North gradually reconquered the Muslim lands and implemented measures to colonize the reclaimed territory. We argue that the rate or speed of the Reconquest, that is, whether the Christian frontier advanced rapidly or not, was a crucial factor affecting the type of colonization conducted in each territory and its corresponding initial political equilibrium. A fast rate of Reconquest is associated with imperfect colonization, characterized by an oligarchic political equilibrium, thus creating the conditions for an inegalitarian society with negative consequences for long-term economic development. This paper is framed within a new stream of literature dealing with the long-term effects of frontier expansions. In a recent contribution, García-Jimeno and Robinson (2011) have proposed the “conditional frontier hypothesis” to explain the starkly contrasting outcomes derived from the frontier experiences in North America (Turner 1920) and Latin America (Hennessy 1978). According to this hypothesis, the consequences of the frontier depend on the initial political equilibrium existing in society at the time of the territorial expansion. In North America, where the prevailing social climate was relatively democratic and egalitarian, the frontier brought about individualism, self-government and aversion to social stratification, whereas in the more oligarchic societies of South America, the presence of a frontier reinforced economic and political inequality. Focusing on the historical border between Castile and the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada in southern Spain, Oto-Peralías and Romero-Ávila (2016) suggest that military insecurity is a factor that favors a political equilibrium biased toward the military elite in frontier regions, generating highly persistent differences in inequality. This article introduces and tests the hypothesis that the political equilibrium among the colonizing agents may be endogenous to the scale of frontier expansion. This is because large territorial expansion allows the elite to play a dominant role in the process of colonizing the conquered lands. Applied to our case study, this became evident after the collapse of the Almohad Caliphate in 1212 following the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa, which enabled the Christian armies to conquer vast swathes of territory in a short period of time. The outcome involved large frontier regions dominated by military orders and the nobility, with negative consequences for long-term development. In contrast, a slow frontier expansion was associated with a more balanced occupation of the territory and a more egalitarian social structure. This was so because smaller frontier regions favored the participation of individual settlers and the Crown in the repopulation, which would lead to better political institutions and a more equitable distribution of the land—as happened in the colonization of the Duero Valley, where settlers occupied land and obtained its ownership. As argued below, these initial differences in the patterns of distribution of economic and political power persisted over time, and led to divergent development paths across what are now the Spanish provinces. In the empirical part of the paper, we create an indicator measuring the “rate of Reconquest”, which captures whether the Christian military conquests progressed rapidly or slowly when each province was reclaimed. We show that there is a robustly negative relationship between the rate of Reconquest and current per capita income across today’s Spanish provinces. This relationship does not simply reflect the fact that regions in the South are poorer, since the results survive the inclusion of latitude and many other geographic, topographic and climatic controls. The effect remains statistically significant when the regression analysis is extended to the level of municipality, even after controlling for province fixed effects. The results are not driven by a selection problem informed by the possibility that –for instance– the Christian kingdoms chose to conquer faster economically less attractive territories. A number of falsification tests show that there is no link between the rate of Reconquest and several indicators of pre-Reconquest economic development. We also analyze the channels through which the rate of Reconquest has affected current income. The results suggest that structural inequality, caused by a high concentration of land and political power in the hands of the nobility, played a central role as intervening variable. This is consistent with the hypothesis formulated by Engerman and Sokoloff (2000, (2002) and Acemoglu et al. (2002), whereby a high concentration of economic and political power in a few hands has impaired modern economic growth because it precludes large segments of the population from participating in economic activity when the opportunity to industrialize arrived. The timing of the effect of the Reconquest is consistent with this hypothesis, since its negative effect became most apparent during the industrialization period. This interpretation is also congruent with the fact that at the onset of industrialization in Spain (around 1860) the negative impact of the rate of Reconquest was also present in some of the foundations of modern economic growth, such as human capital. A general conclusion of our analysis is that accelerated (and imperfect) colonization may create the conditions for an inegalitarian society, with negative consequences for long-term economic development. Several other papers are to some extent related to ours. Chaney (2008) and Chaney and Hornbeck (2015) investigate the expulsion of about 120,000 Moriscos in 1609 from the Kingdom of Valencia. Chaney (2008) finds that persistent extractive institutional arrangements in former Morisco areas inhibited the development of the non-agricultural sector long after the adverse population shock. Chaney and Hornbeck (2015) provide evidence of Malthusian dynamics in early modern Spain by documenting persistent rises in output per capita as a result of the population decline caused by the expulsion. Tur-Prats (2015) finds that a historically-determined persistent geographical distribution of traditional family types (stem vs. nuclear) affects intimate-partner violence (IPV). Based on a historical account, she uses the stages of the Reconquest and a freedom of testation indicator as instruments for the different family types. Droller (2013) investigates the effect of migration and population composition on long-run economic development in the settlement of the Argentina’s frontier regions known as the Pampas. The channels through which historically higher shares of European population affects current output are associated with industrialization and the level of human capital measured through literacy rates. This paper also contributes in several ways to a growing body of research that considers economic development as a long-term process with deep historical roots (Spolaore and Wacziarg 2013; Nunn 2014).Footnote 1 First, our case study is appealing in the sense that the historical process studied in this article is very remote in time. The Reconquest ended in 1492 with the fall of Granada yet, significantly, its effects remain visible today. Explaining the reasons for the effect of the Reconquest being so persistent, along with the channels through which it took place, are questions of general interest. Second, our work is also interesting because unlike most previous studies focusing on former colonies, it analyzes the experience of a developed economy that became a leading colonial power in the Mercantilist era of colonialism. Third, a particularity of the Spanish case is that over a long period of time its territory experienced a process very similar to colonialism. Thus, an analysis of the Spanish Reconquest is useful because it gives clues about the subsequent colonization of the New World. When Spain colonized Central and South America in the sixteenth century, it had all the experience gathered in the Reconquest and through the policies implemented in the occupation of Muslim lands. Therefore, while the recent literature has emphasized that Spanish colonial policies were significantly influenced by the preexisting indigenous organization in conquered areas (Engerman and Sokoloff 2002; Frankema 2010), it should not be ignored that the granting of large tracts of land to the nobility, for example, had a clear precedent in the homeland.Footnote 2
 The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief historical overview. Section 3 describes the indicator for the rate of Reconquest and the other variables used in the paper. Section 4 presents the analysis of the effect the Reconquest has had on current economic development, while Sect. 5 provides several sensitivity exercises that include a municipality-level analysis. Section 6 analyzes the timing of the effect of the Reconquest, and Sect. 7 investigates the possible channels through which this effect occurs. Finally, Sect. 8 puts forward some implications, and concludes.",1
22,1,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-016-9137-4,The effect of aid on growth: evidence from a Quasi-experiment,Sebastian Galiani,Stephen Knack,Ben Zou,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Whether foreign aid causes economic growth in recipient countries is a highly debated research question. Identification of the causal effect of aid on growth has been elusive so far due to the endogeneity of aid in growth models. An instrumental variable is needed to address these problems. However, as Clemens et al. (2012) conclude in their recent assessment: “the aid-growth literature does not currently possess a strong and patently valid instrumental variable with which to reliably test the hypothesis that aid strictly causes growth.” In this paper we contribute to this literature by instrumenting, in an economic growth equation, the endogenous aid variable exploiting a plausible quasi-experiment created by the income threshold set by IDA (International Development Association), the World Bank’s program of grants and concessionary loans to low-income countries. We exploit this new instrument to investigate the causal effect of aid on growth. This income threshold has been used as a key criterion in allocating scarce IDA resources since 1987, and is adjusted annually only to take into account inflation. Other major donors also appear to use the IDA threshold as an informative signal about where development aid is most needed, and we show that total aid declines significantly once a recipient country crosses the IDA income threshold from below. The IDA threshold is nevertheless an arbitrary income level that does not necessarily represent any structural change in economic growth. Threshold crossing is thus a plausibly valid instrumental variable for aid over time for a recipient country in a panel data model that controls for initial income levels and also includes country and period effects (we group years into 8 three-year periods). The main concern with successfully identifying an internally consistent estimate is that some countries might cross the threshold by experiencing a series of large positive shocks that are eventually reversed, making the exclusion restriction invalid. We argue that this concern is largely misplaced. On average, our sample of countries grew faster after crossing the IDA threshold than before, consistent with the fact that developing countries in general exhibited better performance in the latter part of our 1987-2010 sample period. Moreover, our empirical growth model accounts for the differential timing at which countries cross the IDA threshold. In our analysis we exploit only the data for the countries that cross the threshold from below during the period studied while our growth model allows countries to grow at different rates over time (by allowing for country-specific effects on growth and by allowing conditional convergence). Additionally, countries start at the beginning of the sample period from different levels below the threshold. Hence, the differential timing at which countries cross the IDA threshold from below exploited for identification in our study does not have to be driven by unobservable shocks.Footnote 1 We further investigate this threat to our identification strategy by implementing a battery of tests and robustness checks. In particular, we fail to reject the null hypothesis of no serial autocorrelation in the error term of the model implied by the threat to the validity of our instrument posed above. We also show that results are robust to controlling for one and two period lags of growth, which would not be the case if the country receives a transitory positive shock around the time of crossing which is eventually reversed. Importantly, we use an alternative instrumental variable based on a smoothed income trajectory which is unaffected by country specific idiosyncratic shocks and obtain similar results. All in all, these and other robustness checks do not point toward rejecting our identification strategy. Using a sample of 35 countries that crossed the IDA threshold from below between 1987 and 2010, we find that a 1 % increase in the aid to GNI ratio raises the annual real per capita short term GDP growth rate by 0.031 percentage points. The mean aid to GNI ratio at the crossing is 0.09, so a 1 percentage point increase in the aid to GNI ratio raises annual real per capita GDP growth by approximately 0.35 percentage points. This effect is about 1.75 times as large as those reported by Clemens et al. (2012). Using OLS with fixed effects and lagging aid by a period, they find that a one percentage point increase in aid/GDP (at aid levels similar to our sample mean) is followed by at most a 0.2 percentage-point increase in growth of real GDP per capita. We find similar-sized effects in our sample, without instrumenting for aid but merely lagging it by a period and including fixed effects. We also present evidence consistent with the possibility that OLS estimates suffer from attenuation bias due to measurement error in aid, which is exacerbated when the variability in the aid to GNI ratios is exploited to identify the effect of aid on growth in a fixed effects or first-differenced growth equation commonly used in the literature. Thus, one should expect that a valid 2SLS produces larger estimates than OLS. Naturally, this could also be the case if growth affects aid levels. The sizable effect of aid on growth we find may be attributable in part to the fact that our sample consists of low-income countries that successfully crossed the IDA threshold at some point between 1987 and 2010. Aid may have been more effective in these countries–e.g. due to better economic policies and lower corruption—than in countries remaining below the threshold. Relative to middle-income countries, countries in our sample likely face more stringent financial constraints, which again should make aid effects stronger. Furthermore, it is possible that reductions in aid after crossing the IDA threshold may have a larger negative effect on growth than any positive effects from aid increases, due to adjustment costs. We provide suggestive evidence, however, that our results might have meaningful external validity to the remaining poor countries as they grow closer to the IDA threshold. A back-of-the-envelope calculation based on a simple growth model and the coefficient on aid in investment regressions suggests that investment could be an important channel through which aid affects growth. We show that the investment rate drops following the reduction in aid. Increasing the aid to GNI ratio by 1 percentage point increases the investment to GDP ratio by 0.54 percentage points, although this coefficient is generally not significant. The magnitude of the effects on growth and investment is consistent with the average capital stock to GDP ratio for the sample countries, which we estimate to be approximately two. As in most of the literature relying on panel data covering a short period of time, we estimate the short-run effect of aid on growth, an effect that mainly operates through physical investment. In the long run, aid could affect growth through several other channels, but its identification requires exogenous changes in aid over a very long period of time. Our instrument does not provide such exogenous variability to estimate that parameter.Footnote 2
 The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews past studies testing the causal effect of aid on growth. Section 3 describes the data and the sample. Section 4 presents the effect of IDA threshold-crossing on the volume of aid received. Section 5 presents the empirical model and the baseline results. Section 6 explores some mechanisms and Sect. 7 discusses the external validity of our results. Section 8 concludes.",1
22,1,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-016-9138-3,Human capital and the quantity–quality trade-off during the demographic transition,Alan Fernihough,,,Male,,,Male,"Unified growth theory argues that the child quantity–quality (QQ) trade-off was a key mechanism in the transition from stagnation to modern economic growth (Galor 2011). Before the nineteenth century, economic growth was slow and fertility rates were persistently high. By the mid-twentieth century this situation had reversed in the Western world. The corresponding increase in educational attainment observed during this period presents a narrative which is clearly consistent with various QQ theories. However, the findings in existing studies, which use post-demographic transition population samples, have been frustratingly inconclusive (see Black et al. 2005; Cáceres-Delpiano 2006; Angrist et al. 2010). Moreover, few microeconometric studies have tested the validity of this theory during this vital period. The primary difference between this study and existing studies is that we use a large sample of individual level data from a historical population experiencing a demographic transition: 1911 Ireland. Ireland’s relatively late fertility transition, alongside the availability of the completed individual census returns for the entire population, make it a viable testing ground for the importance of the QQ effect during the demographic transition. Using the simple theoretical framework as in Galor (2011), we demonstrate how the child QQ model works, and assess the implications of this model for empirical research. This exercise demonstrates how the child QQ trade-off arises because parents substitute between fertility and child investments in response to relative price, income, and technological changes. It also implies that this substitution happens endogenously, with potential sources of endogeneity stemming from simultaneity, omitted variable bias, and measurement error. Existing research has employed conventional instrumental variable (IV) estimators in an attempt to solve the endogeneity issue. However, IV estimators chiefly rely on valid exclusion restrictions, which given the highly endogenous nature of the child QQ model are extremely difficult to find in practice. Given the lack of a credible exclusion restriction, this study takes an alternative approach. Instead of using an exclusion restriction dependent IV approach, we adopt the methodology suggested in Millimet and Tchernis (2013), and estimate the QQ model using a number of estimators that either avoid or minimize endogeneity bias but do not require the researcher to make any unverifiable exclusion restriction assumptions. Much like cointegration, vector autoregression, or system/difference GMM, these estimators use alternative modeling assumptions but using cross-section data. These alternative modeling assumptions include substituting bias for variance in a manner similar to the conventional IV regression methodology and identifying information generated from heteroskedasticity in a first-stage modeling equation. Section 4 introduces these estimators in greater detail. It is widely accepted that Ireland was something of an outlier in the European demographic transition (Ó Gráda 1991). Indeed, a casual look at early twentieth century Ireland suggests that the island’s society was behaving in a way that contradicted the child QQ model. At this time the country had a relatively well-developed national education system, one that was founded in 1831, 39 years ahead of Britain. Illiteracy was rare amongst adults (see Table 1). However, the modernity suggested by Ireland’s education system was untranslated to Irish demographic behavior. A simple comparison of Ó Gráda (1991) and Wilson and Woods (1991) suggests that marital fertility levels were over 1.6 times larger in 1911 Ireland relative to England in the same period. Nevertheless, Ó Gráda (1991) also showed how macro-level, aggregated statistics hid substantial heterogeneity in fertility behavior across Irish regions. When one takes a closer look at these data, it appears that fertility in the urban centers of Dublin and Belfast bore closer resemblance to the lower fertility patterns observed in more developed regions in Western Europe. The demographic heterogeneity exhibited in Irish regions underlines an important point—aggregated data can obscure important individual-level relationships in any analysis. Our analysis shows how the resolution unit can be vital in QQ-type analyses. If we look at aggregated county-level we find that counties with the lowest fertility also have the lowest school attendance. However, when we analyze more refined, higher resolution, data points, and focus on smaller geographic units inside these aforementioned counties, we find a negative conditional correlation connecting fertility to education—as suggested by the child QQ model. This finding underlines the potential for researchers to commit ecological fallacy when extrapolating results obtained via macro-level data to infer micro-level behavior and motivates the use of high-quality individual-level data in this paper. This paper asks the following empirical question: do those attending school between the ages of 14 and 16 have fewer siblings, as predicted by the child QQ model? Schooling was effectively compulsory until the age of 14. If the QQ theory holds we expect that those who remain in school for longer to be from smaller families. OLS regressions on our large sample of individual-level data indicate that being in school reduces family level fertility by around 1 %. Interestingly, this effect intensifies as control variables accounting for potentially omitted variables, such as income and socioeconomic status, are included in the model specification. This suggests that any endogeneity bias may be biasing this coefficient towards zero. To alleviate endogeneity concerns, we estimate a number of models proposed in Millimet and Tchernis (2013). The obvious criticism with these models is that whilst they avoid exclusion restrictions based assumptions, they require researchers to make alternative modeling assumptions. These alternative modeling assumptions either require the practitioner to correctly specify the regression equation or to use the identifying power generated by heteroskedasticity in a regression model of the endogenous treatment on the regressors. With these criticisms in mind, we probe the potential weakness of our empirical approach by conducting an Empirical Monte Carlo analysis as in Huber et al. (2013). This approach simulates “placebo treatments” using real data and thus assesses the performance of the exclusion restriction-free estimators given the causal effect is known. Assuming the presence of endogeneity, this analysis shows that the parametric version of the IV estimator proposed by Klein and Vella (2009) performs best in this application. This analysis also reveals a positive bias in the alternative exclusion-restriction free estimators proposed in Millimet and Tchernis (2013). Thus, we expect the results obtained from these estimators to underestimate (in absolute value) of the child QQ effect in our main empirical analysis. Our Empirical Monte Carlo results help to contextualize our main results. Compared to the OLS regression results, the endogeneity bias-corrected models indicate a substantially larger QQ effect. The IV estimator based on Klein and Vella (2009), implies that a child staying in school between the ages of 14 and 16 reduces fertility substantially—by around 27 %. As predicted in the Empirical Monte Carlo results, the alternative estimators predict a smaller QQ effect. However, this effect, of around 10 %, is still significant. These results demonstrate the presence of a positive endogeneity bias. Our results are robust to different definitions of fertility (i.e. surviving of births), and potential issues of sample selection caused by maternal mortality. Our findings illustrate the importance of human capital as a factor that underpinned demographic change in historical societies. These results appeal to the wider literature on long-run economic growth and technological progress (Galor and Weil 2000; Galor and Moav 2002). Until recently, few research papers (notable exceptions include Becker et al. (2010) and Klemp and Weisdorf (2016)) have investigated this empirical link. The implication of our findings for the history of economic development is that the fertility transition was accelerated by parental investments in children, and therefore human capital, in Western economies in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.",1
22,1,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-016-9136-5,Revisiting the world technology frontier: a directional distance function approach,Jens J. Krüger,,,Male,,,Male,"Technological progress is only neutral by accident in the sense of shifting the entire world technology frontier to the same extent in the same direction. Instead, technological progress is more likely to augment certain production factors more than others. So, technological progress may augment capital relatively more, or labor relatively more. With respect to labor it may benefit unskilled labor more than skilled labor or the other way round. Thus, technological progress is biased with respect to certain production factors and in that sense has a certain direction. Related to that, technological progress is likely to be local in the sense of Atkinson and Stiglitz (1969), meaning that parts of the frontier function may shift differentially. The concept of non-neutrality later infiltrated other fields such as labor economics (Acemoglu 2002a), international trade and growth theory (Acemoglu 2002b; Acemoglu and Zilibotti 2001). Further literature includes Acemoglu (1998), Basu and Weil (1998) and Jones (2005). Acemoglu (2015) provides a recent review. 
Caselli and Coleman (2006) pick up these issues in an empirical study and provide an analysis of the skill-bias in the world technology frontier.Footnote 1 They propose to calibrate the parameters of a production function with a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) and solve the equilibrium conditions for the technology parameters of the skilled and unskilled labor inputs. With this approach, they find that relatively rich countries with a larger endowment of skilled labor are more efficiently using this type of labor input, whereas relatively poor countries are using unskilled labor more efficiently. In the words of Caselli and Coleman (2006, p. 499): “Higher-income countries use skilled labor more efficiently than lower-income countries, while they use unskilled labor relatively and, possibly, absolutely less efficiently.” Thus, there is skill-bias in cross-country technology differences. In this paper we revisit the research question posed by Caselli and Coleman with nonparametric methods of efficiency measurement which can be used to determine the direction of the largest distance relative to the frontier function. The central advantages of the nonparametric approach are that no functional form assumptions for the production function such as a CES function (which is not particularly flexible) are required, that there is no necessity to calibrate parameters and that no assumptions about optimizing behavior, existence of equilibria and market efficiency are needed.Footnote 2 This approach can be used to disentangle the two principal sources of error, model misspecification and inappropriate data, and a mismatch between the data and the theoretical concepts. The results obtained with this approach show that the findings of Caselli and Coleman are quite robust to the nonparametric measurement approach. This ensures that neither the adopted CES production function, nor the specific values used for the calibration of the parameters are driving the findings. The results become somewhat weakened when data from more recent vintages of the Penn World Table and the Barro-Lee data set are used. Particularly important is the choice of the educational threshold for the determination of skilled and unskilled labor. The results are quite sensitive with respect to this split point as the discussion below will show. The approach used in this paper also makes a methodological contribution to the literature on the optimal choice of direction vectors for directional distance functions (see Färe et al. 2013 or Hampf and Krüger 2015). Especially the dynamic approach discussed later is novel to the literature. For testing the main hypothesis, robust statistical methods are used. Temple (1998, (2000) gives a detailed discussion of the relevance of robust regression methods in empirical growth research. In the present paper we apply a more recent vintage of robust regression methods with improved robustness and efficiency properties. The plan of the paper is first to introduce the original approach of Caselli and Coleman in Sect. 2, to explain the concept of directional distance functions and their nonparametric computation in Sect. 3 and to conduct the analysis with the original data of Caselli and Coleman in Sect. 4. Hereafter we assess the robustness of the central findings along several lines in Sects. 5, 6 and 7, including different definitions of skilled and unskilled labor, more recent data vintages and a dynamic approach to direction choice. Finally, Sect. 8 concludes.",1
22,1,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-016-9135-6,Finance and sources of growth: evidence from the U.S. states,Michał Jerzmanowski,,,Male,,,Male,"A large theoretical and empirical literature highlights the fact that financial development affects the rate of long-run economic growth. As reviewed by Levine (1997, 2005), theoretical models identify multiple channels through which better financial markets boost economic growth: they improve allocation of capital, mobilize savings, allow greater diversification of investment risk, help in overcoming indivisibilities of large capital projects, enhance monitoring and management discipline, and foster entry, innovation, and competition. Empirical evidence generally supports the view that better financial development leads to growth, with more evidence pointing to its role in enhancing the efficiency of resource allocation and less to its impact on increasing the rate of factor input growth (Levine and Zervos 1998). There are, however, important gaps in our understanding of the finance-growth nexus. First, there are weaknesses in the identification strategies used in most cross-country studies. Second, the profession has not fully resolved which are the most important channels through which finance influences economic growth. Although researchers have attempted to address each of these shortcomings (e.g. Beck et al. 2000; Jayaratne and Strahan 1996; Levine et al. 2000), doubts remain about how—and thus if—finance influences economic growth. In this paper we exploit a new data set that allows us to more precisely identify the impact of exogenous changes in financial development on economic growth and its sources: accumulation of physical and human capital, and total factor productivity (TFP) growth. We combine a newly constructed data on state-level output, inputs, and TFP with data on bank deregulation across the US states from the mid-1970s through the mid-1990s, which serves as plausibly exogenous source of improvements in the financial systems of each of the states. Unlike the previous literature on the impact of state bank deregulation on economic growth and welfare (Jayaratne and Strahan 1996; Beck et al. 2010), we separately identify the effects of deregulation on the accumulation of physical capital, the accumulation of human capital, and TFP growth. Thus, we shed additional empirical light on the channels through which finance influence economic growth. There exist previous cross-country studies that attempted to address this question but they relied on questionable identification strategies. Our main contribution therefore lies in bringing the clean identification of baking deregulation studies to the question of the channels through which finance affects growth. In addition, our data set breaks down the aggregate state measures of output and inputs into three sectors: manufacturing, agriculture, and the remaining industries. This allows us to separate out the effects of banking deregulation on each sector making an additional contribution to banking deregulation studies. There are four key findings. First, we confirm the positive effect of state banking deregulation on the growth of output per worker found previously in the literature. Our new contribution is establishing that this effect is robust to adding an expanded set of controls, such as the initial level of GDP and state-specific time trends, as well as including state fixed effects and using a system GMM panel data estimator instead of OLS. Second, we show that deregulation boosts growth by accelerating both TFP growth and accumulation of physical capital without having any impact on the rate of growth of human capital. This is largely consistent with findings from cross-country studies, but the effect on capital accumulation is more robust than what previous studies indicated (Beck et al. 2000). Third, we find that the effect of deregulation is not dependent on states’ initial levels of development: both rich and poor states grow faster after deregulation, and the absolute increase in growth rates is similar. Thus, unlike in cross-country studies (Aghion et al. 2005; Rioja and Valev 2004), we do not find any evidence of financial development interacting with convergence forces to foster catch-up growth. Finally, when we use disaggregated data to compare the effect of deregulation on growth and its components across sectors, we find that deregulation accelerates growth of output per worker in manufacturing and to a lesser degree in remaining industries, while the effect on agriculture cannot be estimated precisely. We also find that the main reason deregulation boosts manufacturing growth is that it accelerates TFP growth in that sector, which is consistent with hypotheses emphasizing the role of financial development in facilitating entry and innovation. We use the sectoral findings to answers an important critique of the banking deregulation studies, which asserts that observed growth effects could be coming from the growth of financial industry itself and not from the beneficial effect of finance on output of other industries, as economic theory predicts. Since banking is not part of the manufacturing sector, this critique cannot account for our findings. In the next section we briefly review the literature on finance and growth, with special attention to the state banking deregulation studies and the cross-country research analyzing the sources of growth. Section 3 discusses our data and lays out the empirical approach. In Sect. 4 we report the results for state aggregates and sector-level data. The final section summarizes and discusses the findings, and offers some suggestions for future research.",1

22,2,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-016-9139-2,Growth discontinuities at borders,Maxim L. Pinkovskiy,,,Male,,,Male,"It is well known that rates of economic growth vary widely between countries. However, it is less well understood how growth varies within and across countries over space. Does economic growth rise gradually as one travels through a poorer country towards a richer one, or does it change abruptly at the border? Figure 1 shows the growth in satellite-recorded nighttime lights, an intuitive indicator of economic growth, over Ukraine and its neighbors between 1992 and 2000. Areas that gained light during this time period are represented in white, whereas areas that lost light are represented in black (gray areas were unlit in both years). It is obvious that the ex-Soviet republics in this picture—Ukraine and its southern neighbor Moldova—mostly lost nighttime lights, while the Eastern European countries outside the Soviet Union—Poland, Romania and Hungary—mostly gained nighttime lights. This is consistent with the fact that during the transition from communism in the 1990s, Ukraine and Moldova contracted much more severely than did Poland, Romania and Hungary, which had exceeded their 1992 GDP by 2000. What is striking about the picture is that growth in nighttime lights appears to be discontinuous at the borders between the ex-Soviet states and their neighbors. Not only are there very few white dots in Ukraine and Moldova, and very few black dots in the Eastern European countries, but the black dots in Ukraine extend all the way to its borders with the Eastern European countries, and are immediately replaced by white dots as soon as the border is crossed. Particularly striking is that many of these national borders are relatively new. The westernmost tip of Ukraine (Ruthenia) had been part of Ukraine for only 46 years before the transition to market institutions, and had been in a political union with Hungary, Slovakia and Romania for much of the past five hundred yearsFootnote 1, and yet, it experienced a decline in lights as did the rest of Ukraine, while the neighboring parts of Hungary, Slovakia and Romania experienced growth in lights. Moreover, Moldova and Romania share the same language, religion and culture (although they have been politically separate for most of their modern history), but have had radically different lights growth experiences in the 1990s with Romania’s lights increasing, Moldova’s lights declining, and the growth experience changing discontinuously at the border. 
White areas denote lights increase and black areas denote light decrease This paper presents evidence that Fig. 1 is not an anomaly, but part of a general pattern of discontinuities in the rates of economic growth around national borders. The key methodological tool that enables me to establish the presence of growth discontinuities at borders is measuring economic growth in narrow bands around national borders by computing growth rates of satellite-recorded nighttime lights in these regions. Night lights are an ideal and indispensable data source for this project because they are one of the few indicators of economic activity that exist at a sufficiently fine resolution to allow the analysis of narrow neighborhoods around national borders, as well as because the method of their collection is continuous across national borders. National accounts data is fundamentally unsuitable for such a project because it is available, at best, only at a regional level, and does not permit considering regions other than large political subdivisions, thus making it inappropriate for a regression discontinuity analysis. Survey data may overcome this problem as it samples individuals or villages rather than geographical units, but it would introduce an artificial discontinuity at borders because each survey is conducted within a single country. Hence, errors attributable to the questionnaire or to the performance of different survey teams would be different on different sides of national borders. On the other hand, even if there is important spatial heterogeneity in the way that satellites record lights data, the remote sensing process should be continuous, and therefore, roughly stable within a neighborhood around a given border.Footnote 2
 Using satellite data on nighttime lights as a proxy for economic activity around borders, I document a strong and statistically significant relationship between differentials in growth of lights per capita across a border and differences in growth in the bordering countries over 5- and 18-year periods between 1992 and 2010. As one moves from a slower-growing to a faster-growing country, the 5-year growth rate of lights per capita rises on average by 1.48 percentage points (or by 0.13 standard deviations) and the 18-year growth rate of lights per capita rises on average by 1.28 percentage points (or 0.19 standard deviations). For every 1 percentage point difference in the 5-year growth rates of GDP per capita of two bordering countries, there is a 0.38 percentage point difference in the growth rate of lights per capita of these countries at their mutual border, and for 18-year growth rates, there is a 0.45 percentage point difference. Therefore, there is a sizeable elasticity (between a third and a half, though less than unity) of growth differentials at borders to growth differentials nationwide. Moreover, these differentials are not driven by borders in any particular region, suggesting that they are not results of composition bias, but rather an enduring feature of the data to be explained. After establishing the existence of border discontinuities in economic growth around the world, I examine the factors that might explain these discontinuities. One immediate explanation for why we observe border discontinuities might be that borders are drawn endogenously, with terrain and climatic conditions that are more favorable for growth being predominantly located on the sides of borders that belong to faster-growing countries. Borders could also be drawn endogenously if they are drawn around populations with particularly high or low growth rates, such as when a high-growing region secedes from a country. In this case, the discontinuity in growth rates causes the border, rather than the other way around. I find weak evidence that discontinuities in economic growth tend to be stronger at borders with above-median rather than below-median differences in key geographic covariates, but the order of magnitude of border discontinuities is similar for borders whose sides are geographically similar as well as geographically different. Moreover, there is no systematic tendency for certain kinds of geographies to coincide with faster- rather than slower-growing sides of borders. While it is difficult to test whether borders may have endogenously been drawn to separate groups of different productivies and propensities for growth because growth data at borders is not available historically, I show that estimated growth discontinuities at borders are of similar magnitude for old and recent borders, curved and straight borders, borders over rugged or flat terrain and borders near or far away from capital cities, which indirectly suggests that the history of the formation of a border matters little for the the growth discontinuity across that border. Furthermore, since I consider differences in economic growth in narrow neighborhoods around borders, so long as the location of borders in these neighborhoods is not precisely determined with respect to economic growth, endogeneity in border placement should not be the driver of growth discontinuities at borders. Aside from endogenous border placement, growth discontinuities at national borders is consistent with either (or both) of the two following hypotheses: The growth process is not smooth across space, but depends on national-level shocks or national-level potential determinants of growth (such as national institutions, the national stock of human capital, culture or history) that vary discontinuously across borders. In particular, models in which local institutions or local culture are key to economic growth, but vary substantially across space and straddle borders would not generate growth discontinuities.Footnote 3 The border must form a barrier to the ability of people to avail themselves of particular institutions, to cultural influences, to the ability to obtain an education (or work with people with high human capital), or to the operation of other determinants of growth. Even in the absence of any differences in growth determinants across borders, there may still be discontinuities in rates of economic growth because borders form barriers to random economic shocks. Since different sides of a national border often have different languages, cultures and regulatory regimes, and often have explicit discouragements to trade across the border because of tariffs, the economies on the two sides of the border are less connected by trade than two economically comparable regions within the same country. Therefore, a shock in one country—such as a fall in demand for oil or a poor harvest—may fail to spill over a national border because of the discontinuous increase in transaction costs along that border. I first show that borders that present greater barriers to economic flows—such as borders with low trade, migration and remittance flows, and high tariffs—tend to have the same magnitudes of border discontinuities as do borders with low barriers to economic flows. On the other hand, borders separating culturally more homogenous populations—such as those having the same language, or those that have had been colonized by the same country—tend to display smaller growth discontinuities. I then perform a correlational analysis of which of the determinants of economic growth that are most frequently cited in the literature help account for growth discontinuities at borders. I find that the rule of law measure from the World Governance Indicators (WGI) is correlated with growth of lights at the border, even conditional on various other covariates, while public goods provision, human capital and trust are not correlated with growth discontinuities conditional on institutional quality. This paper is closest to Michalopoulos and Papaioannou (2014), who use night lights data to look at the (non)importance of national institutions for economic activity within African ethnicities split by national borders far away from their countries’ capitals. The major innovation of this paper is to consider discontinuities in growth rates, rather than levels, of economic activity across national borders. This innovation is valuable, since finding border discontinuities in economic growth rates, which tend to be volatile and much less persistent than is the level of economic activity, suggests that if these discontinuities can be attributed to policy variables, such as institutions, then policy might have nontrivial effects on economic growth. The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 describes the data. Section 3 provides baseline results on border discontinuities in growth rates, as well as robustness checks to varying the econometric procedures and accounting for basic covariates that may be different on different sides of borders. Section 4 explores the heterogeneity of growth discontinuities across borders and provides suggestive evidence that they are not driven by a special subset of borders and that they are not explained by faster-growing sides of borders having different geography from the slower-growing sides of borders. Section 5 explores whether growth discontinuities at borders may be explained by the discontinuous barriers to economic interchange that borders pose. Section 6 discusses determinants of economic growth that may help statistically explain growth discontinuities at borders. Section 7 concludes.",1
22,2,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-017-9141-3,The role of human capital and innovation in economic development: evidence from post-Malthusian Prussia,Francesco Cinnirella,Jochen Streb,,Male,Male,,Male,"Most growth economists probably agree on the notion that human capital is one of the decisive factors in explaining why some countries became rich and others remained poor in the past two centuries (Goldin and Katz 1998; Lucas 2002; Glaeser et al. 2004; Hanushek and Woessmann 2008; Jones and Romer 2010; Galor 2011; Acemoglu et al. 2014; Gennaioli et al. 2013). There is still dissent with regard to the channels through which human capital fosters economic growth, though. On the one hand, human capital is interpreted as an independent factor of production which increases productivity for a given level of technology (Lucas 1988; Mankiw et al. 1992). On the other hand, human capital is seen as an input in the innovation process and therefore as a complement to technology (Benhabib and Spiegel 1994; Romer 1990; Nelson and Phelps 1966). According to this view, higher levels of human capital lead to the generation or diffusion of new technologies or to a more efficient adoption of a given technology, thereby shifting the frontier of the production-possibility set outwards. In this paper we empirically address the role of human capital by analyzing the economic development in Prussian counties in the late nineteenth century. This is the period in which Prussia as a national economy caught up successfully to the more advanced British economy and even took over the technological leadership in some high-tech sectors such as chemicals or electrical engineering (Pierenkemper and Tilly 2004; Broadberry and Burhop 2010). Since the academic debate about the relative importance of different types of human capital during industrialization is not yet settled, we consider the influence of three different measures, namely literacy rates, craftsmanship, and secondary school enrollment rates. Valuable patents are used as a measure for innovation. We first analyze which type of human capital was mostly related to innovation in the Second Industrial Revolution. We find that “useful knowledge” embodied in skilled craftsmen was still an important determinant for innovation activities of private inventors in more traditional industries such as steam boilers or mechanical metal processing. In contrast to the First Industrial Revolution, however, the average stock of basic knowledge measured by the literacy rate was positively related to firms’ innovation in high-tech industries such as chemicals or electrical engineering. The surprising result that the stock of literate people was associated with high-tech innovations can be explained by three different lines of argument. First, high literacy rates might indicate an above-average general investment in children’s human capital that comprised also higher education, nutrition, and preventive health care (Baten et al. 2014; Kelly et al. 2015; Prados de la Escosura 2015; Mühlhoff 2016). Second, a high literacy rate might have facilitated transregional knowledge spillover and therefore a county’s outstanding innovativeness because reading was the only way to learn about ideas occurred outside the own locality. Third, high-tech innovations and formal basic education might have been complements in highly innovative industries where white-collar occupations increased exponentially during the Second Industrial Revolution (Goldin and Katz 1998). After having established the relationship between different types of human capital and innovation, we explore the impact of the former on income. Because data on GDP per capita are not available for Prussian counties we use information on per capita income-tax revenues as a second-best measure.Footnote 1 In the late nineteenth century, a Prussian household’s income tax was based on its taxable income from capital, immovable property, trade and commerce, and dependent employment. We therefore argue that Prussian income tax revenues reflect the productivity of the economic activity of the county. Our empirical analysis shows that literacy and patenting activities are independently correlated with income. This evidence lends support to the notion that basic education had an impact on Prussian growth through both the direct production channel and the indirect innovation channel. The fact that our empirical analysis is based on county-level data within a single country should alleviate the problem of disentangling the effect of human capital from that of institutions (Acemoglu et al. 2001; Glaeser et al. 2004; Acemoglu et al. 2014). Yet we know that, for instance, the process of peasants’ emancipation which started in Prussia in 1807 has been very heterogeneous, which means that land-tenure and labor market relations might still have been different across counties in the late nineteenth century (Cinnirella and Hornung 2016; Cinnirella and Schueler 2016). What is more, Acemoglu et al. (2011) have shown that Napoleonic institutional reforms significantly influenced the economic development in some German states that later became part of Prussia. More recent studies have focused on geography, natural resources, and access to markets to explain the location and the rise of manufacturing in the nineteenth century (Crafts and Wolf 2014; Fernihough and O’Rourke 2014; Gutberlet 2014). That is why we will account for differences in institutions, geography, and market access to ensure that the estimated effect of human capital on income is not mediated by these factors. Finally, we study another channel through which human capital might have affected Prussian economic growth. An important characteristic of the transition to modern economic growth is the rapid decline in fertility rates. Unified Growth Theory postulates that parents’ increased emphasis on children’s education, triggered by higher levels of technological progress, determined lower fertility outcomes (Galor 2011, 2012). Recent studies have provided empirical evidence of such a mechanism (Becker et al. 2010, 2012; Murphy 2015). We extend this literature by showing that the negative impact of literacy on fertility is larger in more technologically advanced counties, where arguably the returns to education were higher. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the role of human capital in economic growth on the basis of the theoretical and empirical literature. Section 3 introduces the data and discusses our measures for innovation, human capital, and income. Section 4 analyzes the relationship between different types of human capital and innovation. Section 5 tests whether literacy had a persistent impact on Prussian counties’ income tax revenues net of the effects of master craftsmen and formal secondary education. Section 6 analyzes to what extent literacy and innovation affect income independently of each other. Section 7 establishes that the negative impact of literacy on fertility increased with technological progress. Section 8 concludes.",1
22,3,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-017-9145-z,British economic growth since 1270: the role of education,Jakob B. Madsen,Fabrice Murtin,,Male,Male,,Male,"Although the British Industrial Revolution is one of the most significant events in human history, which shifted Britain from its Malthusian straitjacket onto a modern growth path, there is still much debate about the role played by human capital in this process. Unified growth theory has long stressed human capital as a crucial element for industrialization, first through informal guidance by parents and later through more formal education and the transition to the modern growth regime (see, e.g., Galor and Weil 2000; Galor and Moav 2002, 2006; Galor 2011). However, educational historians have often de-emphasized education as important for the growth experience of Britain and other countries (see, for discussion of the earlier literature, Stone 1964; Sanderson 1991). In his influential paper, Sandberg (1979) argues that population pressure, poor soil, and bad weather kept Sweden poor up to the middle of the nineteenth century despite having one of the most educated work forces in Europe. He conjectures that Sweden’s growth spurt at the end of the nineteenth century was caused by increasing world demand for Swedish natural resources (timber, minerals and hydro power) as well as increasing “technological opportunities”; however, he does not give an independent role for education as a driver or igniter of growth. Similarly, Mitch (1993) suggests that education was not a major factor for growth during the British Industrial Revolution and also argues against the hypothesis that a certain educational standard is required to industrialize. This line of reasoning gains support from Allen (2003) who finds no empirical support for the thesis that education was important for European development over the period 1300–1800 and concludes that literacy was generally unimportant for growth. However, Jacob (2014, p. 6) suggests that the myopia about the role of education in British economic development may be a result of the appalling state of British educational records prior to about 1850. This paper aims to uncover the role played by human capital, science and the evolution of institutions in British economic growth over the period from 1270 to 2010. To that end, long annual data series of educational attainment, science, capital stock and institutions are constructed. The data on education have been compiled through an extensive search in libraries and university web pages, about 500 Parliamentary Papers, and numerous email correspondences with the 23 individual universities that were in existence in Britain before 1920, and merged with historical studies and official statistics. Human capital is measured as educational attainment at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels, as well as knowledge capital created by great scientists and embodied in significant innovations.Footnote 1 These data are complemented by long-term data on fixed capital, international knowledge spillovers, population, domestic knowledge and institutions. This paper is the first attempt to disentangle the influence of the main factors of production on British growth using annual data over the past seven and a half centuries. We also contribute to the growth literature by proposing an original instrumentation strategy that is made possible by the very long-term dimension of our data. We make the assumption that, after at least two generations (i.e. 80 years), explanatory variables behave as weakly exogenous regressors and, therefore, are uncorrelated with the current innovations in GDP. In practice, we instrument covariates with their values lagged between 80 and 190 years, which, to the best of our knowledge, has never been done before in macroeconomic studies due to the lack of sufficiently long time series. This procedure echoes the instrumentation of children’s outcomes using the characteristics of their grandparents in the microeconomic literature (see, e.g., Maurin 2002). Similarly, Becker et al. (2011) use education across counties in Germany in 1816 as instruments for education in the same counties in 1849 and 1882. The empirical results suggest that education and domestic innovation stock, physical capital and labor are robust determinants of GDP. Simulations of the baseline models show that, of the average 0.5% per capita income growth rate over the 1270–2010 period, 59% is accounted for by the rise in education, 16% by growth of domestic innovations, 29% by capital deepening, 10% by increasing employment-population ratios, and a 14% reduction is induced by population growth. Furthermore, we find that primary education was the most important educational determinant of growth before 1750 and secondary and tertiary education afterwards. These results are consistent with the predications of unified growth theories of Galor and Weil (2000) and Galor and Moav (2002) in which education is stressed as a key factor behind the transition from the Malthusian growth regime, through the post-Malthusian growth regime and to the modern growth regime. The model of Galor and Moav (2002) is particularly relevant for the findings in this paper because it gives a strong theoretical foundation for how evolutionary pressure during the Malthusian era gradually increased the representation of individuals whose characteristics were complementary to growth; thus producing a positive interaction between technological progress and education that eventually resulted in the Industrial Revolution. This effect was reinforced from the mid-seventeenth century by the increasing per capita income that not only lead to increasing population pressure but also to increasing investment in children’s education (Galor and Weil 2000; Galor 2011). The acceleration in technological progress during the Second British Industrial Revolution and the associated demographic transition brought about a decline in population growth and stimulated investment in education (Galor and Weil 2000). The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents a brief review of the origin of education in Britain, the factors that led to the expansion of education, and the interaction between science and innovators. Sections 3–7 present the empirical model, database, OLS and IV regression results, and robustness checks. Simulation results are presented in Sect. 8 to gauge the contribution of education, science, capital accumulation and other factors to British economic growth over the period 1270-2010. Sections 9 and 10 discuss the main findings and their implications.",1

Becker,Markus Nagler,Ludger Woessmann,,Male,Male,Male,"Secularization, understood as churches’ loss of importance in society, is a European phenomenon that was particularly strong during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century and brought fundamental change to societies. Important aspects of this can be observed from the practice of religious participation. For example, in our micro-regional German data, participation in Holy Communion per Protestant declined on average by nearly a third of its initial value from 1890 to 1930. Understanding the sources of this seismic religious change is important: by shaping attitudes towards factors such as education and knowledge diffusion, the religious orientation of society may have important repercussions for long-run development (Galor 2011).Footnote 1 Furthermore, while it is hard to observe changes in religious beliefs in the historical context, declining religious participation in itself has important societal meaning because of the historical role of the institutionalized church in society at large. However, despite heated academic debates, empirical evidence on the sources of this dramatic social change is scarce. In this paper, we use city-level panel data to estimate how advanced education affected religious participation in Germany’s secularization period around the turn to the twentieth century. Classic secularization hypotheses suggest economic development and education as two dimensions of modernization that may affect religious participation. Our focus is on the effect of education. As argued by many eminent scholars, increased education may have been a leading source of secularization because increased critical thinking and advanced scientific knowledge may have reduced belief in supernatural forces (e.g., Hume 1757 [1993]; Freud 1927 [1961]; cf. McCleary and Barro 2006a). Cross-sectional evidence generally contradicts this view and finds a positive association between education and church attendance (Iannaccone 1998), and modern cross-country and individual panel analyses come to mixed results. However, it is unclear how these results transmit to the context of actual decade-long societal developments during important historical phases of secularization. To provide evidence from an historical setting of massive secularization, this paper constructs a unique panel dataset on education and Protestant church attendance in German cities from 1890 to 1930. This dataset allows us to estimate panel models with fixed effects that exploit city-specific variation over time. While cross-sectional associations between education and religious participation may well emerge from bias due to omitted variables—for example, more orderly people may go both to church and to school—the use of city and year fixed effects takes out unobserved time-invariant city characteristics and common trends. In our panel fixed effects models, we find that enrollment increases in advanced schools are significantly related to decreases in church attendance. These panel estimates are in strong contrast to cross-sectional models, which indicate a positive cross-sectional association between advanced education and church attendance in the same data. In contrast to education, changes in measures of income (municipal tax, income tax, or teacher income) and urbanization (city population) as alternative dimensions of modernization are not significantly related to changes in church attendance, confirming recent related work at the county level (Becker and Woessmann 2013). The main result is confirmed in a series of robustness tests. In particular, we control for contemporaneous changes in potentially confounding variables such as the demographic composition of the city (age and gender structure and migration patterns), the educational environment (opening of universities and emergence of secular schools), the economic environment (industry structure and welfare expenditure), and the political environment (emergence of secular movements and nationalistic sentiment). Results are also robust in alternative specifications of the education variable and in subsamples. The significant negative effect of advanced-school enrollment on church attendance is also confirmed in dynamic panel models. First, models with different lag structures of the education variable indicate that the effect of advanced-school enrollment is strongest after about 10 years (the second lag), speaking against bias from reverse causation and suggesting that the effect of advanced education on religious participation materializes over time. By contrast, lagged church attendance does not predict advanced-school enrollment. Second, results are robust in models with lagged dependent variables to account for persistence in church attendance over time. Third, while a demanding specification in our setting, basic results are also robust to the addition of city-specific linear time trends. Results are also confirmed in an instrumental-variable specification that uses the number of advanced schools in a city as an instrument for advanced-school enrollment. To avoid identification from potentially endogenous demand-side enrollment decisions, this model restricts the analysis to changes in the supply of schools and exploits variation in advanced-school enrollment that originates from the opening and closing of advanced schools in a city. Finally, we use enrollment in different types of advanced schools that have different curricula to explore potential mechanisms of the effect of advanced-school enrollment on religious participation. While imprecisely estimated, the coefficients of the different school types indicate that results are at least as strong for the classical humanistisches Gymnasium with its curriculum focused on classical languages (and for the Realgymnasium with its focus on modern languages) as for the newly emerging Oberrealschule with its strong curricular focus on natural sciences. This pattern is more consistent with a leading role for the general conveyance of critical thinking in advanced schools in undermining belief in the institutionalized church than with a specific role for the teaching of scientific knowledge of facts of natural sciences. Our paper addresses the effect of advanced education on religious participation in a leading historical period of secularization, using city-specific variation within one country over several decades. As such, it complements the existing literature on the effects of education on secularization that uses cross-country or modern-day individual-level variation (as summarized in greater detail in Sect. 2.2 below) by providing insights into the mechanisms and reasons of a fundamentally important social phenomenon in Europe in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. It is particularly noteworthy that in our context, the cross-sectional pattern is turned around in the panel analyses, suggesting that the cross-sectional identification is likely to suffer from severe identification problems. Our panel evidence suggests that in the historical context of Germany around the turn to the twentieth century, educational expansion was negatively related to religious participation, confirming traditional secularization hypotheses during an historical period of mass secularization when these lines of reasoning were very prominent but lacked empirical validation. In what follows, Sect. 2 provides a conceptual background and reviews the literature. Section 3 gives the historic and institutional background for Germany at the turn of the twentieth century. Sections 4 and 5 introduce our data and empirical model. Section 6 reports our basic results and different robustness checks. Sections 7 and 8 extend the analysis to dynamic panel models and instrumental-variable estimation, respectively. Section 9 explores specific mechanisms by analyzing effects of different types of advanced schools that have different curricula. Section 10 concludes.",1
22,3,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-017-9144-0,Does European development have Roman roots? Evidence from the German Limes,Fabian Wahl,,,Male,,,Male,"To what extent are contemporary levels of economic development still shaped by history? Many studies have shown that the persistent effects of deeply rooted institutional, cultural, geographical and human characteristics are central to the understanding of comparative development across countries, regions or ethnic groups and also for designing effective political measures to foster long-run prosperity (Acemoglu et al. 2001; Ashraf and Galor 2013; Bleakley and Lin 2012; Dell 2010; GiulianoandNunn 2017). However, despite the potentially significant cultural heritage of the Greco-Roman civilizations, their contribution to the long-run prosperity of Europe has been largely disregarded by existing research. This study explores the long-run effects of a Roman presence on economic development. Namely, it investigates whether there are significant differences in economic development (proxied by nighttime light intensity) between former Roman and non-Roman parts of today’s Germany. Empirical identification of a positive effect of the Roman presence in Germany is based on a spatial regression discontinuity approach. In this boundary discontinuity design (BDD), the German Limes acts as two-dimensional cutoff separating treated and non-treated areas.Footnote 1
 Next, I investigate whether these differences can be traced back to a particular part of the Roman legacy, namely, the persistence of their road network and its influence on the growth and location of cities. To empirically test this, I establish the persistence of the Roman road network within Germany and show that these roads in general are significantly positively related to economic development in Germany. Then I show that the road network in Roman Germany is denser and, by using a city level panel data set from 800 to 2000, that cities in the Roman part of Germany have experienced stronger growth during this period. The road network is among those Roman legacies that is most likely to have had a persistent effect on later developments. Transport infrastructure (railways and roads) is often found to have long-lasting effects on economic development (e.g., Berger and Enflo 2017; Cogneau and Moradi 2014; Holl 2004) by giving an advantage to those places that are connected to a railroad, or were connected earlier. It has additionally been shown that many of the major Roman roads were also used and maintained in the centuries after the break-down of the Empire (e.g., Glick 1979). In line with this, Bosker and Buringh (2017) show that the probability of the existence of a city is significantly higher at locations near to Roman roads. There are three major factors explaining the persistence of the Roman road network and why it provided a particularly long-lasting development advantage to the regions previously ruled by the Romans. First, pre-existing roads represented a cost advantage as no new roads needed to be built by the elites following the Romans. In particular, during the Middle Ages most rulers lacked the natural resources, capabilities, or money to build and maintain new road networks and, thus, largely relied on the existing ones. In later periods, the elites could use those saved resources to build additional roads. This led to a denser transport network in the Roman regions, which is clearly favorable for trade and commerce. Second, cities founded by the Romans (e.g., Cologne, Mainz, etc.) often remained among the most important and populous metropolises in subsequent centuries. Moreover, they had a central position in the post-Roman urban networks as they were connected by the Roman roads, and were therefore easier to travel to and from making them advantageous places for trade, and giving them better market access. Thus, these have grew earlier and larger leading to a higher degree of urbanization in the Roman parts of Germany. Strongly agglomerated areas usually show more economic activity and agglomeration tends to persist (e.g., Bleakley and Lin 2012; Bosker et al. 2013). Third, due to the advantages of being located on a Roman road, new cities were more likely to occur along one (Bosker and Buringh 2017)—despite the fact that Roman roads usually followed a straight line, meaning that their course was often not optimal in terms of economic transport costs, because they were constructed primarily for military rathn than trade purposes (Schallmayer 2011). Hence, there is a positive feedback between the Roman road network and the forces of agglomeration and urbanization that provided cities in the Roman area with a long-lasting developmental advantage. The former Roman border through Germany consisted of two natural river frontiers, following the banks of the Rhine and the Danube, with the Limes Germanicus wall as a joining section between them. An empirically valid boundary discontinuity design requires that the studied border is drawn in an economically unsystematic way. Therefore, this paved frontier wall is the Roman border that is most suitable for identifying the “Roman Empire effect” with a border discontinuity. On the one hand, this is because the Limes, unlike many other parts of the historical Roman border, divides a contemporary country, namely Germany. Among those parts of the Roman border separating contemporary European countries, it is the only one that is not identical to an important contemporary political border (like that between England and Scotland), a major river (the Rhine or Danube) or located in a mountain area (as is the case in Romania).Footnote 2 Another argument is that the course and existence of the roads in all other countries is often uncertain as they are not as well researched as in Germany. The same holds true for the history of the Limes and, in particular, for pre-Roman settlement history in Germany, which is crucial to know for the identification of the effect of the Romans on city development. Furthermore, the formation history of the Limes suggests that its course does mostly reflect strategic and essentially military rather than economic considerations (e.g., Baatz 2000; Schallmayer 2011). This is why parts of the Limes follow straight lines, i.e. were built regardless of topographical conditions.Footnote 3 Finally, focusing on the border through one country significantly reduces potential biases arising from unobserved heterogeneity due to different political institutions or culture. Hence, for the identification of a causal effect of Roman presence in general and the Roman road network in particular with a border discontinuity, the Limes wall is the most promising segment of the Roman border for this analysis. The results indicate that, indeed, economic development is significantly higher in the historically Roman parts of Germany. I can also show that the Roman road network has largely persisted until today, that the formerly Roman parts of Germany have a denser road network and that this denser road network is associated with better economic development. In addition, I am able to show that cities in the Roman area are on average larger and that this is particularly true for cities founded by the Romans and/or connected by Roman roads. I ensure that the results are not driven by existing pre-Roman or time-invariate differences in relevant observable characteristics (e.g., Celtic settlement patterns, soil quality, elevation) and are not related to the spatial distribution of Protestants, historical migration patterns and the separation of Germany into different occupied zones in the aftermath of World War II. Additionally, I conduct a placebo exercise looking at the effect when the Limes is shifted to the north and south of its actual location and do not find significant results. Finally, I show that all results of the paper are qualitatively similar if I consider the complete Roman border through Germany (Appendix section B.3.1). Furthermore, in Appendix B.4.3, I show that the positive and significant effect of Roman heritage on economic development also exists if I analyze all continental European countries separated by the Roman border. The paper is organized as follows: first, in Sect. 2, I discuss relevant existing research and its relationship to the present paper. Section 3 provides historical background on pre-Roman Germany and the history of the Limes. In Sect. 4, I describe the empirical setting and introduce the data used for the empirical analysis. Afterwards, I explain the choice of the German Limes as studied border segment. In Sect. 5, I conduct the empirical analysis, discuss relevant identification issues, and interpret the results. Section 6 concludes.",1

22,4,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-017-9149-8,Oil and ethnic inequality in Nigeria,James Fenske,Igor Zurimendi,,Male,Male,,Male,"In this paper, we ask whether members of African ethnic groups benefit differentially from positive commodity price shocks in resource producing countries. The division of increased returns to commodity production is central to whether or not natural resources contribute to development and growth (Sachs and Warner 2001; Mehlum et al. 2006). Further, ethnic fragmentation is an important component of Africa’s growth tragedy (Easterly and Levine 1997; Posner 2004). We focus on Nigeria. Nigeria is dependent on oil; oil rents accounted for 26.8% of GDP in 2012 (World Bank 2012) and oil provided 70% of government revenues in 2011 (NRGI 2013). Nigeria is well known for failing to convert its resource windfall into development. From 1960 to 2000, more than $350 billion in oil revenue in 1995 dollars was collected by the Nigerian government while, depending on the estimate, real income per capita either fell or made only modest gains (Marwah 2014).Footnote 1 During the oil boom of the 1970s, government spending and access to international capital increased, but annual production of Nigeria’s major cash crops declined (Pinto 1987). By testing whether members of certain ethnic groups benefit differentially from positive oil shocks, we assess the distributional impacts of oil price changes across regions and across ethnicities. This task is made difficult by the absence of nationally representative sub-national data on individuals’ living standards over long periods of time. For example, the Nigeria Living Standards Measurement Study covers only three waves, the first in 2010. The first national survey from which a distribution of living standards can be computed took place in 1992 (Bevan et al. 1999, p. 100). Tracing the relative impacts of changing oil prices is not as simple as measuring the distribution of government spending over space, since many macroeconomic responses to oil are not driven by government spending. We focus, then, on final outcomes for individuals. Our approach is to test whether real oil price shocks experienced in early life affect human capital outcomes of members of Nigeria’s ethnic groups. This allows us to recover the ultimate distribution of the relative impacts of changes in oil prices. We use individual data on women from the nationally representative 2008 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). We employ a difference-in-difference approach that exploits variation over time within ethnic groups and that compares members of Southern ethnic groups to other Nigerians born in the same year, allowing for ethnicity-specific time trends. Though our baseline North-South distinction is coarse, it features prominently in the secondary literature (e.g. Archibong 2016; Dev et al. 2016; Falola and Heaton 2008). The bulk of Nigerian oil is produced in the Niger Delta region of the south. Levels of education have been higher in the south since at least 1960, and members of southern ethnic groups are over-represented in the professions and the civil service. Control of the executive between independence and the return to democracy in 1999 was predominantly held by Northerners. While the south received more colonial missions and is predominantly Christian, the North is predominantly Muslim. The North-South distinction is also reflected in the data. We disaggregate our effects into finer ethnic categories, and show that outcomes for multiple southern groups and multiple northern groups move together in response to oil prices. Delta ethnicities, in particular, have outcomes whose responses to oil prices resemble those of other southern groups. Although oil is important to Nigeria, the country is a small producer and part of the “competitive fringe” that does not coordinate its production quantities with OPEC (Griffin 1985). World oil prices, then, can be taken as exogenous from the Nigerian perspective.Footnote 2 These correlate strongly with the total value of Nigerian oil production, without being potentially contaminated by an endogenous production quantity response. 
Our main finding is that relative economic outcomes for Southern groups respond positively to oil prices, but that relative health outcomes respond negatively. Positive oil price shocks increase years of education, make a woman more likely to have a skilled occupation and to be in work, reduce fertility, and raise age at first marriage compared to a woman from a Northern ethnic group born in the same year. However, positive oil price shocks reduce relative height and increase relative BMI. The effects we find are economically meaningful. Across our outcome variables, a one standard deviation movement in early-life oil prices changes the outcome variables by roughly 0.05 to 0.10 standard deviations, magnitudes that are similar to other early life treatments in the literature. 
Why are these findings significant for economic thought? Ethnic inequality reduces growth through civil conflict, limited public goods provision, lower social capital, and distrust of market economies (Alesina et al. 2016). Despite its importance, the origins of ethnic inequality are not well understood. Existing empirical work has focused on political variables such as control of the executive (Burgess et al. 2015; Franck and Rainer 2012). Alesina et al. (2016) show that inequality in geographic endowments predicts inequality across ethnic groups. And yet our results are both net of time-invariant factors such as geography and reveal relative Southern gains in a time of Northern political dominance. Our results demonstrate, then, that additional factors contribute to this important determinant of economic growth. Our results can be understood as microeconomic responses to the macroeconomic changes prompted by oil prices. While there are several complicated mechanisms driving our results, we focus in this paper on a core set of changes that have been emphasized in the secondary literature, that are consistent with the empirical results that we find, and that we can evaluate empirically. In the appendix, we present several additional results that we use to evaluate a larger set of possible mechanisms. These changes are not as simple as local economic spillovers in the areas where oil is produced; we find little difference in responses between the oil-producing Delta region and the remainder of Southern Nigeria. The oil sector employs less than 1% of the Nigerian labor force (Fajana et al. 2005). The existing literature has argued that oil revenues spurred a decline of agriculture, volume growth in the oil sector, and increasing urban employment in services and manufacturing (Bevan et al. 1999, p. 186). The secondary literature emphsizes that the decline of agriculture and growth of urban services and manufacturing employment was greater in the South, due to a variety of factors such as the labor-intensiveness of Southern agriculture and the high wages in oil and related urban sectors (Scherr 1989; Walker 2000; Khan 1994). The secondary literature also notes that the gap between the richer South and the poorer North grew during the oil boom (Bevan et al. 1999, p. 107). Manufacturing grew in the South where it had been traditionally concentrated, and rising managerial, professional, and public sector employment drew from the Southern ethnic groups that were already over-represented in these sectors (Mustapha 2006). We indeed show empirically that our results can be partly explained by the levels of education that predated the oil boom, and that oil prices accentuated baseline differences between the North and South. Our results support a similar story. Southern households benefit economically relative to the North from positive oil price shocks, and use this advantage to invest in more, better-educated (though not necessarily healthier) children. Adverse health effects result in part because Southern households face a greater opportunity cost of time and reduce some early-life investments in their children, particularly vaccinations.Footnote 3 Additional explanations of the relative adverse health effects include urbanization and food prices. Using additional waves of the DHS data, we show that indeed Southern households have more assets and women are more likely to work when oil prices are higher. We show a strong negative correlation between Nigerian per capita food production and oil prices. We also find that men in southern Nigeria are relatively less likely to work in agriculture in years of high oil prices. We contribute to the literatures on ethnic inequality, early life shocks and investments, and the effects of commodity price shocks in general and natural resource windfalls in particular. The importance of ethnic divisions for outcomes such as government quality, conflict and public goods provision is not limited to Africa (Baldwin and Huber 2010; Esteban et al. 2012). Large intra-country differences in economic development exist across ethnic groups in much of Africa (Michalopoulos and Papaioannou 2013). The importance of Africa’s ethnic divisions for outcomes such as the distribution of political power (Francois et al. 2015), the provision of public goods (Glennerster et al. 2013; Franck and Rainer 2012), and the incidence of conflict (Desmet et al. 2012; Michalopoulos and Papaioannou 2016) has been the subject of considerable quantitative research. Most of the literature has focused on the consequences of ethnic politics on macroeconomic outcomes. Our study adds to this literature by considering whether positive commodity price shocks increase the relative standing of specific ethnicities in a way that improves outcomes for their members. We thus add evidence on the time-varying sources of ethnic inequality, and on the importance of shocks other than the distribution of political power that can alter the relative fortunes of a country’s ethnic groups. Our results are consistent with the pattern highlighted by Chua (2004), in which external economic shocks can amplify existing ethnic differences within countries. Existing research has looked at the impact of many different early life shocks, including disease burdens, weather, and government assistance programs (Almond 2006; Maccini and Yang 2009; Hoyne et al. 2016). In particular, this literature has focused on the “fetal origins” of long-run health (Almond and Currie 2011). We assess a broad range of adult outcomes, including education and marriage behavior. Our contribution to this literature is two-fold. First, we add to the empirical evidence on whether parental investments mitigate or reinforce early life shocks and, if so, how effectively. Recent work has suggested that parental investments are mostly reinforcing (Adhvaryu and Nyshadham 2016; Almond and Mazumder 2013) and that the investments made early in life are particularly productive (Cunha et al. 2010; Bharadwaj et al. 2013). We do not find strong evidence of reinforcing investments, as Southern mothers invest less in vaccination years of higher oil prices. Second, though the literature on early life circumstance is extensive, little of it has focused on the impact of strictly economic shocks such as commodity prices, notable exceptions being Adhvaryu et al. (2014a) and Cogneau and Jedwab (2012). This is despite the particular vulnerability of poor countries to movements in commodity prices (Deaton 1999). The third body of research our paper is related to concerns the political economy and human capital effects of commodity price shocks. Existing work has considered the importance of these shocks for outcomes such as conflict (Brückner and Ciccone 2010), health spending (Acemoglu et al. 2013), government fiscal positions (Arezki and Brückner 2012), household enterprize (Adhvaryu et al. 2014b), and child outcomes such as survival, schooling and labor (Kruger 2007; Miller and Urdinola 2010). Oil is a capital-intensive “point source” resource, and so price increases might be expected to have adverse effects on conflict and health outcomes. Existing studies have found that oil rents may reduce democracy (Tsui 2011), increase corruption (Arezki and Brückner 2011), and reduce the status of women (Ross 2008). We add to this literature by considering the long-run effects of these shocks, heterogeneity in responses to these shocks at the sub-national level, and the degree to which short-term responses help explain long-run outcomes. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides background on oil production and the political economy of economic growth in Nigeria. Section 2 also outlines our conceptual framework: our understanding of the macroeconomic responses to oil prices that explain our microeconomic outcomes. Section 3 explains our identification strategy and outlines our sources of data. Section 4 presents results. Section 5 tests between potential mechanisms. Section 6 concludes.",1
22,4,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-017-9147-x,Life expectancy and education: evidence from the cardiovascular revolution,Casper Worm Hansen,Holger Strulik,,Male,Male,,Male,"In this study, we investigate the fourth stage of the epidemiological transition, or more specifically, the unexpected decline of deaths from cardiovascular diseases since the 1970s. Using a difference-in-differences estimation strategy, we find that American states with higher mortality rates attributed to cardiovascular-disease prior to the 1970s experienced greater increases in adult life expectancy and greater increase in tertiary education enrollment. The existence of a positive association between life expectancy and education is well documented. According to one popular study, US Americans who were 25 years old in 2000 with any amount of college education were expected to live 7 years longer than those with only a high school education or less (Meara et al. 2008). A similar association between education and health has been observed in many other countries. A major challenge among the studies identifying the impact of longevity on education, is reverse causality. In theory, there are several possible mechanisms that motivate education’s positive impact on longevity (e.g., Grossman 2006; Strulik 2016). There exists also a rich microeconometric literature, which suggests that part of the observable positive correlation is explained by a causal impact of education on health and longevity (see Cutler et al. 2011 for a survey of the literature). To identify the causal effect of life expectancy on education and GDP per capita, Acemoglu and Johnson (2006, 2007) suggested that the third stage of the epidemiological transition, i.e. the diffusion of antibiotics and new vaccines in the 1940s, should be exploited as an exogenous health shock. Their seminal approach has triggered a series of follow-up studies and extensions, mainly with a focus on GDP or GDP growth, which either challenged (Aghion et al. 2011; Cervellati and Sunde 2011; Bloom et al. 2014) or confirmed (Acemoglu and Johnson 2014; Hansen 2014; Hansen and Lønstrup 2015) the original results. While these studies vary in their specific estimation strategies, no attempts have been made in order to exploit a different health shock. The third stage of the epidemiological transition, however, is a less convincing health shock for identification when examining adult life expectancy in developed countries. The diffusion of antibiotics and other new drugs in the 1940s had a large impact on death from communicable diseases, in particular, tuberculosis, pneumonia, and malaria. As emphasized by Acemoglu and Johnson (2006, p. 4) these drugs reduced diseases that largely affected children. While communicable diseases still cause a high death toll in today’s less developed countries, also among adults, they play less of a role in adult mortality in developed countries (WHO 2008, Tables A5b–A5d). In developed countries, adult mortality is mainly determined by degenerative, non-communicable diseases caused by the aging body. In the US, for example, heart disease has been the leading cause of death since 1921 up to the present day (DHHS 1999a; American Heart Association 2014). Worldwide, heart disease is the leading cause of death for adults aged 60 and above and is second (after HIV) for those aged 15–59 (WHO 2008). Regardless of the third stage of the epidemiological transition, deaths from cardiovascular disease were continuously on the rise from the beginning of the 20th century until about 1970 (Cutler et al. 2006, Figure 3). The focus of the earlier literature on communicable diseases appears to be less appropriate for uncovering the nexus between life expectancy and education for several reasons. The effect of lower child mortality on human capital per capita is theoretically ambiguous (Galor 2011, 2012). Conventional overlapping generations models predict that decreasing child mortality does not change net fertility nor education (Galor 2011, 2012), while other models predict either a decline (Kalemli-Ozcan 2002) or an increase in net fertility (Doepke 2005; Strulik and Weisdorf 2014). Lorentzen et al. (2008), like us, focus on adult mortality but instead of exploiting a health shock for identification, they use malaria ecology, climatic variables, and geographic features as instruments. These instruments capture predominantly exogenous influences on death from communicable diseases and are presumably less suitable for capturing the influence of natural aging and non-communicable diseases. Lorentzen et al. (2008) find that adult mortality, instrumented in this way, exerts a significant effect on growth, investment, and fertility, but like Acemoglu and Johnson (2006), they fail to find a significant effect for average years of schooling. In contrast, Hansen (2013) demonstrates a positive effect of increasing life expectancy on years of schooling using a cohort-based measure and the same identification strategy as Acemoglu and Johnson (2006, 2007). Inspecting the different potential drivers of these results, the study concludes that the main contributing factor is a decline in death from pneumonia. Interestingly, in the WHO’s (2008) rankings for the leading cause of death for adults aged 60+, lower respiratory infections (including pneumonia) come fourth, after cardiovascular diseases. The question remains: what can be learned from the epidemiological transition of the 1940s or, more generally, from the historical decline of communicable diseases for the future of longevity and higher education in today’s developed countries? In developed countries, primary and secondary education are largely compulsory, and tertiary education is presumably made by adults on their own behalf. These adults experience little threat of dying prematurely from communicable diseases. Instead, they face the risk of dying in old age from non-communicable diseases, such as heart attacks and strokes. Inspired by these insights, we investigate the strong, permanent, and unexpected decline of death from heart disease that began in the 1970s, and has been labelled the cardiovascular revolution (Foege 1987; Vallin and Mesle 2009; Thelle 2011). We focus on education enrollment of 18–24 year-old US Americans and on life expectancy at age 30 (or, alternatively, at 50). This means that there is little concern for reverse causality, i.e. that the education decision of 18–24 year olds may affect life expectancy of the contemporaneously 30 or 50 year olds. We use a difference-in-differences estimation strategy that exploits the fact that some states benefitted more from innovations in medical treatments of cardiovascular diseases. We thus follow the same principal logic as in the empirical strategies employed by Bleakley (2007), Acemoglu and Johnson (2007), Albanesi and Olivetti (2014), and Bhalotra and Venkataramani (2015). Our focus on the relationship between adult life expectancy and education in the US also relates our study to a recent micro study by Oster et al. (2013). Using individual data on the probability of developing Huntington’s disease, which occurs late in life, Oster et al. establish that life expectancy has a strong positive impact on human capital investments, consistent with our evidence. Our estimates suggest that a one-standard deviation higher treatment intensity is associated with an increase in adult life expectancy of 0.37 years and 0.07–0.15 more years of higher education. This means that the cardiovascular revolution can account for 52% of the observed increase in higher education from 1960 to 2000. The obvious (but not singular) interpretation of our results is that it provides empirical evidence for the Ben-Porath (1967) model. According to this model, increasing adult life expectancy exerts a higher incentive to invest in education. In theory, this mechanism was established more than 40 years ago. In practice, however, it has been recently challenged by Hazan’s (2009) study, which then triggered a series of refinements of the original theory (Hansen and Lønstrup 2012; Cervellati and Sunde 2013; Strulik and Werner 2016). In a nutshell, these refinements offer alternative explanations for why increasing life expectancy may trigger more education without necessarily increasing the age of retirement or lifetime labor supply. We argue that our approach captures the ideas of the Ben-Porath model and its refinements more closely than the existing empirical literature (e.g., Acemoglu and Johnson 2007; Lorentzen et al. 2008; Cervellati and Sunde 2011) because of our focus on the impact of adult longevity on higher education. However, there are other conceivable channels. For example, the middle-aged may experience an increase in expected lifetime income through a decline in the risk of death from heart disease, which may motivate them to spend more on college education for their children. Quantitatively, however, this channel seems to be of second order since most heart disease is experienced after retirement.Footnote 1
 This paper is organized as follows. The next section introduces the background of the cardiovascular revolution. Sections 3 and 4 describe the data and estimation strategy. In Sect. 5, we discuss the effects of the cardiovascular revolution. Sections 5.1 and 5.2 contain our main results by establishing the impact of the cardiovascular revolution on adult life expectancy and on tertiary education. In Sect. 5.3 to 5.5, we relate the cardiovascular revolution more broadly to the literature on economic and demographic effects of the epidemiological transition. In Sect. 5.3, we show that we cannot establish a significant impact of cardiovascular disease mortality on income and wages and in Sect. 5.4, we show a positive impact on population size. In Sect. 5.5, we compare the effects of the cardiovascular revolution with those from the third stage of the epidemiological transition, and in Sect. 5.6 we provide some further robustness checks. Section 6 concludes.",1

More recently, geography has gained even greater attention for development in a long-term perspective. Migratory distance from the cradle of human kind in Africa and the effect of genetic diversity have been shown to have a hump shaped effect of comparative economic development (Ashraf and Galor 2013) and regional variations in the return to agricultural investment contributed to the distribution of long-term orientation across societies (Galor and Ozak 2016). Our study contributes to this recent strand of literature, but with a new approach: we study human capital in a cross-section of more than 300 European regions around 1900. Our first set of regressions uses geographic factors (soil quality, altitude, ruggedness) and other geographic variables as explanatory variables. We focus on the following questions: does crop yield matter, and which other agricultural specializations might be important? In a second step, we study the question why geographic factors and human capital might be correlated. One plausible causal channel for explaining the relationship between soil qualities and numeracy is land inequality. In a seminal paper, Galor et al. (2009, GMV from here) argue that inequality in land distribution has a negative effect on the development of institutions that promote human capital. During the transition from an agricultural economy to an industrial economy, a major conflict arose between agricultural landholders on the one hand, and capitalists, on the other. Landholders did not benefit as much from an increase in the human capital of their workers as did capitalists: human capital raises the productivity of workers much more in industry than in agriculture, because land and human capital are less complementary. Consequently, the return on land declines as the wages of workers rise; due to the higher level of education that individuals obtain. Moreover, educated workers have more incentives to migrate to urban, industrial areas than their less educated counterparts. This departure of workers from their fields is clearly contrary to the interests of landholders. Consequently, they attempt to hinder the formation of this “rural exodus”. For this reason, as GMV describe the process, landowners inhibit educational policies and reforms that aim at augmenting the general education of the people. Consequently, inequality in land distribution may be viewed as an obstacle to human capital formation and thus as a factor in slowing down the process of industrialisation and the generation of economic growth. We would argue that this effect may have been even more pronounced in the case of countries such as Russia, Hungary, Italy and Spain, where landed elites were still very powerful around 1900. In this respect, land inequality is a driving force in the emergence of the great divergence in income per capita, which has long-run implications that we can still observe throughout the world today. GMV assess and confirm their theoretical model through empirical, state-level evidence from the US for the first decades of the twentieth century; even if, in this case, the industrial elites may have already partly dominated national politics. Other historical studies observe insignificant and sometimes contradictory results (Gray and Clark 2014, Goñi 2016, see also the literature review below). The value-added of our study consists of the analysis of whether GMV theory can be confirmed when a very large regional sample is used. It turns out that the European experience provides such a sample. The advantage of using a historical European multi-country sample from the nineteenth century is that many decisions and concrete designs of educational investments were realised at the regional level during this period. Even if there were national laws, regional committees hired teachers and decided how school buildings were built and equipped. Many educational issues decreed in Madrid or Saint Petersburg became considerably modified in the provinces in which local elites held power. We employ the age heaping method, which measures the share of individuals in the population who could report their own age exactly rather than reporting a rounded age in censuses. By using a new and large dataset on numeracy, adding relevant data on land distribution and including several control variables, we trace the relationship between land inequality and human capital throughout Europe at the regional level. It is important to use an outcome variable such as numeracy because school inequality was very high in nineteenth century Europe: some local committees hired incapable but inexpensive teachers simply to fill the schools, but the human capital effect of underpaid and undereducated teachers was negligible (on the difference between school inputs and their effects on mathematical ability, see Hanushek and Woessmann 2012). Other local committees decided to provide mostly religious education (Lindert 2004a). We also take care to differentiate between the situations in the less industrialised east and south and the more industrial western parts of Europe; an issue which has not been studied in earlier research. Based on GMV theory, we would expect that the land inequality effect depends on the balance of bargaining power between large land owners and industrialists. It is very likely that in the less industrialised east and south, the political power of landowners was still considerably stronger than in the western European countries where industrialists had attained a large share of the decision-making power. Although the relationship between land inequality and education that we are testing below is based on a well-founded microeconomic theory, we avoid causal language in the interpretation of our regression tables. We only discuss correlations and relationships instead. Only in the conclusion, where we bring together theory and empirics once again, we find that the correlations are in line with our theoretical expectations. We gain insights into identification issues by applying Altonji–Elder–Taber ratios and Oster’s strategies, and find that omitted variables would probably not eliminate the land inequality effect. Additional hints on causality issues are gained from an IV-estimation applied to Spain, one of the countries studied here. Exogenous variation comes from the military event of the late medieval Reconquista, and from family farm structure versus latifundial differences in earlier centuries. The paper is structured as follows. Firstly, we revisit the literature on human capital, land distribution and land reform. Secondly, we present the underlying theoretical framework and the existing qualitative evidence. Thirdly, we describe the data used in this study and present the state of regional land distribution in Europe in the past. We highlight the modelling strategy and empirical results in the following section. The last section concludes.",1

Are technological improvements outcomes of greater openness to trade and more political freedom? In the last decades many arguments have been proposed that suggest a positive answer to these questions. The consequences of these regime changes for technological improvement are, nonetheless, not straightforward from a theoretical perspective and have not been systematically explored empirically. This paper presents a theoretical and empirical investigation of the role of trade liberalization, democratization, and their interaction for technology adoption. Existing theoretical literature has predicted that openness and democracy increase productivity, but mainly through indirect channels (see the related literature in Sect. 2). Trade leads to more efficient use of available resources, reducing the scope for inefficient rent-seeking made possible by economic protectionism. Democracy reduces the ability of the rent-seeking oligarchic elite to protect their vested interests, allowing the population to reap the benefits of their economic efforts. Opening to trade may therefore restrict the economic power of the elite while democratizing erodes their political power. The starting point of our analysis is the idea that, from a positive perspective, improving institutions in one dimension, but not in the other, may create an unbalanced shift in economic and political power that materializes in vested interests and political resistance to technology adoption. A natural implication of this view is the existence of a complementarity between trade liberalization and democratization for incentives to adopt new technologies. We study a general equilibrium occupational choice framework in which the population is composed of a rentier elite and a majority of workers are endowed with heterogeneous skill levels. The model derives predictions on the impact of a shift to free trade or democracy on the demand for skill-biased technology adoption by different groups. Production takes place in two sectors: one traditional sector using manual labor and natural resources, the rents of which are extracted by the minority elite, and a modern manufacturing sector using skilled labor. Workers with heterogeneous skills optimally relocate between the two sectors with endogenously determined wages. The framework is used to characterize the preferences of the ruling political group regarding technology adoption in each trade and political regime. The theory predicts that, starting from a closed autocracy, the elite may not benefit from the adoption of new technologies in the transition to an open economy, as it reduces the rents they can extract. In turn, a process of democratization in autarky may materialize in vested interests of the newly politically enfranchised because technology adoption may reduce the earnings of the less-skilled portion of the population. Consequently, the model predicts that trade liberalization or democratization alone does not necessarily lead to an increase in the demand for technological improvements. A transition to an open democracy nonetheless leads to an unambiguous increase in the demand for better technologies on the part of all workers (skilled and unskilled) that are assumed to be politically pivotal in democracies. The model therefore predicts the existence of a positive complementarity between the trade and the political regime in creating demand for more productive technologies. The role of the interaction between the trade and political regimes for the adoption of better technologies has not been empirically explored. The theoretical predictions are tested using disaggregate measures of adoption at the level of single technologies using the CHAT database for 83 technologies in 104 countries during the period 1980–2000. As a benchmark, we exploit within-country variation in panel regressions with country and time fixed effects, and add technology or \(\hbox {technology}\,\times \,\hbox {time}\) fixed effects to deal with the highly unbalanced nature of the dataset. The baseline specification therefore investigates the effects of both regime changes separately and jointly by exploiting a difference-in-difference design. The explanatory variables of main interest are the timing of trade liberalization and the timing of democratization. This methodology essentially compares a country that liberalized (or democratized) in a certain year to countries that did not experience institutional changes in that year. The results show that the average (treatment) effect of either trade liberalization or democratization is generally statistically insignificant when exploiting within-country variation over time. Once the empirical specification is extended to the consideration of the predicted non-linear effects, the results reveal a large positive and highly statistically significant interaction between trade liberalization and democratization within countries over time. In particular, countries that undertake both transitions experience significant improvements in productivity and technology adoption. The positive effect of a joint regime transition is persistent over time. The findings therefore reveal that the average effects of trade liberalization or democratization hide relevant heterogeneity and suggest that studying their role in linear regressions frameworks can be misleading. Several concerns have been raised in the literature about the effects of trade liberalization or democratization on macroeconomic outcomes at the country level (see also the discussion of the related literature in Sect. 2). We follow the literature and address the issue of omitted variable bias by restricting attention to within-country variation over time rather than cross-country variation. Period-specific effects (e.g., technological waves), technology-specific effects (differential patterns of adoption in different technologies), and period-technology specific effects (e.g., trends of adoption and dismissal in some specific technologies) are controlled for by including fixed effects on each of these dimensions. Another concern is a potential reverse causality running from aggregate economic conditions (e.g., income growth) to regime changes (trade liberalization or democratization). This concern has been addressed by running event studies analyses that exploit the potential randomness of the timing of the regime changes (rather than the randomness of the regime changes per se) in difference-in-difference designs and/or by exploiting the panel structure of the data. In our application, reverse causality should be less of a concern because the variable of interest is the changes in technology adoption at a highly disaggregated level (and not the change of a dependent variable at the country level, like income level), which also allows us to account for specific period-technology dynamics. As argued in the literature, this limits by construction the likelihood of problems of reverse causality running from technology adoption in each single technology to the timing of regime changes at the country level. Another concern, that can be serious when dealing with macroeconomic (country level) outcomes and trade liberalization or democratization, relates to the existence of time-varying omitted factors that drive both technology adoption and regime changes. The potential role of third factors is, however, less straightforward in the specific application under consideration because a main empirical result of the paper is the existence of heterogeneous effects in non-linear specifications. More specifically, it is not obvious which type of reverse causality, or time-varying third factors, could deliver consistently opposite statistical biases when opening to trade in different political regimes or when democratizing under different trade regimes. To assess the robustness of the results, and to investigate the empirical relevance of some side predictions, we perform an extensive set of checks. The results are robust to controlling for relevant covariates such as income per capita and population, consistently emerge in different samples using annual data and 5-year intervals, and are robust with other (for instance continuous) measures of our independent variables. The results are qualitatively and quantitatively very stable when including initial conditions in each technology (thereby allowing for the convergence effect at the technology level). In addition, we measure technology adoption at the extensive margin to account for the introduction of different technologies in each country at different points of time, which also allows us to account for \(\hbox {technology}\times \hbox {country}\) fixed effects while retaining within-country variation in the timing of adoption. Finally, we show in the Supplementary Material that the findings are not driven by a specific technology sector, and qualitatively hold when using manufacturing value added per worker as an alternative measure of technology adoption, when using leads as counterfactuals, or when restricting attention to countries that change only one regime, thereby iteratively ruling out reverse causality by construction in trade and political transitions.

23,2,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-018-9154-6,Distance to the pre-industrial technological frontier and economic development,Ömer Özak,,,Male,,,Male,"The origins of comparative economic development across the world has been one of the most fundamental research agendas in the social sciences. The literature on the subject has focused on deep determinants such as geographical, institutional, cultural and human characteristics (Diamond 1997; Acemoglu et al. 2001; Guiso et al. 2009; Alesina et al. 2013; Ashraf and Galor 2013; Galor and Özak 2016). In particular, given their adverse effect on trade and technological diffusion, geographical isolation and distances to the technological frontier have been widely viewed as fundamental sources of the prevailing inequality among countries (Smith 1776; Redding and Venables 2004; Feyrer 2009; Spolaore and Wacziarg 2009; Ashraf et al. 2010). This conventional view is based on the fundamental role trade plays in the diffusion of technology and in creating economies of scale in the contemporary era. However, given the limited scope of trade in the pre-industrial era, the conventional channels through which distance could have generated negative effects on productivity, may not have been significant. This research explores the effects of distance to the pre-industrial technological frontiers on comparative economic development in the course of human history. It proposes that during the pre-industrial era, while a country’s remoteness from the frontier diminished imitation, it fostered the emergence of a culture conducive to innovation, knowledge creation and entrepreneurship, which may have persisted into the modern era. The contribution of these cultural values to productivity have counteracted the adverse effect of distance from the frontier via diminished technological diffusion. Thus, the theory proposes that the interaction of these opposing forces resulted in a U-shaped relation between economic development and the distance to the frontier in the pre-industrial era. In line with the predictions of the theory, the analysis establishes both theoretically and empirically that distance to the frontier had a persistent non-monotonic effect on a country’s pre-industrial level of economic development. In particular, advancing a novel measure of the travel time to the technological frontiers, the analysis establishes a robust persistent U-shaped relation between distance to the frontier and pre-industrial economic development across countries. Moreover, it demonstrates that countries, which throughout the last two millennia were relatively more distant from these frontiers, have higher contemporary levels of innovation and entrepreneurial activity, suggesting that distance from the frontier may have fostered the emergence of a culture conducive to innovation, knowledge creation, and entrepreneurship. The proposed theory suggests that variations across countries in distance to the pre-industrial technological frontier generated differences in incentives for technological imitation, adaptation and innovation, which culminated in differences in innovative and entrepreneurial culture. In particular, since during the pre-industrial era, the usefulness and transferability of technologies decreased with the distance from the technological frontier, distant countries benefitted less from imitation and had to tinker and toil more in order to adapt existing technologies to their own environment. Additionally, geographically distant countries also tended to be culturally different from the frontier, which may have facilitated the application of existing technologies to uses not discovered or intended by the original innovators. Finally, for some countries the process of technological diffusion from the frontier may have been too slow or costly, which may have promoted the generation of native innovations. Thus, these forces diminished the usefulness and availability of foreign technology and increased the incentives for native innovation that distant countries faced. While all countries might have been imitating, adapting and innovating, the degree to which each activity was pursued was affected by their geographical location with respect to the frontier. Moreover, as successive generations faced similar incentives, a process of intergenerational learning-by-doing in the creation of knowledge may have reinforced this pattern of specialization, facilitating the emergence of an innovative and entrepreneurial culture. The proposed theory generates several testable predictions regarding the effect of distance to the pre-industrial technological frontier on economic development across countries. First, the theory predicts the existence of a U-shaped relation between the distance to the frontier and economic development across countries in the pre-industrial era. Specifically, the theory suggests that during the pre-industrial era, countries located at intermediate distances from the technological frontier were less developed than countries closer to or more distant from it, making these intermediate distances the Least Desirable Distances from the technological frontier. Second, the theory suggests that increases in a country’s distance to the frontier (e.g., due to a change in the location of the frontier) should have positively impacted its level of economic development, especially among countries that were distant. Third, the theory predicts that the more time a country was farther than countries located at the bottom of the U-shape, i.e., at the More Desirable Distances, the longer it benefitted from its incentives to imitate, adapt and innovate. Thus, the cumulative time a country spent at these distances (across technological frontiers in the pre-industrial era) should be positively associated with its level of development. Finally, the theory suggests that the more time a country was remote from the frontier, the longer it experienced conditions that may have facilitated the emergence of an innovative and entrepreneurial culture. Thus, the cumulative time a country spent at the More Desirable Distances (across technological frontiers in the pre-industrial era) should be positively associated with its innovative and entrepreneurial activities in the contemporary era. To explore these predictions empirically, the research introduces a novel measure of the pre-industrial geographic distance between countries and pre-industrial technological frontiers. For each country, this measure estimates the potential minimum travel time to the pre-industrial technological frontiers, accounting for human biological constraints, as well as geographical and technological factors that determined travel time before the widespread use of steam power. This strategy overcomes the potential mismeasurement of distances generated by using geodesic distances (Özak 2010), for a period when travel time was the most important determinant of transportation costs (O’Rourke and Williamson 2001). Additionally, it removes the potential concern that travel time to the frontier reflects a country’s stage of development, mitigating further possible endogeneity concerns. The research validates these measures by (1) analyzing their association to actual historical travel time; (2) examining their explanatory power for the location of historical trade routes in the Old World; and (3) analyzing their association to genetic and cultural distances. Consistent with the predictions of the theory, the empirical analysis establishes the existence of a robust U-shaped relation between the distance to the technological frontier and pre-industrial economic development across countries. Additionally, it establishes the positive effect of increases in a country’s distance to the frontier (due to changes in the location of frontiers) on pre-industrial economic development across countries. Moreover, the analysis establishes that the length of time a country was relatively more distant from the frontiers is positively associated with its economic development as well as its contemporary domestic patenting and entrepreneurial activities. The analysis establishes these results in various layers: (1) a cross-country analysis of the relation between the distance to the pre-industrial technological frontier and technological sophistication in 1500CE; (2) a cross-country panel-data analysis of the relation between the distance to the pre-industrial technological frontier and population density in the pre-industrial era; (3) a cross-country panel-data analysis of the relation between changes in the distance to the pre-industrial technological frontier and changes in population density in the pre-industrial era; (4) a cross-country panel-data analysis of the cumulative effect of distance from the pre-industrial technological frontier on population density in the pre-industrial era; (5) a cross-country analysis of the relation between the distance to the last pre-industrial technological frontier and contemporary technological sophistication and income per capita; (6) a cross-country analysis of the cumulative effect of distance from the pre-industrial technological frontier on contemporary income per capita; and (7) a cross-country analysis of the cumulative effect of distance from the pre-industrial technological frontier on contemporary patenting and entrepreneurial activities. The analysis accounts for a wide range of potentially confounding geographical factors that might have directly and independently affected a country’s economic development (e.g., elevation, area, malaria burden, share of area in tropical, subtropical or temperate zones, caloric suitability, latitude, island and landlocked regions). Moreover, unobserved geographical, cultural, and historical characteristics at the continental, regional or country level may have codetermined a country’s level of economic development. Hence, the analysis accounts for these unobserved characteristics by accounting for continental, historical region, and when possible country and period fixed effects. Furthermore, it accounts for other time-varying pre-industrial country characteristics (e.g. change in caloric suitability due to the Columbian Exchange, colonial status, lagged technology levels, the onset of the Neolithic Revolution). Additionally, the analysis accounts for period-region fixed effects and thus for unobserved time-varying regional factors. The analysis exploits variations in the location of the pre-industrial technological frontier in order to: (1) mitigate potential concerns relating to omitted country characteristics; (2) analyze the effects of increases in distance to the frontier on a country’s development; and (3) explore the persistent and cumulative effect of distance from the frontier on a country’s development. First, changes in the location of the pre-industrial technological frontier permit the analysis to account for country fixed effects, and thus for omitted time-invariant heterogeneity at the country-level. This allows the analysis to differentiate the effect of distance from the frontier from other unchanging characteristics of a country. Moreover, changes in a country’s distance to the pre-industrial technological frontier across different time periods are potentially less endogenous when exploring their association with differences in development, especially after accounting for period, region and period-region fixed effects. Second, changes in the location of the pre-industrial technological frontier permit the analysis to explore the effects of increasing distance on development across countries. Thus, allowing alternative tests of the theory. Third, changes in the location of the pre-industrial technological frontier generated variations in the length of time countries were relatively remote from the frontiers. These variations permit the exploration of the cumulative and persistent effect of distance from the frontier on economic development across countries. This research is the first attempt to analyze the effects of the geographical distance from the pre-industrial technological frontier on economic development. In doing so, it contributes to various literatures. First, it contributes to the literature on the effects of distance on development (Redding and Venables 2002; Feyrer 2009; Spolaore and Wacziarg 2009; Ashraf et al. 2010; Puga and Trefler 2010). This literature has focused mainly on the effects of distance on contemporary levels of trade and development across countries. An exception is Ashraf et al. (2010), which examined the impact of a country’s prehistoric degree of isolation (i.e., its average isolation level from all locations in a continental mass prior to the advent of seafaring and airborne transportation technologies) on its economic development. Their cross-country analysis finds a positive relation between their measure of prehistoric isolation and population density in the years 1, 1000, 1500CE, and GDP per capita in 2000CE. In contrast, this research explores the effect of distance to the technological frontier during the pre-industrial era (i.e., after the introduction of seafaring technologies) on pre-industrial and contemporary economic development across countries. It is the first to establish the persistent U-shaped relation between distance to the frontier and development. Moreover, it provides evidence for a novel channel through which these pre-industrial distances may have had persistent effects on a country’s development. In particular, it presents novel evidence on the persistent effect of pre-industrial distances on contemporary innovative and entrepreneurial activities. Second, the research contributes to the literature on the determinants of entrepreneurship (Knight 1921; Schumpeter 1934; Hwang and Powell 2005; Guiso et al. 2015), which has stressed the role of personal traits as well as the cultural and institutional environment in the prevalence of an entrepreneurial spirit. In contrast, this paper sheds light on a deep historical determinant of innovative and entrepreneurial activities. Finally, the research sheds additional light on the geographical origins of comparative development (Diamond 1997; Gallup et al. 1999; Ashraf and Galor 2013; Galor and Özak 2016). Specifically, it provides novel evidence of the changing effects of geography in the course of economic development (Andersen et al. 2016) and suggests a novel geographical determinant of cultural and institutional differences and their persistent effect on economic development (Giuliano et al. 2006; Alesina et al. 2013; Galor and Özak 2016). The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents anecdotal evidence supporting the proposed theory. Section 3 rationalizes the theory using an overlapping generations model and establishes the existence of a U-shaped relation between distance and economic development. Section 4 presents the data and the empirical strategy. Section 5 presents the empirical analysis for the pre-industrial era. Section 6 analyzes the persistent effect of distance from the frontier on contemporary economic development. Section 7 concludes. All additional supporting material is presented in the Appendix.",1
23,2,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-017-9153-z,Globalizing labor and the world economy: the role of human capital,Marco Delogu,Frédéric Docquier,Joël Machado,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The debate over the global efficiency implications of immigration barriers has recently been revived in the academic literature. Some economists argue that immigration restrictions induce enormous effects on the worldwide level of income and global inequality. Most of the studies summarized in Clemens (2011) use static models and assume that a complete liberalization would lead to real wage equalization across countries. On average, they predict that at least 50% of the world population would live in a foreign country after a complete liberalization. Eliminating all restrictions to labor mobility would induce huge efficiency gains in the range of 50–150% of world GDP, making it the greatest source of efficiency gains to expect from globalization.Footnote 1
 Other studies highlight the global benefits from easing immigration restrictions. Some investigate the economic impact of abolishing migration barriers, using stylized models with two regions (Iranzo and Peri 2009; Klein and Ventura 2009). Others treat migration as the outcome of a central planning problem (Benhabib and Jovanovic 2012; de la Croix and Docquier 2015) and provide theoretical and numerical predictions, using a stylized representation of the world economy with one developing region and several destination countries. Kennan (2013) develops a model \(\grave{a}\) la Heckscher–Ohlin that accounts for the differences in the labor efficiency and human capital endowments of workers. Free trade implies factor prize equalization in efficiency units (i.e., real wages and labor efficiency differ across countries, but wages per efficiency unit are equalized). Allowing migrants to move to the most efficient location doubles the world average labor productivity (i.e., the labor stock in efficiency units). In the long term, the real wage of a randomly selected individual born in a developing country increases by 112 to 125%.Footnote 2
 In the above-mentioned studies, the gains from removing migration restrictions arise from the differences in total factor productivity across countries and are magnified by the mobility of physical capital, which “chases” labor. Private migration costs are disregarded or modeled in a simple manner (e.g., calibrated using US interstate transportation costs). However, non-visa costs are likely to be instrumental given that the empirical literature on the determinants of migration has long emphasized the role of geographic, linguistic and cultural distances.Footnote 3 For example, psychic and monetary moving costs explain why within-EU migration flows have been limited, despite the large income differences between EU member states and a free mobility agreement, or why large income disparities exist within countries.Footnote 4 A study that estimates the size of “incompressible” moving costs for all country pairs is Docquier et al. (2015). Using data on people’s willingness to emigrate from the Gallup World Poll survey (see Esipova et al. 2011), they identify the worldwide total number of potential migrant workers, i.e., actual plus desiring migrants aged 25 and over, equal to 386 million (and 589.5 million when network effects are considered). They use a calibration strategy to identify total migration costs and visa costs as residuals of the migration technology in a model that jointly endogenizes migration decisions and economic performances. In partial equilibrium or in general equilibrium without technological externalities, they obtain an 11.9% increase in world GDP after a complete liberalization and a semi-elasticity of world GDP to the share of migrants of 1.3.Footnote 5 This semi-elasticity is in line with the existing studies considering the skill differences across people (Iregui 2005; Winters 2001; Walmsley and Winters 2005). Hence, their relatively small efficiency effect is explained by the inclusion of incompressible migration costs and not by the technological features of their model. Most of the literature on the welfare implication of immigration restrictions has adopted a short-run or medium-run perspective, assuming a constant size and skill structure of the world population.Footnote 6 Overall, it concludes that the uncertainty surrounding the size of the gains from globalization is large, because both the migration response to abolishing barriers and the global income gains from allowing workers to move are unclear. In line with Docquier et al. (2015), we find that the short-run effects of immigration barriers are limited. However, we argue here that the long-run effects are larger. The reason is that the existing literature has largely disregarded the interdependence between migration decisions and the evolution of the world population.Footnote 7 To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to jointly incorporate endogenous migration, fertility and education decisions into a dynamic microfounded macroeconomic model of the world economy. The majority of new migrants move from poor to rich countries and this affects their education and fertility decisions. The prospect of migrating also changes the incentives to educate before emigration occurs. This link between emigration prospects and human capital formation has been identified in the macro and micro literatures.Footnote 8
 Furthermore, exposed to a new environment and to different norms at the destination, migrants change their fertility decisions.Footnote 9 Compared to their home country, the policies for basic education in the North (such as mandatory education, generous subsidies, greater quality of education, etc.) make basic education much more accessible for the new migrants’ offspring, which increases the pool of young adults who will be eligible for higher education in the future. Consequently, removing migration barriers reduces population growth and improves the skill structure of the world labor force. In such a context, the implications for the world economy are cumulative and gradual. Our contribution is twofold. First, this paper provides a unified theory of bilateral migration, human capital formation and population growth. Our dynamic framework is an abstract two-class overlapping-generations model (with college graduates and less educated workers) that highlights the major economic mechanisms underlying wage inequality and microfounded decisions about migration, fertility and education. Although the model is large (because 195 countries are included), the mechanisms are transparent. The model has only a few equations per country or country pair and uses consensus microfoundations. It is parameterized to match the recent evolution of the world economy, to fit the demographic projections of the United Nations for the twenty-first century and to match the current numbers of actual migrants (those who have already migrated) and desiring migrants (those who have not yet migrated but express a desire to do so). The availability of bilateral data on actual and desired migration helps us identify total migration costs and visa costs (i.e., policy-induced costs borne by migrants to overcome the legal hurdles set by national authorities in destination and origin countries) as residuals of the migration technology. Second, we quantitatively revisit the short- and long-run effects of a complete removal of migration barriers from 2000 onwards using our dynamic framework. This is an improvement with respect to the existing literature, given that, to date, the feedback effects from migration decisions on fertility and education decisions have been disregarded. Our quantitative analysis reveals that the long-run impact of migration restrictions far exceeds its short-run impact. The reason is that relaxing migration barriers stimulates human capital formation and reduces the world population growth rate. In our benchmark scenario, we follow Docquier et al. (2015) and assume that all desiring migrants identified in the Gallup World Poll would migrate if visa restrictions were abolished. In this context, a complete liberalization of labor mobility increases the proportion of international migrants in the world from 3.5 to 12% in the short run. The world average level of GDP per worker increases by 12% when the shock occurs.Footnote 10 The semi-elasticity of GDP to migration equals 1.4; this value is slightly greater than the level obtained in previous studies because, in our framework, better migration prospects stimulate the expected return to higher education and investments in college education. Moreover, additional migrants from poor to rich countries also face a new institutional environment that favors investments in the basic education of their offspring. This tends to increase the pool of young adults who can access the higher education system. Consequently, the increase in educational attainment and the change in the world distribution of income are gradual and cumulative. By the year 2100, the effects are four times larger than in the short run (\(+\) 52% in the worldwide level of GDP per worker). Hence, our analysis shows that large efficiency gains can be expected from removing migration barriers but these large gains mostly arise in the long run and will impact the welfare of future generations. Part of these gains are due to the so-called  brain gain mechanism, i.e., the effect of emigration prospects on the expected returns to higher education. However, the main portion of these gains is mechanical and due to the increased access to basic education (inducing dynamic effects on population growth and higher education). We also investigate the effects of partial liberalization reforms, i.e., cuts in legal migration restrictions by less than 100% and show that the efficiency and inequality effects are roughly proportional to the “liberalization rate”. We then perform a large set of robustness checks. Overall, our conclusions are very robust to our identifying strategy and to assumptions about the technological environment. The results change only slightly when we deactivate the brain gain mechanism or when we consider alternative specifications for the technologies of production and human capital formation. Sizable differences are obtained only under three variants of the model. On the one hand, more optimistic results emerge when we allow network effects to further increase the stocks of immigrants. On the other hand, more pessimistic results are found when the baseline (pre-liberalization) trajectory of the world economy involves a rapid take-off of developing or emerging countries which reduces the gains from “South–North” migration. Efficiency gains are also lower when our estimated visa costs are adjusted for a possible upward bias due to unrealized migration aspirations. In sum, the global costs of migration restrictions are uncertain, somewhere between 4 and 18% of the world GDP in the short run. However, in the absence of a rapid convergence in income of less developed countries, the long-run effects are always 4 to 5 times greater than the short-run ones. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we describe a microfounded model that links income disparities and decisions about migration, education and fertility. The parameterization of the model is explained in Sect. 3. Our benchmark results are presented in Sect. 4. A large set of extensions and robustness checks are discussed in Sect. 5. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes.",1

Ostry,Yorbol Yakhshilikov,Male,Male,,Male,"Economists are increasingly focusing on the links between rising inequality and sustainable growth. While the empirical literature seems to have converged toward a tentative consensus that inequality is generally harmful for the pace and sustainability of economic growth over the medium run (e.g. Persson and Tabellini 1994; Easterly 2007; Halter et al. 2014), the policy implications are far from clear. The difficulty is easy to see. Inequality may impede growth at least in part because it calls forth efforts to redistribute through the fiscal system that themselves may undermine growth. While the literature on this score remains controversial, the notion of a tradeoff between redistribution and growth seems well-embedded in policy makers’ consciousness. In such a situation, even if inequality is bad for growth, taxes and transfers may be precisely the wrong remedy. The two separate mechanisms—how redistribution affects growth and how inequality affects growth—have been examined empirically.Footnote 1 However the literature almost without exception does not examine the role of both redistribution and inequality in growth in a common empirical framework. One reason for the lack of this joint analysis is that usable cross-country data that distinguish between inequality before and after taxes and transfers (market and net inequality) are very scarce and imperfect. In this paper, we extend the empirical literature in several ways. First, we include both redistribution and inequality as drivers of growth, so that we can identify the direct effects of both inequality and redistribution on growth. This allows us to see whether inequality matters for growth independent of its effects on redistribution. With some additional assumptions, we can also make some inferences about how redistribution may affect growth indirectly, through its effects on inequality. Second, we take advantage of a recently-compiled cross-country dataset (Solt 2009) that carefully distinguishes net from market inequality and allows us to calculate redistributive transfers—defined as the difference between the Gini coefficient for market and for net inequality—for a large number of country-year observations covering both advanced and developing countries. This method of calculating redistribution has two important advantages. First, it focuses on the actual redistributive outcome of fiscal policy. And second, it produces a measure of redistribution in Gini points, facilitating comparison with the inequality measure itself. Third, we analyze both the growth rate over 5 year horizons (panel growth regressions) as well as the duration of growth spells, as defined in Berg et al. (2012), which we think is a more salient way of assessing growth experience, especially for emerging and developing economies. We also look for nonlinearities in the relationships, in order to get at the notion that redistributive policies may be benign or harmful depending on how extensive they are, and the idea that the growth–inequality relation may itself depend on the extent of inequality. And finally, we examine evidence for the key channels linking growth to inequality and redistribution. Our principal findings can be summarized as follows. First, lower net inequality is strongly and robustly correlated with faster and more durable growth, controlling for the effect of redistribution. Second, redistribution appears generally benign in terms of its impact on growth; only when redistribution is very large is there some evidence that it may have direct negative effects on the durability of growth. Third, we find preliminary evidence that inequality’s impact on growth works through lower education and life expectancy, and higher fertility. Our results are consistent across the variety of estimation methods, data samples, and robustness checks that we employ. Our two main approaches (panel growth regressions and spell analysis using duration models) involve different conceptions of the growth process, functional forms, and approaches to identification. These approaches therefore have different advantages and are subject to different flaws. Our results are also consistent with the basic impression provided by the raw data. In sum, they seem unlikely to be due to specific features of the techniques we apply to the data, with all their possible shortcomings. Insofar as there is overlap, our results, including on the main channels, also seem to be consonant with the tenor of the empirical literature. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on growth, inequality and redistribution. Section 3 presents the data and some stylized facts. Section 4 presents the empirical results for the panel growth regressions and Sect. 5 for the growth spell survival analysis. Section 6 assesses the channels of transmission from inequality to growth. Section 7 conducts a variety of robustness tests. Section 8 concludes.",1

The effect that income inequality has on economic growth has recently received also quite a bit of attention in policy circles. To speak to those debates, this paper provides estimates of the relationship between income inequality and GDP per capita for different levels of countries’ initial incomes. Economic theory suggests that inequality affects aggregate output and that the effects differ between rich and poor countries. Galor and Zeira (1993) proposed a model with credit market imperfections and indivisibilities in human capital investment to show that inequality affects aggregate output in the short run as well as in the long run. The Galor and Zeira model predicts that the effect of inequality differs across countries and time depending on initial wealth. Motivated by that theoretical work, we estimate a panel model that includes a measure of income inequality (the income Gini) and an interaction between income inequality and countries’ initial GDP per capita. Estimates of the panel model show that differences in initial incomes have a substantial effect on the relationship between income inequality and economic growth. At an initial income of 1000USD (below which countries are classified according to the World Bank as Low Income Countries) the predicted effect of a 1 percentage point increase in the Gini coefficient on the long-run level of GDP per capita is around 4%. At an initial income of 12000USD (above which countries are classified according to the World Bank as High Income Countries) a 1 percentage point increase in the Gini decreases the long-run level of GDP per capita by around 6%. The estimates from the model thus show that in Low Income Countries income inequality is positively correlated with transitional GDP per capita growth; in High Income Countries income inequality and growth are negatively correlated. According to the instrumental variables estimates, the threshold above which inequality has a negative effect on growth is at an initial income of around 3000USD. The higher the initial income above the 3000USD threshold, the more negative is the effect of inequality on transitional growth and the long-run level of GDP per capita. For the median country in the world, that in the year 2015 had a PPP GDP per capita of around 10000USD, inequality has a significant negative effect on transitional growth: a 1 percentage point increase in the Gini decreases GDP per capita growth over a 5-year period by over 1 percentage point; the long-run effect on the level of GDP per capita is around − 5%. Evidence that our empirical findings are consistent with the Galor and Zeira (1993) model comes from estimates of the relationship between inequality and human capital. Panel model estimates show that the relationship between income inequality and human capital is significantly decreasing in countries’ initial incomes. In poor countries income inequality and human capital are significantly positively correlated. In rich countries the relationship between income inequality and human capital is negative. Identification of the causal effect of income inequality on aggregate output is complicated by the endogeneity of the former variable. Income inequality may be affected by countries’ GDP per capita as well as other variables related to deep-rooted differences in countries’ geography and history. We address this issue by estimating a panel model with country and time fixed effects. We instrument income inequality with the residual variation in income inequality that is not due to GDP per capita. In order to obtain the residual variation in income inequality that is not due to GDP per capita we build on the work of Brueckner et al. (2015). Brueckner et al. (2015) provide estimates of the causal effect that GDP per capita has on the income Gini for a large set of countries. Using the residual variation in income inequality that is not due to GDP per capita as an instrument for inequality means that we use a zero covariance restriction to identify the effect of inequality on GDP per capita in a simultaneous equation model where inequality affects GDP per capita and vice versa.Footnote 1 The zero-covariance restriction generates an instrument for inequality. We document that this instrument has a highly significant first stage effect. In the IV approach identification of a causal effect of inequality on GDP per capita requires that the instrument is uncorrelated with the second-stage error term. If there are time-varying variables that directly affect GDP per capita and income inequality, then an instrumental variables approach that uses the residual variation in inequality that is not due to GDP per capita yields inconsistent estimates. The sign of the bias arising from omitted variables is difficult to pin down. To allay concerns related to omitted variables bias, we document that our IV estimates are robust to controlling for a set of time-varying variables that have been used as controls in the empirical literature on growth and inequality. We also show that overidentification tests fail to reject the hypothesis that the instrument is uncorrelated with the second-stage error term. It may be the case that our IV estimates only reflect a correlation between inequality and GDP per capita and not a causal effect of the former variable on the latter. That correlation is interesting, and a novel contribution to the literature, as it says something about how transitional growth is related to inequality that is not due to variation in countries’ average incomes. Our instrumental variables approach has the objective to ensure that estimates are not biased due to reverse causality running from higher GDP per capita to less inequality as suggested by the model of Galor and Zeira (1993). The IV approach is not suited to provide an estimate of a causal effect of inequality on GDP per capita in a richer model where the distribution of income is driven by social policies, changes in tax policy, changes in trade policy, or changes in immigration policy—all of which may directly affect economic growth and are hard to measure in a cross-country time-series context. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related literature and clarifies the contribution of the paper to the literature. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 explains the estimation framework. Section 5 discusses empirical results. Section 6 concludes.",1
23,4,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-018-9158-2,Population relatedness and cross-country idea flows: evidence from book translations,Andrew Dickens,,,Male,,,Male,"Recent research documents a link between the ancestral relationship of two countries and their current difference in income (Spolaore and Wacziarg 2009). This link is interpreted as reflecting an indirect causal effect: income gaps are smaller between related populations because they are more likely to communicate and adopt similar ideas. By this interpretation the probability of an idea flowing between two countries is the indirect causal link, and this probability is smaller in more distant relationships. At the same time, dissimilarity could theoretically provide incentive for idea flows if a wider spectrum of non-overlapping traits increase the likelihood of two populations having complementary ideas. This notion of a diversity-driven incentive for idea flows suggests a possible counterbalancing force to the lower probability of communication when two countries are ancestrally distant. This idea is similar in spirit to the theory of Ashraf and Galor (2013), who find that the integration of diverse traits enhances productivity and knowledge creation.Footnote 1
 In this paper, I advance the hypothesis that population relatedness confers both social costs and benefits on the cross-country flow of ideas. In particular, I argue that the cost of communication is low between linguistically related populations. Linguistic relatedness thus eases communication and facilitates the flow of ideas. At the same time, the diversity-driven communication incentive is lessened among related populations because shared ancestry implies a similar set of traits and ideas. Genetic relatedness thus reduces the incentive for communication and the spread of new ideas because similar populations have fewer novel ideas to share with each other.Footnote 2
 Here, I use book translation data as a measure of international idea flows, and find that relatedness measured across linguistic and genetic dimensions yield robust empirical evidence in support of this hypothesis. In all instances, linguistic distance is negatively associated with book translations. Although the unconditional relationship between genetic distance and book translations is similarly negative, after conditioning on linguistic and geographic distance the association between genetic distance and book translations becomes positive. I also find that linguistic distance reflects a stronger relationship with book translations than genetic distance in terms of magnitude. Importantly, this difference in magnitude helps reconcile my findings with the argument that related populations are more likely to communicate and adopt similar ideas (Spolaore and Wacziarg 2009), and the empirical evidence that genetic distance to the technological frontier reflects a barrier to the long-run diffusion of ideas (Spolaore and Wacziarg 2014b).Footnote 3 As a summary measure of population relatedness, genetic distance captures many different intergenerationally transmitted traits—notably language (Spolaore and Wacziarg 2016a; Harutyunyan and Özak 2016). Moreover, the genetic distance between two populations is, in part, determined by geographic distance (Ashraf and Galor 2013), which itself is a cost to translation flows (Sin 2017). Unconditional genetic distance negatively correlates with book translations because the costs associated with linguistic and geographic differences supersede the relatively smaller benefits of population differences. Hence the stable and positive relationship between genetic distance and book translations is observable only after separating out the costs associated with linguistic and geographic distance. The main data issue to overcome in the analysis is that the origin country of a book translation is not reported in the data. For the baseline estimates, I use the Ethnologue’s home country classification for each language, but this means that genetic distance is potentially measured with error if a book translated from an origin language was originally published in a country other than the assigned home country. To be certain this assignment rule is not driving the baseline results, I forego the home-country assumption and instead use a country’s share of the global population for each language as a weight to construct a weighted average of every bilateral and country-level covariate used in the baseline, including genetic distance. In effect, these population-weighted covariates reflect a synthetic “language country,” where “language country” characteristics measure the population-weighted characteristics of all countries in which a language is spoken. The main finding that population relatedness confers both social costs and benefits on the flow of book translations is robust to this alternative approach. Using an empirical gravity model of translation flows, I estimate that a one standard deviation increase in linguistic distance yields 12% fewer book translations. This result is highly significant and robust to a range of controls, including per capita income and population, political rights, and numerous covariates measuring bilateral differences in geography and colonial history. For the baseline estimate, I flexibly control for country, time and language fixed effects, and later show that the core linguistic distance result holds even when accounting for unobserved country-pair effects. The stability of the linguistic distance estimate in significance and magnitude shows little evidence of a selection bias driving this baseline result. Similarly, I estimate a significant and robust relationship between book translations and genetic distance. Only now the sign is reversed, where a one standard deviation increase in genetic distance yields an 10% increase in book translations. This result is again robust to a rich set of controls and a variety of robustness checks. It is intuitive that the positive relationship is observed through genealogical differences. By construction, genetic distance reflects the time since two populations shared a common ancestor. Although linguistic distance reflects the time since two populations shared a common language, this does not necessarily capture the same historical relationship. For example, the Magyar invaded Hungary in the ninth century, imposing their Uralic language on the conquered. To this day Hungarians exhibit a gene distribution similar to the rest of Central Europe, but continue to speak a Uralic language unlike the Latin-based languages of their neighbors (Cavalli-Sforza 2000). A similar pattern exists in many regions of the transatlantic slave trade, where colonizers imposed their own language on the colonized with little genetic mixing (Phillipson 1992). Such historical events create a wedge between the co-evolution of language and genetics. In this sense genetic distance is a better summary measure of the time since two populations separated, and thus the extent of dissimilar ideas, beliefs and cultural norms. Figure 1 depicts this argument schematically. Opposing forces of population relatedness on the flow of ideas The principal contribution of this paper is the evidence that population relatedness confers both social costs and benefits on the diffusion of knowledge. In related work, Ashraf and Galor (2013) find that diversity confers both costs and benefits on productivity within a country.Footnote 4 While I am concerned with idea flows and not productivity, the intuition gleaned from Ashraf and Galor (2013) suggests that the interplay between these opposing forces of relatedness also exists between countries. I document empirical evidence of this between-country link, which offers a deeper understanding of Spolaore and Wacziarg’s (2009) proposed mechanism: more distant populations share fewer ideas overall, with the caveat that this negative relationship operates across linguistic and geographic lines. After conditioning on these costs, ideas flow more readily between dissimilar populations. By explicitly measuring historical population differences, this paper also speaks to a larger literature on the deep determinants of development. Spolaore and Wacziarg (2013) review this literature, and provide evidence that linguistic and genetic differences can account for the decline in fertility in Europe (Spolaore and Wacziarg 2014a), create barriers to long-run technology diffusion (Spolaore and Wacziarg 2014b), and the occurrence of war (Spolaore and Wacziarg 2016b). Related to this is evidence that the historical composition of a population is a better predictor of its current income than the historical legacy of the geographic location (Putterman and Weil 2010), that patterns of technology adoption dating back to 1000 BCE persist today and that the effects of past technology on current income is stronger when considering the ancestral composition of a population rather than the population’s current location (Comin et al. 2010). At the heart of this literature is the idea that history matters, and that the degree of relatedness is the mechanism linking historical and contemporary development. The use of book translation data as a measure of idea flows also places this research in proximity to work by Abramitzky and Sin (2014), who document the repressive nature of communist institutions on the inflow of Western books in the Soviet Union prior to its collapse. I account for the institutional environment of a country with a measure of political rights, but find that the coefficient estimates of linguistic and genetic distance are unaltered in significance and magnitude conditional on the extent of political rights. Sin (2017) also finds that geographic distance between countries inhibits the flow of book translations. I also document evidence of this channel, but it holds that the degree of linguistic and genetic distance are contributing factors to the bilateral flow of book translations across countries. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the translation data and details the measurement strategy for each distance measure. I outline the econometric model and report the baseline empirical findings in Sect. 3, and report numerous robustness checks in Sect. 4. Section 5 is the discussion section of the paper, where I elaborate on the benefits of dissimilarity. Section 6 concludes.",1

23,4,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-018-9160-8,Why did rich families increase their fertility? Inequality and marketization of child care,Michael Bar,Moshe Hazan,Hosny Zoabi,Male,Male,Male,Male,"A negative relationship between income and fertility has persisted for so long that its existence is often taken for granted in the literature (Jones and Tertilt 2008). This relationship has been typically explained by either the tradeoff between the quantity and quality of children, the opportunity cost of parental time, or both. Some of the many examples include Becker and Lewis (1973), Galor and Weil (1996), Galor and Weil (2000), and Doepke (2004). These mechanisms have led researchers to conclude that rising inequality would lead to a larger differential fertility between poor and rich households (de la Croix and Doepke 2003; Moav 2005).Footnote 1
 However, despite the dramatic rise in income inequality seen in recent decades, the relationship between income and fertility has flattened as high income families increased their fertility, thereby challenging the conventional wisdom.Footnote 2 We argue that the ability to reduce the parental time burden by purchasing babysitters, housekeepers, and prepared food, lessens children’s opportunity cost. As inequality grows, the cost of marketization (i.e. outsourcing) of the time cost of children for the rich shrinks relative to their income, allowing them to have more kids without sacrificing time and careers. In this paper, we show that changes in inequality, and the associated decline in the price of market substitutes for parents’ time with children, can quantitatively account for much of the changing relationship between income and fertility over time. We explore quantitatively and empirically the implications of our findings for aggregate human capital accumulation and policy (minimum wage). Our point of departure is the standard model of fertility and educational investment in children, as in Galor and Weil (2000), applied to the case of inequality as in de la Croix and Doepke (2003) and Moav (2005). This model features both a quantity–quality tradeoff with respect to children as well as an opportunity cost of parental time in childcare. We analyze this model under the assumption that the cost of children can be marketized. We show that this one assumption is crucial for understanding the effects of inequality on differential fertility. Turning towards our quantitative analysis, we calibrate the model to the US in 1980, when fertility and income had a negative relationship. We discipline the model by matching the salient features of cross-sectional US data. Namely, we match the income profiles of fertility rates, mother’s labor supply, marketization expenditures, and college attainment rates.Footnote 3 The model successfully fits the empirical targets with 8 parameters chosen to match 40 moments. We then feed into the calibrated model the observed cross-sectional wages for 2010 and a price decline of home production substitutes. The model predicts the 2010 relationships between income and fertility and between income and mother’s time at home. In the model (data), the fertility of couples with income in the top two deciles increases by 43.5% (39.9%) between 1980 and 2010. Our measure of differential fertility, which compares the average fertility of the top two deciles to that of the second decile, increases by 41.2% (38.5%). An alternative measure of differential fertility, comparing the fertility of the top half and bottom half of the income distribution, increases by 24.4% (18.6%). All of these results are untargeted. Decomposing the mechanisms at work, we find that it is the change in the price of market substitutes relative to parental income, rather than the general income effect, that is the main driver behind our findings. Furthermore, this result depends critically on increasing inequality in parental wages. Our results imply that a naïve modeler, working in 1980 under the view of the standard literature, which ignores marketization, would have predicted a significant decline in fertility among high income households over time if she had been given perfect foresight over the evolution of income distributions. One implication of our theory is that rising inequality increases aggregate human capital, and thus growth. This is due to the fact that the rich tend to provide more human capital to their children, as represented by college graduation rates. Thus, as inequality increases, the average human capital of the next generation grows as relatively more kids are born to richer families. Turning towards policy implications, according to our theory, anything affecting the price of marketization should have an indirect effect on the labor supply and fertility, especially of high income women. One prevalent policy that may affect the price of marketization is the minimum wage. We show empirically that the minimum wage level indeed has a large pass-through effect on wages in the home production substitute (HPS) sector.Footnote 4 Evaluating this effect in the context of the calibrated model allows us to quantify the impact of minimum wage laws on fertility and labor supply of high income women. This analysis is presented in Sect. 5. Accordingly, we show that a disproportionately large number of workers in the HPS sector receive the minimum wage. Using cross-state time series variation in the minimum wage from 1980 to 2010, we show that the minimum wage has a statistically significant and economically meaningful effect of about 58 cents increase in HPS sector wages for every dollar increase of the state minimum wage. We take an instrumental variables approach, as in Baskaya and Rubinstein (2012), as OLS may be biased as states tend to raise the minimum wage during good economic times. We employ this estimated effect to perform a policy experiment, using the model to measure the effects of raising the minimum wage to $15/h, as per Bernie Sanders, on the labor supply and fertility of high income women.Footnote 5 These women reduce their labor supply and fertility as marketizing becomes more expensive.Footnote 6 We confirm the model prediction with respect to labor supply by estimating the empirical elasticity of the labor supply of high income women with respect to the minimum wage. We do so using cross-state time series variation in the minimum wage from 1980 to 2010 and the instrumental variable approach discussed above. The empirical elasticity is also negative, but quantitatively larger in absolute value than that of the model. We conclude by discussing that explicit modeling of outsourcing of home production can also help us understand additional aspects of marital sorting (Greenwood et al. 2017). 
Hazan and Zoabi (2015) was the first paper to document the flattening of the fertility profile by mother’s education, due to rising fertility rates among highly educated women. They qualitatively study a similar model to the one presented here to show theoretically the role of marketization. Furthermore, they exploit cross-state variation in wages and find that the wages of childcare workers, relative to mothers’ wages, are negatively correlated with the propensity to have an extra child. This reduced-form evidence supports the quantitative analysis done in this paper. However, we differ in several critical ways. First, we document the flattening of the fertility-income profile. Second, we quantitatively evaluate the role of rising wage inequality and decreasing prices of home production substitutes, through the mechanism of marketization, in explaining this pattern. Finally, we examine theoretically and quantitatively the implications of inequality and marketization for human capital accumulation and minimum wage policy. This paper is related to a large literature on motherhood and labor supply. Attanasio et al. (2008) builds a life cycle model of fertility and labor force participation. They argue that reductions in child care costs can quantitatively account for the increase in labor supply of young mothers. Furtado (2016) finds that an increase in unskilled migration lowers wages in the child care services sector, and increases both fertility and labor supply.Footnote 7 Interestingly, she finds that native women with a graduate degree increase their labor supply and fertility much more than native women with just a college degree. Similarly, Cortés and Tessada (2011) exploit cross-city variation in immigration concentration, and show that an increase in low-skilled immigration increases labor supply, of women in the top quartile of the wage distribution.Footnote 8 These women reduce time spent on housework and purchase more services as substitutes. Interestingly, Cortés and Pan (Forthcoming) show that increased marketization of household work allows women both to enter occupations that demand high levels of effort, and lowers the earnings gap in those occupations. While the importance of marketization of home production has been widely recognized (e.g. Greenwood et al. 2005a, b), the consequences of rising inequality on differential fertility in the presence of the possibility to outsource home production have not been widely studied.Footnote 9
 We continue as follows. Section 2 presents our motivating evidence. Section 3 describes the theoretical framework of our analysis. Section 4 provides details on the parameterization of the model, along with quantitative results.

Nominal exchange rate appreciation and rent seeking can have adverse effects, as can volatility of revenues, but the large fiscal windfall associated with resource revenue can also foster development. Even when we abstract from nominal exchange rate movements and the impact of oil rents, the pure effect of the physical presence of a natural resource sector might drive up local prices—and therefore crowd out the development of other economic activities, bringing about negative effects on growth. On the other hand, the natural resource sector might also increase demand for workers and attract new activities, which can lead to agglomeration effects, with a positive impact on productivity and income. This paper uses the quasi-experiment generated by the random outcomes of exploratory oil drilling in Brazil in order to investigate the causal effect of natural resource discoveries on local development.Footnote 1 Specifically, we compare economic outcomes in municipalities where the national oil company, Petrobras, drilled for oil but did not find any, to outcomes in those municipalities in which it drilled for oil and was successful.Footnote 2 Drilling attempts were carried out in many locations with similar geological characteristics, but oil was found in only a few places. The “treatment assignment” is related to the success of drilling attempts: Places where oil was found were assigned to treatment, while places with no oil are part of the control group. The treatment assignment resembles a “randomization”, since (conditional on drilling taking place) a discovery depends mainly on luck. Therefore, places with oil discoveries are the “winners” of the “geological lottery.” Since there were no significant royalty payments to municipalities in Brazil until several decades after the first discoveries, we are able to focus on the direct impact of oil extraction rather than the effect of fiscal windfalls. Our analysis uses novel data on the drilling of approximately 20,000 oil wells in Brazil from 1940 to 2000. The dataset covers the universe of wells drilled since exploration began in the country and provides information on three stages regarding oil extraction and production: drilling, discovery, and upstream production. We use this detailed information to distinguish those municipalities which were assigned to treatment from those which constitute the control group. Since we view oil production as the treatment, and its discovery as the assignment to treatment, our focus is on an Intent-to-Treat (ITT) analysis, where we regress our outcome variables of interest directly on discoveries.Footnote 3 Discoveries take place in different locations over time, so we can exploit time and cross-sectional variations. The ITT analysis enables us to obtain a lower bound on the average treatment effect. We also estimate a Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) by instrumenting for production with discoveries.Footnote 4 The baseline results show that locations in which oil was discovered had a roughly 30% higher per capita GDP over a span of up to 60 years compared to those in the control group. Furthermore, we document an increase in both manufacturing and services per capita GDP but no impact on agricultural GDP. While the measure of manufacturing GDP includes natural resource extraction (and as such an increase is not surprising), the increase in services indicates spillover effects of oil production impacting the rest of the economy. Using historical data on employment shares by sector, we corroborate the GDP results by showing that the fraction of workers in the services sector increases significantly following oil discoveries. Additionally, we find evidence for an increase in urbanization of about 4% points. This increase in urbanization is consistent with the increase in services we document. We do not find any effect on population density or total worker density. Distinguishing between onshore and offshore discoveries, we find that the results are entirely driven by onshore discoveries. We hypothesize that is because only onshore production (but not offshore) causes a local demand shock associated with the physical presence of the oil company and well paid oil workers. We find no detectable spillovers to neighboring municipality which we explain (jointly with the lack of impact on population density) by low inter-regional labor mobility. In order to shed more light on the results, we look at recent microdata from the Brazilian employment and population censuses. We find that municipalities in which oil was discovered have larger services firms, a higher density of formal services workers, and a lower fraction of workers employed in the subsistence agricultural sector than the control group. Informality falls as a consequence of oil discoveries. The move from informal, low productivity rural work to the formal services sector explains the observed increase in urbanization and services GDP per capita. Lastly, the density of non-oil manufacturing firms and workers is not affected by oil discoveries. The initial conditions of the local economies we study (large subsistence agriculture sector with very low productivity, small or non-existent manufacturing base) are likely to be crucial for the results we obtain. The impact of oil on manufacturing depends on the scale and specialization of the sector as well as the interplay between agglomeration effects and the crowding out effect from the resource boom (Allcott and Keniston 2018). In our setting of a developing country with little non-oil manufacturing in the affected areas, the presence of oil had no effect on manufacturing, but a strong effect on urban services and precipitated a decrease in the highly unproductive subsistence agriculture sector. Out of the large theoretical literature which tries to explain how natural resource abundance might affect economic outcomes (e.g., Corden and Neary 1982 and Krugman 1987), the framework proposed by Gollin et al. (2016) is most closely related to our results. In line with what we find, they illustrate how natural resource production can lead to urbanization as labor moves from rural food production to urban non-tradables. Our results are robust to a variety of control groups, different control variables, and different sample periods. We show that municipalities with oil discoveries have a higher probability of hosting major downstream oil facilities than the control group. To check whether our results are driven by these downstream facilities, we re-run the regressions excluding those municipalities which host them and find that this is not the case. Since oil is one of the world’s biggest industries and it is at the center of the production network in many countries, its impact on the economy has been studied extensively. The usual approach to understanding the effects of oil relies on cross-country evidence. Several papers have shown correlations between natural resources and adverse outcomes (Sachs and Warner 2001). However, cross-country evidence is sensitive to changing periods, sample sizes, and covariates (for an overview of the literature, see van der Ploeg 2011). Cotet and Tsui (2013b) for instance exploit cross-country variation in the size of oil endowments to show that oil does not hinder economic growth and is positively associated with health improvements. One important strand of the literature has been shifting attention to a more detailed analysis to pin down specific mechanisms of how natural resources impact the economy. Notable papers in this emergent literature are, among others, Michaels (2011), Monteiro and Ferraz (2012), Caselli and Michaels (2013), and Allcott and Keniston (2018). Caselli and Michaels (2013) study the effects of oil windfalls in offshore oil producing municipalities in Brazil and find little improvement in the provision of public goods or the population’s living standards.Footnote 5 Our results complement theirs given that they (i) focus on the period when royalties became an important revenue for local governments in Brazil while we focus on the period before that distribution of royalties and (ii) they look at offshore production only while we find the positive demand shock impact is driven by onshore discoveries. The main empirical challenge is to deal with the endogeneity of natural resource extraction, since many unobservable factors which affect economic development might be correlated with oil production and oil discoveries. Cust and Harding (2014), for example, show the important role institutions have in influencing the location of exploratory oil drilling. Since we exploit the randomness of oil discoveries conditional on exploration, Cotet and Tsui (2013a) is the closest in spirit to our identification assumption. In a cross-country sample of oil-producing countries, they exploit the randomness in the size of discoveries to investigate the impact of oil reserves on conflicts. Our paper stands out from the existing literature in at least three important respects: Firstly, our identification strategy of comparing areas with oil drilling and discoveries to those with drilling but no discoveries allows us to estimate the impact of oil discoveries on local development using a (quasi-experimental) difference-in-difference approach. Secondly, we examine the entire history of oil exploration in an oil-producing country, while attention has mostly been limited to post-discovery periods. Lastly, the use of worker-level data makes it possible for us to look in more detail at the exact mechanism through which oil discoveries impact local economic development in a developing country.Footnote 6 It is important to stress that we cannot comment on the aggregate impact of oil discoveries on the country as a whole. Compared to national economies, municipalities are much more open and face macroeconomic policies which are invariant to their idiosyncratic conditions. By construction, our research design rules out any effect which operates through the nominal exchange rate. This article proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the data we use, while Sect. 3 presents the empirical model. In Sect. 4 we describe the quasi-experiment which we exploit in detail, including a description of the institutional environment in Brazil and a short background on the technicalities of drilling for oil. Sect. 5 presents the results. Sect. 6 concludes.",1

Some contributions argue that values and beliefs are deeply rooted in the country or ethnic group to which a person belongs—being related for example to history or geography —and evolve slowly over time.Footnote 1 Others, instead, suggest that cultural attitudes can change rather quickly in response to changes in economic incentives and opportunities, in technology and in institutions.Footnote 2 Both views of culture (slow versus fast moving) have truth in them, in the sense that while some cultural traits certainly go back to the distant past and affect today’s economic and institutional outcomes, it is also true that many values and beliefs evolve in response to changes in technology, economic environment, and in political institutions. An important distinction in understanding the process through which a person’s values and beliefs are formed is that between “vertical” and “horizontal” transmission. Inside the family, parents shape their children’s preferences, balancing the desire to share common values with them with the concern for teaching traits that will make it easier for their children to function in the social environment in which they will live: this is vertical transmission. But children are also exposed to the world outside the family and thus are subject to a process of social imitation and learning external to the family: this is horizontal transmission.Footnote 3 Two different channels of cultural transmission are thus at work, as in models of evolutionary biology.Footnote 4 Vertical transmission, like genetic inheritance, tends to be relatively more conservative if parents main concern is to socialize children to their own values, giving rise to slow evolution of culture; horizontal transmission, as in an epidemic, may result in a rapid change in the number of people who adopt a new cultural characteristic, particularly if it is attractive to the receiver. This can happen, not in historic time, but in the space of few generations. In this paper we investigate the speed of evolution of a wide range of cultural attitudes for different generations of immigrants to the United States. This is an important issue per se and it is of increasing relevance in the context of current debates on assimilation and immigration policies. Moreover, immigrants provide a useful laboratory for the study of the evolution (or lack thereof) of values and beliefs as a result of vertical and horizontal transmission because their cultural attitudes are likely to bear the mark of the country from which they, their parents or their grandparents emigrated, as early generations of immigrants may want their children to share some of the values that they, or their own parents, brought with them from their country of origin.Footnote 5 However, some of these inherited values may be at odds with the culture of the new country in which they are living, possibly hindering productive exchange with other group, and may be modified as a result of the exposure to US society and its social, political, and economic institutions, often very different from those of the country of origin. Immigrants and their descendents thus provide an interesting quasi-experiment for the effect on inherited cultural attitudes of a change in the economic and social environment. The conditions under which this leads to integration of immigrants or to the emergence of immigration clusters in which separate cultural traits persist has been debated in the theoretical and empirical literature.Footnote 6 We look at a variety of attitudes, rather than a single one because we surmise there could be substantial heterogeneity across cultural traits (and immigrants’ origins as well) in the speed with which attitudes evolve across generations. We study the transmission of attitudes through four generations (a century) because it is possible that some attitudes may appear to be quite persistent within a couple of generations but change significantly by the fourth generation. We use data from the General Social Survey (GSS) to analyze the evolution of cultural attitudes of US immigrants about religion, family, gender, sexuality, cooperation, redistribution, etc., distinguishing between first, second, third and fourth (or higher) generations of British, Irish, German, Italian, Polish , Scandinavian and Mexican immigrants to the United States. The focus on these groups is largely imposed on us by the availability of sufficient data for multiple generations distinguished by country of origin. We use the data contained in approximately 21 waves (the exact number varies across attitudes) of the GSS survey collected between the end of the 1970’s and 2014. Although the GSS is far from being perfect, it is the only data source that allows a systematic investigation of the evolution of cultural values for multiple generations, multiple countries of origin and multiple traits. In order to provide some structure in discussing the results, we develop a simple model of socialization and identity choice. The model builds on the contributions by Bisin and Verdier (2001) on parents’s socialization choices, and on Lazear (1999) and Konya (2005) for a child’s choice of her cultural identity. Parents derive utility form the child retaining their original cultural traits, but also consider the possibility that this may hinder the child’s ability to interact productively with the majority. The child plays an active role in the model and chooses her identity weighing the expected transaction gains from assimilation and a switching cost that partly depends upon the parents’ socialization effort, and which also contains a component that is randomly distributed across the population. Parents choose the optimal level of socialization taking into account the child’s optimization problem, knowing the distribution of the switching cost, but not the particular realization for their child. Insofar as in our set up parents also care about the ability of their children to interact productively with others, our model is also related to Doepke and Zilibotti (2008) who see “vertical transmission” as an active process of socialization where parents attempt to endow their children with values that they think will lead to success. Our model captures this through a parameter that describes how much a parent cares about the child’s future well being. Our model yields two possible equilibria: one with complete assimilation and another with the minority group not assimilating. The occurrence or not of assimilation, and its speed when it happens, depend upon a set of parameters that are likely to vary across different cultural traits and across different countries of origin, such as the child’s net transaction gains and the switching costs from assimilating, the utility benefit to the parents from the child maintaining the original trait, together with the costs of the socialization effort, and, finally, the discount factor parents apply to the child’s utility. A contribution of our model is the result that there can be equilibria characterized by no assimilation even without imposing the “cultural substitutability property” of Bisin and Verdier (2001), whereby a minority parent makes a greater effort at socialization when the initial size of the minority is small. In studying how a person’s values and beliefs are formed and transmitted from one generation to the next, and whether or not they converge, we face a number of empirical challenges. First and foremost, immigrants, even from the same country of origin, differ, depending on when the first generation of the “dynasty” they belong to arrived in the US. Irish immigrants who arrived in the 1890s, for example, are clearly different, in terms of the values they brought with them, from post World War II first generation Irish immigrants. One has to account for this in the empirical work, in order to separate convergence of values across generations of immigrants from convergence of values over time across countries of origin. We address this problem studying the transmission of values and beliefs within a single “synthetic” dynasty, specifically the one that starts with first generation immigrants born at the end of the 19th century/beginning of the 20th century. We then follow the cohort of the children of this first generation (assumed to be the second generation immigrants born 25 years later), the cohorts of their grand children and of their grand-grand children. We discuss in detail how we estimate the cultural attitudes of the various cohorts of our synthetic dynasty in Sect. 3.2. A second empirical challenge is that, once one allows for a general model which includes generation effects that vary across cohorts for each country, one is left with relatively small cell sizes for the first generation, particularly for some countries. We will address this problem at the end of the same section, yet one must recognize that the GSS is the only data set containing information on a range of cultural attitudes for several countries of origin and multiple generations of immigrants within a dynasty.Footnote 7 We are certainly not the first ones to analyze these issues.Footnote 8 However, most existing contributions focus on the persistence of cultural traits for second generation immigrants and on their effect on economic and social outcomes. For instance, Giuliano (2007) presents evidence that cultural heritage is important for living arrangements, Fernandez (2007) for female labor force participation, and Fernandez and Fogli (2009) for female labor force participation and fertility outcomes, all using US census data. Fernandez and Fogli (2006), using the GSS, finds results that are also supportive of an effect of the culture of the country of ancestry on fertility outcomes for US immigrants, although no distinction is made between second and higher generation immigrants. Guiso et al. (2006), using the GSS, find evidence suggesting that the trust of US immigrants (not distinguished according to the generation they belong to) strongly depends upon the country of origin. Exceptions, in the sense that they use generations beyond the second, are Antecol (2000) – who finds that culture matters for the gender gap in labor force participation, for both the first, second and higher generations of US immigrants, although less for the latter – and Borjas (1992) who shows that ethnic capital (measured as average ethnic-specific education, professional achievement or wages) has a greater effect on children’s education, occupation and wages for both the second and the third generation, although the effect tends to be higher for the second. Algan and Cahuc (2010) show that inherited trust of descendants of immigrants in the US is significantly associated with the level of trust in the country of origin. This results holds even if one limits the analysis to fourth generation immigrants.Footnote 9 The paper has three main findings. Our first result is that time since the original immigration of the ancestors matters: results obtained studying higher generation immigrants differ from those obtained limiting the analysis to the second generation. Thus, finding that the attitudes of second generation immigrants have not converged yet and still closely reflect those of the country of origin, does not imply per se that attitudes are very persistent. For instance, we find that the beliefs that shape trust of second generation immigrants towards other members of society remain different from the prevailing US norm and still bear strongly the mark of the country of origin. However, such differences become smaller when one considers fourth or higher-generation immigrants. Second, we provide evidence of heterogeneity across cultural traits in the speed with which they evolve across generations and the degree to which converge to the prevailing norm. We find, for instance, that attitudes towards cooperation (the trustworthiness, helpfulness and fairness of others) display the highest degree of convergence by the fourth generation, as successive generations adapt to the norms of the new society in which they live. Attitudes towards politics and the role of government, sexual morality and abortion exhibit the lowest degree of convergence, followed by religious attitudes. Attitudes towards gender roles occupy an intermediate position, with attitudes towards the role of women in the labor market converging faster than those related to the role of women in politics. Family attitudes also display on average an intermediate level of convergence, but there is substantial heterogeneity among them. Many of these results are largely consistent with one prediction of our simple model: faster convergence is observed for attitudes that are likely to generate larger transaction gains from assimilation, such as attitudes towards cooperation. Convergence is also slower for attitudes for which the utility gain to the parents from the child retaining the original trait (or the cost for the child to abandon them) is likely to be higher, such as some moral and religious values and political orientation. Third, we find that persistence is country specific in the sense that the country from which one’s ancestors came from matters in defining the pattern of integration (or lack thereof) with respect to the entire set of cultural traits. Moreover, the strength of the family in each country of ancestry, the degree of difficulty in learning English, and the extent of residential segregation are (negatively) correlated with the fraction of convergent attitudes. These results too could be interpreted in the light of our model: switching costs, for instance, are likely to be related to language proximity and to the strength of family ties. However, given the small number of countries in our sample, this results must be taken with a grain of salt. The plan of the paper is as follows. In Sect. 2 we illustrate a simple model of parents’ socialization and children’s identity choice. In Sect. 3.1 we discuss how we measure cultural attitudes in the GSS, how we define generations and ethnic origin and which countries (or groups of countries) we use in our analysis. In Sect. 3.2 we describe how we recover the country of origin effect for different generations, dynasties and time periods, while in Sect. 3.3 we illustrate our measure of cultural “convergence”. In Sect. 4 we present and discuss our main empirical results. Section 5 contains several robustness checks and extensions. Section 6 concludes.",1
24,2,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-019-09165-3,Which tail matters? Inequality and growth in Brazil,Stephan Litschig,María Lombardi,,Male,,,Male,"A series of seminal theory papers propose different channels through which a society’s degree of initial economic inequality might impact subsequent income per capita growth. These channels include aggregate savings and investment (Bourguignon 1981), human and physical capital accumulation (Galor and Zeira 1993; Banerjee and Newman 1993; Aghion and Bolton 1997; Galor and Moav 2004), and income redistribution and social unrest (Persson and Tabellini 1994; Alesina and Rodrik 1994; Benabou 1996; Esteban and Ray 2000; Campante and Ferreira 2007). Existing cross- and within-country studies on the relationship between inequality and growth have produced effect estimates ranging from negative to zero and positive as further discussed below. While research design and data limitations may account for some of this variability, it is also possible that the effect of inequality on growth is genuinely heterogeneous. Indeed some of the mechanisms above have different implications for the effect of income inequality on growth, depending on whether the middle class is richer at the expense of the poor or the rich are richer at the expense of the middle class. Yet with the exception of Voitchovsky (2005), empirical work has ignored this issue. This paper investigates whether inequality originating from the lower as opposed to the upper tail of the income distribution has different effects on subsequent income per capita growth. Greater inequality as measured by commonly used metrics (e.g. the Gini coefficient) can result from higher dispersion in different parts of the income distribution, as illustrated in Fig. 1. In Panel A, a theoretical redistribution of income from the bottom to the middle quintile (i.e., the transition from the Lorenz curve displayed in the solid line to that of the dashed line) implies higher overall income inequality as captured by the Gini coefficient. However, the exact same increase in overall inequality can be achieved by redistributing a portion of total income from the middle to the top quintile, as shown in Panel B. Most existing empirical work does not distinguish whether inequality originates from the lower or upper tails of the distribution, even though growth theory suggests that impacts on subsequent growth may well differ. For example, in the presence of credit constraints and setup costs for human (Galor and Zeira 1993) or physical capital investments (Banerjee and Newman 1993), it is conceivable that only inequality in one of the tails matters for growth. Gini coefficient and inequality at the top and bottom of the income distribution. Notes: The solid lines display the Lorenz curve of an AMC with average quintile shares in 1970. Áreas Míınimas Comparáveis (AMCs) are roughly equivalent to Brazil’s municipalities in 1970. In Panel A, the dashed line shows the Lorenz curve of another AMC where the share of income held by the third quintile is 1 standard deviation (3 percentage points) higher, at the expense of the first quintile, holding the other quintile shares constant. In Panel B, the dashed line shows the Lorenz curve of yet another AMC where the share of income held by the fifth quintile is 1 standard deviation (3 percentage points) higher, at the expense of the middle quintile, again holding the other quintile shares constant Consider a stylized economy with three groups of equal size (the poor, the middle class, and the rich) and the same income within each group. Now assume that the incomes of the poor and the middle class are initially too low to overcome the setup costs for investing in either human or physical capital. Put differently, both the poor and the middle class cannot borrow enough to make the relatively large investments that would be required to make a profit. Now consider another economy with the same income per capita but with higher inequality at the bottom, i.e. the middle class is richer while the poor are poorer. In this second economy, the middle class might be rich enough to overcome the setup costs and make profitable investments in human and physical capital, thus making the second economy richer than the first economy in the long run. Finally consider a third economy, again with identical income per capita but higher inequality at the top, i.e. the rich are richer at the expense of the middle class. Since human and physical capital investments are as constrained as in the more equal first economy, investment and growth will be similarly limited. Using sub-national data from Brazil over the 1970–2000 period, we first establish that holding initial income per capita and a host of standard confounders constant, places with higher initial income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient exhibit higher subsequent income per capita growth. Most of the effect materializes by 1991, i.e. there is only a level effect, not permanently higher growth. We then propose a simple approach to distinguish between the growth effects of inequality originating from the bottom versus the top of the initial income distribution. The key idea is to include quintile income shares instead of the Gini coefficient in an otherwise standard cross-sectional growth regression. This allows for hypothetical income redistributions from the two tails towards the (omitted) middle quintile while holding other income shares and mean income constant. We find that the positive effect of overall inequality on subsequent growth is entirely driven by inequality in the lower tail of the income distribution: compared to more equal places, sub-national units with a 3 percentage points (one standard deviation) higher share of 1970 income going to the middle quintile at the expense of the bottom quintile experience about 3 percent higher income per capita by 2000. In contrast, places with a higher share of income going to the top quintile at the expense of the middle quintile get no growth boost at all compared to more equal places. The differential effects of bottom versus top inequality are remarkably in line with our evidence on human and physical capital accumulation. We find that places with a higher share of income held by the middle quintile at the expense of the bottom quintile experience higher subsequent growth in both the number of business establishments and the value of their capital stocks. On the other hand, a higher share of income held by the top quintile at the expense of the middle quintile is not associated with increased physical capital accumulation. We also find that places with higher bottom inequality have a higher share of entrepreneurs (employers or self-employed) at the outset of our sample period compared to more equal places, while places with higher inequality at the top have slightly fewer entrepreneurs. Similarly, a higher share of the population attains more than a primary school education in places with higher inequality in the lower tail of the initial income distribution compared to places where the bottom quintile is richer. Inequality at the top of the distribution on the other hand is uncorrelated with subsequent human capital growth. Overall, these results suggest that in Brazil in the 1970s, income inequality at the bottom mattered for investment and growth, while inequality at the top did not. The most plausible explanation for this pattern of results is the presence of credit constraints. Opportunities for investment were rather limited for households at the bottom of the wealth distribution in 1970, since access to credit was not widespread. For example, only 12% of agricultural establishments received credit in 1970, and only 5% of households in the 1970 census had a mortgage. Moreover, the result that bottom inequality has a positive effect on growth and investment also points to the importance of investment indivisibilities. Credit constraints alone would lead to the opposite prediction that places where the middle class is richer at the expense of the poor should exhibit lower quantity and average profitability of investment compared to more equal places (Galor and Zeira 1993). In order to further test the credit constraints cum setup costs mechanism, we split the sample by the average income of the middle quintile in 1970. Since investment indivisibilities matter in relation to the distribution of absolute income, we would expect effects to be concentrated in only a subset of our sample. Our results suggest indeed that the entire effect of lower-tail inequality on growth comes from the group with the poorest middle quintiles in 1970. Another potential mechanism leading to differential effects of top versus bottom inequality is aggregate savings. Since the propensity to save is increasing and perhaps convex in income (Dynan et al. 2004; Gandelman 2017), higher inequality at the bottom might increase aggregate savings only little, while higher inequality at the top might increase available savings substantially. The savings channel would actually suggest that inequality at the top should matter more than inequality at the bottom, which is the opposite of what we find. Increased savings only leads to increased investment in at least partially closed economies, however, and data for Brazil from the end of our sample period suggest that capital was already highly mobile across municipalities at that time (Bustos et al. 2017). According to available evidence, the differential growth effects we find are therefore unlikely to be attributable to differential aggregate savings. Other channels, such as redistributive policies carried out at the local level, may have been at work. However, we are not aware of any theory leading to the differential growth effects we find and we lack data to investigate potential political economy mechanisms further. Our paper builds on an extensive empirical literature linking overall income inequality and subsequent income per capita growth surveyed in Galor (2011). While the studies to date are largely inconclusive, a recent study by Brueckner and Lederman (2018) finds evidence consistent with theories on credit constraints and setup costs. Using an instrumental variable approach with country fixed effects, they show that the correlation between the Gini coefficient and subsequent income and human capital growth is positive in poor countries and negative in rich countries. Another recent study by Berg et al. (2018) finds that higher inequality reduces growth through reduced education and increased fertility. The study which is most closely related to ours is Voitchovsky (2005), which uses the 90/75 income percentile ratio as a proxy for inequality at the top of the income distribution, and the 50/10 income percentile ratio to proxy inequality at the bottom. For a sample of 21 developed countries, the study shows that under some specifications, inequality at the bottom is negatively correlated with growth, and inequality at the top has a positive correlation. The main conceptual difficulty with the Voitchovsky (2005) study is that the regression specifications typically include percentile ratios along with the Gini coefficient in the same equation. But a higher 90/75 income percentile ratio while keeping the Gini coefficient constant necessarily implies that inequality must be lower in other parts of the distribution. As a result, it is not clear what the coefficient on the 90/75 income percentile ratio is picking up. A similar issue arises in Ravallion (2012), which explores the impact of various parameters of the initial income distribution on income per capita growth and poverty reduction in a large sample of developing countries. The regression specification sometimes includes the initial poverty rate along with the Gini coefficient in the same equation. But holding initial income per capita constant, countries with a higher poverty rate are also those with higher overall inequality, as discussed in that study. Moreover, holding both average income and overall inequality constant implies that countries with a higher poverty rate must have less inequality somewhere else in the distribution, which further complicates the interpretation of the coefficients. The main contribution of our study is its conceptually straightforward approach to analyze the relationship between left- and right-tail inequality and subsequent outcomes. By replacing the Gini coefficient with the quintile income shares as our main regressors, we exploit variation in inequality originating from either tail while keeping initial average income and the other income shares constant. As illustrated in panels A and B of Fig. 1, we exploit quantitatively identical differences in income inequality arising from opposite sides of the income distribution. This implies that the differential effects of bottom versus top inequality we find are not driven by treating inequality in the two tails differently. And because our regressions hold income per capita constant, places with a lower share of income going to the poor and a higher share going to the middle class are places where the poor are poorer and the middle class is richer not only in relative but also in absolute terms. This is important because the credit market imperfections cum setup cost theory is based on absolute income levels. Another advantage of our setting is that we draw on homogeneously collected census data from a single country. Thus, unlike existing cross-country studies, we do not face a tradeoff between data quality and sample size, and our results are less prone to measurement error bias. Ours is also the first study to look at the effects of bottom versus top income inequality in a developing country context. An additional advantage of our setting is that by comparing sub-national units within the same country and state, we can abstract from differences in institutions at the federal and state level which might be correlated with initial inequality and income growth. Last but not least, our study also provides the first direct evidence on physical capital accumulation linking initial income distribution to subsequent economic growth. A potential drawback compared to cross-country studies is that our results could be driven by migration. For example, places with high initial inequality at the bottom may experience higher emigration of the poor and thus higher income per capita in future periods among remaining residents. It turns out, however, that the effect of initial income inequality on immigration or emigration is close to negligible in practice as further discussed below. Another caveat is that the sub-national units we analyze are relatively small (the median population is 11,192) and thus results may not generalize to the cross-country level. However, education is a positive predictor of growth and Brazilian sub-national units also experience income convergence as predicted by growth theories, suggesting that there are at least some common mechanisms linking inequality and growth both within and across countries. We also show that our results are unlikely to be driven by differential measurement error at the bottom versus at the top of the initial income distribution. And as in any observational study there is the possibility that our results are driven by some unobserved confounder, such as heterogeneity in local tastes for equality. We show, however, that our estimates change very little if we adjust them to account for potential selection on unobservables as proposed in Oster (Forthcoming). An important final robustness check is that we also get quantitatively very similar results when we include entity-level fixed effects and account for potential dynamic panel bias using lagged regressors as instruments. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the Brazilian setting, and Sect. 3 describes the data and presents summary statistics. Section 4 discusses our approach to analyze the relationship between left- and right-tail inequality and growth and how we deal with potential confounding factors. Section 5 presents and discusses our main results, and Sect. 6 presents evidence on mechanisms. Section 7 presents the results of multiple robustness checks, and Sect. 8 concludes with a discussion of external validity.",1
24,2,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-019-09164-4,The world income distribution: the effects of international unbundling of production,Sergi Basco,Martí Mestieri,,Male,Male,,Male,"Two remarkable facts of the globalization process witnessed in the last 25 years are the large increases in both trade in intermediate goods and capital mobility. Before the 1990s, trade in final goods accounted for most of the value of world exports and international capital mobility was relatively low. In contrast, after the 1990s, trade in intermediate goods or “unbundling of production” has become more prominent over time (e.g., see Fig. 1a), and global supply chains have emerged—a phenomenon termed New Globalization by Baldwin (2016).Footnote 1 There has also been a sizable growth of both gross and net international capital flows (e.g., see Lane and Milesi-Ferretti 2007). We document that intermediate goods are more heterogeneous in capital intensity than final goods. Figure 1b illustrates this fact by comparing the distribution of capital intensity of intermediates and final goods according to the end-use classification of Feenstra and Jensen (2012). The dispersion in capital intensity of intermediates is 24% higher than final goods as measured by the standard deviation, and 43% higher as measured by the interquartile range.Footnote 2 This suggests that unbundling of production may lead countries to specialize in intermediates with different capital intensity. Motivated by these facts, we develop a tractable dynamic model that combines trade in final goods, intermediates and capital to study how the unbundling of production affects the international allocation of capital and the world income distribution. We capture the higher dispersion in capital-intensity of intermediates in a stylized manner: intermediates are heterogeneous in capital-intensity, while different varieties of final goods are homogeneous in capital-intensity. This allows us to obtain a sharp characterization of the trade equilibrium and the effects of unbundling. The central result of the paper is to identify a novel channel whereby trade in intermediates (and, more broadly, trade in goods heterogeneous in capital intensity) generates a reallocation of capital towards more productive countries that exacerbates world inequality in both welfare and income per capita. The mechanism driving our result comes from the interaction between (i) countries specializing in intermediates of different capital intensity and (ii) an elastic supply of capital. We show that, with an elastic supply of capital, high-productivity (TFP) countries have comparative advantage in capital-intensive intermediates. Intuitively, these countries have higher wages, while capital flows equalize the cost of capital across countries. Thus, high-productivity countries sort into the production of capital-intensive intermediates and the world production of capital-intensive intermediates concentrates in high-productivity countries (in accordance with empirical studies).Footnote 3 As a consequence, high-productivity countries import and accumulate relatively more capital. This magnifies cross-country differences in labor productivity and real wages, implying an increase in world income and welfare inequality. We show that this mechanism also holds in the limiting case of vanishing productivity differences across countries (symmetry breaking). Intermediates and final goods. Notes We use the end-use classification in Feenstra and Jensen (2012) to classify goods as intermediates or final goods. See details in Appendix 1 Formally, the reason why unbundling exacerbates cross-country productivity differences is that it breaks the conditional factor price equalization. In the equilibrium without unbundling, for any two countries i and j, relative wages w are proportional to their productivities, \(\theta ,\) i.e., \(\frac{w_{i}}{w_{j}}=\frac{\theta _{i}}{\theta _{j}}\). In contrast, with unbundling, relative wages also depend on the endogenous sorting of countries into the production of intermediates with different capital intensity. In this case, we show that \(\frac{w_{i}}{w_{j}}=\left( \frac{ \theta _{i}}{\theta _{j}}\right) ^{Z_{ij}}\), where \(Z_{ij}\) is a function that encapsulates how this endogenous sorting magnifies the effect of country TFP on relative wages and satisfies \(Z_{ij}>1\) if \(\theta _i>\theta _j\). Thus, unbundling of production exacerbates cross-country wage inequality (and, ultimately, income and welfare inequality). Note that this is in stark contrast to other models of trade and capital flows, which exhibit conditional factor price equalization (e.g., Jin 2012). In our world economy, described in Sect. 2, countries only differ in their aggregate productivity (TFP). We consider a two-stage structure of production as in the seminal work by Feenstra and Hanson (1996).Footnote 4 Varieties of final goods, to which we refer as varieties in what follows, are differentiated by origin as in Armington (1969). They are consumed by the representative consumer of each country, who maximizes lifetime utility. We assume that the number of varieties that each country produces is proportional to its productivity level.Footnote 5 To produce each variety, a bundle of intermediates has to be assembled. Each of these intermediates requires capital and labor in different proportions to be produced. All technologies have constant returns to scale. Capital can freely flow across countries and can be saved across periods. Labor is fixed and cannot migrate (but can be freely reallocated within a country). We study two trade equilibria that we take as stylized representations of the trade regimes pre- and post-unbundling. We start analyzing an equilibrium “without unbundling,” in which only varieties and capital can be traded. Figure 2a represents this structure for a two-country two-variety case. The share of world output is determined by the share of varieties this country produces, which is proportional to its productivity. In the second trade regime, unbundling becomes possible. Intermediates can be freely traded and variety producers purchase intermediates from the cheapest location in the world.Footnote 6 Therefore, the location of production of intermediates becomes endogenous. In this “unbundling” equilibrium, countries sort into the production of capital-intensive intermediates according to their productivity, as depicted in Fig. 2b. We also show that the world output share of a country is determined by the mass and capital-intensity of the intermediates that it produces. Production structure for the two-country, two-variety case. Notes This figure represents the production structure for two countries and two varieties under the two different trade regimes. Dashed lines indicate trade flows, z indexes intermediates Section 3 derives the main results of the paper. Our central result is that, for any world productivity (TFP) distribution, unbundling implies an increase of world output and welfare inequality. We also find that both gross and net capital flows increase with unbundling. Section 3.1 shows that unbundling of production generates output (GDP) inequality even in the limiting case of vanishing cross-country productivity differences (symmetry breaking).Footnote 7 Section 3.2 provides an explicit characterization of the world output (GDP) distribution under the assumption that countries’ productivity is log-linear in their ranking, which is a very good approximation of the data. We adopt the “continuum of countries” modelling device from Matsuyama (2013) and obtain a sharp and tractable characterization of the cross-country Lorenz curve. Under this parametrization, we also show that middle-income countries experience the largest output decline with unbundling. Lastly, Sect. 4 takes advantage of the tractability of our framework to investigate how unbundling interacts with other relevant features of the world economy in the last decades. First, we show that if emerging countries (the “South”) join the “global supply chain” (i.e., start participating in trade in intermediates), the world output share of Northern countries and the most productive Southern countries will increase. Second, we find that the adoption of a labor-saving technology (computerization) exacerbates the effects of unbundling on world inequality. Third, we show that a first-order-stochastic-dominant shift of world technology distribution always leads to convergence in GDP but, with unbundling, the mass of low-productivity countries catching up is larger. Fourth, we explain how unbundling generates a relative decline in the labor share of high-productivity countries and provide empirical evidence supporting this result. Finally, we show that the dynamics of world aggregate outcomes are analogous to a standard Ramsey model and characterize the transitional dynamics once unbundling becomes possible. Related literature This paper relates to different strands of the literature on trade, economic growth, offshoring and capital flows. Despite the increasing prominence of international trade and capital flows, the attention given to the interaction between both has been relatively scant. Earlier work investigated how capital mobility affects the determination of optimal tariffs in a static two-country, two-commodities, two-factor world economy (Kemp 1966 and Jones 1967). Some important recent contributions have analyzed the role of financial development (e.g., Antràs and Caballero 2009; Matsuyama 2005), the effects on the skill premium (Feenstra and Hanson 1996) and, within dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models, global imbalances (Jin 2012) and the international co-movement of investment over the business cycle (Li and Jin 2012).Footnote 8 Among this set of papers, the closest to ours is Jin (2012). In both papers, countries that specialize in capital-intensive intermediates increase their capital imports. However, the economic forces driving this result are different. In Jin (2012), an increase in a country’s productivity induces a production shift towards labor-intensive goods, which translates into capital outflows. In contrast, in our model, consistent with the empirical evidence, high productivity countries have comparative advantage in capital-intensive goods. Second, and more importantly, in our model, trade in intermediates exacerbates the effect of productivity differences on wages. In our model, trade in intermediates breaks conditional factor price equalization and an increase in productivity has a more than one-for-one effect on wages. In contrast, Jin (2012) features conditional factor price equalization and, thus, exacerbation-type results are precluded by assumption. There exists a growing international trade literature analyzing the effects of unbundling. Nonetheless, this literature has not studied the interaction between trade in goods heterogeneous in capital intensity and an elastic supply of capital, which is the main mechanism of our theory. Moreover, our paper is the first to study equilibria pre- and post-unbundling in a unified framework. For example, Acemoglu et al. (2015), Baldwin and Robert-Nicoud (2014), Baldwin and Venables (2013), Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008) and Jones (2000) revisit the standard trade theorems in the presence of trade in intermediates.Footnote 9 A closer paper is Costinot et al. (2013). They derive a static free trade equilibrium with global supply chains. There are two key differences with our paper: (i) they consider production with only one factor of production, which is in fixed supply (cannot be accumulated or traded), and (ii) there is no heterogeneity in the production technology across intermediates. Thus, the economic forces driving our results are entirely different. Even though we derive our main results in a world in which countries differ in terms of productivity, the intuition of our results is similar to dynamic Heckscher-Ohlin models. For instance, Stiglitz (1970) considers a two-country two-good model and assumes that countries have different time preferences. Given this difference in time preferences, the integrated economy ends up outside the factor price equalization region. Trade leads to either convergence or divergence in income depending on the capital elasticity of the good in which the patient country specializes in. In contrast, in our model, countries only differ in productivity. The level of productivity uniquely determines the pattern of specialization, the stock of capital and income distribution in the long run. We show that world income inequality unambiguously increases with trade in intermediates. Our baseline dynamic model also relates to the large number of models that study the interaction between economic growth and trade. Our model structure for production is similar to Acemoglu and Ventura (2002). The most important difference is that we introduce the additional layer of intermediates in the production process. This allows us to study the effect of unbundling on the world income distribution. Other papers that study how trade in goods affects economic growth include Bajona and Kehoe (2010), Baxter (1992), Cunat and Maffezzoli (2004), Deardorff (2001b, 2013) and Ventura (1997). These papers make different assumptions on the number of goods and whether factor prices equalize. However, they do not consider trade in intermediates.Footnote 10 Yi (2003) calibrates a two-country, two-stage Ricardian model to show that vertical specialization is needed to explain how small trade cost reductions resulted in the observed growth in exports. In our model, unbundling of production generates symmetry breaking of ex-ante identical countries. Krugman and Venables (1995) and Matsuyama (2004, 2013), among others, have also analyzed how trade can generate symmetry breaking. Our mechanism is different from these papers because it does not rely on economies of scale or credit market imperfections. In our model, countries become ex-post asymmetric because in the unbundling equilibrium they specialize in intermediates with different capital intensity. This triggers capital flows (or differential saving rates across countries) that reinforce the initial differences in the specialization pattern. Thus, our framework provides a novel environment in which symmetry breaking emerges: trade regimes in which traded goods are heterogeneous in their input requirements and there is an elastic supply of one of these inputs. It is important to emphasize that while we have symmetry breaking in terms of production and trade patterns, welfare remains the same across countries in the unbundling equilibrium because factor prices equalize. This is in contrast with the previous literature in which, due to increasing returns (or borrowing constraints), they have symmetry breaking also in welfare.Footnote 11",1

Schneider,Jacob Weisdorf,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In attempting to explain the historical economic success of England and Western Europe more generally, scholars have long turned to differences in demographic regimes across countries as a potentially important factor. Malthus (1798) first raised the point arguing that high fertility from low ages at marriage and low celibacy in China prevented any material improvements in living standards whereas the preventive check, which limited fertility, allowed for incomes slightly above subsistence in England. Malthus’s preventive check has been refined over time into what Hajnal (1965) defined as the European Marriage Pattern (EMP). Characterised by late age at marriage, high rates of celibacy and the prevalence of nuclear households, Hajnal argued that the EMP was common west of a line from St. Petersburg to Trieste and less common to the east. Thus, the EMP allowed Europeans to control their fertility and experience living standards above subsistence (Voigtländer and Voth 2013). In addition, De Moor and Van Zanden (2010) and Foreman-Peck (2011) have argued that the European Marriage Pattern influenced economic development not only by limiting population growth but also by promoting higher investment in human capital, especially since women were given high levels of agency in the system. Sitting alongside these arguments, several theoretical contributions (Galor and Moav 2002; de la Croix and Doepke 2003; Clark 2007; Galor and Moav 2001) have argued that the internal demographic dynamics of pre-industrial societies (or of least developed societies) mattered for human capital formation. In particular, Galor and Moav (2002) has suggested that the struggle for survival during most of human existence had generated an evolutionary advantage to human traits that were complementary to the growth process, and that this eventually triggered the take-off of modern economic growth. Their theory considers two types of families: quantity families, prone to having many, but less educated offspring, and quality families, prone to having fewer, but more educated children (in a Beckerian sense). Because quality families invested in their children’s education, their children earned comparatively higher wages than their low-quality counterparts, which afforded educated individuals more offspring than uneducated ones. Quality families therefore had an evolutionary advantage over quantity families, causing their share in the population to rise and eventually leading to birth-restriction behaviour. On the evidence side, several studies have explored the historical link between various measures of income on the one hand and fertility or population growth on the other (e.g. Galor and Klemp 2019; Vogl 2016; Ashraf and Galor 2011; Clark and Hamilton 2006; Boberg-Fazlic et al. 2011). Three studies in particular (Clark and Hamilton 2006; Boberg-Fazlic et al. 2011; Clark and Cummins 2015) have provided pre-industrial evidence that better educated and thus more wealthy individuals had higher net reproduction rates. Both of these strands in the literature have contributed to our understanding of demographic change and economic development, but each has some problematic assumptions that need to be addressed more carefully. For the EMP, Dennison and Ogilvie (2014) have found that the differences in demographic regimes were not so different in Eastern and Western Europe, and they also show that demographic regimes were not homogenous within a country. At the same time, the survival of the richest literature has not properly accounted for differential rates of celibacy and childlessness across classes when computing the reproductive success of each group (Boberg-Fazlic et al. 2011). This paper addresses these earlier shortcomings by analysing the internal fertility dynamics of pre-industrial England, leading both to a substantial revision of previous conclusions about what caused the wealth of nations and to a strong empirical basis for the idea that quality families had an evolutionary advantage during the critical stages in the transition from economic stagnation to modern economic growth. We use the family reconstitution data collected from English parish registers and assembled by the Cambridge Group (Wrigley et al. 1997) to estimate the reproductive success of different wealth groups. Compared to previous attempts to measure reproductive success in historical England, which calculate reproductive rates conditional on giving birth, our study considers both the intensive margin, i.e. an individual’s number of surviving offspring, and the extensive margin, i.e. whether or not an individual married or had children at all (Aaronson et al. 2014 and Baudin et al. 2015). Thus, we explore reproductive success across four margins: two extensive margins—the choice to marry and the choice to have children—and two intensive margins—the number of children born and the child death rate. Our empirical exercise also proposes a novel methodological approach, which enables us to estimate the reproductive contribution of women who died before completing their reproductive period (something that happened often in the past). Whereas Weir (1984), Schofield (1985) and other historical demographers usually evaluate women’s reproductive success at the end of their reproductive period (usually after the age of 40 or 50), we use Cox proportional hazard models instead. This model allows us to estimate the risk of demographic events occurring by means of survival curves which start at the age at which a woman becomes at risk of the event (i.e. age 16 for marriage). This way we are able to explore the reproductive potential of a much larger share of a historical population than is normally the case in studies of women’s reproductive success. Our study replicates earlier, class-specific, historical-demography findings by Clark and others that the upper class had the highest numbers of surviving offspring on the intensive margin. However, by accounting for all four margins of reproduction, our findings dispute the previous view that the upper classes had more surviving offspring than the lower classes. We show that the middle classes of farmers and traders were the most successful socio-economic group in terms of reproduction once taking the extensive margin of fertility into account. Merchants, professionals and gentry, the upper classes, had high rates of celibacy and childlessness driving down their overall reproductive success, whereas labourers, servants, husbandmen and craftsmen had much lower rates of celibacy and childlessness but limited their fertility within marriage through birth spacing instead (Cinnirella et al. 2017). Thus, the middle classes combined high fertility and low celibacy and childlessness and therefore had the highest net reproduction rates. We argue that this demographic regime provides a better explanation for historical England’s economic success than those put forth in the previous work. Middle-class families were more likely to invest in apprenticeships for their children (Leunig et al. 2011), and according to Crouzet (1985), more than 85% of England’s early industrialists came from a middle-class background. This pattern of human capital investment emphasises how Hajnal’s European Marriage Pattern might have explained England’s economic success: not because all English families universally strove to limit births, but because those classes that invested comparatively little in growth-promoting education were more inclined to engage in birth restricting practises. This conclusion fits with the mechanism described in the quantity–quality model proposed in Galor and Moav (2002). There, differences in fertility driven by different social groups’ preferences for child quality have an impact on the distribution of traits in the population. Their theory highlights how the right balance between child quality and quantity (and not just child quantity per se) is important in explaining increased investment in human capital in the transition from stagnation to economic growth, consistent with behaviour of the English middle class observed here. The paper unfolds as follows. Section 2 illustrates the different margins through which social status affects reproduction and reviews the literature on celibacy, childlessness, survival of the richest and the European Marriage Pattern. Section 3 describes the data used for the analysis and how we define social classes. In Sect. 4 we calculate the class-specific rates of celibacy, childlessness, marital fertility and child mortality and translate these rates into class-specific net rates of reproduction. Section 5 provides robustness checks and argues in particular that our results are not driven by selective migration. Finally, Sect. 6 discusses the implications of the results and Sect. 7 concludes.",1

Vieider,,,Male,,Male,"Individual preferences play a central role for economic decisions and outcomes. Recently, a consensus has started to emerge that preferences are malleable, abandoning the ‘black box’ idea that we do not care about where supposedly unchangeable preferences come from (Bowles 1998). This raises the important question of what may determine the distribution of preferences across individuals and across countries. Several recent papers have modeled the evolutionary origins of preferences. Galor and Moav (2002) modeled the predisposition towards child quality as a consequence of the evolutionary pressures prevailing in the Malthusian era. Galor and Michalopoulos (2012) and Doepke and Zilibotti (2014) modeled the prevalence of risk-tolerance in a country as shaped by growth processes. Galor and Özak (2016) modeled the contemporary distribution of time preferences as shaped by agricultural yields in the Malthusian era. Galor and Savitskiy (2018) presented an evolutionary model on the origins of loss aversion, predicting that individuals who originate from parts of the world characterised by climatic shocks that are correlated across space and time will be more loss averse than individuals from regions with more volatile climatic shocks. Several attempts have been made to test the predictions emerging from these models. The predictions of Galor and Moav (2002) have been tested by Galor and Klemp (2019) using data from Quebec from the 1600s and 1700s. The authors showed that predisposition towards child quality, reflected in intermediate levels of fecundity, led to higher levels of long-run reproductive success than the highest fecundity levels. Galor and Özak (2016) presented a test of their own model, showing that agricultural yield pre-1500 predicts contemporary distributions in long-term orientation. Galor and Savitskiy (2018) tested their own predictions using proxies for loss aversion such as a preference for job security. Using second generation migrants, they were able to show an effect of the nature of shocks on loss aversion while excluding direct influences of geography. Ashraf and Galor (2018) present an overview of the literature pointing to the importance of evolutionary forces for comparative development. We add to this literature by testing the predictions on the global distribution of risk preferences of Galor and Michalopoulos (2012) and Doepke and Zilibotti (2014). Galor and Michalopoulos (2012) present an evolutionary model in which the prevalence of risk-tolerance in a country is driven by reproductive success. In early, Malthusian phases of development, risk-tolerance confers an evolutionary advantage. This evolutionary advantage is reversed as income per capita rises because of the increasing cost of children relative to consumption, leading risk-tolerant parents to substitute quality for quantity of children (Becker 1960; Becker et al. 1990). Paired with the intergenerational transmission of risk-tolerance (Kimball et al. 2009; Dohmen et al. 2012), this leads to the prediction of a shift in the composition of the population as countries grow rich. A direct test of the theory is provided by the association between risk-tolerance and fertility. In particular, the theory predicts a positive correlation between risk-tolerance and the number of children in Malthusian economies, and a negative correlation in rich countries, resulting in a negative interaction effect of GDP per capita and risk-tolerance on the number of children. 
Doepke and Zilibotti (2014) provide a complementary account focusing on the specific mechanism shaping preferences, identified in conscious socialization decisions of parents to prepare their children for the prevailing conditions (see also Doepke and Zilibotti 2008 and Doepke and Zilibotti 2017). They predict that the prevalence of risk-tolerance in an economy is determined by the entrepreneurial wage premium—the extent to which entrepreneurs earn higher incomes than workers. This prediction results from the observation that such a wage premium constitutes an incentive for parents to instill the necessary risk-tolerance into their children for them to become entrepreneurs. Doepke and Zilibotti (2014) further predict that the prevalence of risk-tolerance depends on past growth levels. In many respects, the predictions derived from this model are complementary to those of Galor and Michalopoulos (2012), with the most significant differences concerning the mechanism through which risk-tolerance is transmitted.Footnote 1 We set out to empirically document patterns of risk-tolerance across the globe. We use a dataset containing representative samples from 78 countries, with a median sample size of 1200 respondents per country and a total of 107,000 respondents, making this the largest comparative dataset on risk-tolerance to date.Footnote 2 The dataset contains a survey question on respondents’ risk-tolerance. We allay concerns about the economic significance of our survey question by showing that it predicts incentivized choices over financial lotteries. In addition to this validation emulating previous validation exercises (Dohmen et al. 2011; Hardeweg et al. 2013; Galizzi et al. 2016), we further validate the question at the macroeconomic level by correlating it with the aggregate, incentivized country-level data from Vieider et al. (2015). We find strong and significant correlations at both levels, pointing to a remarkable stability of the underlying behavioral trait of risk-tolerance. We start by showing that risk-tolerance is positively correlated with entrepreneurship in our data, as postulated by both Galor and Michalopoulos (2012) and Doepke and Zilibotti (2014). We also find a strong positive correlation between income and risk-tolerance within countries, thus replicating another stylized finding from the literature. More originally, we show that between countries aggregate risk-tolerance shows a negative correlation with GDP per capita, with poor countries displaying higher aggregate levels of risk-tolerance than rich countries. We show this correlation to be stable to the inclusion of a wide variety of geographic, institutional, and genetic controls. Together with the positive within-country correlation between risk-tolerance and income, which we find to hold across both rich and poor countries, this gives rise to a risk-income paradox. This paradox rules out simple intuitive accounts of the correlation between income and risk-tolerance, given the different directions of the correlation within and between countries. We then proceed to separately test some of the central mechanisms underlying the two models. We find only weak evidence for a correlation of risk-tolerance with either the entrepreneurship wage premium or past growth, as predicted by Doepke and Zilibotti (2014). We do, on the other hand, find considerable support for the importance of the fertility channel as a transmission mechanism for risk-tolerance, as postulated by Galor and Michalopoulos (2012). In particular, we find a strong negative interaction effect between GDP per capita and risk-tolerance on the number of children. This effect provides direct support for the importance of the fertility channel in determining the prevalence of risk-tolerant types in the population. Our results thus support endogenous-preference models in which preferences themselves may be shaped by market mechanisms. This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 derives the predictions in more detail. Section 3 presents the data and the validation of the survey question, as well as discussing our empirical methodology.

However, despite improvements in data quality and econometric techniques, the existing literature has not identified a uniform relation between both variables.Footnote 1 In fact, recent studies suggest that the impact of inequality on growth can be positive or negative, depending on initial GDP per capita (Brueckner and Lederman 2018) and varying between the short run and long run (Halter et al. 2014). Even from a theoretical perspective, the net effect of inequality on growth is unclear. Theories that focus on saving propensities and the accumulation of physical capital suggest that inequality increases economic growth (Kaldor 1957; Bourguignon 1981). This approach is based on the observation that savings rates are highest in upper income groups. As a consequence, income inequality channels resources towards individuals with higher savings propensities, which in turn increases economic growth through intensified investment activity. In contrast, theoretical models that build on credit market imperfections and the formation of human capital identify a negative relationship between inequality and economic development. Specifically, assuming indivisible investment in human capital and imperfect capital markets, Galor and Zeira (1993) show that the income distribution determines the allocation of human capital across individuals. In unequal societies, as a result, talented but poor individuals may be excluded from human capital augmenting investment—with potential adverse implications for aggregate output. Taking both mechanisms together, inequality increases the supply of physical capital through higher saving and investment but decreases the supply of human capital through reductions in educational attainment. Therefore, the net effect of inequality is ambiguous, as a country’s aggregate production function is typically increasing with respect to both input factors. 
Galor and Moav (2004) unify these two strands of the literature by developing a theory that proposes inequality being beneficial for countries that are in their early stages of industrialization. In these stages, the economy is characterized by a strong reliance on the accumulation of physical capital, which is accelerated by inequality through higher savings propensities. In later stages of an economy’s growth path, human capital replaces physical capital as the prime engine of economic growth. In the course of this development, a relatively equal income distribution, in the presence of credit constraints, enhances growth by leading to an acceleration in the accumulation of human capital.Footnote 2 Unlike theoretical research, the empirical literature has not yet put forward a framework that takes the different effects of inequality on economic growth via the accumulation of human and physical capital into account. This paper constitutes a first step into this direction. First, we expect the growth rates of physical-capital-intensive industries to be higher in countries with high initial levels of inequality. Second, higher inequality levels should reduce the long-run growth prospects of industries that are most dependent on high-skilled labor. To test these hypotheses, we compile a comprehensive data set that combines data on 22 manufacturing industries in 86 countries drawn from the UNIDO database for the 1980–2012 period with detailed country information on the degrees of inequality and industry information on the dependence on both human and physical capital. Applying disaggregated data at the industry level enables us to focus on the effects of inequality on human and physical-capital-intensive industries separately. We thereby overcome the problem that the two effects offset each other, which could be the case in a framework based on aggregated data. Our empirical specifications thus add to the recent empirical literature on the inequality-growth nexus (e.g., Cingano 2014; Halter et al. 2014; Berg et al. 2018; Brueckner and Lederman 2018) by being the first—at least to the best of our knowledge—to track down empirically to what extent and through which channels inequality affects the economic performance of industries that differ in their ex-ante input factor dependencies, providing a test for the hypothesis developed in Galor and Moav (2004). We start with a baseline model that establishes the effects of inequality on the growth rates of industries that vary in their ex-ante dependence on human and physical capital. Specifically, we model the average industry-level real growth rate of value added between 1980 and 2012 as a function of the interaction between a country’s initial degree of inequality (measured by the Gini coefficient) and an industry’s dependence on human or physical capital, respectively, controlling for country and industry fixed effects. We find that higher income inequality raises the value added growth rates of physical-capital-intensive industries. The effect is significant and economically relevant: the annual value added growth differential between an industry at the 75th percentile of physical capital intensity (paper) and an industry at the 25th percentile (tobacco) is 0.8–1.1 percentage points higher in a country with a Gini coefficient at the 75th percentile (e.g., Turkey) than in a country at the 25th percentile (e.g., Israel) of the distribution of income. In contrast, human-capital-intensive industries grow significantly less in countries with a more unequal distribution of income. The annual value added growth differential between an industry at the 75th percentile of human capital intensity (instruments) and an industry at the 25th percentile (furniture) is 1.2–1.6 percentage points higher in a country with a Gini coefficient at the 25th percentile than in a country at the 75th percentile of the distribution of income. These effects are non-trivial against the background of an average industry growth rate of 1.1% in our sample and they are robust to (i) using different inequality measures, (ii) employing alternative proxies for industry-level human and physical capital intensity, (iii) splitting the sample into various 5-year sub-samples and estimating panel data regressions, (iv) controlling for other macroeconomic variables, and (v) changing the definition of the dependent variable. Our results thus suggest that the difficulty in identifying a monotonic relationship between inequality and aggregate growth also stems from differences in the relative importance of human and physical capital in a country’s production structure. We continue to examine the transmission mechanisms from inequality to the growth rates of physical and human-capital-intensive industries. Following the theoretical literature reviewed above, we focus on the role of two channels—the supply of human capital (proxied by the years of schooling) and physical capital (proxied by the real physical capital stock). To this end, we introduce interactions on the right-hand side of our regressions that capture these two channels. Particularly, we add the country-level stocks of human capital and physical capital interacted with the respective industry-level dependence on human and physical capital. Once we control for the country-level stock of human and physical capital, the coefficients on the inequality interactions lose their statistical significance. This result provides indirect evidence that the growth-related effects of inequality can be explained with theories based on human and physical capital accumulation. To complement this result with more direct evidence, we further document a negative relationship between the years of schooling and inequality across the countries in our sample. In contrast, the relationship between inequality and the real physical capital stock is positive. Both findings are robust to including inequality with a significant lag (i.e., a 10-year and 20-year lag). The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the data and empirical methodology. The main results are shown in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4, we identify the transmission channels from inequality to industry-level growth. The results of various robustness checks are presented in Sect. 5. Section 6 concludes the paper.",1

Johnson,Mark Koyama,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Web Appendix Section 1 outlines a simple framework that describes how a shock can affect the probability that a minority group is persecuted. We consider a minority group and a majority group. The former contributes to economic production through specialized economic services such as moneylending, but is resented by the majority. The decision to persecute the minority depends on their net effect on the utility of a representative member of the majority community. The Black Death is a shock that affects both income, which fell in the short-run because economic activity was severely disrupted, and utility directly through the deaths of relatives and friends.Footnote 3 By definition, in every town with a minority community prior to the shock, the net utility of having their presence was at least weakly positive. We therefore define an indifference condition at which the majority community is indifferent about retaining the minority community. Whether the shock could induce a persecution of the minority depends on how the magnitude of the shock affects this condition. If the minority is held to be responsible for the shock, the larger the shock, then the more the majority community will resent their presence. But if the negative shock raises the marginal value of economic services provided by the minority community, then their value to the rest of society will be increasing in the severity of the shock. We label the former effect the scpaegoating effect and the latter effect the complementarities effect. We show that the majority group will persecute the minority community if the scapegoating effect is larger than the complementarities effect. A further prediction of this model is that if the relative size of the complementarity and scapegoating effects varies from city to city, then a given mortality shock could have differential effects. Moreover, for a given set of city characteristics, the size of the shock might give rise to differential effects. If the economic role of the minority becomes more important in the presence of a large shock, this can generate an inverted U-shaped relationship between Black Death mortality and the probability of a persecution. Our framework considers the utility of a representative member of the majority community. However, the majority group of medieval towns consisted of different subgroups, for the sake of simplicity city officials and the populace (which in turn consisted of merchants, artisans, laborers and peasants from the nearby countryside). The populace may be more likely to believe theories casting blame on the minority group. City officials may be more likely to internalize the positive economic externalities coming from their presence. The minority community may disproportionately contribute to aggregate output, which increases tax revenues, and also provide special taxes. In that case, whether a persecution occurs depends on how the scapegoating and complementarities effects vary for both subgroups and the balance of power between them. We proxy for the scapegoating and complementarities effects in our analysis using characteristics of the towns. We will proxy for the strength of the scapegoating effect using data such as how close a town was to the origin of rumors of well poisoning by Jews, whether the town had a history of persecuting Jews, and the timing of the arrival of the Plague (e.g. Easter). Similarly, we will proxy for the strength of the complementarities effect using measures such as whether Jews were lending money in the town and whether Jewish traders had access to more markets.",1

Ang,,,Male,,,Male,"This study offers an explanation for the different extent of individualism observed across countries and societies by focusing on the historical role of farming practice. Its central premise is that farming crops that require a large amount of manpower and coordinated efforts promotes the formation of within-group interdependence, and leads to the development of collectivistic traits. On the other hand, the cultivation of crops that require fewer hands and more independent efforts provides exposure to an environment conducive to the development of individualistic values. The dichotomy in these farming practices gives rise to the individualism–collectivism cleavage observed across the world. This work builds upon the seminal contribution of Talhelm et al. (2014), who put forward the rice theory of culture. Based on a study of 1162 Han Chinese from China’s rice and wheat growing regions, they show that societies with a rice growing legacy tend to have cultures leaning towards interdependence (collectivism), whereas societies with a history of wheat farming tend to develop cultures which are more independent (individualism). This study generalizes their theory of culture and provides an external validity of their evidence. While Talhelm et al. (2014) focus on rice and wheat, I consider a more comprehensive set of crops. Additionally, I test the theory on a global setting and find that it is consistent with cross-country, individual and the pre-industrial society data. Consequently, this study establishes a broader implication of the rice theory of culture by demonstrating how agricultural legacies explain the formation of cultural traits. The approach of this study is based on the notion that the formation of modern individualism can be traced to the labor requirements of cultivating crops traditionally. To test this prediction, I construct an index that measures the labor intensity of farming environment using high-resolution data. The measure takes into consideration of the labor requirement for farming various major crops and their respective caloric yield. Since farming labor-intensive crops requires more interdependence and intense cooperation which creates collectivistic norms and values, higher agricultural labor intensity is expected to retard the formation of individualistic traits. The evidence based on the use of cross-country, individual and pre-industrial cultural group data provide consistent support for this prediction. First, using cross-country data for up to 99 countries, the results indicate that the degree of individualism is significantly and negatively correlated with the labor intensity of farming environment across countries. Next, using individual-level data for more than 100,000 observations from the World Values Survey, the estimates provide consistent results which highlight that individuals located in areas that are conducive to the farming of labor intensive crops are less inclined to reveal preferences which are associated with individualism. Similar results are obtained when data for 114 pre-industrial societies and survey data for children of European immigrants are used. Overall, the results consistently demonstrate that a labor intensive agricultural environment significantly predicts the extent of cultural orientation towards individualism. The paper proceeds as follows. The next section reviews some related studies to place the findings of this research in the relevant context of the existing literature. Section 3 describes the estimation strategy, data sources and construction of variables. The cross-country estimates are presented in Sect. 4 and a series of robustness checks on the results are carried out. Section 5 provides some micro-level evidence using individual-level survey data on individualism from the World Values Survey. Data from the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample are analyzed in Sect. 6. Section 7 provides additional evidence based on children of European immigrants. The last section concludes the paper.",1
25,1,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-019-09173-3,"Spatial competition, innovation and institutions: the Industrial Revolution and the Great Divergence",Klaus Desmet,Avner Greif,Stephen L. Parente,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Why do some countries develop earlier than others? Why was England the first nation to experience sustained increases in its living standard? One common answer, dating back to Smith (1776), emphasizes increases in market size in the period leading up to the Industrial Revolution.Footnote 1 Larger markets, it is argued, made it more profitable for firms to incur the fixed costs of introducing modern technologies that favored large-scale production, thus spurring industrialization. Although the assertion that market size matters is not unreasonable when comparing England to other European countries, it is less compelling when comparing England to China for the simple reason that, by almost any measure, markets were larger in China in the pre-modern period, and yet industrialization there had to wait until the second half of the twentieth century.Footnote 2 Even upon gaining access to the modern technologies of the West following the Opium Wars, China failed to industrialize, giving rise to the so-called Great Divergence between the West and the East. This paper argues that a market-size-only theory of the Industrial Revolution is incomplete because it ignores the incentives of other actors in the economy, particularly those with interests vested in the status quo, to counter the efforts of would-be innovators and derail the industrialization process. On the eve of the Industrial Revolution, these actors were, to a large extent, craftsmen who expected a reduction in their earnings due to the diffusion of new technologies.Footnote 3 Faced with the prospect of lower earnings, these factor suppliers reacted by organizing themselves with the goal of preventing the introduction of modern modes of production. In many instances, this response involved a transformation of existing professional societies, such as craft guilds, from organizations with some positive economic or social significance, to ones bent on stopping technological change. In our view, the endogenous comparative evolutions of these institutions in China and England are important for understanding the Industrial Revolution and the  Great Divergence. The key tenet of this paper is that once we allow for the emergence of organized groups of factor suppliers, industrialization no longer depends on the size of the market, but on the degree of spatial competition between jurisdictions, which in the pre-modern era corresponded to cities, as power was concentrated at that level, rather than at the national one. Though spatial competition and market size are related concepts, they differ in a crucial way. In particular, whereas market size measures a producer’s access to consumers, both in the own city and in other locations, spatial competition measures the ease by which a producer in one city is able to capture consumers in other cities. Although greater inter-city competition implies a bigger market size, the reverse is not always true. For example, an increase in the population size of cities obviously increases the market for producers in these cities but it does not make it easier to capture consumers from other cities if trade is prohibitively costly. This difference between market size and spatial competition translates into an important asymmetry in the theory we develop: although having access to a greater number of own-city and other-city customers gives an individual firm greater incentives to adopt labor-saving technology, it is only by having access to a larger number of other-city customers that industries can overcome the resistance by factor suppliers with interests vested in the status quo. Thus, an increase in market size without an increase in inter-city competition will see the emergence of institutional barriers to development, but will never lead to their breakdown. Market-size-only theories of the Industrial Revolution miss this point. This paper’s premise is that intensifying spatial or inter-city competition in England between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries led to an early demise of the craft guilds and the introduction of labor-saving technology, whereas in China the absence of meaningful spatial competition meant that these events had to wait until the twentieth century. We demonstrate this mechanism in a model that consists of two cities or regions, each with a continuum of monopolistically competitive industrial sectors and a perfectly competitive agricultural hinterland. For each industrial good, there are two production technologies: an artisanal one, which all producers start out using, and a modern one, which can be adopted. The modern technology has two advantages: it can employ unskilled workers drawn from the hinterland, and it is characterized by greater output per production worker. However, it comes at the disadvantage of requiring a fixed adoption cost. The assumption that the modern technology does not require skilled labor provides the incentives for artisans to form groups to block the introduction of the modern technology. These are the types of institutions whose endogenous evolution we study in this paper. The model aims to capture the idea that stronger inter-city competition makes varieties produced in different cities more substitutable. This is the essential feature of the model in terms of its mechanics. To that end, we choose a preference construct that yields a price elasticity of demand that is increasing in the intensity of competition.Footnote 4 As a result, when spatial competition is stronger, mark-ups fall and firms must become larger to break even. This increases the gains from switching to the modern technology because a larger firm can spread the fixed cost of adoption over a greater quantity of output. Therefore, more intense spatial competition increases the incentives of firms to adopt the modern technology. Spatial competition, however, also affects the incentives of skilled workers to organize for the purpose of blocking the modern technology’s introduction for the simple reason that they face the unpleasant prospect of seeing their wage earnings decrease as they must compete with unskilled workers from the hinterland. Firms in a given industry and city must overcome this resistance if they want to operate the modern technology by compensating them for any reduction in earnings. This can only happen if industry profits are sufficiently large to compensate skilled workers for any reduction in earnings.Footnote 5 Resistance ends and the economy takes off when profits reach this point. Because the profitability thresholds are different for when adoption is profitable and when skilled craftsmen can be sufficiently compensated, the model predicts three stages in a nation’s trajectory. Starting off in a situation where spatial competition is weak, either because populations are small, transport costs are large, or distances between cities are small, no firm can pay the fixed innovation cost associated with making the new production process operational. In this case the equilibrium is characterized by all firms in all industries and cities using the artisanal technology and no technology-blocking guilds existing anywhere. As spatial competition strengthens, a first threshold is reached where an individual firm in a given city and industry becomes large enough so that its profits cover the fixed innovation cost. In spite of this, no firm in that city and industry is able to switch to the modern technology because the profits are too small to compensate the incumbent skilled workers for their reduced wages, prompting organized opposition by craft guilds. In this case, the equilibrium is characterized by all firms using the artisanal technology and guilds existing in all industries and cities. It is only when spatial competition becomes sufficiently intense that the second threshold is met where industry profits from innovation are large enough to compensate the skilled workers. At that point guilds disband, the modern technology is adopted and the economy takes off. Importantly, whereas an increase in city size, if large enough, is sufficient for guilds to form, it is never sufficient, per se, for guilds to end their resistance and for industrialization to take hold. An increase in own city size works like a reduction in transportation costs or distance between cities to affect the date the first profit threshold is reached, but it does nothing with respect to the second profit threshold. This is the key insight of the model. To understand why this is the case, consider a world where for whatever reason there is no inter-city trade. For a firm to find it profitable to introduce the modern technology, it must be able to capture customers at the expense of other firms in its industry. As city size becomes larger, this becomes easier, because varieties are more substitutable. Thus, even in the absence of inter-city trade, with a large enough increase in city size, an innovating firm will be able to capture enough customers from non-innovating competitors so as to justify paying the fixed cost of adopting the modern production process. However, once this happens and the skilled workers form a guild to block adoption by any firm in their city and industry, further increases in city size will not change the incentives of the guild to resist the modern technology if there is no inter-city trade. Given that the guild is organized at the level of the city and industry, its resistance can only be overcome if profits of all firms in its city are large enough to compensate its members for the reduction in wages. However, since household expenditures on a particular good are independent of the technology used, industry revenues (and profits) can only be increased if the innovating city can gain customers at the expense of the non-innovating city. Inter-city trade, and not intra-city trade, is thus critical for an economy’s take-off. To evaluate the historical relevance of the causal relation between spatial competition and industrialization, no single piece of evidence or methodology is perhaps sufficient. We therefore take a multifaceted approach, providing historical and quantitative support for our conjecture. In particular, we supply four different types of evidence, which together suggest that inter-city competition could have been an important determinant of the timing and location of the Industrial Revolution. First, using city size and location data, we quantify how spatial competition increased in England between 1600 and 1800. Using the same metric, we show that China at the end of the nineteenth century was about 200 years behind England. These observations form the starting point of our theory. Second, we provide a historical account of guilds in England and China, as they relate to spatial competition and innovation. In particular, we show that the degree of spatial competition affected the prevalence and intensity of resistance to labor-saving technologies. Third, we undertake a calibration exercise to examine whether the model is quantitatively consistent with England’s development. More specifically, we calibrate the model to the date when English guilds started blocking the introduction of labor-saving technologies on a large scale, and then determine the date predicted by our model when resistance should have ended, given the degree of spatial competition in England. We find that the model predicts the timing of the Industrial Revolution fairly well. Fourth, as a final assessment, we apply our model to Northwest Europe and China. Using data on spatial competitions on these regions of the world, the model predicts an industrial take-off in Northwest Europe lagging that of England’s, and an industrial take-off in China being delayed until well into the twentieth century. The literature that seeks to understand why the Industrial Revolution first occurred in England is extensive. Diverse explanations abound, some of which are: proximity to cheap energy (Pomeranz 2000), greater patience or stronger preferences for education (Galor and Moav 2002; Clark 2007), better institutions (North 1981; Mokyr 1990), and market size and integration (Voigtländer and Voth 2006; Shiue and Keller 2007; Boucekkine et al. 2007; Desmet and Parente 2012).Footnote 6 Among the subset of papers that focuses on market size, none suggests that the degree of spatial competition was relevant. Indeed, in these other theories, an increase in population or a decrease in trade costs have the same impact on innovation. That is not the case in our theory: an increase in market size in the absence of trade is not enough to bring about the economy’s take-off. Our paper is related to at least three other strands in the literature. One strand is the literature on the importance of competition for innovation. Empirical evidence in favor of the positive effect of competition includes Nickell (1996), Galdón-Sánchez and Schmitz (2002) and Aghion et al. (2005). There are also a large number of theoretical papers that describe mechanisms whereby stronger competition leads to more innovation. Of particular note is the paper by Desmet and Parente (2010), which uses the same preference construct as in this paper to show how an increase in market size facilitates the adoption of more productive technology. Although we borrow their basic setup, there are some key differences, the most important one being in this paper he endogenous formation and collapse of institutions that block the introduction of more productive technology. As a result, in our paper spatial competition, rather than market size, is what drives take-off. Another strand is the literature on technology-blocking institutions. The importance of resistance to the introduction of more productive technology by special interests in the context of the Industrial Revolution is a prominent theme in the work of Morison (1966) and Mokyr (1990). Important theoretical papers in this area include Krusell and Rios-Rull (1996), Parente and Prescott (1999), Dinopoulos and Syropoulos (2007) and Greenwood and Weiss (2018). The two most closely related papers are Holmes and Schmitz (1995) and Desmet and Parente (2014). In Holmes and Schmitz (1995), although trade is likewise shown to eliminate resistance, there is no role for local market size and the theory remains silent on how an economy escapes an equilibrium where both regions block innovation. Their theory is useful to understand historical examples where a city relaxed guild regulations when faced with stronger competition from the hinterland or from non-guilded cities. However, it is far less useful to understand how modern technologies were introduced when their large-scale use outside of guilded cities was legally prohibited or when the relevant geographical areas were all under guild control. In this regard we see our work as being complementary to theirs and together encompassing the full range of possibilities. In Desmet and Parente (2014), although workers form guilds or unions to block the introduction of a better production process until they can be defeated, there is no role for spatial competition and geography in their break-up because guilds form at the firm level rather than at the industry level. Increases in own-city size are therefore sufficient to bring about the demise of the guilds in Desmet and Parente (2014). A last strand is the vast economic history literature on guilds and their attitude towards innovation. Although scholars disagree on the precise role of guilds in economic growth, there is a broad consensus on two key facts that are important for our theory.Footnote 7 First, although craft guilds did not start off as anti-competitive organizations bent on slowing down technological progress, they increasingly turned anti-technology when innovation threatened jobs (Epstein 1998; Mokyr 1997). Second, there was less resistance to new technologies when spatial competition was stronger. Adoption of new labor-saving machinery was more likely when nearby locations were doing the same (Randall 1991). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides historical and empirical evidence for England and China on the relation between spatial competition, guild resistance and innovation. Section 3 presents the model and analyzes the theoretical interaction between the spatial distribution of cities, the incentives of firms to innovate, and the incentives of guilds to resist. Section 4 examines the quantitative predictions of our theory for the timing of take-off in England, Northwest Europe and China. Section 5 concludes.",1

Buggle,,,Male,,,Male,"Why did Europe experience rapid technological progress after 1500 century but not the Middle East or Asia, which were more advanced at the time? A prominent explanation links the divergence in science and technology to profound cultural differences between the “East” and the “West” (Weber 1958; Rosenberg and Birdzell 1986; Landes 1999). “Eastern cultures” are commonly described as collectivist: they place the group above the individual, value conformity and obedience to group norms, and expect loyalty from group members. “Western cultures” are instead individualist: they emphasize autonomy, individual achievements, and differences between individuals. While individualism has been argued to be conducive for the creation of novel and unique technologies, collectivism and norms of conformity might impede the pursuit of unconventional ideas that challenge existing concepts (Markus and Kitayama 1991; Mokyr 1992). Indeed, in a cross-section of countries, Gorodnichenko and Roland (2011a, 2017) document a strong negative association between the strength of collectivism, contemporary innovation and per capita incomes. Despite the prominent role attributed to the individualism-collectivism cultural dimension, our understanding of how these different cultural value systems emerged, and how they impacted long-run technological change, is limited.Footnote 1 This paper examines the deep agricultural origins of collectivist cultures and associated economic behavior. It tests the hypothesis that collaboration within groups in pre-industrial agriculture favored the emergence of collectivist cultures (e.g., Barry et al. 1957; Mann 1986; Wyer et al. 2013). I focus on societies that traditionally practiced irrigation agriculture, as irrigation required extensive collective efforts and attached farmers to communities that governed the optimal coordination of the water supply with strict rules and obligations (e.g., Mann 1986; Aoki 2001; Nisbett 2010). If norms that maximize survival probabilities are selected through an evolutionary process, as suggested by models of cultural evolution (Boyd and Richerson 1988, 2004), then irrigation agriculture could have favored the evolution and persistence of collectivist—rather than individualist—cultures.Footnote 2 Moreover, the emergence of collectivism in irrigation societies might have affected technological progress, and possibly contributed to their relative stagnation vice versa more individualist societies in the industrial era. My empirical investigation makes use of ethnographic data to measure the importance of irrigation for the ancestors of contemporary populations. A key identification challenge relates to the possibility that societies that used irrigation were more collectivist to begin with. To identify the long-run effects of irrigation, I control for a plethora of observable geographic characteristics, and propose an instrumental variable strategy that uses the geographic suitability for irrigated agriculture as instrument for the actual adoption of irrigation. The IV addresses in particular concerns about reverse causality, as it predicts historical irrigation use by the profitability of its adoption based on environmental constraints. Reassuringly, ethnic groups that lived in environments defined as suitable for irrigation were historically more likely to use irrigation. The validity of the IV estimation requires that irrigation suitability influences outcomes only through the actual adoption of irrigation in the past, controlling for geographical and historical characteristics. I examine the concern that suitability is correlated with other geographical features, and investigate hypothetical violations of the exclusion restriction following Conley et al. (2012). The first part of the empirical analysis investigates the effect of historic irrigated agriculture on contemporary culture. Results from OLS and 2SLS regressions lend support to the hypothesis that ancestral irrigation favored a culture of collectivism. These findings appear i) across countries, conditional on a wide range of country controls and continental fixed effects that account for differences across world regions, and ii) across up to more than 190,000 individuals living in over 900 sub-national districts, conditional on individual controls and either continental or country fixed effects that control for country-wide characteristics, such as institutions. The magnitudes of the effects are economically meaningful. If the ancestors of a population, such as South Korea, had not practiced irrigation agriculture, then the average collectivism score (measured on a scale from 0 to 100) of this population would drop by between 22% (OLS) to 43% (IV). In other words, the degree of collectivism of South Korea would move from 82 (83 percentile) to a level similar to Uruguay (43 percentile) or Israel (28 percentile). To further test whether irrigation affected populations in pre-industrial times, I differentiate the effect of irrigation suitability computed in the ancestral homelands of populations from suitability measured in locations where populations currently reside. The findings from this exercise suggest that ancestral irrigation suitability is a stronger predictor of collectivism than local irrigation suitability, which underlines that irrigation influenced population characteristics in the past. In addition, I document that differences in the organization of irrigation have resulted in variants of collectivist cultures. I find larger effects of irrigation agriculture on acceptance for authority (vertical collectivism) when interacting irrigation agriculture with geographic characteristics that anthropologists have associated with centralized irrigation. In contrast, I find that irrigation societies display stronger norms of cooperation (horizontal collectivism) in environments associated with small-scale irrigation (see also Weissing and Ostrom 1991; Bardhan 2000).Footnote 3 These results imply that some historic irrigation systems gave rise to a more hierarchical, authoritarian culture that complement autocratic institutions. This is in line with the work by Wittfogel (1957) and Bentzen et al. (2017), the latter who document a strong positive relationship between irrigation suitability, elite stratification and contemporary autocratic institutions.Footnote 4 Testing empirically for the importance of elite stratification as a channel linking past irrigation and collectivist norms today, the results indicate that the historical presence of a landed elite only absorbs a minor part of the effect of irrigation on culture today. Furthermore, I find that the effect of irrigation persists in European migrants, consistent with a mechanism of inter-generational transmission behind the persistence of collectivism.Footnote 5 Assessing factors that affect the transmission of collectivism reveals that persistence is stronger in migrants that experienced negative economic shocks, and weaker in countries in which larger public spending on old age security decreases material interdependencies. I then explore how historic irrigated agriculture shaped technology. I first document that populations of countries whose ancestors used irrigation in the past are less innovative today, measured by the number of scientific articles per capita.Footnote 6 The magnitude of the effect is large and implies that for example South Koreans would today produce up to two times more articles per capita, a level similar to Canada, if their ancestors had not used irrigation. To study the effect of past irrigation on innovation within countries, I build a novel dataset that measures research productivity in 1893 cities. My results document a similar negative effect of past irrigation on contemporary innovation conditional on country fixed effects. Moreover, in line with historical accounts, the analysis of past technological progress reveals that irrigation societies were technological leaders prior to 1500, but fell behind after the mid-sixteenth century. This reversal is consistent with the view that collectivist cultures had an advantage in coordinating agricultural production, but as they innovated at lower rates, they were overtaken in the transition out of agriculture (Ashraf and Galor 2011a; Gorodnichenko and Roland 2017). I provide several types of evidence that culture is an important mechanism behind the effects of past irrigation use on technology. First, irrigation suitability computed in the ancestral homelands of contemporary populations predicts innovation much more strongly than local irrigation suitability. This implies that irrigation affects innovation through its effect on portable cultural characteristics of populations. Second, I look across migrants that face a common institutional environment and document that US immigrants that originate from irrigation societies are less innovative and less likely to mention independence as an important job characteristic. Lastly, the negative effects on innovation are corroborated when investigating patterns of occupational specialization. Looking across countries and US migrants, I find that descendants of irrigation societies are more likely to select into routine-intensive jobs that require obedient rather than independent behavior. This paper adds to the literature on the deep-roots of culture, institutions, and economic development.Footnote 7 The studies most related to this paper are Litina (2016) and Bentzen et al. (2017). Litina (2016) documents a negative effect of land productivity on generalized trust and development today, in line with the idea that low agricultural suitability increased the need for cooperation. In contrast, this study documents that the need for cooperation in irrigation agriculture led to collectivist norms characterized by group identification and obedience, which, in the long-run, reduced the innovative capacity of society. In addition, Bentzen et al. (2017) document a strong positive association between local irrigation suitability and autocratic institutions across countries. I add to this study the finding that historical irrigation also predicts collectivist cultures which are complements to autocratic institutions. Moreover, Olsson and Paik (2016a, b) document a long-run reversal of development, showing that areas within Europe that transitioned later to agriculture are today wealthier and more individualistic. Other studies have explored the effects of geography and agricultural subsistence on gender equality (Alesina et al. 2013b), preferences for hard work (Fouka and Schlaepfer 2017), time preference (Galor and Özak 2016), and trust (Buggle and Durante 2017).Footnote 8 My findings contribute to this literature by providing the first comprehensive evidence that the need of pre-industrial irrigation farmers to cooperate within groups shaped collectivist norms.Footnote 9 My paper therefore also intersects with cross-cultural research that investigates empirically the origins of collectivism (e.g., Fincher et al. 2008; Welzel 2013; Talhelm et al. 2014). My results complement and generalize the findings in Talhelm et al. (2014), who document that students from rice-growing areas in China think more collectively compared to students from wheat growing areas. In estimations reported in the Appendix, I propose to disentangle the effects of rain-fed from irrigated rice cultivation. I find results supportive of the hypothesis that the relationship between rice agriculture and collectivism is driven the irrigation technology rather than the crop.Footnote 10 Finally, this study relates to papers studying the cultural determinants of economic behavior, in particular collectivism. The seminal contributions are Gorodnichenko and Roland (2011a, 2017), who document a negative relationship between collectivism and contemporary innovativeness across countries. The migrant analysis provides new evidence for culture as determinant of innovativeness at the individual level, and adds to studies that analyze the cultural background of innovators (e.g., Hunt and Gauthier-Loiselle 2010). In addition, my findings speak to the literature in labor economics on job tasks (e.g., Autor et al. 2003; Autor and Dorn 2013), as they link labor-market sorting and patterns of specialization across countries and individuals to cultural determinants, which so far has only been studied sparsely (see e.g., Krueger and Schkade 2008). A notable exception is Campante and Chor (2017), who establish empirically and theoretically a two-way relationship between attitudes towards workplace obedience and specialization in routine tasks that mirrors some of my findings. Relative to these literatures, my study finds that innovativeness and labor-market sorting have “deep-roots”: they are influenced by cultural beliefs and norms that have in parts been shaped by traditional agricultural practices. The next section outlines the conceptual framework and hypotheses. Section 3 describes the empirical strategy and the data construction. Section 4 reports results of ancestral irrigation on cultural norms of collectivism. Section 5 discusses the empirical findings of ancestral irrigation on innovation and patterns of occupational specialization. Section 6 concludes.",1

A vast body of literature has established the role of ethnic heterogeneity in economic performance (Alesina and Ferrara 2005). However, the focus has often been on investigating the consequences of ethnic heterogeneity at an aggregate level (such as country, district, or city) using aggregate indices of diversity, rather than on an individual level. The most commonly used aggregate indices include fractionalization (Easterly and Levine 1997; Alesina et al. 2003), polarization (Esteban and Ray 1994, 1999; Montalvo and Reynal-Querol 2005), and genetic diversity (Ashraf and Galor 2013b). For instance, ethnic fractionalization describes the probability that two randomly selected individuals from a given region belong to two different ethnic groups. All individuals, regardless of their ethnicity, face the same level of ethnic fractionalization in a region. This approach disregards the possibility of individual-specific heterogeneity in the consequences of living in diverse regions. In contrast, this paper focuses on the concept of individual-level ethnic distance to identify precisely which individuals lose out within a particular region, even if they face the same level of ethnic diversity in the aggregate. Ethnic distance measures how ethnically different an individual is from others living in the same region. Unlike aggregate measures, it is specific to an individual’s ethnicity and geographic location within a region.Footnote 1 In this study, I combine high-quality individual-level micro data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for fourteen sub-Saharan African countries with a novel dataset on the spatial distribution of ethnic groups at the level of approximately \(1\,\hbox {km} \times 1\,\hbox {km}\). The spatial distribution data are constructed using an iterative proportional fitting algorithm recently developed by Desmet et al. (2020). Exploiting the individual mother’s location, ethnicity (which I map to languages from the Ethnologue database) and the spatial distribution of language groups, I construct individual-level ethnic distances of the mothers from people living around them. Following a burgeoning trend in the literature, I measure the ethnic distance between any given pair of ethnic groups by the degree of difference between the languages spoken by the two groups.Footnote 2 The distance metric is based on the number of branches shared between any two languages according to Ethnologue language trees. Instead of taking a stand on what the appropriate neighbourhood or region for calculating these distances ought to be, I calculate the distances by drawing circles of different radii around the mothers. Then, using a time-varying ethnicity fixed effects framework, I investigate how the mother’s ethnic distance from her neighbours affects her children’s health outcomes. This allows me to curb the effects of unobserved heterogeneity across ethnic groups such as ethnic advantage or dominance of certain groups (Kramon and Posner 2016; Burgess et al. 2015; Franck and Rainer 2012), as well as within-group genetic diversity (Arbatlı et al. 2020). My primary finding is that the children of mothers who are ethnically distant from their neighbours experience higher mortality rates. This effect is stronger for individuals who have never migrated from their village of birth. Considering a circle of 50 km in radius around the mother, a one SD increase in linguistic distance leads to 14 additional child deaths (approximately 3.3% SD) for the non-migrant group. The corresponding number for the migrant group is four additional child deaths (1% SD). Next, using recently constructed disaggregated spatial data on malaria suitability (Kiszewski et al. 2004; McCord and Anttila-Hughes 2017), I find that malaria suitability worsens the pernicious effects of linguistic distance on child mortality. For the non-migrant sample, a one SD increase in linguistic distance when malaria suitability is one SD above its average value leads to 34 additional child deaths compared to the 14 additional child deaths for the average level of malaria suitability. Following the ethnic networks literature (Larson and Lewis 2017; Fisman et al. 2017; Pongou 2009), I hypothesize that information does not flow smoothly across ethnic lines; thus, individuals who are ethnically distant from their neighbours suffer adverse effects. I uncover several pieces of evidence in support of this hypothesis. Delving deeper into the heterogeneity by migration status, I find that linguistically distant individuals who have never migrated are less likely to have heard of oral rehydration for treating children with diarrhoea, to have received tetanus injections and iron tablets during pregnancy, to have washed hands before making their meals, and to know when to seek medical help for their children. The increased strength of the results for individuals who have never migrated might itself indicate that individual ethnic distances impose barriers to accessing information related to health. Individuals who have moved from other places are more likely to have acquired health information in their previous place of residence, which I cannot observe. However, individuals who have never moved have acquired knowledge related to health in their current place of residence. Hence, linguistic distance affects them more profoundly than migrants.Footnote 3 The more profound effects of linguistic distance on child health in malaria-endemic areas might also indicate an information channel. For instance, it may suggest that linguistically distant mothers do not have access to best-practice information about preventing or treating malaria, resulting in higher child mortality among them in malaria-endemic areas. Furthermore, maternal linguistic distance also has strong and robust negative effects on child height, which is an important marker of child health. This lends further credence to the hypothesis that linguistic distance impedes the flow of information, as information is crucial for child height (Thomas et al. 1991).Footnote 4 Finally, using survey data collected by Larson and Lewis (2017) as part of an experiment that seeded information in different Ugandan villages, I provide evidence that information is less likely to pass on to individuals who are linguistically more distant from their neighbours, even in an experimental setting.Footnote 5 I investigate several alternative channels through which linguistic distance from one’s neighbours might be injurious to health. First, using data on access to public goods such as education, water, and electricity, I investigate whether linguistically distant individuals face more discrimination in accessing these public goods. I find no evidence supporting a direct discrimination channel. Next, using the share of coethnics living in a mother’s vicinity, I investigate whether linguistic distance captures the role of kin networks and resource sharing within close-knit ethnic communities rather than imposing information barriers. I do not unearth any evidence in favour of this hypothesis either. Finally, in the spirit of Buckles and Hungerman (2013), I investigate whether selection can provide an alternative explanation of why linguistic distance worsens health outcomes, but find no evidence to support this. More specifically, I do not find any evidence suggesting that women who are more linguistically distant from their neighbours and have children are different from those who do not have children. Another possible explanation could be that individuals speaking different languages do not understand each other. Public health papers have underscored that minorities such as Hispanics in the US (Singleton and Krause 2009; Flores 2006) or asylum seekers in Europe (Bischoff and Denhaerynck 2010) face communication barriers when seeking medical attention because they speak a different language from the medical staff. An analysis that varies the values of a parameter that determines how fast the distance between any two languages declines as the number of shared branches increases suggests the irrelevance of mutual intelligibility of two languages in explaining the findings. Languages become unintelligible quite quickly as they move a few branches away from each other in the language tree. Rather, I uncover evidence suggesting the importance of deeper cleavages arising from splits that occurred thousands of years ago.Footnote 6 Building on the ethnic networks literature, I argue that individuals are reluctant to pass on information to others who are linguistically distant from them.Footnote 7 The empirical analysis relies on controlling for a rich set of control variables and fixed effects.Footnote 8 All specifications include controls for aggregate levels of ethnic diversity such as fractionalization or polarization.Footnote 9 Controlling for ethnicity- and religion-specific fixed effects purge heterogeneity in unobservable characteristics across ethnic or religious groups. The inclusion of time-varying ethnicity fixed effects rules out explanations based on political ethnic favouritism (Kramon and Posner 2016; Burgess et al. 2015; Franck and Rainer 2012; Kudamatsu 2009) as well as purging the effects of within-group genetic diversity (Arbatlı et al. 2020). The inclusion of time-varying region fixed effects rules out the possibility of region-specific transfers benefiting certain ethnic groups at the cost of others (De Luca et al. 2017; Dickens 2016). Further, using the heuristics of Altonji et al. (2005) and incorporating insights from Oster (2017), I show that the results are unlikely to be driven by selection on unobservable variables. If anything, selection on unobservable variables drives the main coefficient of interest away from zero. Finally, I construct additional variables to rule out several potential confounders. First, I show that the effects of linguistic distance are not explained by differences in individual-level genetic distance (Spolaore and Wacziarg 2016), or cultural distance (Giuliano and Nunn 2018). I also construct an index of distance from the dominant group in the region and pit it against my measure of average linguistic distance that considers all individuals residing in the region when constructing linguistic distance.Footnote 10 Average linguistic distance comes out to be both economically and statistically more significant compared to distance from the dominant group. In addition to the ethnic networks literature mentioned previously, this paper contributes to two other strands of the literature. First, I contribute to the literature that demonstrates the role of ethnic and cultural distances in economic outcomes (Spolaore and Wacziarg 2009, 2016; Guiso et al. 2009; Desmet et al. 2017). This literature is largely agnostic about specific mechanisms through which ethnic barriers operate. My micro-level analysis demonstrates how ethnic distance might act as a barrier to health information, leading to higher child mortality rates among linguistically distant groups. A related nascent strand of the micro literature highlights the ways in which ethnic distance affects economic development through human capital accumulation (Laitin and Ramachandran 2016; Shastry 2012), trade flows (Isphording and Otten 2013), literacy and labour market outcomes of immigrants (Isphording 2014), market integration (Fenske et al. 2017), and the effectiveness of counterinsurgency policies (Armand et al. 2020). I introduce a spatial dimension at the individual level and highlight an information channel, both of which are novel in the literature. Second, this paper contributes to a sizeable body of literature investigating the effects of ethnic diversity on different political economy outcomes.Footnote 11 While most of the literature is at the cross-country level, there has been a recent surge in the number of studies investigating political economy outcomes at the local level, such as: Alesina et al. (1999) (U.S. cities); Dahlberg et al. (2012) (Swedish municipalities); Munshi and Rosenzweig (2015) (wards in India); Algan et al. (2016) (apartment blocks in France); Montalvo and Reynal-Querol (2017) (\(1^{\circ } \times 1^{\circ }\) pixels in Africa); and Desmet et al. (2020) (local interaction at the 5 km \(\times\) 5 km cell level and public goods outcomes at the national level). In contrast, I focus on individual-level ethnic distances, controlling for ethnic diversity at the local level in addition to a rich set of other controls.Footnote 12",1
25,2,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-020-09176-5,Losing your dictator: firms during political transition,Felipe González,Mounu Prem,,Male,Male,,Male,"Political transitions are associated with significant economic changes (Acemoglu et al. 2019), but little is known about the persistence of resource misallocation across regimes and the role firms play during these times.Footnote 1 Distortions in the allocation of resources across firms are an important source of inefficiency (Hsieh and Klenow 2009) and links between firms and the state are at the heart of it.Footnote 2 Anticipation that said distortions will disappear if there is a regime change could lead politically connected firms to “prepare.” If distortions exist and some firms successfully prepare, they are transferring inefficiencies across political regimes, possibly limiting the benefits of democratization and the market changes it creates. However, observing firms during transition and across political regimes has been difficult. We collect new firm-level data from Chile to document resource misallocation in favor of politically connected firms during the transition from dictatorship to democracy.Footnote 3 We find that firms connected to the Pinochet dictatorship (1973–1990) were relatively unproductive and benefited from resource misallocation when compared to unconnected firms in the same industries, and these distortions seem to have persisted into democracy. We then show that after learning the dictatorship was going to end, firms in Pinochet’s network increased their productive capacity, experienced higher profits, and obtained more loans from the main state-owned bank. In the effort to explain this observed firm behavior during the political transition, we test for different potential mechanisms—including the role of uncertainty and financial frictions—and provide suggestive evidence consistent with connected firms aiming to shield their market position for the future democracy. Chile’s transition to democracy provides an opportunity to measure and study the interactions between a dictatorship and firms. Vast amounts of (previously unexploited) information exist about firms operating during and after the dictatorship led by General Pinochet from 1973 to 1990. The existence of records of people who worked for Pinochet assures that these interactions are measurable. In addition, the timing of this transition provides an opportunity to measure firm behavior after a democratization announcement but before the new democratic government takes office, a period in which firms can reoptimize their decisions for the new environment. After fifteen years in power, General Pinochet called for a referendum in 1988, in which he would run to transform his autocratic regime into a democratic one for the next eight years. Contrary to everyone’s expectations, Pinochet not only lost the referendum, but also acknowledged his defeat. This event, known as the “1988 plebiscite,” marked the beginning of Chile’s transition to democracy. Perhaps surprisingly, Treisman (2017) shows this type of democratization is common.Footnote 4 We take advantage of this situation to study connected and unconnected firms under dictatorship, transition, and democracy. Our econometric analysis uses data for 118 firms that were mandated to submit annual reports to a regulatory agency. By law, firms listed in the stock market—or those with more than five hundred shareholders—had to send reports describing their yearly business activities. We digitized these documents for all years between 1985 and 1994. We chose this period because since 1985 firms had to report the exact same activities. To be in our data, a firm needed to have reports in both the dictatorship and democracy. The reports allow us to observe assets and their subcategories, debt and its subcategories, profits, firm-bank relationships, and the identity of board members. To detect firms with links to the regime, we look for board members who worked for Pinochet before 1988, a process that results in the identification of firms with direct or indirect links to the regime, a novelty in our empirical approach. We refer to firms with direct or indirect links as connected or as being in the dictator’s network of firms. We study firm behavior using a differences-in-differences framework with three periods and three types of firms. Our strategy flexibly controls for the probability that firms had a link to Pinochet and for unobservable industry shocks by period. Because firms with connections to Pinochet were larger and more likely to have been privatized, a differences-in-differences strategy is subject to the threat of cross-sectional variables interacting with year shocks. To deal with this concern, we estimate the probability of firms having links to the dictatorship and include an interaction between this probability with period fixed effects. Then we follow Hornbeck and Naidu (2014) and show that after adding this control differences in observables between connected and unconnected firms are smaller and not statistically significant, and we cannot reject the existence of parallel trends across firms before the plebiscite. However, given the differences across firms in the dictatorship period, and the limited number of variables available in the reports for us to estimate the probability of having links in the best possible manner, the results should be interpreted as causal with caution. The first part of our analysis shows that when financial investors learned that the dictatorship was going to come to an end—i.e. after the 1988 plebiscite—connected firms experienced a significant decrease in their stock market value. However, we also show that connected firms benefited from resource misallocation under dictatorship and these benefits persisted into democracy. To study changes in firm value we collected daily stock prices for firms in our data. We document that firms with direct or indirect links to Pinochet suffered a substantial decrease in their stock value in the days following the plebiscite. Although changes in stock prices of connected firms after political events have been documented before, the patterns for firms with indirect links are novel and suggest the existence of more complex political networks. To study resource misallocation we construct measures of productivity and the capital and output wedges proposed by Hsieh and Klenow (2009). Our results reveal that under dictatorship firms with direct and indirect connections were less productive and their capital was distorted when compared to unconnected firms. Using our empirical strategy we show that this resource misallocation persisted into democracy. The second part shows that during the political transition, i.e. when it was known the dictatorship would end, firms with direct links to Pinochet increased their productive capacity—measured by changes in physical capital—by 0.40 standard deviations (\(\sigma\)) and enjoyed 0.20–0.30 \(\sigma\) higher profits, with no significant changes in the number of workers employed. Additionally, firms with direct links obtained substantially more loans from the main state-owned bank in this period, with some evidence of debt substitution from private banks. This result is consistent with anecdotal evidence pointing to the main state bank as crucial for firms connected to Pinochet (Leon-Dermota 2003). Importantly, these results control for any effects the transition might have had across industries and are robust to a wide range of exercises, including: (i) a placebo that exploits the attempted murder of Pinochet during his dictatorship, and (ii) elections during democracy. However, the behavior of connected firms might still be explained by unobserved characteristics that were related to connections and unrelated to the variables included in the estimated probability of having links. The last part of our paper attempts to explain the persistence of distortions using firm behavior during transition as a mechanism. We provide suggestive evidence that firms used their preferential relationship with state-owned banks to obtain credit and make investments to shield their market position for democracy. To arrive at this conclusion we test four different mechanisms that can potentially explain the higher investment, profits, and debt from the main state-owned bank. First, we propose a theoretical framework in which firms with different types of connections decide to invest in the presence of: (i) credit distortions, and (ii) the threat of entry under democracy. We test and confirm primary and auxiliary predictions from this model. Second, we use the Baker et al. (2016) text analysis framework to construct firm-level measures of uncertainty and find a limited role for economic uncertainty. Third, we find that a supply side explanation in which banks provide more credit to large firms (Beck et al. 2005) is inconsistent with the data. Finally, we show that strategic link formation and wealth extraction are also unlikely to be mechanisms behind our results. We conclude that the evidence is most consistent with strategic behavior of firms aiming to shield their market position for the democracy period. However, we are unable to test other mechanisms that could also be at play. Several papers have shown that a threat of entry can induce incumbent firms to change their behavior (Goolsbee and Syverson 2008; Cookson 2018). However, the existence of a period for firms to adapt to the new environment is key. In a closely related study, Kochanova et al. (2018) show that the market share of firms connected to Suharto in Indonesia decreased in the post-Suharto era, a finding consistent with more competition from unconnected firms. The main difference with Chile’s transition is that the fall of Suharto was more abrupt, leaving firms with less time to prepare for the next political period. Our work is related to the literature studying resource misallocation under dictatorship and the legacies of non-democracies. Although empirical work documenting distortions associated with political connections is vast, only a few articles study resource misallocation in authoritarian regimes (e.g. Mobarak and Purbasari 2006). The empirical literature documenting short-term persistence of economic and political distortions across regimes is a relatively new area of research and has focused mostly on local politicians. For example, Martínez Bravo (2014) shows that appointed officials who remained in power after Indonesia’s transition to democracy are associated with significant economic and political distortions. In the same context, Martínez Bravo et al. (2017) show that mayors who remained in power had worse governance outcomes, highlighting the costs associated with slow transitions. We contribute to this literature by examining the persistence of resource misallocation across firms. This paper also contributes to the empirical literature studying the economic effects of political transitions. Estimates of the effect of democracy on economic growth go back to at least the beginning of the 1990s and have been the focus of contentious debates. Acemoglu et al. (2019) provide the most recent empirical analysis and show significant positive effects of democratizations on economic growth in the long run.Footnote 5 Our results suggest that the short-run effects of democratizations may be at least partially explained by a transfer of distortions from the previous regime. In this sense, we interpret the persistence of distortions as a potential constraint on the effects of democratizations. Finally, our results also speak to a theoretical literature studying the persistence of economic power across political regimes (e.g. Acemoglu 2008; Acemoglu and Robinson 2008).",1

25,3,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-020-09179-2,The origins of the division of labor in pre-industrial times,Emilio Depetris-Chauvin,Ömer Özak,,Male,Male,,Male,"At least since Adam Smith, the presence of individuals exclusively engaged in specific occupations has been considered fundamental to comparative economic development.Footnote 1 The importance of this division of labor is attributed to its essential role in the accumulation of production specific human capital and the potential benefits of learning by doing, all of which may be conducive to increasing productivity, innovation, trade, and economic development.Footnote 2 Moreover, these consequences of the division of labor may in turn have provided the fertile ground for the emergence and subsequent evolution of complex social organizations.Footnote 3 Indeed, a complex division of labor has been prevalent since pre-industrial times, with some types of division of labor, at least along sexual lines within a family, being present in almost every society (Nolan and Lenski 2011).Footnote 4 Despite the prevalence of the division of labor since pre-industrial times and its suggested fundamental role for the progression of societies, little, if anything, is known about its deep-rooted determinants. This research aims to fill this void by exploring the deep historical roots of the division of labor in pre-industrial societies.Footnote 5 Specifically, we explore the role of diversity across individuals in a society on its division of labor, a fundamental hypothesized force underlying the division of labor in the classic literature on the subject (Smith 1776; Ricardo 1817; Marx 1867; Durkheim 1893). The role of within-population diversity in economic development has been explored by a recent vibrant literature spurred by the seminal work of Ashraf and Galor (2013b), which established that within-population diversity has a hump-shaped effect on economic development. This relation has been hypothesized to reflect a fundamental interplay between beneficial and detrimental effects of diversity on productivity at the societal level. Further work has explored different potential mechanisms underlying the aforementioned hump-shaped relationship.Footnote 6 Interestingly, while Ashraf and Galor (2013b) suggest that higher within-population diversity should be beneficial for productivity due to larger complementarities between individuals, the empirical evidence on the mechanisms underlying these benefits is sparse. Indeed, most of the existing empirical evidence suggests that diversity adversely affects contemporary social cohesiveness, trust, autocratic forms of governance, and violence (Arbatli et al. 2018; Galor and Klemp 2017). Our research identifies a potential mechanism through which within-population diversity can positively affect productivity and long-run development: the emergence of the division of labor. Our research establishes that population diversity was conducive to the division of labor in pre-industrial times across ethnic groups.Footnote 7 The underlying idea is simple: more diverse ethnic groups experienced larger variations across individuals in intergenerationally transmitted traits (e.g., preferences, skills, human capital), which increased the complementarities between individuals and between individuals and their environment.Footnote 8 Specifically, differences across individuals in intergenerationally transmitted traits, allowed them to better exploit the potential gains of increased occupational specialization.Footnote 9 Therefore, during the pre-industrial era economic specialization should emerge and be more prevalent among diverse ethnic groups. Additionally, since diverse geographical environments should allow diverse ethnic groups to generate larger complementarities, diverse ethnicities inhabiting diverse environments should have a larger division of labor. To empirically test the aforementioned predictions, this research combines geocoded ethnographic, linguistic and genetic data to construct a novel dataset of measures of intra-ethnic diversity and economic specialization for pre-industrial ethnic groups. In particular, for over 1100 ethnicities, the research constructs novel measures of economic specialization, based on the number of economic activities in which specialization existed in the pre-industrial era. By performing the analysis at the ethnic level, the research sidesteps potential pitfalls from the aggregation of data (e.g., to the country level). Thus, the analysis focuses on the effects of intra-ethnic diversity, mitigating the potential confounding effects of country-level inter-ethnic diversity, which have been widely explored in the literature. A major challenge for the analysis is the measurement of diversity within an ethnic group in the past. The lack of direct measures of skills, preferences or other relevant intergenerationally transmitted traits for individuals within an ethnicity, rules out the direct measurement of historical intra-ethnic diversity in those specific traits. To address this problem, Ashraf and Galor (2013b) have suggested using measures of genetic diversity as proxies for population diversity, which have been widely used in the ensuing literature. Our research generalizes this approach and addresses this challenge by additionally introducing novel measures of intra-ethnic linguistic diversity.Footnote 10 In particular, language and genetic material are also intergenerationally transmitted, and as shown below, share with other intergenerationally transmitted traits the common historical source of exogenous variation identified by Ashraf and Galor (2013b). Based on this fact, our analysis employs these measures of genetic and linguistic dirversity as proxies of historical intra-ethnic diversity in intergenerationally transmitted traits. Moreover, it shows that even if genetic and linguistic diversity do not have a direct effect on the division of labor, they still capture the effect of diversity in relevant traits of the population. Thus, these measures of genetic and linguistic diversity capture general aspects of historical intra-ethnic diversity, above and beyond genes and phonemes.Footnote 11 The research explores the deep historical roots of the division of labor, by analyzing the effect of intra-ethnic diversity on the prevalence of economic specialization in pre-industrial times across ethnic groups in various steps. First, using ordinary least squares and a restricted sample of ethnicities for which ethnographic, genetic and linguistic data exist, the empirical analysis documents the robust positive statistically and economically significant relation between diversity and economic specialization. Clearly, these statistical associations do not necessarily imply causality and could arise from omitted confounders, such as heterogeneity in environmental factors, or as a result of reverse causality from, for instance, the emergence of institutions on the composition of populations. In order to mitigate these potential concerns, the research follows several strategies. First, it accounts for the confounding effect of a large set of geographical controls of the ethnic homeland. Second, it shows that the main results are not driven by other plausible sources for the emergence of economic specialization such as variation in agricultural suitability, ecological diversity, spatial and intertemporal temperature volatility, pre-1500CE caloric suitability and mobility costs.Footnote 12 Third, it follows the instrumental variable approach introduced by Ashraf and Galor (2013b), and exploits the exogenous variation in intra-ethnic diversity generated by a fundamental statistical process brought about by historical migratory patterns known as a serial founder effect (SFE).Footnote 13 Indeed, as could be expected in an era when populations were small and knowledge and culture, among others, were passed orally between generations, the decrease in diversity along historical migratory routes has been documented for various intergenerationally transmitted traits. In particular, the diversity in the shape and size of arrow heads and handaxes, cultural memes, and phenotypes, as well as the proxies of intra-ethnic diversity based on genetic and linguistic data used in this paper, have been shown to follow a serial founder effect (Ramachandran et al. 2005; Lycett and von Cramon-Taubadel 2008; Lycett 2008; Hamilton and Buchanan 2009; Betti et al. 2009; Rogers et al. 2009; Atkinson 2011; Creanza et al. 2015). Reassuringly, after exploiting these three strategies jointly, the research finds a positive robust relation between intra-ethnic diversity and the prevalence of economic specialization for the restricted sample of ethnic groups. Additionally, it proposes conditions under which the estimated coefficient provides a lower bound for the true causal effect, suggesting an economically significant positive effect of intra-ethnic diversity. In a second stage of the analysis, the research exploits the implications of the serial founder effect and a two-step econometric method to generate predicted intra-ethnic diversity measures (Murphy and Topel 2002; Ashraf and Galor 2013b). This allows the analysis to be performed on a sample of more than 900 ethnicities. By increasing the sample size, the analysis mitigates potential concerns regarding geographical coverage and representativeness of the restricted sample. Moreover, the increased sample size permits the relation between intra-ethnic diversity and specialization to be estimated more precisely. Reassuringly, and in line with the proposed hypothesis, the estimated relation between intra-ethnic diversity and the prevalence of economic specialization is positive, statistically and economically significant. Moreover, the research finds a positive complementarity between an ethnicity’s diversity and the diversity of the environment it inhabits on the prevalence of economic specialization. These results are robust to large battery of tests, including different measures of economic specialization, accounting for a large set of historical and cultural confounders, econometric specifications, multiple hypothesis testing, among many others. The analysis also explores the relative importance of intra-ethnic diversity as a determinant of economic specialization. Indeed, it documents that the variation uniquely associated with intra-ethnic diversity is larger than the one associated with all other determinants included in the analysis. These findings provide evidence that is consistent with a fundamental role of intra-ethnic diversity as a determinant of economic specialization across ethnicities. Furthermore, the analysis explores the relation between intra-ethnic diversity, economic specialization and development outcomes. Specifically, it provides evidence that intra-ethnic diversity has a large direct effect on economic specialization, which is not mediated by other development outcomes. Additionally, it suggests that economic specialization plays a fundamental mediating role in the link between population diversity and development. This research is the first attempt to identify the deep-rooted historical factors behind the prevalence of economic specialization in pre-industrial times across ethnic groups. Moreover, it is the first to document the robust positive effect of (1) intra-ethnic diversity and (2) the complementarity between the heterogeneity of both population and environment on economic specialization. Additionally, it is the first paper to use measures of linguistic diversity (within a language) to proxy for intra-population diversity. Also, it provides a conceptual empirical framework to rationalize the use of these measures of genetic and linguistic diversity as proxies for population diversity in general. In doing so, this research contributes to various strands of literature. First, this research contributes to the literature studying societal attributes in the past (Ahlerup and Olsson 2012; Michalopoulos 2012; Giuliano and Nunn 2013; Fenske 2014). In particular, it sheds light on the origins of a fundamental driver of economic development in the pre-industrial and contemporary eras (Smith 1776). Given the persistence of culture, institutions, human capital and technology, and their effect on development, the findings suggest a novel potential source of economic development (Diamond 1997; Glaeser et al. 2004; Acemoglu et al. 2005; Nunn 2008; Alesina et al. 2013; Ashraf and Galor 2013b; Michalopoulos and Papaioannou 2013; Spolaore and Wacziarg 2013; Depetris-Chauvin 2014; Galor and Özak 2016; Andersen et al. 2016).Footnote 14 Additionally, by unveiling the complementarities between population and the environment the analysis bridges the gap between the literature that focuses on their independent roles in shaping long-run development (Michalopoulos 2012; Alesina et al. 2013; Ashraf and Galor 2013b; Galor and Özak 2016; Giuliano and Nunn 2017). Second, this research contributes to the literature on the effects of diversity on economic development, which has previously been explored using various country-level measures of genetic, ethnic, cultural, and religious diversity (Easterly and Levine 1997; Alesina et al. 2003; Desmet et al. 2012, 2015; Ashraf and Galor 2013a, b; Arbatlı et al. 2020; Cook 2015; Alesina et al. 2016). While most of the existing empirical evidence, suggests that diversity adversely affects contemporary social cohesiveness and development, this paper documents a positive effect of intra-ethnic diversity on a key driver of economic development. By doing so, it provides prima-facie empirical evidence consistent with the upward sloping side of the hump-shaped relationship between diversity and economic development established by Ashraf and Galor (2013b). Thus, it complements the previous findings associating positively genetic diversity to economic outcomes (Ager and Brueckner 2018; Cook and Fletcher 2018). Finally, this research contributes to the emerging literature that uses genetic diversity to understand the deep-rooted determinants of modern comparative development (Ashraf and Galor 2013b; Arbatlı et al. 2020; Ashraf and Galor 2013a; Cook 2015). By additionally using linguistic data, this is the first paper to exploit non-genetic historical proxies of intra-ethnic diversity in the literature. This analysis sheds new light on the role of these proxies of intra-ethnic diversity as drivers of comparative development across the globe. Specifically, they provide support the view that neutral genetic diversity reflects a wider range of non-neutral human characteristics (Ashraf and Galor 2018). The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the empirical strategy and describes the data. Section 3 analyzes the impact of intra-ethnic diversity on economic specialization. Section 5 explores the robustness of the results. Section 6 concludes.",1

Fulford,Ivan Petkov,Fabio Schiantarelli,Male,Male,Male,Male,"What impact do immigrants and their descendants have in their new homes in the short and long term? The answer depends on the attributes they bring with them, what they pass on to their children, and how they interact with other groups. When people move to a new place, they leave behind the complex interactions of institutions, culture, and geography that determine economic outcomes in their homeland. They bring with them their own human capital and their cultural values, norms, and knowledge and experience of institutions. These values and experiences help shape the way they interact with others, the institutions they form in their new home, and their incentives for investing in human and physical capital. Because immigrants pass on many traits to their children, the effects of immigration do not end in the first generation and they may become even more important as new groups change the society around them.Footnote 1 This paper uses the large and diverse migration to and within the United States over a century and a half to study the effect of the changing ancestry mix on local economic development. The United States constitutes an ideal laboratory to address this issue because of the large immigration flows from many countries that characterize its history (Daniels 2002, pp. 24–25). These immigrants came to the United States from different parts of the world with diverse histories and cultures. Some were brought against their will as slaves; others decided to come for economic reasons, or seeking religious or political freedom. Once here, the immigrants and their descendants had to negotiate economic, cultural, and institutional relationships with other groups who were there before them or settled after them. To perform our analysis, we build two unique new data sets. Using individual records from the US census going back to 1850, we construct the country-of-ancestry composition of each US county’s population. Crucially, we produce an objective measure of the ancestry composition of the full population, not just of first-generation immigrants, and so we are able to capture the long-term impact of groups and their descendants as they come to the US and move within it.Footnote 2 Second, we create a more comprehensive measure of the GDP of each county going back to 1850 that includes agriculture, manufacturing, and services. While measures of manufacturing output and intermediate inputs and agricultural output have been available at the county level, we construct measures of value added for both sectors. More importantly, focusing only on manufacturing and agriculture overlooks the large and growing contribution of the service sector, and so undervalues urban areas and misses the important and changing role played by the transportation, distribution, and financial sectors. We address three central questions: Do ancestry groups have different effects on local development? If so, which characteristics brought from the country of origin explain why groups have different effects? As groups come together and interact, what is the impact of ancestry diversity? Importantly, we focus on whether the mix of ancestries matters, not the impact of increased total population from immigration or internal population growth. Our work shows that (1) groups have different economic impacts, (2) these impacts are closely related to characteristics in the origin country, and (3) that overall diversity has both positive and negative consequences, depending on the form of diversity. To help separate the economic effects of people and what they bring with them from the economic effects of a place’s characteristics we take several approaches that deal with distinct problems. First, our long panel allows us to control for unobservable county characteristics and hence separate out the effects of the evolving ancestry composition from time invariant characteristics of a county. Doing so removes the endogeneity that arises if certain ancestry groups are attracted to places with particular characteristics. We show that not controlling for the these fixed characteristics leads to misleading conclusions about the effect of the endowment characteristics brought by immigrants from the origin country. This time-invariant type of endogeneity is not the only problem that must be addressed if one wants to make causal statements about the effect of ancestry composition on local development. It is also possible that ancestry groups with particular endowments are more willing to move in response to short-term county-specific economic shocks, creating a form of short-term reverse causality. We address this potential additional source of endogeneity using three instrumental variables approaches. The conclusions we arrive at when instrumenting under each approach are similar to each other. They are also similar to the conclusions based on estimates obtained without instrumenting, suggesting that the biases arising from group-specific endogenous migration in response to shocks are a lesser concern compared to the importance of controlling for time-invariant county characteristics. First, we create an instrument for each county’s share of a given ancestry using the share in the past and growth in that ancestry nationally, excluding the county’s state.Footnote 3 Doing so removes any county-ancestry specific pull factors. Second, we build an instrument for ancestry share using the the interaction of immigrant arrival times with the development of the railroad and highway transportation network that builds on Sequeira et al. (2019). Because immigrant groups arrived at different times, groups were exposed to different transportation networks, so decided to go to different places for reasons that depend in large part on when they moved. We discuss how one can isolate from this information county-ancestry level variation that can be treated as exogenous, as it is unlikely to be related to group characteristics that may lead a particular ancestry to move disproportionately to a given county following a shock to local development opportunities. Finally, we present dynamic panel GMM results (Holtz-Eakin et al. 1988; Arellano and Bond 1991) that rely on appropriately lagged values of the regressors as instruments and address the potential issue of the Nickell (1981) bias when the time dimension of the panel is short. At their core, both the first approach and the GMM approach rely on the past distribution of ancestries. Because the vast majority of the population does not move from decade to decade, the ancestry distribution in one decade is highly predictive of the distribution in the next, so these instruments have highly predictive first stages. Of course, the validity of these instruments relies on the past shares being uncorrelated with current shocks. We are thus careful to use this approach only in dynamic models where we can test for—and reject—the presence of serial correlation in the error term. The instrument based on the interaction between immigrant arrival time and the railway and highway network is less dependent on the ancestry shares in the recent past and only uses the shares in 1870. It is comforting that the basic conclusions remain very similar across the three approaches. We first show that ancestry groups have different effects on county GDP per worker, even after after we control for county-specific fixed effects, race, and other observables. The effects of different groups are correlated with characteristics of the country of origin. As a summary measure of what groups bring with them, we construct the average origin GDP per person in each county by weighting origin country GDP per person by the share of each ancestry in a county. When internal or external migration results in a county’s residents coming from 1% higher GDP per person countries on average, county GDP per worker increases by 0.3% in the first decade and 0.6% in the long run. The impact grows over time, reaching its peak only after several decades. These effects do not seem to be related to origin-country inequality, suggestion that a model of self-selection, such as Borjas (1987), is not likely to be driving the results. The relationship between origin GDP and county GDP per worker shows that there must be something important for economic development that is transportable and inheritable. We examine possible origin characteristics that might explain the relationship. What appears to matter most for local economic development are cultural characteristics that capture the ability of people to productively interact with others (Tabellini 2010). Moreover, it also matters whether immigrants came from a country with a long history of a centralized state not subject to foreign domination (Bockstette et al. 2002; Putterman and Weil 2010). Origin political institutions that may change rapidly and may not be deeply embedded in the immigrants’ beliefs or values, such as constraints on executive power or political participation, are not important for the impact of immigrants once we control for their experience of a strong state. Over the long-term, the human capital of migrants is not significantly associated with local economic development once other endowments are controlled for, perhaps because public schooling reduces educational differences and schooling policies respond endogenously to immigration flows (Bandiera et al. 2019). Diversity has both positive and negative effects. Immigrants and their descendants must interact with other groups from different backgrounds, and the full impact of immigration depends on these interactions. When ancestry diversity increases, so does GDP per worker. Despite the often negative views that greet new groups, more diversity is actually good for growth. Yet when groups have important cultural differences that may affect their ability to interact with others, diversity has a negative effect on local economic development. The results suggest that when groups have to share a place and work together, diversity is good, as long as there is a degree of agreement in terms of cultural values that facilitate exchange, production, and reaching agreement in the public sphere. We provide evidence that the positive effect of ancestry diversity on development is partly explained by the fact that greater ancestry fractionalization is associated with a richer menu of locally available skills. More diverse places can have greater specialization and returns from trade. The structure of the paper is as follows: after discussing the relationship with the literature in Sect. 2, we describe the evolution of ancestry and its construction in Sect. 3 and describe the construction of county level GDP in Sect. 4; Section 5 contains the main results, Sect. 6 explores possible mechanisms, while Sect. 7 concludes.",1

25,4,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-020-09184-5,Legacies of inequality: the case of Brazil,Evan Wigton-Jones,,,Male,,,Male,"Most contemporary economic literature holds inequality to be a key determinant of development. Nevertheless, a consensus has yet to emerge on the key elements of this relationship, including the aspects of development most directly influenced by the distribution of resources, the mechanisms through which inequality may affect development, and even the underlying causes of inequality itself. In this study I examine each of these questions in the context of Brazil. Brazil provides a useful context for the study of inequality as the country’s long agrarian history has made land a uniquely valuable asset which well-reflects broader inequality in welfare. Furthermore, the substantial intra-country variation in the distribution of landholdings, along with a high degree of local government autonomy, allows for a more comprehensive analysis of inequality on within-country development. A key theme of this paper is that local inequality is in part determined by those environmental conditions which govern the suitability of the climate for plantation versus smallholder agricultural production. I then show that the resulting distribution of land influenced the structure of local institutions, the persistence of economic inequality over time, as well as contemporary economic development. Importantly, the effects inequality can be difficult to quantify since a given distribution of resources is frequently correlated with a variety of confounding factors that can bias estimates in an ordinary least squares specification. To circumvent this endogeneity problem, I instrument for the local distribution of landholdings in 1920 using a new index that captures the suitability of the climate for plantation over smallholder agriculture in a two-stage least squares instrumental variables framework. This instrument compares a locality’s long-run temperature and precipitation conditions to those necessary for the production of certain crops which are more biologically suited for plantation or smallholder production. Here I use scientific taxonomies to identify these types of crops: Growing conditions for cereals in the Pooidieae subfamily and bean species of the Phaseolus genus are used to characterize a locality’s suitability for smallholder agriculture; those for plants in the Saccharum (sugarcane) and Coffea (coffee) genera are used to assess the climatic amenability for plantation agriculture. I show that this instrument, which is based on multiple crops within these taxonomies, is a robust predictor of land inequality and consititutes a stronger metric than similiar climate-based instruments, such as that of Easterly (2007). I argue that this local distribution of land influenced the extent to which a small group of landowners could shape local institutions to serve their own interests instead of those of the general public. I argue that this power was attenuated considerably in municipalities with a more egalitarian distribution of land, where elites held relatively less sway. Consistent with this hypothesis, I find that historically unequal areas devote significantly less public spending to welfare and public goods. Such areas also score lower on metrics of local government quality and efficiency, and spend less per-child on education. Furthermore, historical inequality has a detrimental effect on development, as measured by the local Human Development Index (HDI). I find that the latter effect may be due to a delayed transition of the local economy from agriculture to industry/services, as historical inequality is associated with a greater dependence of the local economy on agriculture. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, I provide evidence that historical inequality can exert a strong detrimental effect on institutional and economic development. This research is thus similar to other studies of the historical determinants of institutions, such as those by Acemoglu et al. (2001, (2002) and Engerman and Sokoloff (2000). Consistent with the previous studies, I find evidence that higher inequality yields extractive institutions in which spending on welfare and public goods is reduced considerably. Here local governing norms appear to prioritize the needs of the elite over the general public. However, I also find that the agrarian elite appear to act on their economic incentive to slow the transition of the local economy from agriculture to industry or services, as historically unequal areas have a greater share of their local GDP based on agriculture, and a larger proportion of their workforce in the agricultural sector. This latter channel is consistent with the theoretical predictions of Galor et al. (2009). That both channels appear to manifest in Brazil is likely due to the extreme nature of local inequality within the country and its strong persistence throughout the 20th century. Additionally, this paper contributes to a growing literature on geographic endowments and long-run development. This is a theme that has received a renewed interest in recent years (for example, by Nunn and Qian 2011; Easterly 2007, and in the Brazilian context by Summerhill 2010). An important finding of this research is that such endowments can create a path dependency even within countries. When local governments have a degree of autonomy over the allocation of public resources, they may be just as susceptible to elite capture as those at a national level. In such cases, the local governing norms and distribution of resources may persist for generations, even when, as in the case of Brazil, there are significant changes in national-level institutions. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the relevant theoretical and empirical literature on inequality. In Sect. 3 discuss inequality and development in the context of Brazil, while in Sect. 4 describe the Plantation Suitability Index (PSI). The main empirical specifications are introduced in Sect. 5. In this Sect. 1 also discuss alternative determinants of Brazilian development which may serve as confounding factors in the empirical analysis: My strategy for accounting for such factors is described here as well. Section 6 describes the main empirical results, while in Sect. 7 discuss a number of robustness checks. Section 8 concludes.",1
26,1,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-020-09185-4,Disease and demographic development: the legacy of the plague,Fabian Siuda,Uwe Sunde,,Male,Male,,Male,"The reason for development differences across countries and regions remains one of the long-standing questions in economics. In view of the non-monotonic dynamics of long-run development and the crucial role of the demographic transition for the take-off in economic development, the answer to this question is closely related to the timing of the demographic transition, as maintained by unified growth theories. In particular, it was the deliberate reduction in fertility that allowed for intensified child rearing, increased human capital investment, and ultimately a sustained increase in incomes per capita in the context of continuing productivity improvements (Galor and Weil 2000; Galor 2011). Consequently, the onset of the fertility transition represents the key turning point, not only for population dynamics and education, but also for the transition to sustained growth. While there is widespread agreement about the role of the fertility transition for the economic take-off as the central building block of the mechanisms underlying unified growth theory and ample evidence regarding the mechanics of these transitions, there is relatively little empirical work in economics that has investigated the determinants of the timing of the fertility transition. This paper explores the empirical relevance of the hypothesis that the exposure to repeated population shocks related to epidemics influenced the population equilibrium and ultimately the timing of the fertility transition. This hypothesis is motivated by earlier research that conjectured that population shocks related to the Black Death triggered adjustment mechanisms that led to shifts in the Malthusian equilibrium with the consequence of higher population density (Voigtländer and Voth 2013a, b), which provided the ground for the transition from Malthusian stagnation to a modern growth regime (Galor and Weil 2000). Evidence on this conjecture is scant, however. The empirical analysis investigates whether the timing of the onset of the fertility transition in cities or regions in Germany was influenced by the exposure to repeated outbreaks of the plague. The implementation of an empirical strategy to test the hypothesis requires a plausible measure of exposure to repeated plague outbreaks. Since the effect of interest is that of an accumulated exposure, and since conceptually this exposure can be measured in various ways, the empirical strategy is based on a proxy variable approach that makes use of various, mutually non-exclusive proxies for plague exposure. The first measure of plague exposure is the number of plague outbreaks. Empirical results based on this proxy indeed provide evidence that the experience of more frequent plague-related population shocks was also associated with an earlier fertility transition. In addition to plague outbreaks, the empirical strategy also makes use of a second set of proxy variable that accounts for variation in the spread of repeated outbreaks of plagues in Europe during the Middle Ages by measuring the travel distance to the ports from which the plague spread after new outbreaks. The respective measures make use of the fact that cities that were closer to these harbors were affected more by outbreaks of the plague. Outbreaks spread inland along medieval travel routes with an intensity that decreased in travel distance to these entry ports, regardless of whether outbreaks of the plague after the 1348 outbreak of the Black Death occurred spontaneously from reservoirs in Europe or from reintroductions from Asia. A second set of empirical results reveals that greater exposure to plague outbreaks as proxied by greater proximity to the nearest entry port is associated with a significantly earlier onset of the demographic transition. Both plague outbreaks and geographic proximity to entry ports of plague waves are imperfect proxies that contain distinct but mutually non-exclusive variation that is relevant for the hypothesis to be tested. To rule out spurious results, the analysis controls for an extensive set of additional variables that potentially affect the timing of the fertility transition. The extensive specification of the empirical model makes it unlikely that the finding is driven by third factors, but at the same time it is difficult if not impossible to fully disentangle the role of medieval trade from exposure to plague outbreaks. To explore this issue, the empirical analysis applies various robustness checks that verify that plague-related population shocks affect the timing of the demographic transition. The results are robust to controlling for other characteristics, including access to medieval and 19th century trade routes that have been conjectured to be relevant predictors of the demographic transition, as well as accounting for additional historical and geographic information. In particular, by accounting for access to maritime trade routes, access to the hanseatic trade network, and trade networks during the 19th century, the analysis disentangles the role of population shocks related to medieval plague exposure from effects that are exclusively related to 19th century trade or other mechanisms, such as the demand for human capital, that affect the timing of the transition but are not related to population shocks. An instrumental variables approach that uses travel time to the nearest entry port as instrument for the number of plague outbreaks also confirms the finding that cities that were more exposed to plague outbreaks showed an earlier onset of the demographic transition. Additional analyses reveal that similar patterns are also found for France, providing additional support for the external validity of the results. Taken together, the empirical results support the hypothesis that the fertility decline in the context of the demographic transition occurred earlier in cities and regions that were more exposed to the plague and correspondingly experienced more frequent plague-related population shocks. The paper contributes to the literature in several ways. The results provide empirical support for some of the central predictions of unified growth theory, according to which the demographic transition, which was the prerequisite for long-run development, was fostered by reduced Malthusian population pressure and an increase in the demand for skills (Galor and Weil 2000; Galor 2011). Despite the important negative short-run consequences of disease shocks (see, e.g., Chakraborty et al. 2010; Bhattacharya and Chakraborty 2016) and the set-backs in long-run development caused by repeated epidemic shocks (Lagerlöf 2003), the evidence shown here suggests that frequent exposure to diseases might indeed have induced transitions to Malthusian steady states with higher population density as response to major population shocks and as consequence of behavioral responses that foster development in the long-run. The findings thereby provide empirical support for the implications of the mechanisms proposed by Voigtländer and Voth (2013a), who suggest that exogenous disease shocks like the outbreak of the Black Death might have triggered a transition to a new Malthusian equilibrium with higher wages and population density, with important consequences for long-run development. For instance, plague-related population shocks might have ultimately triggered fertility reduction by fostering female employment and delaying marriage and childbirth (Voigtländer and Voth 2013b, see also Clark 2008), although this pattern was more prevalent in Northern Europe than in Southern regions like Italy (de Moor and van Zanden 2010). The empirical validity of this channel is also a matter of ongoing debate in light of findings that delayed marriage did not affect total fertility Ortmayr (1995) and that the plague exhibited a similar age pattern in mortality for men and women, while there are no significant gender-differences in mortality (De Witte 2010; Curtis and Roosen 2017; Alfani and Murphy 2017; Alfani and Bonetti 2019), implying that the potential comparative advantage underlying this mechanism might have been weaker than previously thought. Alternatively, plague shocks might have led to changes in household composition that favored investments in child quality. If smaller households were more affected by plague shocks than larger households, as suggested by recent evidence by Alfani and Bonetti (2019), and had a greater propensity toward child quality and more resources to spend on each child, a quantity-quality argument would imply that this led to a shift in the Malthusian equilibrium and ultimately led to an earlier transition from a Malthusian or post-Malthusian equilibrium to a modern growth regime.Footnote 1 While the findings presented in this paper are not suited for disentangling the empirical relevance of the different mechanisms that have been proposed in the literature, they suggest that greater plague exposure was associated with an earlier fertility decline. In this sense, the results also complement recent evidence for England by Crafts and Mills (2017) that is overall consistent with the view that the plague shifted the pre-industrial Malthusian equilibrium and eventually gave rise to a demographic transition that marked the onset of modern growth. Likewise, Dittmar and Meisenzahl (2020) find evidence that plague outbreaks led to the adoption of policies and institutions that were favored by the protestant reformation and that fostered human capital acquisition and greater population growth until the 19th century. While their argument rests on the randomness of the timing outbreaks during a short period, our analysis is based on the overall exposure to plague-related shocks. Our results add to their findings by providing new information about the heterogeneity of the timing of the fertility transition about one century later. Using spatial variation in the plague-related mortality at the city level, Jebwab et al. (2019) explore the impact of the outbreak of the Black Death 1347–1352 on city growth. They present new evidence for the duration until the populations recovered as well as its determinants and document heterogeneity regarding geographic endowments of cities in terms of land suitability and access to trade networks. On the other hand, recent work by Alfani and Percoco (2019) on Italian cities suggests that the plague epidemic of 1629-30 represented a productivity shock that caused a long-run decline in city growth and urbanization rates. The empirical analysis in this paper provides evidence that complements these findings by documenting that repeated plague outbreaks might in fact have led to an earlier fertility transition once controlling for heterogeneity in other factors.Footnote 2 At the same time, the approach focuses on a confined area of comparable geography, demography, and institutional environment in Northern Europe, thereby to a certain extent implicitly accounting for the heterogeneity of the impact of the plague that has been documented by Pamuk (2007) and more recently by Alfani (2013) in the context of Europe. The findings thereby also contribute an explanation for the heterogeneity in fertility dynamics across regions that eventually converged in the context of changes in transportation and migration, as recently documented by Daudin et al. (2019). Our findings also complement evidence that fertility reductions in Germany and France were linked to increased education (Becker et al. 2010, 2013, Murphy 2015, de la Croix and Perrin 2018) consistent with the unified growth perspective of a close link between the fertility transition, education and economic development. This paper adds the exposure to population shocks during the middle ages as a long-run determinant of the relative timing of the transition in different regions. The empirical findings also complement evidence of higher education attainment in predominantly Protestant areas (Becker and Woessmann 2008, 2009, 2010), while Protestantism was mainly adopted in regions where the return to education was comparably high, related to, e.g., access to major trade routes of the time, which affected the demographic dynamics above and beyond the distance to entry ports of reintroduced plague outbreaks (Cervellati and Sunde 2016). The results are also consistent with a role of greater life expectancy for long-run development (Cervellati and Sunde 2013, 2015), because plague outbreaks represent infrequent epidemics that unfold their consequences through population dynamics at the macro level rather than through individual incentives for education attainment. Finally, the use of disaggregate data complements recent evidence for the role of policies, such as the introduction of public health systems, for longevity and development (Strittmatter and Sunde 2013). The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the background of the resurgent outbreaks of the plague in Europe and the resulting hypothesis. Section 3 describes the data and the empirical strategy. Section 4 presents the main results. Section 5 provides a discussion of the findings.",1
26,1,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-021-09186-x,The American System of economic growth,Marvin Goodfriend,John McDermott,,Male,Male,,Male,"Modern economic growth took off in Great Britain after the Industrial Revolution that began in the eighteenth century. In this paper we explore the idea that it accelerated in the nineteenth century with the development of the “American System of Manufactures”, the use of standardized, interchangeable parts in production. This shift, we believe, conferred a temporary growth advantage to the US economy, but as it diffused around the world by the twentieth century, the US advantage disappeared. Still, the American System itself has had long lasting effects on world growth and human capital accumulation. We focus our discussion on the US and show that our model can account for the relative stability of growthFootnote 1 since 1860 in spite of major structural change.Footnote 2 It can also account for a growth slowdown like the one we have witnessed since about 1980. The American System of Manufactures was the name given to the novel method of production in the United States that used interchangeable parts as a way to economize on the craft skill necessary to “fit” components into final goods. To assist this “assembling” that replaced the more time-consuming and skill-intensive “fitting” also required the invention and diffusion of specialized machines. The usefulness of knowledge and skill moved over time from finishing tasks in the later stages of production to the creation of intermediate, specialized machines in the early stages of production. In our model, this can result in a net economization of knowledge and a reduction in the rate at which it is rational to accumulate human capital. Growth might slow. Another, less emphasized, feature of American industrial history was the sharing of technical information within and across industries. Compared to Great Britain and Continental Europe, according to some historians, the flow of technical knowledge in the United States was appreciably freer in the nineteenth century and contributed greatly to the development of the system of standardization and reduction in reliance on craft skill.Footnote 3 The model has two final goods that are perfect substitutes in consumption. We refer to the final goods as “conventional” or “advanced” depending on how intermediate inputs are combined—or processed—into final goods. Human capital enhances the productivity of labor in the processing of conventional intermediates into final goods—this is the fitting—but does not raise labor productivity in the processing—or assembling—of advanced intermediates. Unskilled labor is just as productive as skilled labor in processing intermediates using the advanced technology. Katz and Margo (2014) call such workers “operatives”—workers with limited skill that assembled intermediate inputs into final goods. Early in the history of the American System, human capital was naturally predominantly occupied in industries using conventional techniques. It was this stock of knowledge—which was accustomed to the difficulties of fitting custom intermediates into final goods—that was used to adapt and create specialized machine tools designed to substitute for craft skill in the fitting stage of final-good production. Our view is that this reservoir of knowledge in conventional technologies spilled over to reduce the cost and increase the productivity of the new machine tools, which we identify with advanced intermediate goods. This important feature of the model provides an explanation for why the advanced technology could begin at small scale. Conventional intermediate inputs, on the other hand, were limited in terms of potential productivity. These limitations are spelled out in Sect. 2, where we briefly review the evolution of industry in the United States in the nineteenth century. Individuals in the model accumulate new knowledge by allocating time to learning as in the work of Lucas (1988). The productivity of learning time depends on the individual’s human capital, and is enhanced by a learning externality based on the variety of intermediate goods (Goodfriend and McDermott 1995, 1998). As population grows and individuals accumulate human capital, more firms find it profitable to enter intermediate-good production whose fixed costs can be spread over a larger volume of output. In this way, the model exhibits increasing returns as in the models of Romer (1987, 1990). This scale effect lifts output and real wages. As human capital increases, intermediate firms take advantage of knowledge spillovers to introduce machine tools that save on skilled effort, raising the wage in advanced processing more than in conventional processing. Labor moves from conventional to advanced production technology. This result—that advanced processing gradually replaces conventional processing—diminishes the incentive to accumulate knowledge because the advanced technology economizes on human capital in the processing stage. The model is motivated by manufacturing, but the phenomenon appears to extend to services, retail, and even agricultural production. Computers and the internet, for example, allow people with little medical or financial knowledge to self-diagnose and invest in complex financial instruments. Bar codes and scanners allow retail outlets to hire people who may possess very limited skill with numbers. The internet has allowed the simultaneous production and consumption of many kinds of entertainment, service, and education. This is why we simulate the model to analyze both transitional and steady-state growth from 1860 to the present and beyond. The American System model succeeds well in reconciling the growth facts mentioned at the outset. The baseline model simulation closely matches the average 1.88% per capita product growth rate since 1860 in the United States. The simulation predicts that long-run per capita product growth peaked in 1980 at 1.914% and will eventually fall to 1.31%, as the share of unskilled work rises to 50%. Our simulated American System model offers an alternative perspective on recent growth and its slowdown documented in Fernald (2015) and highlighted in much recent work. Some of this literature emphasizes innovations in information technology in the late twentieth century whose diffusion caused a rise then decline in growth (Fernald 2015; Aghion et al. 2019), perhaps related to shifts in the ability to create tasks that utilize the new technologies (Acemoglu and Restrepo 2018). Other work emphasizes the onset of secular stagnation, perhaps due to the financial overhang following the Great Recession (Summers 2018). Another strand focuses on the assumption that by the middle of the twentieth century, all of the most important inventions had already been discovered (Cowen 2011; Gordon 2016). The argument in Jones (2002) and Fernald and Jones (2014) is compatible with a story in which investment in resources and education cannot sustain the near-constant, high growth that characterized the twentieth century. A more optimistic strand finds that long lags and costly implementation are responsible for the current slowdown, but that there is much reason for optimism as AI technologies finally kick in (Brynjolfsson et al. 2018). Yet another branch locates the slowdown in the decline in the ability to educate our young people (Goldin and Katz 2008). Our model shares some features of many of these papers, but foresees a permanent growth slowdown rooted from the beginning in the economization of skilled labor inherent in the American System of Manufactures. Our model is rooted in the product variety approach to growth that originated with Romer (1987, 1990), but it is related to the Schumpeterian view that arose around the same time with the work of Aghion and Howitt (1992, 1998). That approach locates the source of growth in investment in research time, similar to our learning, which affects the arrival rate of new inventions that replace old ones and destroy existing firms. In our model, firms never disappear, even in the conventional sector that loses labor. Both approaches feature economies of scale through specialization, and temporary monopoly profit, but the dynamics of the growth process are different. Our creative destruction happens in a relative sense, as the advanced sector becomes increasingly large relative to the conventional sector, but the latter never completely disappears.Footnote 4 In Sect. 2, we present a historical account of the revolutionary nature of the American System of Manufactures, drawing on the insights of historians of technology. We also marshal historical evidence to support our assumptions about the importance of knowledge diffusion in the American economy, especially compared to that of Great Britain and Europe at the time. In Sect. 3 we introduce the conventional and advanced goods-producing technologies. The learning technology is presented in Sect. 4. Section 5 derives the equilibria in the conventional and advanced processing sectors, separately. Section 6 links the conventional and advanced sectors by imposing wage equality, and examines the overall momentary equilibrium allocation of work effort. In Sect. 7 we analyze the conditions for a maximum to the household’s intertemporal problem and characterize the transitional dynamics of the endogenous growth model. In Sect. 8 we calibrate the model’s six parameters using value-added data taken from the Census of Manufactures in the nineteenth century, and a time series of the share of operatives in the total work force reported in the Historical Statistics of the United States (Carter et al. 2006). In Sect. 9, we simulate our model of the American System from 1860 forward through the twentieth century and beyond. We discuss the implications for learning in our model in Sect. 10. Sensitivity analysis is undertaken in Sect. 11 and, in Sect. 12, we point out that the latest incarnation of the American System of advanced processing technology facilitates the self-processing of goods and services by individuals alone. Section 13 concludes the paper.",1

Organized, complex, and hierarchical social structures—what we often call states—are a relatively recent phenomenon. States emerged gradually from around 3500 BCE, starting in a few corners of the world, in particular Mesopotamia, China, the Nile and Indus River Valleys, Mesoamerica, and the Andes (e.g., Service, 1975, Ch. 1; Borcan et al., 2018). A few millennia earlier, these same regions were also the first to enter the Neolithic Revolution, i.e., develop agriculture. Many have therefore hypothesized a causal link from the rise of agriculture to statehood. One proposed mechanism has been labelled the Surplus Theory. The idea is that agriculture caused, or allowed, the rise of states by raising output per unit of land, thus creating a “surplus” which could be stored, and then feed a ruling elite. By contrast, in human societies that rely on relatively low-yielding techniques to obtain food, no such elite population can be sustained, since everyone’s labor is needed for procuring food. Variations on this broad explanatory theme can be found in, e.g., Childe (1936, 1950), Allen (1997), Diamond (1997), Hibbs and Olsson (2004), Putterman (2008, Section IV), and Borcan et al. (2020).Footnote 1 Another mechanism, proposed by Scott (2009, 2017), Mayshar et al. (2017, 2020), has been labelled the Appropriability Theory. This emphasizes the characteristics of new crops that arrived with the Neolithic Revolution, in particular cereals. These were easier to expropriate than foods obtained through gathering or horticulture, specifically tubers. In support of this theory, Mayshar et al. (2020) document that statehood did not arise earlier in locations with higher agricultural yields overall, when controlling for the relative productivity of cereals and tubers. They also make the theoretical point that the Surplus Theory is hard to reconcile with a Malthusian model. This relates to the standard Malthusian result that steady-state incomes per agent are independent of land productivity, implying that the rate of extraction chosen by the elite should also be independent of land productivity. In this paper we propose a unified Malthusian framework that incorporates some elements of both of these theories. Decisions in this model are made by a ruler, representing an “embryonic” state, and by a continuum of subjects, whose incomes the ruler has some ability to expropriate. [The pre-existence of a ruler is not crucial. Prior to full-fledged statehood, we can think of this agent as a “chief,” or what Sahlins (1963) labelled a “big man.” This is discussed further in Sect. 3.6.] The size of the subject population evolves over time in a Malthusian fashion and depends on how much the (embryonic) ruler extracts. The extracted resources can be used for the ruler’s own consumption, or for two types of investment. First, he can invest in public goods, or what we call productive capacity. This captures the observation that early states were often instrumental in providing, e.g., irrigation (cf. Wittfogel, 1957; Nissen & Heine, 2009) and external defense (cf. Dal Bó et al., 2016). Second, the ruler can accumulate power, or capacity, to more easily extract resources in the future. We refer to this as investment in extractive capacity. One example of such investments could be the costly acquisition of knowledge about writing and record keeping, which have been important components of a state’s extractive apparatus (Scott, 2009, pp. 226–234; Stasavage, 2020, pp. 93–96). Another example could be the hiring of skilled administrators (Ertman, 1997, Ch. 1). Extractive and productive capacities are complementary: expanding production is more valuable when extracting it is easy, and improving extraction is more valuable when there is more to extract. This can give rise to multiple steady-state equilibria: one has low extractive capacity, low rates of extraction, and low levels of land productivity, population density, and output; another has high extractive capacity, high rates of extraction, and high levels of productivity, population density, and output. The way these steady states differ is a non-trivial insight. The population is denser in the very steady state where it is taxed more heavily, which is surprising given the Malthusian framework. It is the higher productive capacity in the high-extractive steady state that sustains that denser population. Also, the higher rate of extraction does not follow trivially from a higher level of extractive capacity. Rather, the ruler extracts more to finance investment in future extractive capacity. As in any model with multiple steady states, shocks can push the economy from one steady state to another. For example, a positive shock to extractive capacity, holding productive capacity constant, can push it from the low-extractive to the high-extractive steady state; a shock to productive capacity can cause the same type of transition, holding extractive capacity constant. In that sense, the workings of the model seem consistent with both the Appropriability and Surplus Theories. Moreover, we show that multiplicity of steady states hinges on the ruler being able to invest in both extractive and productive capacities; removing either channel renders the steady state unique. In other words, investments in extractive and productive capacities produce richer results together than each of them can on its own. To explore the empirical relevance of the model, we lean on the complementarity between productive and extractive capacities. This complementarity implies that land productivity should have a greater impact on state building when the return to investing in extractive capacity is higher. That return should arguably depend on how many existing states there are to copy from. To illustrate this, we consider an extended setting with many societies, and assume that the return to investing in extractive capacity faced by each ruler is increasing with the average level of extractive capacity across all societies. We then simulate the model, and let a few societies experience a positive shock to extractive capacity at some point, which pushes these to the high-extractive steady state. This in turn raises the return to investing in extractive capacity for the remaining societies, among which those with higher land productivity transition into statehood earlier than those with lower land productivity. This generates a positive relationship between land productivity and statehood across societies with late state development, but not among those with early state development. This pattern is consistent with cross-country data for the Eurasian continent. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Next, Sect. 2 discusses some of the existing literature. Section 3 sets up the benchmark model, and arrives at its main prediction about multiplicity of steady states. Section 4 then shows how this result falls apart when dropping investment in either extractive or productive capacities. Section 5 presents a simulation and some empirical evidence. Section 6 ends with a concluding discussion.",1
26,2,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-021-09189-8,Rising inequality and trends in leisure,Timo Boppart,L. Rachel Ngai,,Male,,,Male,"The distribution in income, consumption and wealth has received a lot of attention in economics in order to make statements about economic welfare. Income, consumption, and wealth, however, are all related to an individual’s market activity and ignore additional dimensions of heterogeneity outside the market place.Footnote 1 In the U.S. there have been significant changes in the allocation of time of different educational groups outside the market place. Overall leisure time has been trending up but this aggregate trend masks heterogeneity across skill groups. Whereas leisure time was relatively equally distributed across educational groups half a century ago, nowadays low skilled individuals enjoy (on average) systematically more leisure time. This increase in leisure inequality is partially mirrored in hours worked across skill groups; hours worked of high-skilled individuals decrease slower than for low skilled individuals. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a simple growth model that is consistent with both a rise in aggregate leisure and an increase in leisure inequality along a path of (exact) aggregate balanced growth. In our model individuals derive utility from market produced goods, home produced goods as well as leisure. There is rising wage inequality—modeled as exogenous changes in household-specific efficiency units—that drives the differential trends in hours.Footnote 2 As the relative implicit price of leisure increases over time due to technical change there is a general upward trend in leisure time. This is the case because leisure and the composite of market and home goods enters the utility function as gross complements such that the income effect of a wage change dominates its substitution effect. Hence, in the aggregate time series rising wages are associated with rising average leisure time whereas the cross-sectional micro data shows that households who experienced a faster wage growth, i.e., households with higher education, had a slower increase in leisure time. The key mechanism that allows us to square the two finding is intertemporal substitution of labor supplied to the market à la Lucas and Rapping (1969). Due to this intertemporal substitution, households who face a faster wage growth chose to raise leisure time more slowly, whereas in the aggregate time series households take more and more time off as the market productivity (and average wage) increases. Without intertemporal substitution of labor, a theory that matches the aggregate time series would also in the cross-section predict that a higher wage growth should be associated with faster rising leisure time. As a consequence without intertemporal leisure substitution the aggregate time series and cross-sectional micro patterns cannot be squared. The model economy consists of heterogeneous households with household-specific labor market efficiencies (per unit of time) and different levels of initial wealth. The distribution of labor market efficiencies can be interpreted as mapping into the distribution of educational qualifications. The household derives utility from the consumption of market goods, home goods and leisure goods. The key assumption is that high skilled households have a comparative advantage in the production of market goods as opposed to home and leisure goods. Market and home goods are gross substitutes with an elasticity of substitution higher than one (e.g., cooking at home vs. buying a take-away), but both are poor substitutes to leisure goods, with an elasticity of substitution less than one (as they are different type of goods, watching TV vs. having a haircut). Production of all three activities requires time and capital as inputs, and each activity has its own specific rate of TFP growth. In contrast to our approach, the literature typically models leisure time as directly generating utility. However, the majority of leisure time, such as watching TV, involves the usage of some capital (see table VII of Aguiar & Hurst, 2007a). As shown in the representative agent model in Ngai and Pissarides (2008), such a generalization allows for a trend in leisure along a path of balanced growth of the aggregate capital stock.Footnote 3 The optimal time allocation is driven by the relative opportunity costs of the three activities market, home and leisure as well as the intertemporal substitution of hours supplied to the market. Both the activity-specific TFP growth common to all households and the household-specific change in market efficiency of time affects the relative implicit prices of the different activities. Faster TFP growth in the market leads to a rising relative implicit prices of leisure. Given that leisure and non-leisure goods are gross complements, this relative price effect leads to a common shift in the time allocation of all households toward leisure. On the other hand, the household-specific change in the market efficiency of time, i.e., wages, induces through intertemporal substitution a skill group-specific deviations from the common trends. The growth in the marginal utility of market consumption is pinned down by an Euler equation and is equalized across all households, whereas there is an incentive to adjust labor supply along the intertemporal margin, i.e., households have an incentive to work relatively hard in periods of high relative wages. Increasing wage inequality then implies that the more-educated households tend to work (relatively) longer hours in later years whereas less-educated household tend to rather frontload their working hours. This leads to less of an increase in leisure for the more-educated whereas leisure increases over this period even more for the less-educated. So put together, the model can account for both the time series and cross-sectional facts on time allocation. The theory also speaks to the timing; in the 60s and 70s, when wage inequality did not rise, there is no change along the intertemporal margin and the households are expected to increase their leisure time pari passu. The theory predicts a rise in leisure inequality only after the 80s when wage rates systematically started to diverge across skill groups. To quantitatively assess the mechanism, we calibrate the parameters of the model to match perfectly the fractions of time allocated to the three activities of four education groups in the U.S. in the year 1965. We then calibrate in our model changes in relative labor efficiency units of the different groups to replicate the observed change in relative wages. Together with the overall productivity growth the implied wages make predictions for the dynamics of the time allocation. The model successfully captures the parallel rise and the subsequent divergence in leisure shares across the four education groups. Overall, it does also a good job in accounting for the aggregate trend in leisure and the rise in leisure inequality. It accounts for all the rise in aggregate leisure and slightly over-predicts the rise in leisure inequality. We conclude from this quantification that a simple model with intertemporal labor substitution can account for the observed pattern in the data. Consistent with the empirical work by Attanasio et al. (2015), our theory suggests that the rising leisure inequality needs to be taken into account together with the rising inequality in market outcomes in order to make welfare statements. Our paper contributes to this issue by developing a simple model to illustrate how increasing wage inequality itself can generate a rise in leisure inequality and partially mitigates the effect of wage inequality on welfare. This mitigating effect is also present in the calibrated model of Boerma and Karabarbounis (2020) based on expenditure and time-use data of the last two decades. In our theory, leisure production play an important role in squaring a trend in leisure time with an aggregate balanced growth path. This aspect is similar to Ngai and Pissarides (2008), which however abstracts from the cross-section facts.Footnote 4 Leisure as an activity that not only involves time but also capital, plays a key role in Vandenbroucke (2009), Kopecky (2011) and Bridgman (2016b) too.Footnote 5 These papers study also both time trends and cross-section facts, but their main mechanism is the falling relative price of leisure capital whereas we emphasize the higher productivity growth for market production. Vandenbroucke (2009) is motivated by the differential decline in market hours across different wage-group during the period 1900–1950 and consequently treats all non-market hours as leisure and abstracts from home production. Kopecky (2011) is motivated by the trend in retirement and focuses on time use across different age groups. In contrast to our paper, Bridgman (2016b) focuses on the quantitative role played by different capital intensities across market, home and leisure production where the main objective is to account for changes in the labor market wedge. Finally, while most of macroeconomics models feature in the long-run constant hours worked and leisure time (see, e.g., Cooley & Prescott, 1995), Boppart and Krusell (2020) propose a general class of utility functions defined over consumption and leisure to obtain trends in aggregate market hours and aggregate leisure along a balanced growth path.Footnote 6 In contrast, we obtain these trends by explicitly modeling leisure and home production. As home production is a closer substitute to market good than leisure this distinction matters for welfare. Furthermore, our explicit goal in this paper is to replicate the cross-section facts on leisure and market hours. Finally, our theory that models leisure and home production explicitly as a process involving time and capital makes additional predictions about, e.g., the relative growth of leisure durables relative to the aggregate capital stock. The paper is organized as follows. The next section document the empirical facts in U.S. data that motivate the paper. In Sect. 2 we present a growth model with heterogeneous households and derives its balanced growth path. Section 4 shows that the balanced growth path of the model is consistent with a rise in leisure in the aggregate time series together with a rise in leisure inequality in the cross-section. Section 5 presents the quantitative results. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes.",1

As we have obtained new evidence, charting inequality further back in time, the old paradigms have been challenged and new ones developed (Atkinson & Piketty, 2007, 2010; Kuznets, 1953; Piketty, 2001, 2014). Although numerous countries have been extensively studied, Poland has been missing from the picture. The episodes of state formation, war, socialism, transition into capitalism, and integration into the EU make Poland a particularly compelling case for studying the determinants and effects of income inequalities. More recently, Poland’s profound transformation from communism to a market economy happened in less than one generation, and the accompanying economic growth has been the fastest in Europe (Piątkowski, 2018), but little is known about which income groups have benefited from it. How do inequalities evolve in such fast-changing societies and what is the relative role of technological change versus transition policies and emerging institutions? The Polish economy has been also deeply transformed by the new wave of globalization. This is the only major European country which has recently experienced a substantial re/industrialization and a growing share in the World’s GDP (Baldwin, 2016). But we know little about the distributional effects of these processes. This paper is a first comprehensive attempt to examine the long-run evolution of inequality in Poland in order to shed light on the determinants and implications of inequality. We combine tax, survey and national accounts data to provide consistent series on the long-term distribution of national income in Poland. First, we construct top income shares for the whole period from the end of the nineteenth century until today. Next, we combine household surveys and income tax data in order to provide more reliable estimates of the full income distribution in Poland from 1983 until 2015. More precisely, we use tax data on high-income taxpayers to correct the top of the survey distribution. We thus produce the first homogeneous series that offer a possibility to compare the level and evolution of income inequality in Poland both through time and across countries.Footnote 1 Figure 1 summarizes our main results on the long-run income inequality in Poland.Footnote 2 We interpret these results through the lenses of theories analysing the determinants of income inequality and the implications for economic development (Galor & Moav, 2004; Kuznets, 1955; Piketty, 2014). Table 1 provides a concise overview of Polish history since the nineteenth century and we follow the outlined periodization in our analysis throughout the paper.Footnote 3 Source: Authors’ computation based on income tax statistics. Distribution of fiscal income among tax units. Note: the Prussian Poland is the Province of Posen and West Prussia, the Austrian Poland is Galicia. For 1925–1937 Poland is the Second Polish Republic (with 1918–1939 borders), for 1945–1989 Poland is the Polish People’s Repulbic (with post-1945 borders), for 1992–2015 Poland is the Third Polish Republic. Top 1% income share in Poland, 1892–2015. Top income shares in Poland followed a U-shaped evolution from 1892 until today. We find that top income share followed different trajectories in the Prussian and Austrian partitions, a steady rise in the former contrasting with the stagnation in the latter,Footnote 4 which we link with the different political institutions and economic structures. The destruction of the First World War and a set of post-war shocks and redistributive polices led to a sharp reduction in top income shares. During the 1920s, however, top income shares recovered from this low-point and the Great Depression resulted in further concentration of income at the top. We document a high concentration of capital income at the top of the distribution throughout the first half of the twentieth century. The introduction of communism led to a dramatic fall in top income shares. As documented now in many countries, the post-WWII downward trend in inequality was induced by the fall in capital income concentration. Communism signified comparatively greater shock to capital incomes relative to other countries, by literally eliminating private capital income with nationalisations and expropriations, while in addition it implied strong reduction of top labour incomes. During the remaining four decades of the communist rule, top income shares displayed notable stability at these—to some extent artificially—lower levels.Footnote 5 We analyse the transition from communism to a market economy by constructing the full income distribution (1983–2015) from combined tax and survey data. Figure 2 presents our series on the income distribution. We show that within one generation, Poland has moved from being one of the most egalitarian to one of the most unequal countries in Europe. Inequality experienced a substantial and steady rise after the fall of communism, which was driven by a sharp increase in the income shares of the top groups within the top decile. Over the whole 1989–2015 period, real income rose for nearly all income groups, but the top 1% captured almost twice as large a portion of the total income growth as the bottom 50% (24% versus 13%). The middle 40% and bottom 50% income shares experienced a similar evolution characterized by a stable fall from 1989 until the mid-2000s, and a stagnation afterwards. These results remain in contrast to the official survey-based measures, which substantially underestimate the rise of inequality since the end of communism, primarily by underestimating the top of the income distribution.Footnote 6 Source: Authors’ computation. Distribution of pre-tax national income (before taxes and transfers, except pensions and unemployment insurance) among equal-split adults Income shares in Poland, 1983–2015. The highest increase took place immediately at the onset of the transition in the early 1990s and was induced both by the rise of top labour and capital incomes. However, the strong rise in inequality in the 2000s, after Poland joined the European Union, was driven solely by the increase in top capital incomes, which are dominant sources of income for the top percentile group. Today, Polish top income shares are at the level of most unequal European countries, most notably Germany and the United Kingdom, but still substantially below those documented in Russia (Novokmet et al., 2018). The new long-run inequality series present a critical input to investigate the determinants and implications of inequality. Overall, we point to the central role of country-specific institutions and policies in shaping the U-shaped evolution of inequality in Poland in the long run. The long-run evolution of top income shares presents suggestive evidence against the ‘natural’ decline of inequality along the development path. That is, the secular fall of inequality after WW2 in Poland was not an outcome of natural economic forces innate to the development process, nor its rise after 1989 can be explained by the new ‘technological revolution’. Although a closer look at certain episodes in Polish history underlines the importance of economic forces, in particular, technological change and globalisation, we argue that their distributional impact depends on a broader institutional setting (e.g., labour market institutions such as unions, minimum wage, corporate governance; provision of public education; government transfers and safety nets, or social norms towards inequality). Our series also shed new light on the role of inequality for growth in Poland and other post-communist countries. We highlight several ways in which institutional systems have mattered regarding the way inequality affected development through accumulation and efficiency channels.

Madsen,Holger Strulik,Male,Male,Male,Male,"It is a well-known regularity that economic development tends to increase as one moves away from the equator. However, this state of affairs is of relatively recent origin. As shown below, in circa 1500, per capita income, proxied by population density, was negatively correlated with latitude across the world as well as within Europe; a result that was first noticed by Ashraf and Galor (2011). The objective of the present paper is to provide a theory that accounts for this remarkable ‘reversal of fortune’. This paper proposes that the intertemporally shifting latitude gradient is a consequence of differences in the physiological constraints faced by individuals at different geographical locations. The argument is anchored in an important fact from the fields of biology and physical anthropology: Individuals are inherently physically bigger (i.e., taller and heavier in terms of lean body mass) in locations further away from the equator. This phenomenon is labeled “Bergmann’s rule” in the relevant literature, after Bergmann (1847). Bergmann’s rule is possibly a consequence of positive selection towards greater cold tolerance in the aftermath of the exodus from Africa some 50,000 years ago, but it could potentially have other roots as well (see discussion below). The substantive implication of this “latitude gradient in body size” is that individuals living in colder climates would end up facing higher metabolic costs of fertility, on purely physiological grounds, since these costs are increasing in the body mass of the individual. As a consequence, during pre-industrial times we would expect progressively lower levels of population density the farther we move away from the equator (see Dalgaard & Strulik, 2015). Moreover, if, in the pre-industrial era, technological change was positively influenced by population size, societies where citizens were bigger but less numerous would tend to be technologically less sophisticated, reinforcing the physiologically based reason for low economic development (see Aiyar et al., 2008; Ashraf & Galor, 2011, for a formal discussion of the link between population density and technological change in a pre-industrial environment). However, as technological change makes formal education more attractive, it is likely to be adopted sooner in societies where the relative costs of child quantity are greater; that is, places inhabited by bigger individuals, farther away from the equator. This is where the latitude-productivity nexus gradually begins its turnaround: As educational investments are undertaken, fertility declines and economic growth takes off. Consequently, the currently observed positive correlation between absolute latitude and development outcomes may be the product of a differentiated timing of the take-off, which provided places farther away from the equator with a developmental head start in the modern growth regime. In support of this hypothesis, we develop a unified growth model and test its implications. The model features overlapping generations of children and adults. Adults are the economically active agents and decide on family size, the level of nutrition and schooling of the offspring as well as their own (luxury) consumption. Following Dalgaard and Strulik (2015, 2016) parents are subject to the physiological constraint that they have to cover their metabolic needs, which depend on their own body mass as well as the level of fertility. Moreover, body mass is transmitted via an intergenerational law of motion. Finally, a unique output good is produced using body size augmented labor, human capital, land, and technology. The theory builds on three key elements. First, utility of parents is increasing in the quality and quantity of offspring as well as own consumption. There are two dimensions to child quality, which are assumed to be imperfect substitutes: nutrition and skill formation. Moreover, preferences are assumed to fulfill a ‘hierarchy of needs’ principle: In a time of crisis, parents will tend to adjust own (luxury) consumption more strongly than child quantity and quality. Second, the return to skill formation is increasing in the level of technological sophistication, and human capital production is non-convex. The latter element involves the assumption that parents costlessly transmit a minimum amount of skill to the next generation, which permits a corner solution in terms of skill investments when the level of technology is sufficiently low. Third, technology evolves endogenously and depends on human capital-augmented population size. These elements interact in the following way. At early stages of development the economy finds itself in a ‘Malthusian ‘subsistence regime’ featuring low income and a relatively poor state of technology. Consequently, parents only invest in child quantity and the nutrition-based quality component. As technology slowly advances, however, income rises gradually despite the resource diluting influence from population. Eventually, the economy transits into a ‘post-Malthusian’ regime. The higher level of income entices the parents to start spending resources on themselves; i.e., above and beyond subsistence requirements. In addition, parents choose to increase the size of the family further. Nutritional investments also rise, but not on a per child basis. Consequently, average body mass is not increasing despite a higher level of income. Yet as technology continues to advance, now at a higher pace, the economy ultimately moves into the ‘sustained growth regime’, where human capital investments are deemed optimal. As quality investments are intensified, individuals respond by lowering fertility, which also allows nutritional spending per child to increase, and growth takes off: economically and physiologically, in the sense of increasing body mass. In the long run, the economy converges to a steady state where fertility is at replacement level, average body mass and human capital investments are constant, and economic growth occurs at a constant rate. We use our model to conduct experiments in order to examine the causes of the shifting latitude gradient described above. Specifically, we compare societies where individuals are inherently of different body size, which potentially could have been due to selection. Before the onset of the fertility transition, societies farther away from the equator spent more on child nutrition and less on child quantity. Due to smaller family size and lower population density, they developed fewer new technologies through learning by doing. The transition to modern growth arises when a critical level of technological sophistication is attained enticing individuals to commence human capital investments. This critical level of technology is declining in the average body size of individuals, since families with higher metabolic costs of fertility (child quantity) require less of an inducement to reduce fertility and to invest in child quality in the sense of human capital. Thus, societies farther away from the equator experienced the take-off to modern growth earlier and are richer today. We test the implications of the model using pre-industrial and post-1800 data as follows. First, we show a reversal of fortune across the world as well as between the European countries anchored in the latitude gradient (Sect. 2). Second, using cross-country data, we examine the extent to which contemporary economic development is associated with height in 1900, while controlling for several factors that various authors have found to explain economic development, such as culture, institutions, and geographical characteristics (Sect. 6.1). Third, we use decennial data for Italian regions over the period 1821–2001 to test the implications of our model (Sect. 6.2). Fourth, we use annual panel data for the OECD countries over the period 1840–1980 to show that the fertility transition was triggered by foreign technological progress transmitted internationally through the trade channel and mediated through height (Sect. 6.3). This paper is related to several strands of literature. On the theoretical side, the paper belongs to the literature on economic growth in the very long run (e.g., Galor & Weil, 2000; Galor & Moav, 2002; Lucas, 2002; Cervellati & Sunde, 2005; Strulik & Weisdorf, 2008; De la Croix & Licandro, 2013). It is also related to studies on evolutionary growth theory focussing on the geographically driven selection of biocultural traits, such as time preferences (Galor & Özak, 2016) and loss aversion (Galor & Savitskiy, 2018), see Ashraf et al. (2020) for a review. In particular, the model developed below uses elements from Dalgaard and Strulik (2015, 2016) who integrate nutrition, ontogenetic growth, and physiological constraints into theories of long-run economic development. While Dalgaard and Strulik (2015) focus on the impact of physiological constraints on the cross-country distribution of income and body size in Malthusian times, and Dalgaard and Strulik (2016) focus on the take-off of average body size after the fertility transition, we show here how physiological constraints can explain the differentiated take-off to growth and a reversal of fortune.Footnote 1 We extend the theory of Dalgaard and Strulik (2015, 2016) by considering education as a second channel of child quality investments and by integrating it with the canonical model of unified growth theory (UGT). The key mechanism of UGT that explains the onset of the fertility transition, mass education, and the take-off from stagnation to modern growth is based on the interaction of advancing technological progress with the child quantity-quality trade-off: Parents start investing in child education and reduce fertility when technological progress increases the return to education sufficiently strongly (Galor & Weil, 2000). By integrating UGT with the physiological model of Dalgaard and Strulik (2015, 2016) we refine the predictions of UGT with respect to regional differences in the timing of the take-off. Specifically, the integrated model predicts that countries or regions populated by bigger people, ceteris paribus, initiate the fertility transition and the take-off to growth earlier. The reason is that child costs are higher for bigger children such that the quantity-quality trade-off with respect to education kicks in already at a (somewhat) lower level of the return to education. Thus, we argue that small differences in initial conditions with respect to underlying physiological constraints are powerful enough to generate the historically observed interregional reversals. The paper is also related to existing contributions that have aimed to explain observed reversals of fortune in history (Acemoglu et al., 2002; Olsson & Paik, 2016, 2020; Litina, 2016; Dalgaard et al., 2020). The present study differs from previous contributions on two fronts: First, we focus on the role played by absolute latitude, rather than other structural characteristics. Second, whereas previous work has focused on either institutional or cultural drivers of the reversal, the present study proposes a physiological mechanism. We elaborate on the value added of the present work in the next section. The paper proceeds as follows. In the next section we document a series of stylized facts, regarding the interrelationship between geography, body mass and economic activity that we require the model to be able to account for. Section 3 develops the model, and Sects. 4 and 5 describe the development trajectory implied by the model. The empirics are presented in Sect. 6, and Sect. 7 concludes.",1
26,3,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-021-09192-z,Secular satiation,Gilles Saint-Paul,,,Male,,,Male,"Limits to growth are generally considered to lie on the supply side: limited resources, decreasing returns to innovation, and so forth. Yet as societies become more affluent, the question arises as to whether consumers will be able to absorb an ever increasing output level. Indeed we observe that over time growth becomes increasingly qualitative as opposed to quantitative. Productivity improvements are matched by greater product quality and variety as well as a secular decline in working time. Ignoring transitory phenomena such as wars, pandemics, and severe recessions, the scenario outlined by Keynes in his Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren (1930), where he predicted that the bulk of human activity will eventually take place outside the economic sphere, seems increasingly plausible.
 This paper analyzes growth dynamics when needs may be subject to satiation. I assume that utility derived from any individual good reaches a maximum at a finite consumption level. An immediate implication is that there may be two kinds of long-term steady states: a non satiated one where the capital stock is determined by the standard Keynes-Ramsey condition, and a satiated one where the marginal utility of consumption is zero, and there may be excess capital (in that its net marginal product is negative) in the long run. I then allow for new products to be introduced. While each product is subject to satiation, there is no satiation in the taste for variety: utility can potentially be raised without bounds if enough new goods are introduced. I show that a social planner will never elect a trajectory which converges to a satiated steady state. In such a steady state, the marginal utility of consumption is zero, and so is the opportunity cost of introducing an additional variety, which in turn has a first order positive effect on utility. I then consider a decentralized economy where, in a standard fashion, new varieties are introduced by profit-seeking innovators, who derive subsequent monopoly rents. Under satiation, at the margin, consumers are willing to pay an arbitrarily high price for a new product. If there is no limit on monopoly power, the monopoly can charge such a price and will recoup the cost of innovation. As in the first best, enough varieties will be introduced for satiation to be ruled out – although the equilibrium number of varieties will not be optimal, due to the market failures well identified by the literature on innovation.Footnote 1 But limits on monopoly power may neuter such mechanism. As is frequent in the literature, I assume there is a cap on the price that a patent holder can charge, due to a competitive fringe of imitators. It is then shown that the economy may converge to satiated steady states. At the margin of those equilibria, the market does not deliver the required innovation level to lift the economy out of its satiation trap, despite that the social opportunity cost of innovation, in terms of utility, is of second order. An innovator cannot charge a price high enough, in terms of goods, to internalize the fact that the marginal utility of consuming existing goods is very low. The model also highlights an important strategic complementarity, which generates multiple equilibrium trajectories. Unlike vertical innovation, horizontal innovation raises the marginal utility of aggregate consumption. Consequently, expecting more varieties to be introduced in the future raises the incentives to save. Higher savings in turn reduces interest rates, which favors innovation. I show that equilibrium trajectories that converge to a non satiated equilibrium where the modified Golden Rule holds coexist with trajectories that converge to satiated equilibria. In the latter, the capital stock and the number of varieties are lower than in the former, while interest rates are higher and wages are lower. I then perform some comparative statics exercises and show that paradoxical results may arise. For example, if society is satiated in the long run, a reduction in the bliss point level of consumption has a negative effect on GDP if it does not trigger innovation, but a positive one if it does. If the initial capital stock is low then it is never profitable to innovate, and more ""austere"" tastes simply reduce the need for capital in the long run. If initial capital is high enough, the economy eventually innovates, and austerity, by raising savings, frees resources for innnovation. In the last two sections of the paper, I extend the model by assuming a positive trend in total factor productivity growth.Footnote 2 The value of this exercise is two-fold. First, I show that the results are robust to introducing such a trend, and that the steady states with and without satiation can be generalized as balanced growth paths; in these trajectories innovation takes place and the number of varieties grow at the same rate as aggregate output, yet innovation may not be high enough to rule out a satiated trajectory. Second, TFP growth makes it possible to study satiation under an endogenous labor supply. If the disutility of labor schedule satisfies the Inada conditions, absent TFP growth satiation cannot arise, since labor supply must be equal to zero, for any finite wage, if the marginal utility of consumption is equal to zero. Under TFP growth, the economy cannot be satiated throughout, for the same reason. However, it may converge to a satiated equilibrium. If TFP growth is high enough, the growth in wages driven by technical progress may be strong enough to offset the fall over time of the marginal utility of consumption as consumption of each good gradually approaches the satiation level. As a result, labor does not fall over time despite increased saturation of needs. If TFP growth is at intermediate levels, a ""leisure society"" trajectory arises. In such a path, working time trends downwards, converging to zero, while consumers are asymptotically satiated. Working time falls less fast than TFP growth (otherwise GDP would shrink and the economy would move away from satiation , which cannot be in equilibrium), so that the economy grows at a strictly positive rate, as does the number of varieties. This feature is reminiscent of debates about the relative merits of the ""American model"" vs. the ""European model"", the former being considered as favoring consumption and the latter being more inclined to leisure.Footnote 3 It is shown that the ""leisure society"" is associated with lower growth in output, physical capital and the number of varieties than a balanced growth path without satiation (the ""consumer society""), while being more intensive in innovation relative to physical capital. Also, the strategic complementary mentioned above still operates: For a range of parameter values, both the ""consumer society"" and the ""leisure society"" coexist as equilibrium trajectories. Which trajectory prevails may not only be due to preferences and technology, but also to self-fulfilling expectations. The present paper is related to several strands of literature. Non homothetic preferences have been introduced into growth models in order to explain structural change ( Echevarria (1997), Laitner (2000), Ngai and Pissarides (2007), Foellmi and Zweimüller (2008)) and to study the interplay between income distribution and growth through demand channels (Matsuyama (2002), Foellmi and Zweimüller (2006), Saint-Paul (2006)).Footnote 4 Yet to my knowledge the role of satiation as a limit to growth and its relationship to innovation has been under-researched by the mainstream of economics.Footnote 5. Rather, research has focused on supply-side limits to growth such as complementarities and bottlenecks (Baumol et al. 1985) and whether innovation may endogenously lift those limits (Acemoglu (2002)).Footnote 6 Classical economists such as Keynes (cited above) and Malthus (1798) as well as alternative approaches have paid more attention to the possibility of saturation, which they take as a likely and important possibility.Footnote 7 Both Keynes (1930) and Veblen (1973), believe that as needs get satiated people will consume symbolic goods instead, such as conspicuous items, whose utility is social rather than intrinsic. However, such a claim begs the question of the nature, range and costs of those goods; it is also silent as to why people would elect to consume such goods as opposed to greater leisure. Before addressing such complex questions, a more basic approach consists in asking whether the economy will be able to introduce enough new goods to exit satiation.Footnote 8 This is what this paper does. An important theme of the non orthodox literature is how the ruling class in a capitalist society may manipulate preferences and institutions so as to avoid satiation and maintain a large consumer basis (Galbraith (1958), Scitovsky (1976), Schor (1998), Lee (2000), Witt (2001)) Psychological techniques such as advertising may artificially create a demand for new products and/or raise the marginal utility of existing products, an issue that has been formalized by Benhabib and Bisin (2002). Labor market institutions may make it difficult for workers to elect more leisure by constraining working time or artificially raising the fixed cost of working. In contrast, this paper pursues a standard neo-classical approach: preferences are exogenous and differ from usual ones only in that they include a bliss pointFootnote 9. New goods are introduced not as a strategy of ""capitalism"" but because profit-maximizing innovators choose to do so, and, as shown, the new goods may or may not eliminate satiation. Working time may fail to fall as people get more satiated, not because of institutions, but because productivity growth allows wages to grow fast enough for people to be willing to work as much as before, while they increasingly spend their income on greater product variety. Conversely, working time may be reduced indefinitely along the convergence path, but this may not be enough to prevent the economy from converging to satiation in the long run. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 lays out the basic model without innovation. Section 3 extends it by allowing for new goods to be introduced. I show that satiated trajectories are socially inefficient and that there exist multiple growth paths. Section 4 studies how some traditional comparative statics are overturned. In satiated trajectories with no innovation, an increase in TFP is met by a fall in investment. In satiated trajectories with innovation, a reduction in the cost of R & D eventually reduces the number of varieties. Finally, a reduction in the satiation level of consumption (which may be interpreted as more austere social norms) favors capital accumulation and product diversity if the initial capital stock is not too small (so that innovation eventually picks up), but is immiserizing otherwise. In Sect. 5 the analysis is generalized for an economy with a trend of TFP growth. Section 6 discusses how the features of those trajectories change when one allows for endogenous labor supply. I show that the possibility of satiation in the long run survives. Depending on the level of TFP growth, asymptotic satiation is consistent with both a constant labor supply (the ""abundant society"") or a shrinking labor supply (the ""leisure society""). In the leisure society, growth is strictly positive and innovation takes place, but growth is too slow, relative to the speed of convergence toward satiation, for preventing labor from shrinking over time. Section 7 concludes.",1
26,3,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-021-09191-0,Financing choice and local economic growth: evidence from Brazil,Thiago Christiano Silva,Iftekhar Hasan,Benjamin Miranda Tabak,Male,Male,Male,Male,"This paper studies the relationship between local activity diversification and economic growth in Brazilian municipalities from 2003 to 2014. We use a detailed dataset on municipal-level GDP, credit operations from local banks, and borrowing firms’ characteristics to examine several empirical questions. We document a positive association between financing local activity diversification—through bank credit to non-traditional local activities—and municipal growth. We provide empirical evidence that investment in non-traditional activities contributes to growth by generating synergies with traditional local activity. We then collect data on localized natural disasters to examine how financing non-traditional activities is associated with economic growth during times of distress. We find that larger shares of bank finance to non-traditional local activities correlate with lower growth, suggesting there are higher returns to restoring the traditional sector after a disaster. The finance-growth literature constructs proxies for financial development at the aggregate level when explaining economic growth.Footnote 1 A few exceptions study the relationship between growth and financial development using bank credit operations from the creditor perspective.Footnote 2 In contrast, this paper looks at the borrower side of the credit relationship. We analyze how borrowers’ activities relate to the municipal traditional and non-traditional activities and whether they impact local economic growth differently. Thus, this paper documents the role of lending diversification in regional growth. We show that the distribution of who gets the credit (borrowers) matters for economic growth. On the one hand, municipalities may specialize in sectors in which there are external economies of scale that are sector-specific (Henderson, 1974). On the other hand, municipalities may diversify their production if inter-municipality transportation costs are high compared to the gains they can obtain from economies of scale (Abdel-Rahman & Anas, 2004).Footnote 3 From the viewpoint of municipalities, if they have different specializations—precisely their traditional local activities—then funding less important non-traditional sectors could reduce their potential for development, which would otherwise be reached if funding were channeled to those local activities with comparative advantage. Therefore, we should expect a negative association between funding non-traditional local activities—which could promote activity diversification (less specialization)—and economic growth. Using evidence from Brazilian municipalities, we show the opposite: funding non-traditional local activities is associated with higher economic growth rates. Our results suggest that activity diversification may promote growth at the municipal level. Brazil is an interesting case study for several reasons. First, it is a relevant emerging market country that experienced tremendous credit growth in the mid-2000s. Despite such strong credit growth, the pace of economic growth has been somewhat lower, and therefore the link between bank credit and growth is an important research question. Second, the structure of the economy is also bank-oriented. In this way, bank credit ends up being the only external funding source for the average firm. Third, Brazil has a large geographical territory with significant demographic, social, and economic disparities observed across its many municipalities. Fourth, it shares roughly common legal, institutional, judicial, and political features across its municipalities, which are dimensions that are difficult to measure and vary a lot across different countries. Therefore, we alleviate concerns with omitted-variable bias arising from these dimensions. We provide empirical evidence supporting the view that activity diversification can lead to a synergistic effect between the municipality’s new activities and its traditional local activity. For instance, in an agricultural municipality, manufacturing expansion (non-traditional sector) may enlarge the market for suppliers of non-traded services, inducing entry and new services activity. In turn, the expansion of non-traded services may bring productivity gains for manufacturing firms that use them. Our finding also suggests that non-traditional local sectors may be more profitable, and therefore their funding is beneficial to growth. This could be due to a less competitive environment or because some sectors experience diminishing returns.Footnote 4 We show that the positive association between activity diversification and economic growth holds only during normal times. Using large natural disasters in Brazil during the analyzed period, we show that this relationship becomes negative during times of distress. We find that traditional local sectors are more affected than non-traditional sectors following a natural disaster. Precisely because of the non-traditional sector’s dependence on the traditional sector, our results suggest that municipalities should restrengthen their traditional activities during adverse conditions. Municipalities specialize in agricultural, industrial, or service activities. We assume that the traditional activity is whichever contributes the most to its local GDP. The remaining sectors—those contributing less to local GDP—are considered as non-traditional. We provide robustness tests on our definition of traditional activity. We run regressions on two municipalities’ samples: those with highly-specialized and similar value-added shares in two or three sectors. While our results hold for both samples, they are economically stronger in highly-specialized municipalities, corroborating the existence of diminishing returns in financing the traditional sector. Furthermore, we show that the sector that contributes the most to local GDP is long-standing and does not significantly change over our sample period, alleviating concerns with changes in municipal activities over time arising, for example, from the entry of new firms.",1
26,4,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-021-09196-9,Axis-orientation and knowledge transmission: evidence from the Bantu expansion,Arthur Blouin,,,Male,,,Male,"Jared Diamond famously hypothesized that a fundamental determinant of wealth differences across the globe is whether a region is oriented primarily along an east-west or north-south axis (Diamond 1998). His idea was that because there is less geographic variation along an east-west axis, important information about agricultural products or processes can travel more seamlessly. While there is modest empirical support for the Diamond hypothesis, (Laitin and Robinson 2011; Laitin et al. 2012; Pavlik and Young 2019), testing it has been a significant empirical challenge. As a result, big questions regarding mechanisms remain unanswered. For instance, why does the effect persist when information can now travel across the globe so quickly and easily? In this paper, I make some progress on these issues by first showing that (1) knowledge does seem to have historically traveled less seamlessly across more varying land conditions in Africa; (2) the effect can be seen in current agricultural production patterns, and; (3) geographic and cultural isolation may explain this persistence. I explore all of this within the context of the Bantu expansion, one of the largest ever human migration movements. Bantu migration began along what is now the Nigeria/Cameroon border and followed two primary routes—south and east. Because migration occurred very slowly—slowly enough that land characteristics were not substantially different in any direction, for any single leg of migration—there was no selection into either route (Vansina 1990). However, over many generations of migration large differences in the suitability of dry crops did emerge. The southern branch migrated through the rainforest in central Africa, an environment much different than Nigeria/Cameroon. The eastern branch, on the other hand, migrated around the rainforest, reaching Africa’s east coast, and then veered south. Each leg along this route featured agricultural characteristics much more similar to Nigeria/Cameroon than the rainforest. Both migration branches rejoined after 1000C.E., and currently live in the same regions in some parts of southern Africa. This paper aims to use the large difference in the ability to produce certain agricultural goods by southern migrants relative to eastern migrants, in order to explore three questions related to Diamond’s hypothesis. First, did ancestral differences in crop production influence the inter-generational transmission of knowledge of some modes of agricultural production? If so, does this help to explain crop production variation today? And finally, if cropping patterns today do reflect ancestral migration routes, why? To touch on the first, I examine the characteristics of the settlement locations of southern migrants upon exiting the rainforest. If knowledge of dry crops was not transmitted across generations when it fell out of use, then we might expect the migrants exiting the rainforest to prefer to settle on land suitable for wet crops. However, those whose ancestors were continuously able to produce both wet and dry crops may have no such preference. Consistent with this hypothesis, I find that ancestors of southern migrants were more likely to settle rainforest-similar land than ancestors of eastern migrants, even controlling for distance to the rainforest, latitude, longitude, and a wide variety of other land characteristics. Furthermore, data that distinguishes historical land use by pasture/crop land reveals that south of the rainforest, ancestors of southern migrants were historically less likely to keep livestock. This is consistent with knowledge loss, since livestock is far less productive in the rainforest because of the tsetse fly. Perhaps surprisingly, I find similar agricultural production patterns using more detailed contemporary data. In particular, the descendants of southern migrants continue to produce less of the dry-crops that were produced in the Bantu homeland than the descendants of eastern migrants. This is true even controlling for land characteristics, including the suitability of the land for a wide variety of crops. Interestingly, however, they are also less likely to produce both wet and dry crops introduced to Africa post-Bantu settlement. This suggests that the apparent under-production of dry crops by south-Bantu is not the result of selective rainforest migration on the basis of relatively poor dry-crop ability, which might otherwise have been a concern. Instead, the result indicates that something more fundamental about adopting new farming techniques itself was influenced by the rainforest history of some societies. This brings us to the issue of mechanisms. I explore whether isolation could be one reason for the patterns found in the data, and find some evidence to suggest that the descendants of southern migrants are both more geographically and culturally isolated.Footnote 1 This result on insularity is also consistent with the previously mentioned differences in preferences over settlement locations. Upon exiting the rainforest, ancestors of southern migrants settled away from most other societies, due to their particular preferences for land suited to wet crop production. Whether due to this isolation, or due to the underproduction of many agricultural products, the descendants of southern migrants fare worse economically today than their counterparts whose ancestors originally migrated east. The findings primarily contribute to the literature by establishing empirical support of the Diamond (1998) hypothesis. The evidence to support the hypothesis has to date been weakly positive. For instance, Pavlik and Young (2019) find positive but imprecise correlations between axis-orientation and technology adoption. Laitin and Robinson (2011), Laitin et al. (2012) show that those along a north-south rather than east-west axis are more diverse, which we might expect if technology more easily flows east-west. One advantage of my approach is that by focusing on a particular location and industry, I can be more precise both in the main effects, and with respect to mechanisms. The second main contribution to the literature relates to the very long-run determinants of development. Notably, Ashraf et al. (2010) show that historical isolation may foster innovation, given a diminished ability to benefit from the technological advances of others. I similarly explore whether isolated societies may be disadvantaged in knowledge adoption. My approach builds on work by Putterman and Weil (2010), who demonstrate that the economic history of a place, and the people who inhabit that place, are distinctly responsible for economic development. I extend this literature in a few ways. First, my focus on human capital sheds some light on why ancestry matters (e.g. Michalopoulos et al. 2018b). Second, while much of the literature focuses on the economic history of a place or a society (Hibbs and Olsson 2004; Olsson and Hibbs Jr 2005; Comin et al. 2010), I show how a society’s ancestry influenced the places they settled. Finally, the finding that isolation is influenced by ancestral migration routes contributes to a small literature investigating the origins of ethnolinguistic diversity. The first paper in this literature, Michalopoulos (2011), shows that incentives for knowledge transfer leads to less diversity in the long-run. In this case I focus on diversity as a function of migration and settlement, and accordingly share much in common with Ashraf and Galor (2013a, 2013b), who first established the strong relationship between diversity and migration out of Africa. Further advancing the literature on the origins of diversity is Dickens (2021), who establishes that diversity is associated with trade. Blouin and Dyer (2021) show that investments in linguistic convergence are a function of economic trade incentives. Further, Dickens (2018) investigates the nuances of the relationship between diversity and knowledge flow. One contribution of this paper is to demonstrate how ancestral location-specific knowledge can determine settlement patterns.",1

Evidence from second-generation Americans,Areendam Chanda,Bulent Unel,,,Male,,Male,"In the study of economic growth, entrepreneurs occupy center stage due to their role in creating firms, spurring innovations, and reducing poverty. Entrepreneurship inherently involves bearing risk. Risk aversion, in turn, is one of the deep parameters in economic theory. A large amount of research is devoted to both the measurement of attitudes towards risk, and understanding the relationship between them and entrepreneurial activity. Many conduct their own surveys, lab or field experiments which elicit responses to measure risk tolerance. The studies then go on to show a strong association between these and various risky choices made by the subjects, including the choice of being entrepreneur. While this literature has made important strides, particularly in the measurement of risk preferences, identifying its exogenous effects on choosing to be an entrepreneur remains a challenge due to issues of selection bias, small samples, and reverse causation. This paper assesses the importance of attitudes toward risk taking for entrepreneurship. Specifically, using a measure of the willingness to take risks derived from the Global Preference Survey (GPS) by Falk et al. (2018) in conjunction with twenty five years (1995–2019) of individual level occupation data from U.S. Current Population Surveys (CPS), we examine the extent to which variation in the willingness to take risks in the country of origin can explain the likelihood of being an entrepreneur among second-generation Americans. Before summarizing our findings, we highlight the distinguishing features of our approach. Compared to the existing literature, our strategy has several advantages. First, by looking at a single large country (where all respondents are exposed to the same broader set of markets and institutions), we already control for a large number of confounding factors that can contaminate the relationship between risk preferences and occupational choice. Second, in our analysis, we focus on the sample of second generation Americans, which further factors out unobserved differences that might be present among first generation immigrants. Third, by using entirely separate data sources for our risk tolerance measure and individual occupational choices, we are able to avoid the pitfalls of other studies that rely on the same survey to examine the link between the two variables. Fourth, the CPS data affords us the luxury of considerably larger samples and an extensive set of individual-level controls. Fifth, the GPS itself is a culmination of a long research project with numerous prior peer reviewed studies and validation exercises (e.g. Dohmen et al., 2011a, b; Vieider et al., 2015; Falk et al., 2016), thus carrying far more credibility than previous survey based questions. It also has the distinct advantage that it covers 76 countries, thus allowing for considerable global variation. We find that the level of risk taking in the country of origin has a positive and significant impact on the likelihood of being an entrepreneur. Specifically, a one-standard deviation increase in risk taking increases the probability of being an entrepreneur by 16% among the second-generation Americans (relative to the sample mean). This finding highlights the importance of attitudes towards risk in entrepreneurship, thus reinforcing a large literature documenting the same for other measures of preferences or cultural factors (e.g., patience, trust, etc) in different contexts (such as growth, labor market participation, etc). Since we use variations in risk tolerance of the ancestral country, there is the question of robustness to other country of origin variables. First and foremost, our primary variable of interest is a demography adjusted version of the GPS risk-taking measure. This is motivated by the observation in Falk et al. (2018) that risk tolerance varies far more across individuals within countries, than across countries.Footnote 1 Our baseline regression also controls for a range of geo-climatic variables that are common in the literature, continent dummies, and religious composition. Building on the persistence literature, we also consider a host of genetic, geographic, agricultural, and historical variables that have been attributed to long term development, institutional capacity, preference formation, and cultural norms. However, our results are not too sensitive to these additional controls. Our empirical strategy rests on the assumption that risk attitudes are transmitted across generations.Footnote 2 Risk taking, however, is not the only preference parameter or cultural factor that can affect the decision to be an entrepreneur. Indeed, the literature has often foregrounded other factors such as the role of patience (or “long term orientation”), the importance of individualism (or “internal locus of control”), as well as social capital measures such as trust. Apart from being important in their own right, these too have been documented to persist across generations. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the importance of these variables. They are also captured either by the GPS, or the widely used cultural dimensions of Hofstede et al. (2010). To summarize our results, when entered jointly in our baseline specification, surprisingly, none of them have significant effects. Risk taking continues to be robust and significant. On their own, we find some evidence that time preference measures (patience and long-term orientation) have positive effects while trust has a negative effect, but the findings are not robust.Footnote 3 We find no effect of Hofstede’s individualism and uncertainty avoidance variables. Our measure of entrepreneurship, like much of the literature, is that of self-employment. Levine and Rubinstein (2017) note that most self-employment is not the kind of entrepreneurship normally associated with innovation and job creation. Our research highlights the fact that attitudes towards risk taking can indeed separate entrepreneurs, broadly defined, from wage earners. It would still be of interest to know whether risk-taking not only separates the self-employed from workers, but also the innovative and job creating entrepreneur from the rest. Being a repeated cross-section, the CPS data is less insightful in this regard. However, it provides information on whether the self-employed are incorporated. Levine and Rubinstein highlight the important differences between the incorporated vs unincorporated self employed, and argue that the former is a better proxy for entrepreneurship. They are more likely to be managers, more educated, and have higher earnings. Even though the incorporated is a very small fraction of our sample, we show that our results continue to support the main hypothesis. The paper is organized as follows. The next section provides a review of the related studies, and puts the contribution of this paper in perspective. Section 3 discusses data and presents statistics about key variables, and Section 4 presents the empirical methodology. Section 5 presents and discusses baseline findings, and investigates their robustness. Section 6 extends the analysis examining alternative preference/cultural measures. Section 7 concludes the paper.",1
26,4,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-021-09195-w,"Automation, growth, and factor shares in the era of population aging",Andreas Irmen,,,Male,,,Male,"Automation, i.e., the use of machines to replace and complement human beings in the performance of tasks, has been a key driver of economic growth since the beginning of the industrial revolution (Landes 1969; Mokyr 1990; Allen 2009). At least since the early 1960ies, this tendency has become more pronounced as technological advances in areas like robotics, information technology, digital technology, and artificial intelligence substantially widened the scale and scope of automation (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014; Ford 2015; Ross 2016; Goldfarb and Tucker 2019). For many industrialized countries the period from 1960 to today has also been an era of population aging that is predicted to extend further into the twenty-first century (Lutz et al. 2008; United Nations 2015). Since longevity has increased and fertility fallen, older individuals have become a proportionally larger fraction of the total population (Weil 2008).Footnote 1 The focus of this paper is on the effect of population aging on automation, growth, and factor shares. Unlike existing studies, my analysis shows that the source of aging and the considered time horizon matter for the direction of impact. On the one hand, an increase in longevity reduces automation in the short and promotes it in the long run. It boosts the growth rate of absolute and per-capita GDP in the short and the long run, lifts the labor share in the short and reduces it in the long run. On the other hand, a decline in fertility increases automation, reduces the growth rate of GDP, and lowers the labor share in the short and the long run. While in the short run, it may or may not increase the growth rate of per-capita GDP, it unequivocally accelerates per-capita GDP growth in the long run. I derive these findings in a novel competitive one-sector endogenous growth model. The design of the production sector is the central conceptual innovation of this paper. Here, I distinguish fixed capital from machines. Automation refers to the substitution of new and better machines for hours worked by labor in the performance of tasks. A higher (expected) wage strengthens the incentive to automate.Footnote 2 While automation is labor-saving at the level of individual tasks, it is labor-augmenting in the economy’s reduced-form aggregate production function. Even though the latter is Cobb–Douglas with fixed parameters, automation affects the labor share. The household sector features two-period lived overlapping generations. Individuals face a survival probability when they enter the second period of their lives. Population aging corresponds to an increase in this probability and/or to a decline in fertility. The per-period utility function of individuals is of the generalized log–log type recently proposed by Boppart and Krusell (2020). Hence, the individual supply of hours worked is endogenous, falls in the real wage, and declines at a constant rate in response to a constant wage growth (Irmen 2018b). To the best of my knowledge, the present paper is the first that studies Boppart–Krusell preferences in a fully-fledged endogenous growth model. This is the second conceptual innovation of this paper. The economy converges to a steady-state path that is consistent with Kaldor’s stylized facts (Kaldor 1961). New machines embody improved technological knowledge that accumulates through periodic automation investments. This is the source of sustained growth. A steady state is feasible since technological knowledge is labor-augmenting in the economy’s reduced-form net production function (Irmen 2018a). In addition, and in line with recent empirical evidence, the amount of hours worked per worker declines at a constant rate (Huberman and Minns 2007; Boppart and Krusell 2020). As a first set of results, my analysis uncovers how the possibility of automation affects the behavior of firms and the labor share. At the level of the individual task automation gives rise to a rationalization effect as fewer working hours are needed to perform a given task. At the same time, automation lowers the cost per task. I refer to the latter as the productivity effect of automation. It induces a task expansion effect, i.e., automating firms increase the set of tasks they perform. The slope of the aggregate demand for hours worked reflects how both the rationalization and the task expansion effect respond to a change in the real wage. I find that automation reduces the labor share. Without automation the share in the value added that accrues to tasks coincides with the labor share. However, with automation investments these shares differ, and the labor share declines. Moreover, the stronger the incentives to automate the lower is the labor share. Nevertheless, even if these incentives become very strong the labor share remains bounded away from zero. The main results of my analysis concern the direction of impact and the mechanics through which population aging affects automation, growth, and factor shares in the short and in the long run. These findings may be sketched as follows. Young individuals who expect to live longer want to increase their consumption possibilities in old age. Therefore, they expand their supply of working hours and save a larger fraction of their earnings. In the short run, these behavioral adjustments increase the aggregate supply of hours worked at the intensive margin and lower the equilibrium wage. As a consequence, the incentive of firms to engage in automation investments falls, and the labor share rises. GDP is affected through two channels. On the one hand, the level of employment, hence, GDP increases. On the other hand, the weakened incentives to automate imply that the productivity of labor in the performance of tasks falls. However, as firms choose the degree of automation and the amount of performed tasks optimally, the latter channel has no first-order effect on GDP. Hence, GDP increases in the short run. Since the labor supply expands at the intensive margin, per-capita GDP rises, too. The long-run effects of a permanent increase in longevity materialize through an increase in the savings rate. This stimulates the accumulation of fixed capital and allows for higher wages. As the working hour becomes more expensive, firms respond with more automation. In steady state, this speeds up the growth rate of absolute and per-capita GDP and reduces the labor share. The short-run effects of population aging through a decline in the fertility rate materialize in the period following the decline when the labor supply shrinks at the extensive margin. This leads to a higher equilibrium wage, stronger incentives to automate, and hence, to a lower labor share. GDP is again affected through two channels. On the one hand, the level of employment, hence, GDP declines. On the other hand, the strengthened incentives to automate imply that the productivity of labor in the performance of tasks increases. However, the latter channel has again no first-order effect on GDP as firms choose the degree of automation and the amount of performed tasks optimally. Hence, GDP falls in the short run. Nevertheless, if the proportionate decline in GDP is smaller than the decline in population, per-capita GDP can increase. If the decline in fertility is permanent then the labor supply is lower in all periods following the decline. Accordingly, in these periods the appropriately defined capital-labor ratio and wages will be higher so that the incentives to automate become more pronounced. Therefore, the long run has more automation, faster growth of per-capita GDP, and a lower labor share. The present paper is related to several strands of the literature. First, it contributes to the recent literature on endogenous automation and economic growth (see e.g., Steigum 2011, Acemoglu and Restrepo 2018a, c, d; Berg et al. 2018, or Hémous and Olsen 2021). In contrast to these contributions, my analytical framework provides a novel and tractable “neoclassical” alternative. Automation is the consequence of investments in new machines that substitute for human labor in a widening range of tasks and, nevertheless, appears as endogenous labor-augmenting technical change in the reduced-form aggregate production function. Moreover, sustained growth is due to the accumulation of technological knowledge embodied in new machines rather than to a mechanism that mimics the one of the AK-model (de La Grandville 1989; Klump and de La Grandville 2000; Palivos and Karagiannis 2010). Second, the present paper complements the literature on automation, economic growth, and demographic change (see e.g., Acemoglu and Restrepo 2018b; Cutler et al. 1990; Irmen 2017, among others). Contrary to these contributions, the focus of my research is on the link between population aging, the individual labor supply, individual savings, and the equilibrium incentives to automate. This perspective leads, e.g., to the novel insight that the qualitative effects of population aging through a higher life expectancy on automation incentives in the short and in the long run are of opposite sign. Allowing for an endogenous supply of hours worked is key to these findings. The representation of individual preferences with a generalized log–log utility function of the Boppart–Krusell class reveals in addition that the wage elasticity of the individual supply of hours worked matters for the link between population aging and the incentive to automate. In the short run, this elasticity affects the response of the equilibrium wage to an increase in life expectancy and/or to a decline in fertility. In the long run, it is a determinant of the steady-state growth rate of technological knowledge. Therefore, it affects the impact an increase in life expectancy and/or a decline in fertility has on the steady-state growth rates of technological knowledge, per-capita and aggregate macroeconomic variables. Third, my research contributes to the literature that aims at explaining the global decline in the labor share (see e.g., Karabarbounis and Neiman 2014; Piketty 2014).Footnote 3 Here, I maintain that the decline in the labor share is also a long-run consequence of automation induced by population aging. However, in contrast to other studies my analysis predicts that the labor share remains bounded away from zero even if the incentives to automate become very strong. Finally, let me confront two key findings of the present paper with those obtained in the canonical OLG-model.Footnote 4 In the latter model, a decline in the population growth rate increases the capital-labor ratio in the long run and induces positive level effects on per-capita variables. In contrast, the present paper shows that a higher capital-labor ratio due to a decline in population growth generates incentives for automation that can trigger a higher long-run growth rate. A permanently lower population growth rate is therefore associated with faster long-run growth of per-capita variables.Footnote 5 Moreover, in the model of this paper a lower population growth rate is associated with a decline in the labor share even though the reduced-form production function is Cobb–Douglas. This contrasts with the canonical OLG-model where the Cobb–Douglas production function precludes that a lower population growth rate can have an effect on the labor share. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model. Section 2.1 introduces the novel production sector. Here, I show that the profit-maximizing production plan associates automation with a rationalization effect, a productivity effect, a task-expansion effect, and an output expansion effect. Moreover, I show that automation is labor-augmenting in the aggregate production function and reduces the labor share. Section 2.2 introduces the household sector. Sections 3, 4, and 5 contain the main results of this paper. The focus of Sect. 3 is on the inter-temporal general equilibrium, the mechanics of the labor market, and the properties of the dynamical system. Sections 4 and 5 derive the effect of population aging on automation, growth, and factor shares in the short and the long run. Section 6 concludes. All proof are relegated to the Appendix. The separate Online Appendix contains supplementary empirical findings as well as a calibration exercise.",1
27,1,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-021-09199-6,Creativity over time and space,Michel Serafinelli,Guido Tabellini,,Male,Male,,Male,"Creativity is often highly concentrated in time and space, and across different domains. In the fifteenth century, Florence was home to an amazing number of groundbreaking innovators in literature, paintings, sculpture and philosophy. At the turn of the nineteenth century, Vienna hosted pioneers in paintings, medicine, biology, psychology, philosophy, music, who interacted with each other. Antwerp in the sixteenth century, London and Paris in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, San Francisco and New York in the past few decades, are other recent examples (Banks, 1997; Kandel, 2012). What explains the formation and decay of such centers of innovation? A priori, one would expect creative clusters to emerge in societies that are: (i) more affluent—because economic prosperity fuels the demand for the services of creatives, and provides resources for training and education; and (ii) more free—because political freedoms create a more open and dynamic social environment. In this paper we show that the historical evidence from European cities strongly supports (ii), but not (i). We analyze data on European creative elites born in the eleventh–nineteenth centuries. We exploit information on the date and place of birth and death of notable individuals in arts, humanities, science and business. Our main source is Freebase.com, a large data base owned by Google and coded by Schich et al. (2014), that stores information from a variety of publicly editable sources, most notably Wikipedia. After integrating these individual data with additional information scraped from the internet, we match them with a historical data set on European cities and local institutions put together by Bairoch et al. (1988) and Bosker et al. (2013). Our unit of observation is thus a city in a particular century between the eleventh and nineteenth centuries. We consider two main variables. First, the number of famous people born in a city (per 1000 inhabitants) during a century. Births of famous creatives are a measure of the local opportunities for radical innovation offered to young talent. As emphasized by Kubler (1962), successful creativity reflects a fortuitous match of individual predispositions with local opportunities for innovation.Footnote 1 Place of birth is more informative than place of death, because the external environment has a greater impact on younger individuals, through role models and opportunities for social learning and training—see also Bell et al. (2019).Footnote 2 Second, we consider the number of famous immigrants, defined as the number of deaths (per 1000 inhabitants) of famous creatives born elsewhere. This variable captures the attractiveness of a locality due to opportunities for professional enhancement or a market for one’s services. Given the breadth of our data in terms of time, geography and disciplines, we don’t have information on where these notable individuals did their most important work. We doubt that this is an important omission, however, since any invention reflects ideas and experiences accumulated through a life time.Footnote 3 We find two main results. First, there is no evidence that changes in local economic conditions play an important role in the formation or decay of creative clusters, except in a few specific disciplines. In line with other historical studies—e.g. Bosker et al. (2013)—we use urban population as an index of local economic conditions. Neither current nor lagged changes in population are correlated with changes in famous births or immigrants, although there is some heterogeneity across disciplines: changes in births of famous non-performing artists and changes in famous immigrants in business are preceded by changes in population in the same direction. The same finding also holds in a gravity model, where changes in the bilateral flow of creative migrants across cities are not correlated with changes in the size of the origin or destination city. Population is an imperfect measure of local economic conditions. We thus repeat the analysis with historical data on real wages of skilled workers. Here the sample only includes about 30 major European cities, but time is measured in decades rather than centuries, and for most cities the period goes from 1400 to the mid nineteenth century. There is no evidence that wages started increasing before famous births or the arrival of famous immigrants. This is true for all disciplines. A possible concern with wage data is that they do not exhibit enough variation, but there is no correlation with creativity even if we restrict the sample to cities and decades where wage variation is more pronounced. On the other hand, our wage data do predict urban population, indicating that they vary sufficiently over time to have explanatory power in other contexts. This finding may seem surprising to economists, and it could reflect measurement error in our indicators of economic conditions. But it is in line with historical anecdotal evidence. Although there are instances where good local economic conditions and artistic florescence went hand in hand, like the emergence of a market for Belgian and Dutch paintings in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries (De Marchi and Van Miegroet, 2006), there are also prominent examples to the contrary. For instance, London under Queen Elisabeth, Florence during the Renaissance, and Spanish cities in the seventeenth century are examples of peak creativity achieved during difficult economic times, while rich Genoa remained in artistic obscurity for several centuries.Footnote 4 Transitions into commune and births of famous creatives. The figure plots point estimates for leading and lagging indicators for the change in commune status. We estimate (5) by OLS, including separate indicator variables for two centuries before the transition, the century of the transition, one century after, and for centuries 2 and forward. In other words, we constrain the effects of the transition to remain constant from century 2 onwards. We normalize \(\beta _{-1}\) to zero, so that all post-event coefficients can be interpreted as treatment effects. The dependent variable is \(Log (1+Births)\). The variable Births is equal to the number of famous creatives born in a city, per 1000 inhabitants. Vertical bars correspond to 95% confidence intervals with region-clustered standard errors. We include city FE and century FE. Results are very similar when adding the full set of controls, including the spatial lag Spatial distribution of births of famous creatives, fifteenth century. The darker the tone, the higher the number of famous creatives born in a city during the century, per 1000 inhabitants. The larger the circle, the larger the population of the city. The names in the map indicate the location of present-day cities, which may have been small or may have not existed in the fifteenth century. The map only displays those cities in our sample which are geographically more central Our second main result is that, instead, the formation of creative clusters is strongly correlated with becoming a free city, as measured by the dummy variable “Commune” coded by Bosker et al. (2013). Communes protected basic economic freedoms, promoted trade, guaranteed freedom of movement and from censorship and other personal freedoms. This attracted religious and political exiles and created a dynamic social environment, in frequent contact with other trading centers and open to external ideas and innovations.Footnote 5 Communal participatory institutions also established an inclusive social order, that reinforced civic capital and emphasized the importance of the common good over particularistic interests (Brucker, 2015). These cultural traits created a fertile ground for innovative activities that would benefit all, such as the pursuit of knowledge and artistic creations. Moreover, Communes often promoted works of art that could become symbols of the city and enhance its prestige—see for instance Paoletti and Radke (2005), Connell (2002) on Florence and Norman (1999) on Siena. These institutional features that made Communes hubs of innovation are reflected in our findings. Becoming a Commune is followed by a rise in births of famous creatives, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The treatment variable is Commune, and it is measured at about the beginning of each century. Becoming a Commune (date 0 in Fig. 1) is associated with a 5 percentage point increase in the births of creative individuals (per 1000 inhabitants) during the same century (an increase of about 25% relative to the average number of famous births), with an additional increase in the subsequent century. We obtain similar results in a gravity model where we study the bilateral flow of creative immigrants across European cities, using a diff-in-diff methodology: becoming a Commune is associated with an increase in the inflow of notable individuals, that almost doubles in size. As described by Pirenne (2014) and Parker (2004), communal institutions often evolved from within the city, and were guided by the aspiration of the urban middle classes to gain freedom and independence from external influence (primarily in opposition to the Church or an external Lord). In some cases, autonomy and freedom were granted in order to encourage new settlements during periods of intense migration (Bartlett, 1994). An obvious concern, therefore, is that the economic and social changes that led to the emergence of communal institutions also had a direct effect on creative endeavors, for instance by creating a demand for works of art or of education. Our first finding, that economic conditions are not correlated with current or subsequent creativity, reduces this concern somewhat. Nevertheless, to limit the scope of omitted variables, we construct two instrumental variables. Our main instrument exploits the idea that political transitions were facilitated by external forces, such as a vacuum of regional powers or contagion effects in the aspirations of cities. Adapting a strategy introduced by Persson and Tabellini (2009) and Acemoglu et al. (2019) to study democratic transitions, we instrument Commune with the incidence of Commune in the remainder of the region (defined by current NUTS 1 administrative borders). The identifying assumption is that, conditional on time and city fixed effects and other covariates, regional waves of institutional transitions influence city level creativity only through the city political institutions. To make this assumption less restrictive, we also control for regional waves of creativity (measured by the spatial lag of births of notable individuals in the region). These IV estimates confirm the results of the event study and are very robust. On average, births of creative people increase by 10 percentage points or more during the century (almost a 50% increase relative to the average), upon a transition into Commune. As a robustness check, we also rely on a second instrument inspired by Schulz et al. (2019): whether a city was exposed to the medieval Church policy of banning cousin-marriage. As argued by Goody and Goody (1983), this religious innovation led to the dissolution of kin networks in early medieval Europe. This resulted in profound cultural transformations, also documented in Schulz et al. (2019), which in turn facilitated the emergence of participatory political institutions. This second instrument is not strongly correlated with the first one, and it confirms the robustness of our findings. Finally, the paper describes a number of stylized facts on the temporal and spatial patterns of creative clusters. First, births of creative people and famous immigrants are more spatially concentrated than population, and they are clustered across disciplines. Hence spillover effects associated with local proximity and/or local factors are important for creative activities, and operate across disciplines and not just within each field. This finding is consistent with the discussion and evidence in Jacobs (1969) and Glaeser et al. (1992).Footnote 6 Second, births and immigration are persistent, but less than population. Cities that are at the frontier of creativity in one period retain an advantage that persists for a while but not indefinitely. This too echoes similar results on clusters of innovation (Saxenian, 1994; Duranton, 2007; Kerr, 2010). Estimating a transition matrix, we also find that persistence of creativity is higher at the bottom of the distribution than at the top. Most small and uncreative cities remain in that condition. But at the top of the distribution there is more reshuffling in creative clusters than for population: while most large cities keep growing and remain large, creative clusters exhibit more change over the centuries. Third, the overall spatial proximity of births and the distribution of birth-to-death distances did not change much over the centuries. This stability is somewhat surprising, in light of the consolidation of states and the improvements in the means of transportation throughout this period. It suggests that the agglomeration of creative activities is not very sensitive to the cost of transportation and communication, but reflects historically stable forces.Footnote 7 Our paper is related to a large literature. A strong link is with the important work of Mokyr (1990) on the history of technology, and Mokyr et al. (2002) and Mokyr (2016) on the flow of ideas across Europe, and their role in the industrial revolution. Mokyr et al. (2002) and Mokyr (2016) mostly focus on the second half of our sample period, and emphasize the importance of interactions within a European community of intellectuals. Our results suggest that self-governing cities were an important component of the relatively free environment in which these exchanges thrived. Our paper is also related to Cox (2017), who argues that local autonomy and economic freedoms were key to European growth in the period leading to the industrial revolution. Finally, our study is also motivated by the literature on upper tail human capital and the industrial revolution (Mokyr, 2009; Meisenzahl and Mokyr, 2011; Squicciarini and Voigtländer, 2014). The link between democratic institutions and innovation has been studied in the context of economic growth by Acemoglu and Robinson (2012) and Acemoglu (2008), while De Long and Shleifer (1993), Bosker et al. (2013) and Guiso et al. (2016) have shown the positive relationship between political institutions and urban development. Others have investigated how local cultural traits affect innovation. In particular, Bénabou et al. (2015a) and Bénabou et al. (2015b) show that religiosity is negatively correlated with indicators of innovation. See also Saxenian (1994), Florida (2005), Falck et al. (2011), Acemoglu et al. (2014), Akcigit et al. (2017a) and Akcigit et al. (2017b). Our paper is also related to a growing literature on innovation. One line of research, surveyed in Carlino and Kerr (2015), analyzes the connections between agglomeration and innovation. Agglomeration advantages are also reviewed by Combes and Gobillon (2015). Much of this research focuses on recent periods and exploits patent data. A similar historical perspective to ours is taken by a set of studies using microdata on upper tail human capital, such as Schich et al. (2014), De la Croix and Licandro (2015), Gergaud et al. (2016) and Laouenan et al. (2021).Footnote 8 In particular Gergaud et al. (2016) analyze a database of more than one million famous individuals and more than seven million places associated with them throughout human history (3000BCE−2015AD). They document several interesting facts regarding notable people, including a positive correlation between the number of entrepreneurs and artists and subsequent urban growth, which is consistent with our evidence, and a zero or negative correlation between the share of “militaries, politicians and religious people” and urban growth. Relative to their paper, we focus on the effects of local self-government institutions on the formation of creative clusters. More recently, De La Croix et al. (2020) have studied the mobility decisions of scholars across European universities; relative to this paper, our sample also includes creatives who were not affiliated with any university, such as artists and members of scientific academies, and it probably represents the upper tail of the distribution of scholars. Finally, two related papers study the effects of local institutions on innovation, using historical data on Germany. Donges et al. (2016) show that counties whose institutions are more inclusive as a consequence of the French occupation after 1789 turn out to be more innovative (in terms of patents per capita). Dittmar and Meisenzahl (2020) show that sixteenth century legal reforms establishing mass public education and increasing state capacity had a positive effect on upper tail human capital. The outline of the paper is as follows. The next section defines the data and their sources. Section 3 describes a number of stylized facts about the spatial and temporal distribution of creativity.

27,1,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-021-09194-x,The origins of cultural divergence: evidence from Vietnam,Hoang-Anh Ho,Peter Martinsson,Ola Olsson,,Male,Male,Male,"Economic research has uncovered strong associations between many cultural traits and various indicators of individual behavior, and institutional and economic development (e.g., Guiso et al., 2011; Fernández, 2011; Algan & Pierre, 2014; Doepke & Fabrizio, 2014; Alesina & Giuliano, 2014, 2015). Among the cultural traits, the individualism–collectivism dimension has been found to be a powerful predictor of economic and democratic development in a large sample of countries (Gorodnichenko & Roland, 2011, 2015, 2017).Footnote 1 These empirical findings lead us to an important question: Why are some societies more or less collectivistic or individualistic than others? In the present paper, we hypothesize that cultural differences along the individualism–collectivism dimension across modern societies can be traced back to repeated processes of territorial expansion and migration that happened in historical times. In particular, we advance a selective migration hypothesis, consisting of three building blocks. First, in regions where settled agriculture and states arose early, collectivist societies emerged through a process of self-domestication as communities made the transition from hunter-gatherer strategies of food procurement, which were characterized by individualism, to agricultural food production, resulting in a gradual strengthening of “civilizing” collectivism. Second, these collectivist societies triggered the out-migration of individualistic members toward peripheral areas. This pattern then repeated itself as the individualistic migrants inhabited and developed these peripheral areas into less collectivistic societies compared to the ones they left behind, which in turn induced more individualistic members to migrate toward more peripheral areas. Eventually, these migration processes gave rise to cultural differences along the individualism–collectivism dimension across societies. Third, owing to the slow-moving nature of culture, these differences have persisted over time and constitute an important feature of the cultural landscapes exhibited in modern times. As a result, the time elapsed since the collectivist transformation can predict the strength of collectivism across modern societies. Testing the selective migration hypothesis requires a historical setting where there was a large out-migration of people from a collectivist society in the core region to settle down in new regions with a similar biogeography as in the core region, and that this migration repeated over time once collectivism was gradually strengthened in the new regions. We find such an ideal setting in the process of territorial expansion and migration in historical Vietnam. Gaining independence from the colonization of imperial China during the first millennium, historical Vietnam initially governed the region of what is now north Vietnam with a centralized government and a collectivist social organization. At the same time, the territory in the south of historical Vietnam was sparsely populated by many ethnic tribes that did not have a centralized government. From 968 to 1757, historical Vietnam gradually expanded its territory southward to the Mekong River Delta to establish the country as it is today (see Fig. 1). This process happened through successive waves of state conquest followed by civil migration, resulting in the displacement of most of the population of local ethnic tribes. Applying the logic of the selective migration hypothesis, we argue that the time elapsed since annexation to historical Vietnam is an important predictor of the strength of collectivism across regions within contemporary Vietnam. The Vietnamese Southern advance Note: The year at which a district was annexed into historical Vietnam. See Online Appendix A for data sources To test the selective migration hypothesis, an ideal empirical strategy would consist of three integral parts. The first part should demonstrate that some early agricultural states were characterized by collectivism, and that people who migrated to the new territories following state expansions were less collectivistic or more individualistic than those who stayed. The second requires historical data to prove that these selective migrations gave rise to early cultural differences along the individualism–collectivism dimension between the initial regions and the new territories. Finally, the third part involves using present-day data to conduct an empirical analysis on the relationship between the time elapsed since the collectivist transformation and the strength of collectivism. To match this ideal empirical strategy in the context of Vietnam, we first present qualitative accounts to demonstrate that the initial society of historical Vietnam was characterized by strong collectivist norms. Second, we examine available primary records on the territorial expansion of historical Vietnam to identify the categories of people who migrated to the new annexed territories. In addition, we provide qualitative accounts and descriptive statistics to show that cultural differences along the individualism–collectivism dimension across regions were already present in Vietnam in the Seventeenth century. Third, we provide empirical evidence for a positive relationship between the time elapsed since an area was annexed to historical Vietnam and various indicators of collectivism in the present day. Using different robustness checks, we further show that these empirical findings are consistent with the self-domestication/selective migration hypothesis. To capture the strength of collectivism, we focus on the societal ability to solve collective action problems, which is the main feature of collectivism studied in related economic models (Gorodnichenko & Roland, 2015, 2017). What constitutes a collective action, of course, varies significantly across societies. In Vietnam, labor contribution to public goods production is a typical collective action (Adams & Hancock, 1970). In particular, every year households in a local area send their members to work without payment to build or repair local public infrastructure such as roads, wells, irrigation, schools, and health clinics. Because collectivist societies are considered to be better at solving collective action problems, it should be able to mobilize a larger amount of voluntary labor contribution to public goods production from their in-group members. Using data on voluntary labor contribution to public goods production from around 30,000 households in the Vietnam Household Living Standard Survey, we aggregate three related indicators at the district level: (1) the percentage of households contributing labor, (2) the average number of persons per household making labor contributions, and (3) the average number of labor days contributed per household. We find that districts annexed earlier to historical Vietnam currently have higher percentages of households contributing labor, more members per household making labor contributions, and more labor days contributed per household. The estimated effects are economically and statistically significant, and robust to the inclusion of potential confounding factors, various sub-samples, and omitted-variable bias, among other checks. In addition, we also use data from the Population and Housing Census (covering in total 16.5 million households nationwide) to construct two measures of individualism–collectivism traits that have frequently been used in the literature as proxies for such cultural norms (Vandello & Cohen, 1999; Talhelm et al., 2014): Extended family structure and marriage stability. In line with our hypothesis, we find that households in districts that were annexed earlier have a higher percentage of households with grandchildren living in them and a lower prevalence of divorced households. To examine in-group cooperation in more detail, we conduct a lab-in-the-field public goods experiment with high school students from the same districts, including an earlier-annexed district and a later-annexed district. This is a subject pool who are old enough to be aware of the cooperative norms in their communities, but not yet affected by living outside their communities. The advantage of the experiment is that the institutional setting can be kept constant, which helps ruling out the influences of informal institutions on cooperation behaviors. More importantly, the experimental design allows us to examine if the difference in the contribution to public goods between the two chosen districts is driven by a difference in preferences for cooperation or a difference in beliefs about the cooperative behaviors of others. We find that subjects from the earlier-annexed district contribute substantially more in the public goods experiments compared to subjects from the later-annexed district, and that the result is mainly driven by the belief about the contribution levels of the other subjects. Thus, the experimental findings corroborate the survey data analysis and further suggest that cultural differences across Vietnamese regions are embodied in individual beliefs. Our research relates to a growing multidisciplinary literature examining the origins of cultural differences along the individualism–collectivism dimension.Footnote 2 Theories based on ecological context posit that some forms of production in subsistence economies (e.g., farming) require more functional interdependence than others (e.g., hunting), which gave rise to collectivism as an adaptation mechanism (e.g., Vandello & Cohen, 1999; Talhelm et al., 2014). In a recent paper, Buggle (2020) documents that societies where irrigation agriculture was practiced tend to have stronger collectivist norms (and a lower degree of innovative activities) even today. In related research, Bentzen et al. (2017) show that historical irrigation is also associated with autocratic governance. Litina (2016) argues further that lower level of natural land productivity increased the return to public agricultural infrastructure, which generated higher incentives for cooperation to solve the problem of collective action.Footnote 3 Motivated by the history of settlement in the United States and its highly individualist culture, Kitayama et al. (2006, 2009) proposed the voluntary settlement hypothesis, asserting that settlers in frontier areas are likely to have highly autonomous, independent, and goal-oriented mindsets. Bazzi et al. (2020) expand on this theme and study the cultural legacy of the nineteenth century westward expansion in the United States. The authors show that contemporary individualism is stronger in historical frontier areas and that a selective migration of individualists to the periphery explains part of this pattern, along with the particular characteristics of wilderness and isolation in the west. Knudsen (2019) finds a similar pattern of selective migration among Scandinavian migrants to the United States in the nineteenth century, using uncommonness of first names as a proxy for the degree of individualism. She also documents that the out-migration of strong individualists made the home regions more collectivist in the long run. Giavazzi et al. (2019) study the evolution of preferences among European immigrants to the United States and find that the persistence in cultural attitudes is substantial across the spectrum of values. Using a similar line of argument as in the current paper, Olsson and Paik (2016) show that collectivism is stronger in regions across western Eurasia that adopted agriculture earlier during the Neolithic Revolution. The present paper builds on and adds to this literature in various ways. To the best of our knowledge, no studies on the origins of cultural differences along the individualism–collectivism dimension have examined the societal ability to solve the problem of collective action, especially using a combination of survey and experimental data. Furthermore, most studies so far have either employed cross-country comparisons or concentrated on currently developed societies. Because these societies have gone through the modernization process to a greater extent, the reduction of the traditional cultural landscapes makes it harder to study the historical origins of cultural differences. By comparing different regions within a single and biogeographically homogenous developing country that experienced a relatively recent economic modernization, our research is able to overcome these limitations. Our research also fits into a literature in economics examining the persistence of various cultural traits as an important channel through which historical processes could influence contemporary economic development (Nunn, 2012, 2014; Spolaore & Wacziarg, 2013). Some notable traits are gender equality (Alesina et al., 2013; Hansen et al., 2015), trust and cooperation (Nunn & Wantchekon, 2011; Becker et al., 2016; Bigoni et al., 2016, 2018; Guiso et al., 2016; Litina, 2016), anti-Semitic attitudes (Voigtländer & Voth, 2012), time preference (Galor & Özak, 2016), civic values Lowes et al. 2017 and norms favoring hard work (Fouka & Schläpfer, 2020). The theoretical basis for understanding intergenerational and other types of cultural transmission was pioneered by Bisin and Verdier (2001) and Richerson and Boyd (2005). In a related recent study, Dell et al. (2018) use a border regression discontinuity design along a border segment in southern Vietnam which they claim was a stable demarcation between historical Vietnam and tributary polities to the Khmer Empire from 1698 to the 1830s. The main hypothesis is that the presence of a centralized historical state should crowd in local collective action, which in turn was beneficial for subsequent economic development. The authors show that living standards are currently higher in the border areas governed for a longer period of time by the centralized states of historical Vietnam. As one potential mechanism for this result, Dell et al. (2018) explore whether historical institutions contributed to a greater ability of collective action, measured by participation in civil society organizations. Our research differentiates from Dell et al. (2018) in the following ways. First, our emphasis is on a mechanism of selective migration rather than on crowding in of norms by a powerful state. In the sections below, we argue that our mechanism has strong support in the historical literature on Vietnam, as well as reflecting a general pattern throughout Southeast Asia (Scott, 2009). It should be recognized though that the two hypotheses are strongly linked and that the true historical process probably had elements of both crowding in and selective migration. Second, our main outcome variable is cultural norms of collectivism-individualism rather than indicators for economic development. We would argue our research is complementary since it investigates a different cultural dimension for understanding long-run economic development. Third, rather than using a border regression discontinuity design as in Dell et al. (2018), our main empirical strategy is to exploit a countrywide sample of districts across all of Vietnam. Our basic rationale for this strategy is that our coding of the official chronicles of historical Vietnam suggests a more or less continuous process of state expansion that was completed in 1757.Footnote 4 The remainder of the present paper is organized as follows. The next section discusses in detail the conceptual framework behind the selective migration hypothesis. Section 3 provides the historical background of the southward territorial expansion of historical Vietnam and the accompanying migration process, with a focus on the three building blocks of the selective migration hypothesis. Section 4 presents the empirical analysis with survey data. Section 5 describes the sample selection, experimental design, and corresponding results. Section 6 closes the paper with some concluding remarks.",1

The Web Appendix provides more details on sources. Appx. Table A2 shows summary statistics. Missions in Ghana. We partition Ghana into 2091 grid cells of 0.1 x 0.1 degrees (12 x 12 km) and construct an annual panel data set from 1751 to 1932 (181 years). Merriam-Webster (2020) defines a mission station as “a place of missionary residence in or from which missionary activity in a given area is carried on.” We recreate the history of every mission station (N = 2144) for all mission societies (classified as Presbyterian, Methodist, Catholic and other) and geocode their locations. Our main sources are the ecclesiastical census returns published in the Blue Books of the Gold Coast, 1844–1932 (see Web Appx. Fig. A1 for an example). Each mission society was required to submit annual reports on its activities to the colonial administration, thereby listing all of their stations. Churches received annual grants from the colonial government for their pastoral services, which provided a strong incentive to report. Our data thus represents an exhaustive census of missions. The early origins of mission societies are then well documented by society-specific anniversary reports, and we have no difficulties reconstructing missions before 1844. Using the same sources, we identify if a mission was a main station or an out-station. Main stations are the principal centers of a “circuit” - a society’s administrative unit. Main stations are larger and centrally located (Thauren 1931); they are headed by an ordained missionary. The congregations of out-stations are smaller but still of significant size and taken together have more members than main stations. All mission posts, not just main stations, built churches.Footnote 12 We also identify if a mission had a school. We focus on “assisted schools”, which followed the government school curriculum and certified quality standards (Williamson 1952). As they received grants-in-aid, they were reported accurately. The existing mission literature has not distinguished between main, out-stations and schools. We follow this decision in our main analysis. However, we will also study heterogeneous effects with respect to the type of mission. Missionaries in Ghana. We create a data set of all 338 male European missionaries stationed in Ghana during 1751–1890 from a variety of sources (data not available post-1890). For the mortality analysis in Sect. 3, we reconstructed dates of service and death in Ghana. African missionary careers are less well-documented. From the Blue Books 1846–90, we retrieved the localities where European missionaries were permanently based and which missions they served occasionally.Footnote 13 Locational Factors for Ghana. We construct a GIS data set at the same grid resolution: (i) Geography: Historical malaria intensity (based on genetic data) comes from Depetris-Chauvin and Weil (2018). We compute the distance to the coast and obtain ports c. 1850 from Dickson (1969); (ii) Political conditions: Data on large pre-colonial cities before 1800 are from Chandler (1987) and headchief towns in 1901 are from Guggisberg (1908). From Dickson (1969), we derive the boundary of the Gold Coast Colony established by the British c. 1850; (iii) Transportation: We obtain from Dickson (1969) navigable rivers in 1850–1930 and trade routes circa 1850. Railroads (1897–1932) and roads (1932) come from Jedwab and Moradi (2016); (iv) Population: From census gazetteers, we compile a GIS database of towns above 1000 inhabitants in 1891, 1901 and 1931. We also collect rural population data for 1901 and 1931. Because all cells have the same area, population levels are equivalent to densities;Footnote 14 (v) Economic activities: Slave export and slave market data come from Nunn (2008) and Osei (2014) respectively. We obtain cash crop production areas from Dickson (1969) and total export value of cash crops from Frankema et al. (2018).Footnote 15 Mines are from Dickson (1969); and (vi) Other: We obtain area, mean annual rainfall (mm) in 1900–1960, mean altitude (m), ruggedness (standard deviation of altitude), and soil fertility. Contemporary Data for Ghana. We use satellite data on night lights in 2010 as a proxy for local economic development (NGDC 2015). We use the radiance calibrated version of this data, to avoid issues related to top-coding.Footnote 16 Census data on religion, education, fertility, mortality, employment and urbanization in 2000 are from Ghana (2000). To study child mortality, we use seven Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) between 1993 and 2017 (USAID 2020).Footnote 17 Data for Africa. We compile data for 203,574 grid cells of 0.1 x 0.1 degrees (12 x 12 km) for 43 sub-Saharan African countries. The Blue Books of the Gold Coast (Ghana) are exceptionally rich in detail. Blue Books of other British colonies do not list each station systematically over such a long period. Yearbooks of other colonies are completely silent. We thus use mission location data widely used in the literature. These stem from mission atlases. (Fahs 1925, p. 271) writes that these atlases are based on “hundreds of documents” and “society field reports” and admits “problems of what to include in or to exclude (...).” Keeping this caveat in mind, we use Beach (1903), compiled by Cagé and Rueda (2016), which reports the locations of 677 Protestant missions in 1900, and added the year of foundation ourselves. We then use Roome (1925), digitized by Nunn (2010), which shows the respective locations of Catholic and Protestant missions in 1924 (N = 1212). The set of locational factors for Africa follows the one for Ghana: (i) Geography: Historical malaria intensity is from Depetris-Chauvin and Weil (2018) and tsetse fly ecology from Alsan (2015). We compute distance to the coast, and 19th century slave ports are from Nunn and Wantchekon (2011); (ii) Political conditions: Data on large pre-colonial cities before 1800 are from Chandler (1987). Data on the capital, largest and 2nd largest cities come from Jedwab and Moradi (2016). The year of colonization for each ethnic group is from Henderson and Whatley (2014). Using the Murdock (1967) map of ethnic boundaries (Nunn 2008), we then assign a year of colonization to each cell. From the same sources, we know if the cell was in an ethnic area with a centralized state before colonization. We compute the distance to historical Muslim centers based on Ajayi and Ade and Michael Crowder, (1974) and Sluglett (2014); (iii) Transportation: We obtain navigable rivers and lakes from Johnston (1915), pre-colonial explorer routes from Nunn and Wantchekon (2011) and railroads from Jedwab and Moradi (2016); (iv) Population: We control for population density c. 1800 and log urban and rural population c. 1900 from HYDE (Goldewijk et al. 2010), and log city population c. 1900 for towns above 10,000 from colonial administrative sources;Footnote 18 (v) Economic activities: We know if slavery and polygamy was historically practiced (Murdock 1967). The log number of slaves exported per land area is from Nunn and Wantchekon (2011). Land suitability measures for various cash crops are from FAO (2012). We obtain cash crops’ national export value in 1850–1924 (Frankema et al. 2018). Mines in 1900 and 1924 come from Mamo et al. (2019); (vi) Other: We obtain area, mean annual rainfall (mm, 1900–60), mean altitude (m), ruggedness, and soil fertility.Footnote 19 Finally, we also use satellite data on night lights in 2010 (NGDC 2015).",1

27,2,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-021-09201-1,Meritocracy and the inheritance of advantage,David Comerford,José V. Rodríguez Mora,Michael J. Watts,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Meritocracy, as a term, was first coined in the 1950s by British Sociologist Michael Young and was intended to describe the process of selectivity in education and labor markets whereby those perceived to have the most talent received the greatest rewards (Young 1958). Young intended it as a warning—talent can be bought and increasingly unequal rewards breed discontent—but the concept has since garnered significant positive attention. In this paper, we adopt Young’s definition of meritocracy—allowing firms to better judge the abilities of their workers, independently of their backgrounds—and investigate the extent to which it feeds into levels of income inequality and social mobility. We begin by modeling, in a standard manner, the decisions of parents regarding investment in their children’s education given incomplete capital markets and an income process which they take as exogenous. We then endogenize this process by determining how the market rewards agents based on certain observable characteristics. This is the central feature of our model: firms observe signals on both the human capital and parental income of workers, and decide how much to pay based on these signals. The decisions made by parents and firms are interconnected. Parents’ investment decisions depend on the extent to which the resulting signals will be rewarded by firms; and the value which firms assign to the signals depends on their accuracy relative to the firm’s priors, itself a function of the amount of inequality in society which results from parental investment decisions. It is very hard in general to find analytical solutions to models of this sort, as the whole distribution of heterogeneous agents both determines the equilibrium and is determined by the equilibrium. Nevertheless we set up the environment in such a way that we can solve analytically not only for the steady state, but for the whole dynamic path of the equilibrium. We calculate the equilibrium weight given to the signals on human capital and parental income, and how these weights change when we exogenously vary the accuracy of the signals. This is how we provide more accurate information on human capital (meritocracy) and on parental income (inherited advantage). We then look at the implications of these changing weights for steady state income inequality and social mobility. Our model explains a new mechanism behind the well-known negative relationship between income inequality and social mobility.Footnote 1 This comes about because more inequality implies firms have weaker priors about workers’ human capital and come to rely more heavily on information which is correlated with parental income, reducing mobility. Moreover, this increased discrimination feeds back into income inequality. This creates a multiplier whereby small changes in fundamentals can have large steady state effects. The model shows how this increased discrimination by firms can come about as a result of more precise information on human capital. Thus better information on human capital increases inequality and lowers social mobility. This fall in mobility can happen directly, through greater weight being given to both the parental income and human capital signals, or indirectly, where the parental income signal plays less of a role in firms’ decisions, but the human capital signal is used more, and is sufficiently highly correlated with parental income through human capital investment, that mobility falls nonetheless. Thus, we show that if a society is better able to judge (and reward) individuals according to their human capital, then the unconditional intergenerational income correlation will necessarily increase, albeit the partial correlation (controlling for human capital) could decrease. This is one of our key results: societies that reward human capital handsomely—and where as a consequence the children of the rich do not enjoy advantages once human capital is accounted for—are nonetheless bound to show larger inequalities and lower social mobility because richer parents use the rewards to human capital to create advantages for their children through educational investment. We use a numerical illustration to show that this process describes the situation in the US, a very meritocratic society but one in which intergenerational mobility is very low. Moreover, there is a similar process whereby more information on parental income leads to lower mobility and greater inequality by allowing for greater statistical discrimination in favor of the children of the rich. This describes the situation in Italy. It makes clear that very different underlying processes can have very similar outcomes and how the degree of meritocracy has qualitatively the same effects on inequality and mobility as giving more information on an individual’s background. The paper proceeds in the following way: Section 2 discusses some related literature. Section 3 outlines the model and solves for the equilibrium levels of discrimination and income inequality given optimal behavior by parents and firms. Section 4 characterizes the effects of changes in the accuracy of information that firms receive. Section 5 is a bit more philosophical and considers different possible meanings of the word ""meritocracy"". It shows that our results are robust to these alternative possibilities. Section 6 describes a numerical illustration which allows us to estimate the degree of accuracy of the signals in different countries, and the weights which they are given. Section 7 puts forward some ideas for extensions and Sect. 8 concludes. All proofs can be found in the appendix.",1
27,2,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-021-09200-2,Measuring intragenerational mobility using aggregate data,Aart Kraay,Roy Van der Weide,,Male,Male,,Male,"Data on intragenerational mobility is crucial for interpreting evidence on aggregate growth and inequality changes. For example, the policy implications – and even the perceived fairness and political acceptability – of a given growth rate of average income in the top 1 percent of the income distribution depends crucially on whether the identity of those in the top income group is stable over time, or instead whether some of the initially rich fall out of the top group and are replaced with those who were initially poorer. This distinction also matters at the lower end of the income distribution. Consider for example the World Bank’s declared goal of promoting “shared prosperity”, defined as growth in the bottom 40 percent of a country’s income distribution.Footnote 1 To the extent that the role of such a goal is to evaluate the efficacy of interventions targeted towards the initially-poor members of the bottom 40 percent, it is necessary to know whether membership in this group is stable over time, or whether the initially-poor beneficiaries of these interventions become richer and move out of the bottom 40 percent and are replaced by those who started out richer but became relatively poorer. Despite the considerable policy relevance of the topic, our ability to measure and analyze intragenerational mobility and its implications for the distributional aspects of growth is severely constrained by the scarcity of panel data sets that track individual or household incomes over time. In advanced economies such as the United States, high-quality panel data are available in the Panel Study on Income Dynamics (PSID) over long periods of time, and can be used to document patterns in intragenerational mobility directly. However, outside a small number of mostly rich countries, high-quality panel data sets over long periods of time are scarce. Instead, it is much more common for survey data to be available in the form of repeated cross-sections, with different samples of individuals appearing in each round of the survey, and often with restricted access to the record-level data from the survey. In other cases, particularly for older datasets such as historical income tax records, the microdata may simply no longer exist, and therefore cannot be used to measure mobility directly. In these cases, researchers may only have access to summary statistics such as average income as well as some measure of distribution such as the Gini coefficient and/or grouped data on the proportion of individuals in different income brackets, but not the microdata itself. In this paper we propose and implement a method for approximating income distribution dynamics in these situations where only aggregate data in the form of summary statistics on the distribution of income are available. Our key assumption is that individual incomes follow an autoregressive lognormal process with individual fixed effects. Under this data generating process, the joint distribution of individual incomes in any two periods is fully characterized by the mean and standard deviation of log incomes in the two periods (which can readily be inferred from the observed aggregate moments of the income distribution), and a mobility parameter summarizing the persistence in incomes at the individual level between the two periods (which cannot be observed directly in the aggregate data). However, this mobility parameter depends on two underlying parameters of the data generating process: the autoregressive coefficient on log income, and the cross-sectional variance of the individual effects. We show that the limited information embodied in the evolution over time of the observed aggregate moments is sufficient to allow us to estimate the autoregressive coefficient on log income, as well as to place bounds on the variance of the individual effects. This in turn permits us to place bounds on the extent of mobility in the income distribution, even though we do not observe income dynamics at the individual level.Footnote 2 In order to assess the usefulness of these bounds, we use record-level data from nine long-running panel surveys that permit us to measure mobility directly using the micro-level panel data. We then discard all of the information in the record-level data and use only the two time series on the mean and standard deviation of log income to retrieve bounds on mobility. These bounds for the most part contain the point estimates obtained using the record-level data and reproduce the broad cross-country patterns in mobility as measured with micro data. This validation exercise furthermore identifies the empirical conditions under which the proposed method may fail to produce useful bounds on mobility. We next apply our method to two large cross-country datasets. The first of these is the World Inequality Database (WID), which reports summary statistics on average income and top income shares compiled from tabulated data on tax records. From this database, we retrieve time-series data on mean income and the bottom 90% income share for 19 countries with reasonably complete annual time series data during the post-World War II period. For the median country in this sample, we have 60 years of annual data on aggregate moments on which to base our estimates of mobility. The second data source is the collection of household surveys for a large set of mostly developing countries in the World Bank’s PovcalNet database. This dataset provides summary statistics on the distribution of income (or consumption, depending on the survey) for over 1400 household surveys in a large cross-section of developing countries, in some cases extending back to the 1980s. We retrieve data on mean income (or consumption) and the Gini coefficient for these surveys and restrict attention to the set of 28 countries for which we have at least 10 surveys. The median country in this sample has 16 household surveys spanning a period of 17 years. Using our method, we obtain bounds on mobility in a large cross-section of 46 developed and developing countries. To our knowledge, this is the largest cross-country dataset of measures of intragenerational mobility to date.Footnote 3 For many of these countries, high-quality long-running panel datasets tracking individual incomes over time are not available. For such countries, direct measurement of mobility is not possible, and our bounding method provides a feasible alternative. We use this global database to provide new evidence on the correlates of intragenerational mobility across countries. Our estimates suggest that mobility is lower, i.e. income stability tends to be higher, in countries that are richer, have higher top marginal tax rates, report greater confidence in labor unions, and perhaps somewhat surprisingly, have less rigid labour market regulations. These correlations are consistent with the view that public policies that can reduce the dispersion in income growth rates across individuals are costly and therefore are more prevalent in rich countries. Our findings are also consistent with lower levels of informality and greater job security in richer countries, and they support the idea that collective bargaining helps reduce individual downside income risk. The negative association between labour market rigidity and income stability is perhaps less intuitive. One candidate explanation is that rigid labour market regulations may lead to a segmented labour market in which a small share of workers enjoy secure jobs and stable income, while a large share of workers have less secure jobs and less stable incomes. Next, we use our estimated bounds to illustrate the importance of taking mobility into account when interpreting summary measures of growth across the income distribution. Specifically, we use our mobility bounds to generate bounds on the difference between “anonymous” growth rates of group average incomes (that do not require membership in the group to be stable over time) with corresponding “non-anonymous” growth rates (that track the performance of the same initial group of individuals over time). When we compare estimates of anonymous income growth rates among the bottom 40% to their non-anonymous counterparts, the difference is substantial: on average, non-anonymous growth rates exceed anonymous ones by three to four percentage points per year. This is a natural consequence of “churning” at the bottom of the income distribution, and implies that by tracking shared prosperity anonymously, policy makers could inadvertently overlook the successes with which initially-poor households have been able to increase their incomes. This ordering is reversed when we examine growth of average incomes at the top of the income distribution – the anonymous growth rate of top incomes is substantially higher than the corresponding non-anonymous growth rate, again reflecting churning in the income distribution. The magnitude of the differences we observe is also considerable, on average between eight and ten percentage points per year. This suggest that anonymous top income growth rates are not well-suited for estimating the expected income success of those who occupy the top of the income distribution at any given point in time.Footnote 4 Naturally, we do not claim that our method of obtaining bounds on mobility using aggregate data is superior to estimating mobility with panel microdata. When such data exists, measuring mobility directly clearly is preferable to our approximations based on aggregate moments. Similarly, in situations where repeated cross-sections of micro data are available, it is possible to use well-developed results from the pseudo-panel literature that tracks the evolution of synthetic cohorts over time to develop approximate measures of mobility (see for example the recent study by Krebs et al. (2019)).Footnote 5 Rather, the key value-added of our approach is to enable the analysis of mobility across a much broader set of countries where such microdata are not available to researchers. Our approach relies on the fact that, under certain assumptions, the parameters governing individual income distribution dynamics can be retrieved from time series data on aggregate moments only. In this respect, our work is similar in spirit to Caselli and Ventura (2000), who study a series of growth models with heterogeneous agents and show that under fairly general heterogeneity, (1) the aggregate economy behaves as if aggregate variables represent the decisions of a representative agent; and (2) the evolution of the aggregate variables characterizing the decisions of the representative agent are informative about the individual-level dynamics of income, consumption, and wealth. Our paper also relates to much earlier work by Creedy (1974), as summarized in Creedy (1993), Chapter 4. He studies simple autoregressive processes for individual incomes and derives results on the evolution of aggregate inequality implied by these processes. However, he does not take the next step that we do here, which is to use the information in the evolution of aggregate moments to obtain estimates of the parameters of the individual income data generating process. Our approach is also related to the macroeconometric literature that seeks to characterize the time-series properties of aggregate data in terms of the time- series properties of the underlying individual data. Classic references include Granger (1980) and Lewbel (1994) who show that the aggregate of individual heterogeneous AR(1) processes display long memory (Forni and Lippi, (1997, 1999) provide an extensive overview of this literature). While our mapping between aggregate and individual income dynamics is a familiar and simple special case of this literature, our use of this mapping to obtain estimates of intragenerational mobility is new. The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes our method for estimating mobility using aggregate data. Section 3 validates our method using long-running panel data from nine different countries. Section 4 provides estimates of mobility for a large cross-section of countries based only on the aggregate summary statistics on the distribution of income available in the WID and PovcalNet databases, and Sect. 5 uses this data to study the correlates of mobility across countries. In Sect. 6 we use our estimates of mobility to document the differences between anonymous and non-anonymous growth rates of group average incomes, and Sect. 7 concludes.",1

Rousseau,Male,,Male,Male,"Private equity funds account for a growing share of real investment in the U.S. economy, with the amounts placed in these funds reaching more than 6% the size of private domestic investment on average since 2001.Footnote 1 We build a model of private equity investment consistent with its cyclical properties, and fit the model to the observed levels and returns. We focus on the empirical regularity that investments in both venture capital (VC) and buyout funds rise relative to other forms of investment as a function of aggregate Tobin’s Q, but that venture responds more strongly. The left panel of Fig. 1 shows the relative “intakes” of VC and buyout funds along with fluctuations in Q from 1987 to 2016, and the scatterplot in the right panel shows the positive relation between the two.Footnote 2 The left panel of Fig. 2 shows the individual intakes and the closer link of venture with Q is apparent there as well. The relation between the log ratio of venture and buyout fund investments to aggregate Tobin’s Q, 1987–2016 Why is intake more Q-elastic for VC than for buyouts? Our model implies it is because buyout funds reorganize existing capital, which is costlier to acquire when Q rises, whereas VC does not face this impediment (and indeed ordinary investment faces it to an even greater extent than buyout). The right panel of Fig. 2 shows our second empirical regularity: payoffs to venture funds on average exceed those of buyout funds over the cycle.Footnote 3 In our model this occurs because both ventured and bought-out capital collect the same amount, Q, per unit when sold to the public, and it is thus only the difference in costs that drives the stronger response of VC intakes. Moreover, both types of private equity outperform the S&P 500, and both co-move with it, yet venture returns respond more strongly to returns on the S&P 500. The intakes of PE funds with respect to gross private domestic investment, and their respective returns, as related to Tobin’s Q and the S&P 500, 1987–2016 The key feature of the model is that the returns to venture and buyout are drawn from different distributions with the expected returns known before investment decisions are made. This implies that the investment choice for each type of fund is described by a simple cutoff rule: invest as long as the return is sufficiently high. The cutoffs vary over the business cycle, and the relative returns, as well as the cyclical variation in relative intakes of venture compared to buyout funds, are determined by the shapes of the distributions from which the returns are drawn. We show that, so long as the distribution of venture funds returns has a thinner tail than buyout returns, and the cutoffs are sufficiently close to each other, the model is consistent with the empirical regularities documented above. The model delivers premia over the S&P 500 return because private equity pays more when the cost of capital is high, but that’s also the time when aggregate investment is low and consumption is high. Higher returns to private equity thus tend to be realized when consumption is valued less at the margin. Earnings of the S&P 500 firms, on the other hand, depend primarily on TFP shocks, and there is no incentive to substitute toward consumption when TFP is high. Hence the premium for private equity.Footnote 4 Why do these distinctions between the two types of private equity matter for macroeconomics? Although monies placed in these two types of funds together amount to only 2–7% of the size of total domestic investment, with the average exceeding 6%, this ratio is growing rapidly. With VC intakes and returns more procyclical than those for buyout, it is clear that VC can amplify business fluctuations, and importantly at times when activity is expanding and less promising ideas are getting implemented. At the same time, venture has higher external benefits than buyout that may offset the change in the average quality of ideas: Gompers et al. (2005), for example, show that founders of venture capital-backed start-ups disproportionately come from prior positions at previously venture-backed companies. This is learning-by-investing and therefore the Arrow (1971) type of effect that Searle (1945) and Lucas (1993, Fig. 1) document, with such learning disproportionately associated with new ventures. In particular, we embed VC and buyout funds in a traditional Ak model and show, analytically and numerically, that their addition contributes to growth while retaining all of the standard implications of the Ak model. A stylized parametric example shows that PE can account for as much as half of observed growth. This effect falls to 7% of observed growth in numerical estimations with less extreme distributional assumptions about the quality of new projects and under Epstein–Zin preferences. Under CRRA preferences the effect is 11% of observed growth. Using another plausible measure of PE excess returns in the literature, these contributions could be as low as 5.8–9.7%. In all cases the effect of venture on growth is larger than that of buyout, and the overall growth effects could be even larger if PE were embedded in a heterogeneous-idea model of the Lucas and Moll (2014) or Perla and Tonetti (2014) types. We then ask if the Ak structure of our model, with its constant returns to factors, may overstate the growth effect of PE funds if in reality returns to factors diminish. In that case PE raises not long-run growth but the steady-state level of GDP. We indeed find the effect to be three or four times smaller than in the Ak version. That said, we believe that the Ak framework should apply to PE generally and especially to the venture capital sector, which deals with projects close to the technological frontier. Since technologies build on one another, they probably do not face the diminishing returns that ordinary capital faces. Opp (2019) also models the implementation of heterogeneous ideas by VC funds, and in his model as in ours VC activity is procyclical, with funding standards declining during booms in the sense that the average quality of implemented ideas is countercyclical. He analyzes venture only, whereas we also analyze buyouts. As a result, we can study the movements in the relative intakes (Fig. 1) as well as the relative performance of venture and buyout funds (Fig. 2). To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to endogenize both types of investments or “intakes” in a dynamic general equilibrium model. In addition, Opp (2019) quantifies VC funds’ impact on aggregate growth and welfare while we study contributions to growth from both types of PE funds. A complementary explanation for the premium in private equity returns is illiquidity, where there is an effective lock-up period of as long as 10–12 years. Sorensen et al. (2014) model the effects of these lock ups and find an annual premium of slightly more than 1%, which we subtract from the returns that we target when estimating the model. Ang et al. (2014) also find the premium to be about 1%. Amihud and Mendelson (1986) argue that the low liquidity premia are the result of a selection effect whereby investors who can tolerate risk more easily are drawn into private equity—a preferred habitat view. Our discussion of private equity is confined to PE funds. A broader measure of private equity includes occupation-specific investments in physical and human capital such as those made by self-employed people. Hamilton (2000) and Moskowitz and Vissing-Jørgensen (2002) find the risk-adjusted return to self employment insufficient to compensate for foregone wage earnings, and that perhaps non-pecuniary benefits play a major role. Such benefits are presumably not present when investing in PE funds. Vereshchagina and Hopenhayn (2009) point out, however, that the option of liquidating a private equity investment after realizing a low return can also lower its equilibrium return. Earlier work finds that the mode of business investment varies across firms and over the cycle; in particular, young firms contribute a larger fraction of investment when stock prices are high. Gompers et al. (2008) find that VC investment is positively related to Q. Jovanovic and Rousseau (2014) show that a rise in aggregate Tobin’s Q leads incumbents to reduce investment, thereby creating opportunities for investments by new firms. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces our model. Section 3 characterizes the equilibrium and provides analytical examples. Section 4 discusses the plausibility of the model by first providing some empirical evidence, and then provides estimates from baseline calibrations of the model. Section 5 examines robustness of our findings to alternate modeling assumptions. Section 6 concludes. All data sources, estimation methods, and derivations are in the “Appendix”.",1
27,3,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-022-09206-4,The rural exodus and the rise of Europe,Thomas Baudin,Robert Stelter,,Male,Male,,Male,"Among historians and demographers, the rural exodus is reputed to have been one of the key forces behind the development and urbanization of European economies in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (Saville, 2013; van der Woude et al., 1995). Surprisingly, to the best of our knowledge, economists have never deeply questioned this qualitative result. We fill that gap by estimating the contribution of the rural exodus to the rise of European economies. To do so, we build a unified model of growth and internal migration and estimate its deep parameters. Using an original dataset on Sweden, we show that the conditions for migration between the countryside and cities have strongly shaped the timing and intensity of the transition to growth. Among these conditions, we highlight migration costs, mortality differentials between areas and the initial productivity of rural industries. We obtain two main results. First, shocks that increase migration costs generate larger delays in the take-off to growth than do mortality crises equivalent to a bubonic plague or influenza pandemic. Second, the negative effects of high internal migration costs are significantly attenuated by higher initial levels of productivity in rural industries. The more productive the latter were, the less economies needed to rely on the rural exodus and urbanization to start industrializing. We first collect data on Sweden from 1760 to 1960. From this data collection, we identify a series of facts in three domains: demographics, economics and education. First, compared to the countryside, cities were experiencing higher child and infant mortality rates as well as lower fertility rates. While the mortality differential vanished smoothly during the process of industrialization, fertility differentials were more persistent and started to vanish only in approximately 1870. Urbanization, which we define as an increase in the proportion of people living in cities, started to progress after 1850.Footnote 1 Second, if average GDP per capita also started to grow only around 1850, the growth rates of total production became higher in industries than in agriculture as early as 1820. At that date, a clear break in industrial growth can be detected. Nevertheless, total industrial production first exceeded total agricultural production around 1900. Importantly, industrialization occurred in two phases: until the turn of the twentieth century, rural industries triggered this process, while after 1900, urban industries became its epicenter. Cities progressively became the leading economic areas. Industrialization was accompanied by a continuous decrease in the price of industrial goods relative to the price of agricultural goods. Third, an educational revolution took place after 1850, causing the enrollment rate in primary education to explode until 1960. Our database is the first to demonstrate these facts in a unique setting. To the best of our knowledge, Sweden is—along with Denmark—the only country that offers reliable information for consistently computing fertility and mortality in cities and the countryside before the Industrial Revolution. We focus on Sweden, as data are available over a longer timespan; see Baudin and Stelter (2021) for additional information about Denmark. Our data highlight a key historical fact: both urbanization and educational improvements seem to have resulted from the pre-existing differences in economic growth rates between industry and agriculture. The theory we develop is in line with this empirical finding. To demonstrate how the conditions governing the rural exodus have influenced the economic take-off of Sweden, we estimate the deep parameters of an overlapping-generations model that explicitly distinguishes between cities and the countryside. We assume that agricultural production takes place exclusively in rural areas, while industrial production may occur in both cities and the countryside. What distinguishes these two types of industrial production is the technology they employ: urban industries are the only industries that produce with human capital. Each adult is endowed with a certain level of human capital and an intrinsic ability to work in the rural sectors.Footnote 2 There is perfect mobility of labor between the two rural sectors. Individuals can decide to stay in their area of birth or to pay a cost to move to the other area. However, they can choose their place of residence only once, at the beginning of adulthood. Return migration is excluded, and mortality is area specific. Once individuals have settled down, they decide on the number of children to have, the educational level they want their surviving children to achieve, and the levels of agricultural and industrial goods they consume. In the early stages of our economy, the society is trapped in a Malthusian regime.Footnote 3 It endogenously starts to experience global technological progress once the overall workforce has reached a certain threshold. As a result, an increasing number of parents become willing and able to educate their children, attracting such people to urban areas and magnifying the growth in productivity in urban industries. This is the key role our model gives to the rural exodus: as natural movements of the population cannot sustain urbanization, generations of rural workers have to migrate to urban areas to fuel the virtuous circle of urbanization and human capital-based industrialization. If they do not, the second phase of industrialization, based in urban areas, may not be sustainable, clearly and permanently reducing development prospects. What factors might prevent or weaken the rural exodus? One potential factor is the mortality penalty in cities. Mortality peaks in cities could significantly lower the incentives to settle in urban areas. The economic cost of the exodus to cities may also be crucial. When migration costs are high, the prevailing technological progress may not allow for development simply because the economic opportunities offered by cities are not good enough to attract rural workers to urban areas. Finally, living in a prosperous rural economy may reduce the incentive to move to cities. Thus, the more productive rural industries are initially, the less intense the rural exodus is likely to be.Footnote 4 These are the three main mechanisms that may prevent the rural exodus from fueling human capital-based industrialization in our setup, and these are the three main mechanisms we quantify in this paper. We calibrate the parameters of our model to match the fertility rates in cities and the countryside as well as urbanization rates and the share of rural workers involved in industry in Sweden between 1760 and 1960. Our model reproduces the main characteristics of these time series very well. We do not try to replicate the dynamics of other economic moments, such as shifts in GDP per capita, changes in overall education, or changes in the relative prices of industrial goods. However, our overidentification checks indicate that our model replicates these dynamics convincingly.Footnote 5 Such a result guarantees that our estimation strategy delivers reliable results and allows us to proceed to an evaluation of the importance of the conditions that governed the exodus out of the countryside. In our first experiment, we focus on the importance of productivity in rural industries during the eve of the Industrial Revolution. The first phase of European industrialization is marked by the importance of these industries in the countryside, be they cottage industries or larger industries.Footnote 6 This seems especially true for Sweden, as discussed by Schön (2010). We simulate our economy under alternative initial productivities in 1760s’ rural industry. When these industries are initially very productive, they are better able to sustain the first phase of industrialization and cause rural areas to be relatively richer. Nevertheless, they also make urban places poorer, as urban areas suffer from decreases in the relative price of industrial goods. Perhaps more surprisingly, higher initial productivity in rural industries also impoverishes the entire country in the long run. Indeed, the initial distortion in local incomes translates into depressed fertility rates in both urban and rural places, delaying the onset of technological progress. As a result, the higher the initial productivity in rural industries is, the lower the growth rates of GDP per capita are over the period 1820–1900 and the more time the economy needs to reach its long-run growth path. Our second experiment evaluates the effects of migration costs on the economic and demographic revolutions in Sweden. Alone, high migration costs, even infinite ones, would not have prevented the occurrence of the first (rural) phase of industrialization, and they would not have prevented the fertility transition from setting in. Nevertheless, they would have had detrimental effects in the long run, as the second phase of the Industrial Revolution would have been strongly affected. In our benchmark estimation, by 1760, the cost of migration represented 28.4% of the average potential income of industrial workers. Multiplying this cost by five would have magnified fertility differentials between urban and rural places during the fertility transition. Furthermore, the urbanization process would have been severely delayed, as by 1900, urbanization rates would not have exceeded their reference level in 1760. These two movements would have contributed to the reinforcement of the demographic pressure on rural areas, maintaining their populations at low levels of productivity and thus depressing their incomes. As a result, the higher the internal migration costs are, the stronger the economic inequalities between the two areas. In a complementary analysis, we show that the detrimental effects of high migration costs are magnified when the initial productivity of rural industries is reduced. We show, for instance, that if their initial productivity had been divided by 10, rural industries would not have been able to sustain the first phase of industrialization, giving a much more crucial role to urban industries. Thus, in a scenario in which internal migration and urbanization are impossible (infinite migration costs), Sweden’s development would have been totally different: no fertility transition would have occurred in rural areas by 1960, the rural population would have exploded at the price of severe pauperization, and rural-urban income inequalities would have climaxed. Our experiments therefore suggest that more than the initial productivity level of rural industries or migration costs alone, what truly mattered for the transition to modern economic growth was the interplay between these two elements. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate and quantify such a result. Our last experiment relates to mortality crises. We simulate the dynamics of our economy in a case in which infant mortality rates (IMRs), rather than decreasing, were frozen between 1760 and 1960. Such stagnation would have left the economic dynamics almost unchanged, while compared to those in the benchmark scenario, the number of births in this scenario is greatly increased and the number of surviving offspring is decreased. Equivalent results are found when simulating a mortality shock equivalent to the bubonic plague for the year 1800. This rather weak effect of mortality variations is in line with the results of Galor (2005) and Doepke (2004)Footnote 7 and contradicts traditional demographic theories positing that the mortality decline was the main driver of the fertility decline and the associated economic take-off. The model we propose contributes to the unified growth theory (hereafter, UGT) initiated by Galor and Weil (2000) and Galor and Moav (2002). UGT provides a consistent framework for explaining how the economies of Western Europe moved from Malthusian stagnation to modern growth and how this economic take-off is related to the demographic transition. Recent literature has suggested that certain conditions must be met for the general mechanisms of the UGT to operate. For instance, Squicciarini and Voigtländer (2015) show that rising total factor productivity is not necessarily sufficient to induce human capital accumulation and an economic take-off. They highlight the role played by upper-tail human capital and scientific knowledge.Footnote 8 We complement this literature by emphasizing how the rural exodus had to be affordable for industrialization—at least its second phase—to occur. Together with Adams (2022) and Greenwood and Seshadri (2002), we are among the few economists to investigate the role of urban-rural differential demography in the process of economic development. With English data, Adams (2022) calibrates the parameters of a growth model in which rural-urban differences are key.Footnote 9 He then predicts that a country will grow less rapidly if it has a higher initial urbanization rate, a prediction validated through cross-sectional data. Greenwood and Seshadri (2002) focus on the rural-urban fertility differential in the US. They find that technological progress was essential for the reduction in fertility in rural and urban sectors, and we complement their approach by studying the precise effects of the rural exodus on the emergence of technological progress and growth from both a theoretical and a quantitative perspective. Finally, our paper is also in line with Brunt and García-Peñalosa (2021), who provide evidence that urbanization caused technological progress throughout the Industrial Revolution, one of our core mechanisms. Our paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the empirical regularities characterizing the Swedish economic take-off from the eighteenth to the twentieth century. Section 3 proposes our unified model of growth and migration, while Sect. 4 estimates the deep parameters of this model. We investigate the effects of shocks to productivities in rural industries, to migration costs and to mortality rates in Sect. 5. Importantly, in Sect. 6, we show both how the facts we have highlighted for Sweden are representative of most Western European countries and how our results can be generalized to these countries. Section 7 concludes.",1
27,3,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-022-09204-6,How does scientific progress affect cultural changes? A digital text analysis,Michela Giorcelli,Nicola Lacetera,Astrid Marinoni,Female,Female,Female,Female,"“Economic change in all periods depends, more than most economists think, on what people believe.” (Joel Mokyr, The Enlightened Economy) “Every historical act can only be performed by the ‘collective man’, and this presupposes the attainment of a ‘cultural-social’ unity […], on the basis of an equal and common conception of the world.” (Antonio Gramsci, The Prison Notebooks) As the scholarly quest for the determinants of economic growth shifted attention away from factors such as labor, land and capital, a large literature identified scientific and technological progress as a key driver of development and prosperity (Bush, 1945, Jones 2002, Pakes & Sokoloff, 1996, Romer, 1990, Stephan, 2012). In the last few decades, scholars also pointed to the role of culture, i.e., the set shared beliefs, values, goals and traditions that a population holds and transmits over time, as a further determinant of the institutional choices and economic trajectories of a community (Alesina & Giuliano, 2015, Galor, 2011, Guiso et al., 2006, Landes, 1999, McCloskey, 2016, Mokyr, 2016, Spolaore 2014, 2020, Williamson, 2000) We know little, however, about the relationship between science and culture. If they do not only develop independently but also interact with each other, this relationship may represent a further variable of interest to understand economic change. Mokyr (2013, 2016), for example, advanced the idea that certain scientists introduce new sets of beliefs in a population with their discoveries.Footnote 1 The impact of these individuals, therefore, affects not only the production and diffusion of scientific knowledge, but also changes how people, more broadly, interpret the world around them.Footnote 2 Mokyr calls these scientists “cultural entrepreneurs”. In this paper, we propose an approach to test empirically the impact of scientific progress on the broader culture, and we apply our methodology to one of the major advancements in the history of science: Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection. Assessing how scientific progress affects cultural change presents several empirical challenges. First, one would need a long time horizon to analyze the interplay between public discourse and scientific progress. Second, unobserved factors and events (especially over extended periods) make inferring causal links difficult. A further complication is how to define and measure, in the first place, culture and cultural change. Most of the existing literature in the economics of culture relies on survey-based measure of specific attitudes, such as trust, cooperation, or “civicness”, or on activities whose intensity plausibly correlates with some of those attitudes.Footnote 3 To our knowledge, there have not been attempts to define measures of culture related to new scientific ideas and discoveries. Moreover, most existing measures concern recent times and represent beliefs in a given moment.Footnote 4 To conceptualize and measure culture and cultural change over a long (historical) period, and to identify the inclusion of certain scientific ideas into the broader public discourse, we adopt a different approach. We rely on concepts, sources and tools from such fields of research as the humanities, sociology and ethnography. The underlying claim of these approaches is that language embodies values and beliefs, and is a major channel of communication and transmission of them over time (Hamilton et al 2016; Kirby et al., 2007; Lévi-Strauss 1963; Nguyen et al., 2020; Whorf 1956). Changes in use of certain words and phrases, as well as in the meaning of a word, indicate changes in underlying beliefs and views of the world in ways that can be transmitted and further change (in a measurable way). We study the evolution of certain phrases and expressions by performing digital text analysis on a large text corpus between 1820 and 1899. Written text, of course, represents only a part language-based communications, together with oral exchanges (Michalopoulos & Xue, 2021). There are, moreover, relevant forms of non-verbal behaviors and communications as well. In addition to being, in general, easier to record and measure the written word, the growth of the printing industry and the increase in literacy rates especially since the 19th Century, and the role not only of academic and other non-fiction texts, but also of the fictional literature especially through the diffusion of the novel (Lyons, 2003), makes the written language a major repository (and means of transmission) of broader values and beliefs. In fact, a relevant claim in the digital humanities and cultural linguistics literature is that digital text analysis or “distant reading” allows for the consideration of the “great unread”, i.e., the large quantity of texts that normally scholars do not study, but that, as a whole, represent the broader social and cultural climate and discourse at a given time (Cohen, 1999). Although there is a general perception that the theory of evolution had broader influence, we know less about what concepts were particularly influential, how their influence evolved and entered the public discourse, and how long it took these ideas to diffuse beyond a narrow scientific community. The information that we retrieve from various text sources makes progress in addressing these questions. The publication of On the Origin of Species, in 1859, made Darwin’s theory known to a vast public; moreover, the timing of the publication was largely unplanned. We rely on this event as our main source of natural variation. The main corpus on which we perform our text analysis is Google Books, a digitized collection of about eight million volumes. We define the publication year of On the Origin of Species as our reference date and concentrate the analysis on the four decades before and after it (1820–1899). We consider words and expressions that, according to many accounts, embody the key concepts of Darwin’s theory (Desmond & Moore, 1994; Mayr, 1982): Evolution, Survival, Competition, (Natural) Selection, and Adaptation. We compare the evolution of the frequency of use of these Darwinian words with a large number of words not related directly to Darwin’s theory but extensively used in On the Origin of Species. We then complement the frequency analysis on the Google Books corpus with evidence from UK Parliamentary Transcripts and US Congressional Records. With these additional corpora, we explore how certain concepts diffused not only in the cultural discourse, but also in the political arena, thus potentially shaping the policy debate. In addition to frequency of use, we assess semantic changes and the evolution of attitudes toward Darwinian concepts as additional measures of cultural change, applying word-embedding techniques.Footnote 5 We show, first, that some key concepts in Darwin’s theory increased their diffusion in the broader cultural discourse in the years immediately following the publication of On the Origin of Species: Natural Selection, Evolution, Survival and Competition. The patterns of diffusion of these words and expressions were similar in the non-fiction and fiction literature; this indicates that the underlying concepts had a broad impact on culture as well as on the social imaginary as represented, for example, by short stories and novels. Other concepts such as Selection and Adaptation did not experience a change in the rate of diffusion. We also document that some of the key Darwinian ideas entered the policy debate after 1859 but with some delay with respect to the entry of these concepts in the broader public discourse. The effects of On the Origin of the Species, moreover, were not specific to the English-speaking world; the Darwinian concepts diffused in non-English speaking countries right after the translation of the book in the corresponding language. Moreover, the translation occurred earlier in countries that industrialized earlier, such as Germany and France, than in “late comers” such as Italy and Spain. The second set of results concerns changes in the semantics of these words as well as in the types of reactions, or sentiments, that they generated over time. Of interest is, for example, the increase in semantic association between certain words, such as Competition and Life, as well as between Life and Adaptation. The term Evolution, which came mostly from chemistry and physics in the first half of the 1800s, later in the century related more to concepts from biology as well as social and human subjects, indicating a broader reach of this idea in society. We also document an increased similarity between Evolution and words related to the traditional view of the Christian doctrine about the origins of the world, such as Creation and Genesis; this suggests a process of “secularization” of these ideas. Furthermore, Selection became more similar in meaning to other “Darwinian” words, such as Survival, Variation, Fittest and Heredity. Sentiment analysis shows a more positive attitude toward certain Darwinian concepts after the publication of On the Origin of Species, in particular Evolution, and a positive attitude toward Darwin himself. Finally, we show that the word “Darwin” diffused more literature than the names of other major scholars in the same area (Lamarck, Chambers and Wallace), and that the semantic association of the focal concepts that we consider was higher with the name “Darwin” than with the other names. This suggests that these ideas were particularly associated, in the public discourse, with Darwin’s work and not just generically with the progress in the biological sciences of the time or ideas that were “in the air”. The relationship between scientific discoveries and the public discourse may also contribute to understanding deeper social and political processes, such as the extent to which, to cite Alexander Hamilton’s reflections in the Federalist Papers, a society is based on a “culture of reason and evidence”. If a culture that values scientific inquiry is more likely to promote economic development, and scientific breakthroughs contribute to the evolution of culture in this direction, then studying this relationship acquires additional value. We see our approach as a fruitful one to investigate also the impact of other scientific breakthroughs in history. In Sect. 2, we provide a brief account of Darwin’s elaboration of the theory of evolution by natural selection. We also explain why the publication of On the Origin of Species provides natural variation that allows studying the effect of Darwin’s theory on the broader public discourse. In Sect. 3, we describe the text-based data that we use and the techniques and empirical strategies that we adopt to extract information about cultural change. Section 4 reports the findings. In Sect. 5, we provide a discussion and propose directions for future research.",1

Prarolo,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The medieval republics, the self-governed city states that emerged in Italy after AD 1000, are considered precursors of modern states in view of their early dismissal of the feudal apparatus and their innovative systems of public finance and economic regulations (e.g. Waley, 1969; Hohenberg & Lees, 1995; Epstein, 1999). Scholars have largely associated the distinctly different development paths in Italy to the presence of the republics in the North and the autocratic-feudal historical institutions in the South (e.g. Putnam et al., 1994). This paper takes a different perspective and studies the, hitherto largely neglected, comparative political economy of the territories historically ruled by these self-governed polities. We focus, in particular, on the origin and persistence of the very different socio-economic regulations implemented by the elites of the so-called “communal” and “maritime” republics. Our empirical analysis connects a variety of present-day socio-economic outcomes across spatially disaggregated northern Italian localities to the intensity and stability of exposure to the different types of republican “treatments” in these localities in pre-industrial times. We advance a structural narrative, guided by a simple conceptual framework and supported by the historical evidence. Specifically, in the communal republics, small territorial size and the almost exclusive reliance on internal tax revenues from production and local trade meant that the elites in these polities had incentives to supply public goods and grant more personal and economic freedoms in order to elicit higher internal fiscal compliance from the population. In contrast, the larger territorial size of the maritime republics, coupled with the ability of the ruling merchants to extract rents from long-distance sea trade with their colonies abroad, implied a limited need to induce internal fiscal compliance, resulting in an opposite set of incentive-compatible strategies for these elites. The maritime polities were consequently characterized by more exclusive institutions, limited provision of public services, and personal and economic subjugation of vast segments of the population. The republics also differed in their expansion approaches: communal polities mostly aimed to stabilize territorial control and their fiscal base by also applying their inclusive regulations to the annexed territories, while the maritime polities engaged in more expansive and extractive colonial strategies. The high level of political fragmentation and intense territorial competition between historical polities (see, Jones, 1981; Mokyr, 1992, 2016; Fukuyama, 2011) meant that, until the emergence of modern states in Europe, patterns of territorial control in pre-industrial times were fluid and often involved changes in borders (e.g. Strayer, 1970; Tilly, 1990). An important contribution of our study is the extraction and digitization of the complete political geography of Italy at yearly frequency during the AD 1000-1800 time period, including information on the origin, territorial dynamics, location of capitals, and disappearance of each independent political entity that existed within this 800-year period. We use this information on the changing spatial distribution of borders and on distance to the centers of power to build highly spatially disaggregated data on the political history of each locality (as measured by 5 \(\times\) 5 arcminute grid cells). This spatial disaggregation also allows to distinguish between the locations where a given polity came into being (i.e., the “seeds” of a republic), and the locations that were subsequently “annexed” to its territory. We measure the intensity of exposure to the rule of different polities and isolate the empirical implications of being forcefully controlled by either type of republic (communal or maritime), as well as the effect of historical instability in political rule in each location. Our conceptual framework interprets the emergence of historical institutions with different degrees of inclusiveness as multiple “social contracts.” By this, we intend equilibria in which individual attitudes in the population and policies implemented by the ruling elites are mutually consistent and persist over time. Inclusive equilibria arise when the provision of productive regulation and fiscal compliance sustain each other, while in extractive equilibria, exploitation is coupled with fiscal avoidance. In line with this perspective, we study the legacy of local political history for public policies and attitudes today. The regression analysis is performed at the level of, the around 5000, municipalities in the North of the country, whose territories were all exposed to the rule of the medieval republics. Measuring local social contracts today, in terms of attitudes towards fiscal compliance and public good provision, at such disaggregated level is far from straightforward. We exploit municipal data on the share of households complying with the payment of a small (flat and not enforced) national television-radio tax that, we argue, represents the best available proxy for attitudes towards fiscal compliance at the local level. Data on the public provision of goods and services are extracted from municipal budgets. Finally, we collect information on the universe of surnames in each municipality and build measures of population diversity to explore the role of the differential attractiveness of the republican social contracts and historical migration. In line with the structural origins and persistence of the divergent institutional configurations, our empirical findings show that variation in the intensity and stability of exposure of contemporary localities to different types of historical republican “treatments” still affects local social contracts today. A longer period of exposure to the rule of communal republics increases fiscal compliance and productive governance both in “seeds” and in annexed locations, while the opposite is true for the length of exposure to maritime rule, although this negative effect is detected only in annexed locations. Changes in the identity of rulers in a location can, according to the conceptual framework, impact policies and harm fiscal compliance, representing a main threat for the persistence of inclusive social contracts. In line with this view, we document that higher historical political instability has a robust negative effect on both fiscal compliance and the provision of public goods today. The results also carry over to the latent inclusivity of socio-economic institutions, as reflected by surname diversity. Our findings are robust to an extensive set of controls and checks, including a careful treatment of spatial auto-correlation. They are further confirmed with an IV strategy that exploits exogenous variation in exposure to the different polities due to the latent territorial competition and distance to the changing networks of republican centers of power. We next discuss a set of further results emerging from our analysis in light of the relevant literature. Literature Our new database on local political history, the main empirical findings on the impact on today’s social contracts, and the additional results discussed below contribute novel insights to several recent strands of the literature on the deep determinants of political and economic development. Relatively little is known about the historical emergence of different social contracts (that is, configurations sustained by different attitudes and policies, and the mechanisms of their persistence) and empirical evidence is scant (see Bowles, 2020; Bisin, 2020 for discussions). Our conceptualization is based on three elements that to date have not simultaneously been considered, but which we argue are necessary to understand the historical social contracts in the medieval republics. First, the process of state formation was under the control of (oligarchic) elites. As in Lizzeri and Persico (2004), Galor and Moav (2006) and Ashraf et al. (2020), discerning the economic interests of local elites is key to comprehending public policies and the inclusiveness of implemented institutions. Second, in pre-industrial times both extractive capacity and the provision of public services sharply declined with distance from centers of power (see, e.g., Cervellati et al., 2019), with important implications for the role of polity size in shaping the interests of the elites and for their strategies of territorial control.Footnote 1 Third, public policies and behavior within the population should be interpreted as jointly determined in the long run (as in, e.g., Benabou & Tirole, 2006; Tabellini, 2008; Bisin & Verdier, 2000; Besley, 2020). This study furthermore contributes to the literature linking geography and history to diverging paths over the long term (see Ashraf & Galor, 2018; Michalopoulos & Papaioannou, 2020; Nunn, 2009 and 2020 for discussions). Historical evidence, discussed in Sect. 2, supports our structural narrative on the origin of multiple republican “treatments” and differences in observed inclusiveness. Historically, the emergence of the rule of law has been connected to the rise of merchant classes and the associated curbing of the extractive power of the landed (feudal) nobility (e.g., De Long & Shleifer, 1993; Acemoglu et al., 2005) and through the practice of more effective private-order bilateral contract enforcement (see, e.g., Greif, 1993). Our narrative qualifies these canonical arguments. As we discuss below, compared to the inter-city trade typical of the urban belt, long-distance sea trade in the maritime republics implied a more centralized control of returns in the hands of a minority of economically and politically powerful (vessel-owner) families (see also de Lara et al., 2008). This, and the extensive rents accruing from the colonies, favored the emergence of more extractive state capacity. Thus, both geography, i.e., more or less easy access to the sea, and historical contingencies, i.e., related to the ability of communal rulers to offer productive services and to the uncertain fortunes of long-distance trade and military expeditions, shaped the interests of local elites and the emerging social contracts.Footnote 2 Studies of historical republicanism have thus far relied on information on free cities or city charters (see Stasavage (2010, 2014); Bosker et al. (2013); Guiso et al. (2016); Belloc et al. (2016); Angelucci et al. (2020); Serafinelli and Tabellini (2022), among others). We offer a measurement of local exposure to these multiple republican treatments across the different locations in terms of intensity and stability at a high level of spatial disaggregation, which, following the conceptualization, also tracks the patterns and stability of forceful territorial annexation. Our results provide robust evidence of systematic differences in local policies, individual attitudes, and population diversity. The findings support, at the municipal level, the evidence advanced by Tabellini (2010), namely that regional differences in culture and policies persist within the same formal national institutions. In terms of mechanisms of historical persistence, in our conceptualization changes in the identity of rulers represent the main threat for the endurance of productive social contracts. In line with this perspective, we document that the number of polities ruling over a locality has a robust negative effect on the inclusiveness of current social contracts in terms of public good provision, individual compliance, and population diversity.Footnote 3 Our analysis also qualifies existing arguments on the role of formal political institutions. Differently from interpretations of institutions as rules or commitment devices (e.g., North, 1990; Acemoglu & Robinson, 2000), in our conceptual framework constraints on the executives are not necessary to sustain productive equilibria since, given a complying population, offering productive governance and limiting wasteful rent extraction can also be in the best interests of unconstrained ruling elites. In this perspective, though formal institutions are neither necessary nor sufficient for the emergence and persistence of productive equilibria (see also Greif & Laitin, 2004), constraints on the executive may help align expectations and favor equilibrium selection serving as a coordination device. In fact, as also discussed in Sect. 2, inclusive regulations have often persisted with the advent of lordships well after the end of republican experiences. To explore the possible role of early constraints on the executive in the selection of social contracts, we collect data on the identity of all historical chief administrators of each republic (e.g., “podestà,” “signori,” and “dogi”) and show that a higher administrative turnover in the early phases of emergence of the communal republics positively affects their duration.Footnote 4 Finally, our results intersect with investigations of the imprint of historical contingencies and geography on individual traits and population diversity. Existing evidence documents the historical drivers of trust (Nunn & Wantchekon, 2011), time preferences (Galor & Özak, 2016), loss aversion (Galor & Savitskiy, 2018), individualism (Bazzi et al., 2020), and familistic moral values (Enke, 2019), among others. We contribute to this stream of literature by showing that local political history impacts individual attitudes of fiscal compliance and also has significant, although heterogeneous, effects on measures of social capital and social cooperation.Footnote 5 Recent studies have explored population diversity on a global scale by isolating the role of long-run migrations out of Africa and genetic diversity (Ashraf & Galor, 2013; Ashraf et al., 2019a; b), the cross-country process of nation-state formation (Ahlerup & Olsson, 2012), and the long-term exposure to diseases on African etnicities (Cervellati et al., 2018). We provide evidence on the role of local productive or extractive institutions for the latent process of selected migration across densely populated historical localities. Our findings also suggest that the composition of the population, in terms of surname diversity, indirectly played a role in sustaining the different social contracts.Footnote 6 The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the predictions of the conceptual framework (a simple theoretical model is reported in the Appendix) and the historical evidence. Section 3 presents the data and the main patterns of the territorial emergence and historical evolution of the republics, as well as the measurement of local social contracts today. Section 4 provides the main empirical results, Sect. 5 details different robustness checks and further results, and Sect. 6 concludes.",1

Carillo,,,Male,,,Male,"Nationalism, racial resentment, xenophobia, and preferences for strong leaders are widespread. In the U.S., for instance, more than 30% of respondents to the 2010 World Value Surveys say that “it would be “good” or “very good” to have a “strong leader” who doesn’t have to “bother with parliament and elections” (Foa & Mounk, 2016). Such views are anything but new. They resemble the Fascist ideologies of the 1920s and 1930s, and so should recall memories of the disastrous experiences of those regimes, loss of freedom, and war. The persistent popularity of a rhetoric echoing such a dark past is puzzling. The explanation may lie partly in the long-lasting impact of historical institutions on beliefs. But such an effect is ambiguous, ex ante. While institutions may complement beliefs (Alesina & Fuchs-Schundeln, 2007; Becker et al., 2016), they may also crowd out parental investment in transmitting those beliefs to their children (Lowes et al., 2017), so the effect of institutions on values is ambiguous. In this context, the empirical challenge in establishing the direction of causality compounds the difficulty of identifying the mechanisms by which historical institutions may affect beliefs. This paper examines these issues by investigating the relationship between infrastructure built by the Italian Fascist regime and political beliefs.Footnote 1 Authoritarian leaders often exploit infrastructure to expand their popular support.Footnote 2 I explore the case of Mussolini’s New Towns (Città di Fondazione)—a major infrastructural program running from 1922 until the early 1940s—and investigate whether it led to a more favorable view of Fascism and its ideology, possibly influencing the formation of political beliefs that persisted in the face of democratization and over the long run. Differences in the exposure to the infrastructures provide the ideal variation for empirical identification of a novel mechanism whereby historical institutions may have an enduring influence on political beliefs, which may persist via cultural transmission, in turn, casting new light on the persistent popularity of extremist, anti-democratic ideologies. In line with the hypothesis, I find (1) that the foundation of the New Towns enhanced local electoral support for the Fascist Party at the onset of the regime; (2) that this effect persisted through democratization, favoring the emergence and persistence of one of the largest neo-fascist parties in the West; and (3) that the Fascist New Towns explain differences in current political and cultural attitudes that can be traced back to the Fascist ideology, including preferences for a strong leader, nationalism, and racial resentment. When the Fascist Party came to power, a substantial part of the country consisted in swampland. An extensive program of land reclamation was instrumental for Mussolini to show the economic and technological competence of the regime. As the Party advertised, draining the swamps was an achievement of the Fascist government that neither the Roman Empire nor the Papal State had been capable of. Reclamation entailed massive infrastructural investment that was unprecedented in the history of the country, including dewatering plants, canals, bridges, roads, and buildings. These infrastructures formed the New Towns. The towns of Littoria, whose name was rendered into English as “Fascistville” (Snowden, 2008), and Mussolinia are two of the 147 New Towns built by the regime in Fascist Italy. The foundation of modern cities constructed on former swampland was a key motif of Fascist propaganda and resonated internationally (Ghirardo, 1989; Kargon & Molella, 2008). After the end of the dictatorship, despite legal restrictions and social stigma against fascist principles, the political landscape saw the emergence of the Italian Social Movement (Movimento Sociale Italiano, MSI), a political party advocating ideological positions directly rooted in the Fascist regime. This neo-fascist party, while a political pariah and never in government, enjoyed steady electoral support of around 5%. Its ideological roots and its limited influence on policy offer a unique opportunity to investigate the ideological legacy of Italian Fascism. In the cities founded by the regime, the fairly substantial electoral support for the MSI is associated with neo-fascist rallies, which are the norm rather than the exception.Footnote 3 The empirical analysis uses a rich dataset at the level of Italian municipalities and at the individual level. Novel data on the location of the Fascist New Towns augmented with information digitized from primary sources on the historical map of the largest catchment area of the New Towns, as well as on the historical presence of malarial swamps—a key determinant of their location. These data are combined with a rich set of socioeconomic data from several censuses and detailed geographic information. Support for the Fascists is measured by three sets of data. First, I use voting data to measure the electoral support for the Fascists in the two elections that took place before the institution of the dictatorship, in 1921 (the year before the initiation of the New Towns project) and 1924. Second, I investigate the footprint of the New Towns on voting choices after the demise of the dictatorship, gauged by the electoral support for the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement (MSI) in the eleven elections from the party’s formation in 1948 to its dissolution in 1992. Third, I use contemporary individual surveys on political and cultural values from the Italian National Election Studies (ITANES), which ask about respondents’ preferences for a stronger leader, their attitudes towards immigrants, electoral choices of the respondents and their parents, as well as other measures of preferences for fascism, nationalism, and racial resentment. In line with the hypothesis, I document that areas near the Fascist New Towns exhibited larger increase in the electoral support for the Fascist Party between the elections of 1921 and 1924. The estimated coefficient is large. A 1-standard-deviation increase in proximity to the New Towns is associated with an increase in the Fascist vote of 10% of the average share in 1924. Next I investigate the persistent effect of the intervention, finding that areas near the Fascist New Towns exhibited significantly more electoral support for the neo-fascist party several decades after the demise of Fascism itself. For example, in the elections of 1992 a 1-standard-deviation increase in proximity to the New Towns was associated with an increase in neo-fascist electoral support of 20% of the party’s average share of the vote. The Fascists may have chosen the location of the New Towns on the basis of preexisting popular support. This would be a concern if they had targeted places already exhibiting strong support. However, the election data for 1921, the year before the initiation of the New Towns project, indicate that the relevant areas were less supportive of the Fascists, which suggests that the estimated effect is a lower bound of the parameter of interest. The New Towns were built in former swamplands, so their location may have had an independent effect on political views. The dates of foundation show that the support for the Fascist Party increased only in the municipalities near the New Towns constructed just before the 1924 elections, and not in those near the towns founded just afterward, which suggests that absent the new towns Fascist electoral support would not have increased in those areas. Furthermore, if characteristics explaining the locations chosen had influenced political preferences, then the areas where towns were planned but not built should also exhibit greater support for the Fascists. Reassuringly, however, this is not the case: those places did not show greater support for the Fascist or neo-fascist party, thus further mitigating identification concerns. Results are robust to a large set of controls including measures of elevation, suitability for wheat and agriculture, prevalence of (or suitability for) malaria, distance to water, macro-region fixed effects, pre-policy population level and market access, distance to large cities, local political pre-conditions, and WWII-related events. Results are also robust to the exclusion of traditionally right-wing regions, corrections for spatial correlation, and a host of other checks. Finally, I exploit the fact that a subset of the New Towns was built within a large catchment area (comprensorio di bonifica). I take advantage of the discrete nature of the border of the catchment area and find a discrete increase in support for the neo-fascist party precisely at the border cutoff: specifically, up to 4 percentage points more support in municipalities just inside than in those just outside the area. This is quite a sizable effect, given the party’s national average vote of 5%. The spatial Regression Discontinuity identification assumption requires that there be no other relevant factors exhibiting a discrete change at the border. Robustness tests and placebo checks support this assumption. Different factors may explain the effect of the Fascist infrastructures on voting outcomes long after the demise of the dictatorship. Even though during the Fascist period migration was severely restricted, politically motivated migration would be an explanation if the settlers of the New Towns were already in favor of the fascists. Fascistville (Littoria) and 20 more New Towns were built in the Agro Pontino area, which was the emblem of the reclamation project and by far the place that received the greatest number of settlers. This area provides the ideal setting to investigate settlers’ preexisting political ideology. A major difficulty is to measure extremist ideology in the past. I tackle this issue by developing a novel names-based measure of nationalistic (proto-fascist) views. The myths of the nation, war interventionism, and colonial expansion were key ideological principles of the Fascist rhetoric. Individuals with those values were more likely to develop positive attitudes towards Fascism. I explore the prevalence of patriotic, pro-war, and pro-colonization first names as an indicator of parental transmission of nationalistic views. I then use two novel databases of individuals located in the Agro Pontino in the 1930–40s. One covers the family heads’ names of all of the 3300 families who settled in the area over the Fascist period. Another covers 4000 police records, which provide the names of the suspected dissenters of the Regime (non-fascists) and its supporters (fascists).Footnote 4 I find that the prevalence of nationalistic names is twice as high for the fascists than for the non-fascists, in turn validating my names-based measure. I then find that the settlers (1) turn out to be less likely than the fascists to have nationalistic names; and (2) exhibited no difference in the prevalence of nationalistic names with respect to non-fascists. These findings indicate that the settlers were not already in favor of Fascism. Overall, these and other results do not point to migration as the main explanation.Footnote 5 An influential body of works examines the effect of institutions on political values.Footnote 6 Besley and Persson (2019a) show that autocratic institutions can influence the popular prevalence of political values that are then transmitted across generations. While persuasion has been shown to have important effects on beliefs also in democratic contexts (DellaVigna & Gentzkow, 2010; Guriev & Treisman, 2019) emphasize that authoritarian leaders take actions designed to show competence and enhance popular support. A view that finds empirical support in the context of the highway construction in Nazi Germany (Voigtlaender & Voth, 2014). I build upon this literature and advance the hypothesis that the Fascist New Towns influenced citizens’ opinion of the economic competence of the Fascists, fostering partisan identification and shifting beliefs towards Fascism (Ortoleva & Snowberg, 2015), which persisted across generations, despite democratization, via cultural transmission.Footnote 7 In line with this hypothesis, I find that the long-lasting legacy of the New Towns is greater in places where market access increased during Fascism (but not before), which citizens possibly linked to the new infrastructures. And is greater when the New Towns had larger infrastructural investments. In addition, estimates are larger in places where WWII Allies’ bombing attacks damaged infrastructures (but not other targets), possibly improving citizens’ appraisal of the Fascist works. I find limited evidence of explanations related to agricultural specialization, New Towns population size, the strength of local Fascist institutions, propaganda, or Fascist associations in the towns. Taken together, these findings point to the perceived economic improvements that —even if not caused by the New Towns or the Dictatorship—were associated with the fascist infrastructures, enhancing people’s attitudes towards Fascism. I substantiate the effect on attitudes with survey data on political and cultural attitudes in recent times. Individuals near the New Towns built more than 70 years ago turn out to be more likely to be hostile to immigrants, to voice racial resentment, and to express preferences for fascists (but not other extremist parties or groups), for stronger leaders, and for nationalism —the central ideological pillars of the Fascist regime. The estimated link between New Towns and political attitudes is higher for individuals who actually lived under Fascism. And I find evidence that these political views were transmitted across generations from parents to children, in line with the vertical transmission cultural values (Bisin & Verdier, 2011). This research mainly contributes to three strands of the literature. First, by exploring a novel mechanism whereby autocratic regimes may affect political attitudes, it may reconcile divergent views on the connection between institutions and political preferences and beliefs. For instance, Shiller et al. (1992) find no systematic differences in individual attitudes in surveys of three former communist and three capitalist countries. This concurs with the potentially slow-moving nature of cultural attitudes compared to institutions, as discussed by Roland (2004). Alesina and Fuchs-Schundeln (2007), by contrast, show that the exposure to communism in East Germany did influence redistributive preferences. The present paper indicates the role of heterogeneous exposure to regimes’ interventions in explaining these contrasting findings. Furthermore, while some works emphasize complementarity between institutions and cultural traits (Becker et al., 2016), other emphasize crowding-out effects (Lowes et al., 2017). Such contrasting findings point to the need to identify these mechanisms empirically, which I investigate by exploring a public investment program exploited by an autocracy to influence political views. Thus, the paper casts new light on the interaction between institutions and culture (Tabellini, 2008; Belloc et al., 2016; Bisin & Verdier, 2017; Buonanno et al., 2019). Second, in exploring the link between infrastructures and political attitudes, this paper provides novel evidence on the long-term influence of historical events on attitudes.Footnote 8 While existing works have mainly studies traumatic episodes, including African slavery (Nunn & Wantchekon, 2011; Acharya et al., 2016), the Black Death (Voigtländer & Voth, 2012), natural disasters (Bentzen, 2019), and the WWII Nazi troops (Fouka & Voth, 2013; Fontana et al., 2016), the present work analyzes a non-traumatic historical episode,Footnote 9 which induced positive attitudes. Third, this paper is related to the political economy literature studying the interlink between public funds allocation and electoral support. Recently, Finan and Mazzocco (2021) explore how politicians interest in getting elected, along with their interest in the welfare of people from their state, affect the allocation of public funds and welfare in the context of Brazil. Glaeser and Ponzetto (2018) show that voter attention can shift democratic governments provision of public funds away from the socially optimal level. The present paper differs from this stream of works as it focuses on the electoral consequences of infrastructures rather than their determinants, in line with (Cinnirella & Schueler, 2017; Drazen & Eslava, 2010; Levitt & Snyder Jr, 1997; Manacorda et al., 2011; Huet-Vaughn, 2019; Caprettini et al., 2021). And adds a focus on the autocratic context, thus related to Voigtlaender and Voth (2014), who show that railways boosted Nazis popular support. Yet, differently from Germany, in Italy the Neo-fascist party was admitted to the polls after the collapse of the dictatorship. I explore this unique setting to study the link between infrastructures and the electoral support for the Neo-fascist party after the end of the Regime, thus emphasizing the persistent influence of the intervention across a major institutional transition via persistence in political attitudes—a key innovation with respect to the aforementioned literature. That also links this work to the literature on the persistent effects of authoritarian interventions on political beliefs, which hitherto mainly focused on indoctrination and repression (Voigtländer & Voth, 2015; Xue & Koyama, 2016). Thus the paper provides an explanation for the persistent popularity of extremist ideologies, and complement works that take them as given (e.g. Cantoni et al., 2019).Footnote 10",1
27,4,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-022-09207-3,Surname distance and technology diffusion: the case of the adoption of maize in late imperial China,Ying Bai,James Kai-sing Kung,,,Male,,Male,"Since Adam Smith’s time, the question of why income per capita is higher in some societies than in others has been fundamental to understanding the determinants of economic growth and development. More recently, increasing emphasis has been made on the transmission of traits across generations over the very long run as key determinants (Galor and Ozak, 2016; Spolaore & Wacziarg, 2009, 2013). Using genetic distance as a summary measure of relatedness between populations,Footnote 1 these authors demonstrate that uneven economic development caused by technological diffusion can essentially be understood as a consequence of the indirect “barrier effect” arising from the divergences in human traits, habits, norms etc., as these differences affect the communication, diffusion, and imitation of technologies and institutions effectively both across societies and over time.Footnote 2 Using surname distance as a measure of the potential differences in population characteristics (e.g., biological, cultural, institutional), our goal is to examine the impact of surname distance on the diffusion of technology in the historical context of China. Defined as the inverse log-term of the probability that two individuals, when selected at random from their respective populations, share the same surname (Nei, 1987), a greater surname distance implies lower relatedness between populations—the fundamental cause of larger differences in observed economic outcomes such as the adoption of new technologies.Footnote 3 Specifically, we examine the effect of surname distance on the adoption of maize—a major New World crop (as well as a new agricultural technology)—in late imperial China. We chose maize because, of the three New World crops (maize, potato, and sweet potato), it was the one most widely adopted in China (Chen and Kung, 2016). Moreover, the enormous variation in its rate of adoption across China over a period of more than two hundred years makes it an ideal choice for examining the hypothesized effect of surname distance on economic outcomes. Using the Chinese prefecture as the spatial unit of analysis,Footnote 4 we hypothesize that this New World crop would diffuse more effectively between prefectures whose populations shared a greater degree of relatedness in terms of biological, cultural, and institutional characteristics as measured by a shorter surname distance. Specifically, we construct the surname distance measure based on the surnames and geographic coordinates of so-called “notable figures”—typically poets, scholars, or officials—enumerated in Harvard’s China Biographical Database (hereafter CBDB). We do so by calculating the share of each surname in the 107 sample prefectures across the nine provinces in Song and Yuan China (960–1368), based on which we compute the surname distance between two prefectures for a total of 5671 pair of prefectures. As the CBDB enumerates only historically notable figures, we need to ensure that a selective sample like this one is both representative of the larger population and stable over time, so that the historical surname distribution would be highly correlated with today’s surname distribution. By calculating the current share of each surname at the prefecture level and surname distance between each pair of prefectures based on the 2005 population census, we find that the two measures are indeed highly correlated. To determine whether and how surname distance affected the diffusion of maize, we adopt two estimation strategies. First, we examine the effect of surname distance to the “technology frontier”—defined in our context as prefectures which had adopted maize in 1650 when it was first introduced to China. We find that prefectures with a greater surname distance to the frontier were indeed less likely to be early adopters of maize. This effect can arise through two possible channels. First, given that surname distance is highly correlated with both genetic distance and dialectical differences, there are good grounds to interpret this effect as an indirect barrier effect. Second, since the surname distance between prefecture pairs is also positively correlated with differences in cultural traits such as lineage organization and clan culture in the historical Chinese context, surname distance may thus also affect technology adoption directly. However, neither are we able, nor is it necessary to distinguish the two, hence we leave this question open.Footnote 5 Our second estimation strategy is to pair up the frontier prefectures, namely those which adopted maize in 1650, with those that did not, and examine the effect of surname distance between the prefectures in a pair on the probability of maize diffusion from the frontier to non-frontier prefectures over time. In a nutshell, we find that a one standard deviation increase in the surname distance between a pair of prefectures lowers the probability of technology diffusion by approximately 7.3 percent during the 50-year period of 1650–1700 and 7.0 percent during the 100-year period of 1650–1750. However, the effect dies down over longer periods, which suggests that, while surname distance does have a barrier effect on technology diffusion, this effect disappears over extended periods. To correct for potential estimation biases caused by measurement error and omitted variables associated with the measure of surname distance, we use the difference in the assimilation of various nomadic groups into the Han community forced by the Mongols as instrument. The Mongols attempted to uproot and assimilate these various nomadic groups with the Han Chinese to prevent them from regrouping militarily. Our identification strategy is thus premised on the rationale that, while some nomadic groups such as the Tangut became thoroughly assimilated with the Han, others—notably the Huihui—have retained their distinct identity to this day.Footnote 6 This acute difference in assimilation between the two ethnic groups thus provides us with an exogenous variation with which to identify the causal effect of forced resettlement on surname distance. Other things being constant, we expect the surname distance between prefecture pairs where the Tangut were present in both to be shorter than that between all other prefecture pairs. Our instrumented results find that surname distance does have a significant negative effect on the diffusion of maize during the shorter periods of 1650–1700 and 1650–1750. Our analysis also confirms that the marginal effect of surname distance on technology diffusion is substantially greater than that in the baseline results, suggesting that the baseline estimates of surname distance are probably biased downwards due to measurement error. In terms of magnitude, a one standard deviation increase (i.e. 0.675) in the surname distance between pairs of prefectures during, for example, 1650–1700, has the effect of lowering the probability of technology convergence by about 32 percent. Finally, to check robustness we apply this estimation strategy and instruments to examine the diffusion of other types of technology such as Industrial Revolution technology, which we proxy using the establishment of modern firms utilizing either the steam engine or electricity, for the periods 1896–1906 and 1896–1916. As with our findings on maize adoption, a one standard deviation increase in surname distance lowers the probabilities of adopting the steam engine and electricity by 7.8 percent and 14.9 percent respectively during the two periods in question. These results remain robust to the control of geographic isolation, differences in economic and geographical characteristics between a given pair of prefectures, and treaty ports and railways, and to the use of an instrumental variable. Our paper contributes to the growing literature on the “deep roots” of comparative economic development. Existing studies have highlighted the roles of geography (Diamond, 1997, 2002; Gallup et al., 1999; Jones, 1981; Olsson and Hibbs 2005), climatic fluctuations (Ashraf & Michalopoulos, 2014), human capital (Galor, 2011; Glaeser et al., 2004), institutions (Acemoglu et al., 2001, 2002, 2005; Engerman & Sokoloff, 2000; Hall & Jones, 1999; La Porta et al., 1999; Michalopoulos & Papaioannou, 2013), ethnolinguistic fractionalization (Alesina & La Ferrara, 2005; Alesina et al., 2003; Easterly & Levine, 1997a, 1997b), culture (Alesina et al., 2011; Barro & McCleary, 2003; Becker & Woessmann, 2009; Guiso et al., 2009; Nunn & Wantchekon, 2009; Tabellini, 2008), the ancestral composition of the current population (Ashraf & Galor, 2013; Comin et al., 2010; Putterman & Weil, 2010), and genetic distance (Spolaore & Wacziarg, 2009). We add to this long list of causal variables the role of the differences in population characteristics (e.g., biological, cultural, institutional) using surname distance as a measure. Our study is also related to a small but growing literature using surname information or cultural diversity to examine issues pertaining to social mobility (Clark et al., 2015), migration propensity (Li, 2018) and public goods provision (Hao & Xue, 2017). By examining the role played by surname distance in technology adoption, our paper complements these endeavors. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we first construct the measure of surname distance between 5671 pairs of prefectures and check its reliability, followed by a brief discussion of why and how surname distance matters for the diffusion of technology. In Sect. 3 we introduce the analytical framework proposed by Spolaore and Wacziarg (2009) to examine the effect of relative surname distance to the technology frontier. In Sect. 4 we conduct a baseline analysis of the effect of surname distance on the probability of technology convergence, before adopting an instrumental variable approach using the forced resettlement and assimilation of the Tangut nomads to address the endogenous measure of surname distance. To ensure robustness we further apply our instrumental variable approach to study the diffusion of an industrial revolution technology among firms in Sect. 5. Section 6 concludes.",1
