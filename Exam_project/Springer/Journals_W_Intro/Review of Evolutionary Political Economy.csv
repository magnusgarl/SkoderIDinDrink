1.0,1.0,Review of Evolutionary Political Economy,09 July 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43253-020-00011-6,Towards an evolutionary political economy. Editorial to the inaugural issue of the Review of Evolutionary Political Economy REPE,May 2020,Silvano Cincotti,Wolfram Elsner,Engelbert Stockhammer,Male,Male,Male,Male,"This is the first of two inaugural issues of the Review of Evolutionary Political Economy (REPE), a new peer-reviewed, inter-disciplinary academic journal, initiated by the European Association for Evolutionary Political Economy (EAEPE) and published by one of the leading international academic publishers, Springer Nature. But why a new journal? Is there a potential space for it in the universe of already well-established economic journals? And what could its value-added for the economics community be? The ambition of the journal is to bring together and integrate political economy, evolutionary and institutional economics, agent-based computational economics, and heterodox macroeconomics, and to become a pluralistic forum of excellence in what is emerging as evolutionary political economy. Economics got separated from the social sciences in the late nineteenth century, when its later mainstream turned from “political economy” to “pure economics”, which in turn, led to “neoclassical economics”. A substantial further narrowing of that mainstream took place from the 1970s onwards. With the “New Classical” counterrevolution, the Keynesian-neoclassical truce of the post-war period was ended. This transformed, in particular, the field of macroeconomics. A new mainstream economics was established, based on methodological individualism, particularly “rational expectations”, and the notion of market clearing. “Proper” economics then had to use a particular mathematical modelling, and the models themselves had to be based on “rational” agents. In “New Classical” macroeconomics, a rational-expectations and global-knowledge equilibrium became the reference point of modelling in the form of the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. In economics, such reductionism marginalized the different strands of non-mainstream economics. It became more difficult for non-orthodox and epistemologically pluralistic economists to publish in orthodox journals, to win grant funding and get promotion. But it also led to some fragmentation among the non-mainstream scene, where heterodox economists of Marxist, post-Keynesian, institutionalist, socio-economic, feminist, ecological, or neo-Schumpeterian economics developed their own fields, established journals and associations. And several generalist, heterodox and pluralist organizations and networks, EAEPE being prominent among them, emerged in order to facilitate discussion, interaction and potential convergence among the disparate heterodox streams. REPE now has been founded on the conviction that the fragmentation of the heterodox economic perspectives and the separation of “economics” and “political economy” is a severe impediment to progress in economic research and relevant insight for our societies. Below, we will briefly give an outline of some research orientations in the different fields to be covered by REPE, before we will discuss what we see as the particular role and value-added of this journal. The ambition of Evolutionary Economics in general is to interpret change and to observe the development (or history) of socio-economic systems, either by a formal dynamic system or by its qualitative reconstruction (or by both). Evolutionary approaches, paradigms, or theories integrate bounded rationality in dealing with complex problems, radical uncertainty, search, knowledge acquisition, and learning (Dosi and Winter 2003: 286). They receive inspiration from biology and biological analogies, but also from other natural sciences with their complex dynamic approaches and network modelling, such as physics or neuroscience. Those insights have entailed a renewal in the economics discipline and a new broad interdisciplinary cooperation. Most heterodoxies in economics, among them are neo-Schumpeterian, Veblenian, radical, post-Keynesian, or Hayekian, interpret evolutionary dynamics in the context of socially learned and interactively acquired social rules and institutions, as coordination, cooperation, orientation, and complexity-reducing devices, and as interim social “solutions”, or transient “attractors” in complex dynamics, but also possibly as dysfunctional, “petrified” structures preventing favourable change, impeding innovation, or causing petrifactions of systems (e.g. Dopfer and Potts 2004; Witt 2008; Elsner 2017a; Dosi et al. 2019). Such approaches rest upon a relatively recent transdisciplinary scientific corpus, characterized by a diversity of methods in addressing change, innovation, process, slower or faster transitions, and institutional and organizational solutions with shorter or longer, useful, or hindering states of systems. In these approaches, there can be no unique and globally optimal way of doing things, but agents and organizations have to adhere to social institutions, habits, routines, or norms, which lead to systemic path dependence (e.g. Becker et al. 2005). Evolutionary approaches have not been completely standardized yet as to their methods, giving rise to a profusion of answers to address the questions of dynamics, process, history, novelty, or disruption. But among key findings of evolutionary economics are explanations showing why the “optimal” technology may not be realized (e.g. David 1985), why learning, adaptation, and building absorptive capacities are critical for technology diffusion, and how, once a technology is adopted, path dependency occurs, reinforcing prior choices (e.g. Cowan 1990). This was formally depicted first in W.B. Arthur’s famous model of competing technologies (Arthur 1989). Related applied evolutionary insights gained considerable impact on contemporary research and innovation policies, namely, in the EU. Industrial and organizational economics, the evolution of demand and consumption, questions of the natural environment, or the natural commons, including the global climate, and the transformations of the capitalist system, all were substantially broadened by evolutionary approaches. While neo-Schumpeterian evolutionary theory relies upon a positive vision of innovation, a vector of growth and progress taken as a whole (e.g. Dosi and Grazzi 2006; Dosi et al. 2019), Veblenian evolutionary-institutional perspectives also focus on “ceremonial” degenerations, obstruction, distortion, or negative externalities of technologically innovative potentials (e.g. Elsner 2020). The evolution of demand and consumption, analyzed already by Veblen, was further developed more recently, for instance based on work by U. Witt and others (e.g. Witt 2003, 2008; Lazaric et al. 2019). An evolutionary economics of consumption and demand scrutinizes preferences and values, which is symptomatic of evolutionary research responding to contemporary problems (e.g. Buensdorf and Cordes 2008; Cordes and Schwesinger 2014). This includes research within interdisciplinary so-called naturalistic perspectives, for instance on learning and transmission processes of new behaviour, such as in consumption qualified as “green”. Work along these lines also makes evident the pertinence of environmental questions, which may become the new battle horse of evolutionary-institutional approaches as much as innovation and consumption, all in both research and policy (e.g. Maréchal and Lazaric 2010; Brouillat and Oltra 2012). With respect to innovation, the long-standing lack of a critical stance towards innovation, failures to link innovation to social inclusiveness and ecological sustainability, and the reluctance to think about innovation in terms of governance and ownership have motivated the ambitions of the present journal. And there is much out already, where we can build upon (e.g. Metcalfe et al. 2005; Gifford and McKelvey 2019; Savona and Tommaso 2019). While the evolutionary approach in a neo-Schumpeterian perspective focuses on innovation under the dialectic of destruction and creation and its different performances under more competitive versus oligopolistic and corporate conditions, the evolutionary-institutional approach in the Veblenian perspective (i.e. original institutional economics) focuses on the potentially different characters of social institutions as either problem-solving (“instrumental”) or differential status and power preserving (“ceremonial”) devices. And while neo-Schumpeterian economics has become leading in industrial economics, its ecologies, dynamics and evolution, and in research and innovation policies, the Veblenian neo-institutionalist “institutional dichotomy” has facilitated an operational and value-aware theory of “progressive” versus “regressive” institutional change to explain typical ongoing processes in contemporary capitalist socio-economies. Both evolutionary perspectives have considerably been further developed since the 1960s and 1970s into fruitful applied, applicable, empirically, and policy-wise accessible research programmes. So, while neo-Schumpeterian economics has become the main paradigm shaping modern research and innovation policies, institutionalism, formerly looked at as “just historical” or “just sociological” by mainstream economists, had not only shaped US legal systems and social policies in the 1920s and 1930s but also, with a strong epistemological value-awareness, developed a policy paradigm of a “negotiated”, socially problem-solving economy, based on its elaborated “instrumental value principles”. And both variants of evolutionary economics today also are deeply involved in “hetecon” discourses with political economy, post-Keynesianism, international political economy, or complexity economics, where potential convergences and complementarities are being fathomed (e.g. Elsner 2013, 2017b). Their policy conceptions do benefit from cooperation with political economy, the policy orientations of post-Keynesian economics and the field of International Political Economy, as well as their comprehensions of systems are benefiting from modern complexity sciences. Besides the research in each of these fields, it is this structured interaction processes, discovering differences, complementarities, and convergences that will take place in REPE and guide its discourses and its pluralistic heterodox editorial policy. The science of complexity studies phenomena, which emerge from a collection of interacting entities and which cannot be understood by considering them as separate units. In this sense, the holistic approach does not exclude a reductionist theory, but states that the aggregate can possess emerging properties that are different and complex with respect to the mere superposition of elementary objects. Complexity was proposed in the 1970s as counter paradigm to the reductionist methods in natural sciences (e.g. Anderson 1972), but already in 1959 and 1962, H.A. Simon prompted out the necessity of a holistic approach to the study of the economy, and in 1969, T.C. Schelling took up Simon’s lesson with a study on segregation that led to first real applications of complexity sciences to social systems, with surprising, counterintuitive results. Since Simon’s and Schelling’s seminal works, the complexity approach has allowed to explain aggregate and emerging statistical regularities as well as both intuitive and counter-intuitive relationships in the economy, outcomes of the interaction of heterogeneous, and bounded-rational agents in either multiple equilibria or disequilibrium conditions of imperfect decentralized systems (markets) (e.g. Kirman 1992). Complexity economics offered the opportunity to address questions that cannot be tackled by means of representative and perfectly rational agents in general-equilibrium conditions, whereas realistic explanations involve notions of heterogeneity, adaptive expectations, social collective intelligence and self-fulfilling or self-destroying properties, interactions, contagion, networks, etc. Complexity economics is the answer to the needs of understanding all that, and it is nowadays the scientific area embracing all methodologies and applications of complexity sciences to economics, ranging from agent-based approaches (e.g. Arthur et al. 1997; Raberto et al. 2001; Delli Gatti et al. 2005; Le Baron 2006; Buchanan 2009; Cincotti et al. 2010; Farmer et al. 2012; Dosi and Roventini 2019) to networks (Battiston et al. 2007; Delli Gatti et al. 2010; Battiston et al. 2016), all in the general framework of non-linear dynamical complex systems (e.g. Arrow 1994; Arthur 1999; Beinhocker 2006; Helbing and Kirman 2013). This also offers the opportunity to represent, analyze, and study economic and financial systems as complex adaptive systems and to translate them into artificial economies gathering insights and outcomes from different heterodox economic approaches (e.g. innovation, endogenous money, or financial acceleration) and taking fruitful inspiration and positive feedbacks from other disciplines (e.g. mathematics, physics, engineering, biology, or computer science) in a creative and valuable inter- and multidisciplinary context. Post-Keynesian economics is an important heterodox macroeconomic theory that emphasizes demand-led growth, involuntary unemployment, and issues of financial instability (e.g. Lavoie 2009; Palley 1996; King 2002; Hein 2017). It builds on the radical insights of J.M. Keynes, in particular the concept of fundamental uncertainty, which implies that people cannot act in globally rational form and will resort to behavioural rules, which are often stabilized by social institutions and norms. This has important implications for the theory of money demand (liquidity preference), financial stability (the possibility of herding), and for investment dynamics, where non-rational elements, Keynes’ “animal spirits”, play an important role. Post-Keynesian economics’ initial project was to develop Keynes’ macroeconomic theory, which had a short-term focus, into a growth theory (Robinson 1956; Kaldor 1956, 1957; Kalecki 1965) and to critique neoclassical theory of production and distribution (Cambridge capital controversies, e.g. Harcourt 1969; Moss 1980). It is based on a class-analytic approach and conventional, real-world behaviour rather than methodological individualism. Also post-Keynesian economics formed into a distinct school of thought with its own journals and networks in the 1970s. Since then, it has developed theories of endogenous money creation (e.g. Moore, Lavoie), financial instability, and endogenous financial cycles (e.g. Minsky 1986; Palley 1994; Ryoo 2016; Nikolaidi and Stockhammer 2017 as a survey), demand regimes and growth models (e.g. Bhaduri and Marglin 1990; Lavoie and Stockhammer 2013), and stock-flow consistent modelling (Godley and Lavoie 2007). There is also a closely related stream of Latin American structuralism, which analyzes the growth conditions and constraints in developing countries (e.g. Cimoli and Porcile 2014). Post-Keynesians have commented extensively economic policy making (e.g. Hein 2013; Stockhammer and Onaran 2013; Palley 2015), in particular questions of fiscal and monetary policy, critiqued austerity policies, and highlighted the danger of rising debt ratios for financial stability. Post-Keynesian economics has established itself as an alternative to mainstream macroeconomic theory addressing questions of demand formation, economic growth, distribution, and financial instability. Compared with other heterodox approaches, post-Keynesian economics has paid less attention to modelling individual behaviour, but there are several areas of ongoing cooperation and intellectual cross fertilization with other heterodox approaches. As of yet, these are often limited to specific niches. For example, there is a recent wave of papers to integrate non-mainstream macroeconomics more systematically into ecological economics, and climate-change models in particular (e.g. Dafermos et al. 2017). There is also an exciting intersection of agent-based modelling and post-Keynesian economics (e.g. Caiani et al. 2016; Dosi et al. 2010); and there is a growing interest in the field of comparative political economy in the post-Keynesian analysis of demand regimes and growth models (e.g. Baccaro and Pontusson 2016; Schwartz and Tranoy 2019). It is for such boundary-crossing research that REPE will be a forum. Although it has long historical roots in moral philosophy and political economy, the contemporary discipline of International Political Economy (IPE) would re-emerge only in the late 1960s and 1970s at the intersection of international economics and international relations. At the time of the global ascent of market-centred ideologies and policies, some economists, as well as other social scientists, became dissatisfied with the lack of attention paid to of power relations in traditional economics. The analysis of power, in its multiple facets, had been central to political science and the study of international relations. The latter, in turn, traditionally focused on the analysis of monetary factors and trade regimes in shaping international economic diplomacy. While the founders of IPE included economists as well as political scientists, today the discipline is typically hosted in international relations and political science departments. At present, IPE is divided by the so-called Atlantic divide (Cohen 2007). The American tradition of IPE has evolved by adopting the methods of neoclassical economics to the study of international trade diplomacy. As a result, American IPE today is dominated by quantitative methodologies and is defined by the focus on one main puzzle: Namely, if free markets are optimal allocators of scarce resources, how come that governments around the world continue to adhere to protectionism? Addressing this puzzle, American IPE employs, for instance, the method of two-level game theory, modelling the response of international economic agents against the context of (1) international and (2) domestic constituencies. On the other side of the Atlantic divide, IPE has much stronger roots in classical political economy and history of economic thought, especially its Marxist tradition. This particular stream of scholarship remains prominent in the UK and continental Europe, where historically IPE has drawn on the French School of Regulation. The main themes for IPE in Europe have been globalization, neoliberalism, and the changing world order. There is a third school of thought, somewhat less widely known, that informs IPE scholarship today. It goes back to the tradition of Original Institutional Economics (OIE), the above-mentioned evolutionary-institutional economics (or institutionalism), and the works of T.B. Veblen, J.R. Commons, A.A. Berle, and others. Its key focus has been twofold: On the one hand, it is the understanding of the structure and nature of wealth and capital; on the other, it is the relationship between individual and aggregate forms of organization and behaviour in capitalism. Although somewhat interrupted in its development by the ascent of quantitative approaches in mid-twentieth century, such evolutionary IPE has been given a boost by the 2007–2009 crisis. From around that time, it has been developing through a close dialogue between institutional economics, political economy, economic sociology, and law. In this process, the focus on uncertainty and expectations, historically central to post-Keynesian thought, has been advanced also by insights from OIE. Today, the essence of this approach is best captured by what Perry Mehrling called the “finance view” of the economy, which focuses on the present valuations of capital assets, seeing them as entirely dependent on imagined future cash flows, projected back into the present (Mehrling 2011: 4). It is against this background that the discipline of IPE can particularly benefit from this new journal, REPE, focusing on inter-disciplinary research in evolutionary political economy. It seems to become increasingly clear that today’s economic institutions and structures are defined by expectations of change and valuations of the future. It also appears to be increasingly clear that big political-economic issues of today and tomorrow are likely to centre not on isolated or individual problems and crises, but on complex, systemic phenomena and processes. REPE is intended as an outlet that can inform the emergent evolutionary strand in IPE and related disciplines. The articles that comprise the inaugural issues should initiate discussions about the ways such discourses may develop. Evolutionary economics, institutionalist economics, complexity theory, post-Keynesian economics, and International Political Economy, all have important developed alternative perspectives to current mainstream economics. They all share a rejection of the rational-agent methodological individualism and of simple market clearing. Instead, they advocate an understanding of human behaviour as shaped by social institutions and conventions, of decentralized (“market”) processes as prone to evolutionary dynamics that may lead to socially undesirable results and give rise to fallacies of composition. Thus, we think that the various non-mainstream approaches in economics and the social sciences already share some common ontological, theoretical, and policy-oriented ground, but they have developed in different fields and have built their own niches. We think it is important to build more bridges between these and also other heterodox approaches (like feminist or ecological economics) to support the works towards comprehensive alternative visions of economics that could at some point absorb and replace the orthodox economic mainstream in research, applications, advice, policy-making, teaching, and textbook writing. While initiated by EAEPE, REPE is organizationally independent as an academic journal and will be strictly international globally, both in its published articles and its personnel and governance (Editorial team, Associate Editors, and International Advisory Board). EAEPE severely discussed the question of founding a new journal for several years. It considered that there are already a number of excellent heterodox and pluralist journals existing. There are well-established journals for evolutionary economics, institutional economics, political economy, post-Keynesian macroeconomics, complexity economics, and International Political Economy, furthermore, for innovation or history of economic thought, in Schumpeterian, Marxian, social-economic, institutionalist, Austrian, feminist, ecological, and other critical perspectives. There are also journals, both of a heterodox-pluralist and mainstream self-image, that cover cutting-edge methodologies, complex systems, networks, or computational approaches. But the editorial team of REPE, EAEPE, and Springer did identify a space indeed for a new pluralist-heterodox journal, which relates cutting-edge evolutionary and complex systems with institutional analysis, critical political economy, heterodox macroeconomics, computational methods, and interdisciplinarity, in a number of applied fields, from innovation, networks, distribution, or social class to climate change, with topicality and critical policy relevance, wherever possible. For this, as our Aims&Scope and Call for Papers clarify, we invite high-quality and cutting-edge conceptual and review articles, theoretical, methodological, empirical, and computational research from the fields and cross-fields mentioned. Submitted papers should embrace the heterogeneity of economic agents and interactions as complexified by power, institutions, or environmental conditions. Papers might explore the origins and impact of economic crises, inequality and unemployment, the changing role of finance and financial instability, the digital transformation, artificial intelligence, the socio-economic facets of environmental degradation, and climate change, up to most topical issues of economic impacts of epidemics. Articles that advance novel interdisciplinary analyses of complex systems, embrace social, natural, behavioural, and computer sciences or draw on humanities and cultural theories are highly welcome. As a key purpose of REPE is to bring together different heterodox contributions, as sketched above, we will also rely on symposia (with 3–4 papers) and special issues (with 6–7 papers) on topical themes or themes that cut across conventional themes and disciplines and relate in some way to what may emerge as evolutionary political economy. Ideas and proposals from potential guest-editors are invited. Brief instructions are to be found on REPE’s website:https://www.springer.com/journal/43253. Each author will assign his/her paper to one of the major fields given by the Editorial Manager system when submitting. This should not be a restriction to the author but an assistance for quickly assigning the handling editor and reviewers. Finally, to be successful, this journal needs support and critical feedback from critical scholars, including those beyond EAEPE. The editorial team always welcomes comments on REPE’s agenda and issues. Against the background outlined, for the inaugural issues, we invited some of the leading figures in evolutionary political economy to reflect the status and future of what is, what could, and will be a research programme of evolutionary political economy. It turned out that we will be able to present to the scholarly public two inaugural issues, the present one and the next one, issue 2–2020, which will appear in Fall. Smita Srinivas’ article “Development, Institutional Variety, and the Future of Economics” explains the importance for development economics of diverse ontological assumptions about the nature and content of development for understanding and tackling institutional variety. The differences notably matter for understanding technological and social capabilities. Using four cases drawn from the author’s research, this article highlights diverse conceptual frameworks for institutional variety. Such variety matters for economic development, and it is critical to understand local conditions and history of such variety. Indeed, industrialization is a process of institutional change, where social capabilities provide direction and guidelines for development goals and institutional transformation. By scrutinizing the process of inference during the building of capabilities, evolutionary political economy may improve the understanding of the emergence of that institutional variety and its outcomes within and across countries. In “The past, present and future of evolutionary macroeconomics”,Malcolm Sawyer argues that heterodox macroeconomics contains many features of evolutionary political economy. It highlights social conflict and potential instabilities of monetary production economies in a world of fundamental uncertainty. Heterodox macroeconomics thus features reoccurring crises, distributional conflict, and gives rise to a path-dependent growth process. Sawyer particularly discusses three frontiers of heterodox macroeconomics that in the past have received limited attention: ecological issues and climate change, gender, and heterogeneous-agent modelling. Overall, he concludes that heterodox macroeconomics is part of evolutionary political economy that analyzes monetary production economies. In “Gender and the Future of Macroeconomics: an evolutionary approach”, Sheila Dow argues that gender lends itself well to an evolutionary analysis which focuses on non-equilibrium change and transformation for individuals within society. Decomposition by this important category, gender, helps us to understand the economy at the macro level, and design macroeconomic policy better. It also provides the foundation for advocating equal gender rights and outcomes. In contrast, in mainstream macroeconomics, gender issues can only be partially analysed due to its requirement of “microfoundations”, its focus on GDP growth, and its explanation of suboptimal outcomes as due to market imperfections only. An approach which takes gender seriously requires the different epistemology that arises from feminism: It does not rely on dualistic categorisations, but builds on the idea of situated knowledge, which in turn requires a pluralist methodology and an acceptance of fundamental uncertainty. Such a methodology allows for emergent identity, for the cognitive roles of emotion and social convention, and for attention to power relations beyond market power. John Davis’ paper “Belief reversals as phase transitions and economic fragility: A complexity theory of financial cycles with reflexive agents” contributes to the analysis of expectations and belief reversals in an evolutionary and complexity economics framework. It formulates its analysis in terms of the concept of reflexivity, drawing on ideas on reflexivity in financial markets of G. Soros. It lays out a model of how a financial cycle expresses a systematic pattern of interacting feedback effects. The paper develops this analysis as a complex interaction between sets of heterogeneous expectations derived from the behaviour of reflexive economic agents. A central role is played by agents’ beliefs and judgments underlying their expectations, and how those beliefs and judgments in uncertain circumstances are changeable and subject to abrupt reversals, which can manifest themselves in “Minsky moments”. Agents’ belief reversals may follow their misconceptions about causal processes in booms and upswings, and such misconceptions will reflect their tendency to think causally in terms of negative feedback patterns rather than positive ones. In “Was Hyman Minsky a post-Keynesian economist?”,Marc Lavoie discusses key features, and strengths and weaknesses, of Minsky’s financial instability hypothesis, which became popular in the aftermath of the failure of Lehman Brothers despite having been ignored by mainstream economists until then. Minsky is an interesting case as he has been important within post-Keynesian theory, but was a student of Schumpeter’s. His analysis of financial innovation and endogenous financial crisis has institutionalist and evolutionary features, while the core of his macroeconomics, including endogenous money creation via credit, and the principle of effective demand have clearly Keynesian features. While Colander, Holt and Rosser (2010), and Davidson (2003–4) have questioned whether Minsky can be classified, Lavoie concludes that indeed Minsky clearly stood in the post-Keynesian camp. Frank Beckenbach’s article, “A value-theoretic approach to economic dynamics and evolution – Synthesizing different Marxian modules in a simulation model. Part I: Foundations”, has a twofold background as follows: first, the ongoing debate about whether the Marxian theory of value has been damaged (or even destroyed) by the alleged impossibility of solving the “transformation problem” and secondly, the fact that almost all of the (later) economic manuscripts of Marx are now accessible due to the MEGA project. In regard to the former, it can be concluded that the rationale of the Marxian value concept is distorted by its Ricardian elements (including the labour theory of value). In regard to the latter, the later economic manuscripts as well as the few economic monographs published during Marx’s lifetime indicate that Marx was figuring out different modules for his value theory which are not thoroughly synthesized with each other. An attempt is made to reformulate this contested and fragmented value theoretic torso by focussing on the non-Ricardian essentials of the value theory. This (de-)construction is then used as a basis for linking the different value-theoretic modules in terms of their ability to explain economic evolution. In addition to a conceptual discussion of the value-theoretic modules, a simulation model is suggested for their integration. It can be shown that the value theory can be substantiated in a consistent stepwise fashion and the conditions for generating the long-term results expected by Marx can be specified. As said, issue 2 will provide the second part of our two inaugural issues and will appear after the summer break with more papers on the future of the fields of evolutionary political economy by prominent authors (P. Arestis, F. Beckenbach, L. Chester, K. Dopfer, M. Lavoie, R. Palan, J. Toporowski, U. Witt). Enjoy reading REPE!",3
1.0,1.0,Review of Evolutionary Political Economy,16 June 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43253-020-00010-7,Institutional variety and the future of economics,May 2020,Smita Srinivas,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Despite substantial debate and dissent, the process of development in economics is seen with some considerable consensus as one of institutional change, especially the change of dominant institutions such as markets. Economic historians and economic development scholars, however, have recognized that development involves phenomena which may not be easily recognizable within existing conceptual frameworks nor reconciled into empirical patterns or policy clarity that can be easily extended from already industrialized economies. For example, the process of industrial development, and with it the wide and varied attempts by firms and states of technological learning and innovation, reveals considerable institutional variety. Implicit in the policy advice is recognizing some institutional variation, yet viewing the transformation of economies as processes of inevitable institutional convergence or of dominant institutions such as markets becoming more “perfect.” In this sense, development economics has been an arena of considerable dissent about the microeconomic assumptions of institutional change and the narrow reading of markets. Furthermore, policy advice from development agencies can push countries to mimic those of industrialized economies from several decades earlier, such as South Korea, or suggest to democracies that authoritarian transitions may be copied. The stakes are high for countries to manage their institutional change process, but also for economics to justify how it infers such change from situations where considerable variety exists. This paper provides a preliminary conceptual approach by asking how one might reconcile different theoretical frameworks about institutional variety under the umbrella of evolutionary political economy (EPE). What inferences can be drawn from the phenomena of variety of institutions such as markets and firms? Development economics is a study of phenomena dependent on inferences about institutional variety and its consequences for technological capabilities and development. Using four brief composite cases drawing from the author’s development research, the paper focuses on the conceptual frameworks and taxonomy of inference and judgment in economics. How, why, and what scholars differently infer from the phenomena of institutional variety matters to economics and to theories and policies of technological capabilities, especially for learning and innovation in industrial advance. The paper lays out the argument that more systematic treatment within evolutionary political economy, across frameworks for innovation and learning, can advance the field of development and economics. The next section outlines in more detail the scientific process of economics, the potential advantages of drawing from alternate systems of inference such as the Nyaya school that well predates Cartesian thinking and the opportunity presented by revealing such assumptions of inference and judgment in evolutionary political economy (EPE). Section 3 then details the specific intra-paradigmatic conceptual context of institutional variety. The example used is the study of technological learning and innovation literature regarding economic development in “late” industrial nations. Section 4 presents four brief cases to further a taxonomy of intra-paradigmatic challenges in the evolutionary political economy tradition. Section 5 derives from the four development cases to discuss potential benefits of EPE for economics’ advance.",8
1.0,1.0,Review of Evolutionary Political Economy,11 March 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43253-020-00003-6,"The past, present and future of evolutionary macroeconomics",May 2020,Malcolm Sawyer,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This paper discusses the roles and natures of heterodox macroeconomics analysis and the challenges which it faces as a contribution to the symposium on ‘evolutionary political economy – state of the art and future’. I view ‘heterodox macroeconomics’ (briefly defined below) as contributing to evolutionary political economy and argue that heterodox macroeconomics analysis contains many features of evolutionary political economy. The boundaries of any school of thought or body of analysis are often to define with precision. In the case of heterodox macroeconomics, I align that with the bodies of analysis which are broadly post Keynesian and Kaleckian macroeconomics.Footnote 1 Heterodox macroeconomics is itself viewed as part of heterodox economics which is ‘a study of production and distribution of economic surplus, including the role of power relations in determining economic relationships, a study of economic systems, and tendencies associated with it, and the employment of theories that have these issues at their core, such as Classical Political Economy, Marxian Economics, Feminist Economics, Institutional Economics, and Keynesian Economics’.Footnote 2 In Sawyer (2009a), I placed heterodox macroeconomics analysis as relating to a monetary capitalist economy in which the monetary and financial sectors play central roles. Further, ‘the decision making of individuals and firms, the interactions of those decisions and the evolution of the economy have to be analysed in the context of fundamental uncertainty (in the sense of Keynes) where the future is unknown and unknowable, and the evolution of the economy must depend on the collective decisions which are made.’ (Sawyer 2009a, p. 25). Heterodox macroeconomic analysis stands in sharp contrast with what may be termed the mainstream macroeconomic analysis, in particular, the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models and ‘new consensus in macroeconomics’ (NCM).Footnote 3 From the perspective of evolutionary economics in general, the DSGE has shortcomings from its use of infinite time horizon constrained utility optimisation (hence denying role of fundamental uncertainty, and bounded rationality) and invoking the representative agent (thereby dismissing issue of aggregation, inequality and income distribution). The central features of heterodox macroeconomics can be viewed in following termsFootnote 4: The level of aggregate demand is always important for the level of economic activity, in the long run as well as the short-run. In order to be effective, demand has to be financed by the creation and possession of money. The analysis necessarily concerns a monetary production economy. Money is created by banks (commercial and central) and destroyed, and an ‘endogenous money’ approach has been closely associated with heterodox macroeconomics. In a monetary production economy, there is no possibility of the separation between the ‘real’ and the ‘monetary’ as envisaged in the ‘classical dichotomy’. The key and dual roles played by investment as a relative volatile component of aggregate demand and the driving force in the savings-investment relationship, and as involving the creation of productive potential and capacity The functional distribution of income comes within the macroeconomic analysis, and that the distribution of income impacts on the level of demand. In the recent literature, this has been closely reflected in the debates as to whether an economy is wage led or profit led. The interdependences of the conditions of (aggregate) demand and the supply potential of an economy. There are clear relationships, and a notable example is that of investment as a component of aggregate demand and as adding to productive capacity. Particular important features are those of hysteresis and path dependency as will be further discussed. Prices are set in many different ways varying depending on market power of firms and their objectives. Similarly, wages are determined in different ways depending on the structures of collective bargaining, the industrial relations frameworks etc. In general, prices and wages are not set in what may be termed a competitive market situation. A heterodox approach to inflation (which we labelled a structuralist approach, Arestis and Sawyer 2005) concentrates on three key elements in the inflationary process. One set of inflationary pressures comes from the level of demand relative to the size of productive capacity. There is no presumption that there is adequate capacity in an economy to support the full employment of labour, and hence, enterprises may be operating at or even above normal capacity with substantial levels of unemployment. A second and related set of inflationary pressures comes from the inherent conflict over the distribution of income. The ability of the economy to reconcile the conflict depends, inter alia, on the productive capacity of the economy. National economies are open to the rest of the world to varying extent and ways. Current account deficits and constraints on borrowing from abroad may serve to limit economic activity and growth in a country (as in the notion of balance of payments constrained growth). Exchange rates are set in a range of ways but strongly influenced by capital movements and generally subject to high degree of fluctuations with the extent of foreign exchange trading greatly in excess of the requirements for trade in goods and services. Capitalist economies are subject to fluctuations, cycles and crisis. Heterodox macroeconomics views cycles and crisis as inherent in capitalist economy and not ascribable to random factors (as would be the case in real business cycle analysis). Heterodox macroeconomics comes with many insights into the generation of cycles and crises, which are often analysed separately but are not in general inconsistent. Fluctuations in aggregate demand driven by investment (as in investment-accelerator type models) and class and income distribution struggle (as in Goodwin (1967, 1990) cycles) feature strongly. In a financialised economy, the issue of money and credit is a necessary component of fluctuations in economic activity, and further instabilities of the financial system become significant factors in the business cycle (Minsky 1982, cycles). Capitalist economies are prone to unemployment and underemployment of labour, and cycles and government policies (fiscal and monetary) can have a role in addressing unemployment and cycles. There are political and social constraints on the willingness of governments to use policies in this manner (Kalecki 1943). This paper proceeds as follows. In the next section (Section 2), I discuss the relationships in general terms between micro-, meso- and macroeconomics, specifically the nation state orientation of what is termed macroeconomics, and relate them to the analysis of a monetary production economy. In Section 3, it is noted that ideas on fundamental uncertainty have been (at least implicitly with the rejection of the probability distribution risk approach) a key component of heterodox macroeconomics and outline the implications of that in terms of decision-making and path dependency. Section 4 has remarks on how organisation and institutions are approached in heterodox macroeconomics. Section 5 focuses on the heterodox approaches to finance and money. Heterodox macroeconomics (in its post Keynesian, Kaleckian forms) has focused on the demand side of the economy. In Sections 6 and 7, I draw attention to two areas where heterodox macroeconomic analysis has historically ignored though the last decade or so has seen developments. In Section 6, it is environmental considerations which are examined, and in Section 7 gender. Section 8 makes some remarks on recent modelling techniques and their value in heterodox macroeconomics analysis.",3

Rather, a gender focus has the potential to illuminate our understanding of identity, behaviours and institutional structures and their evolution. Further, where this is our focus, the way in which we build economic knowledge needs to be suited to this subject matter. We need an epistemology which addresses core gender issues: the emergent and non-dualistic nature of identity, the integral role of values and emotion in economic activity and in the building of knowledge about it, the importance of social convention and the role of power including, but not limited to, market power. Since these issues are not incompatible with evolutionary economics, there is scope for extending evolutionary analysis by learning from feminist epistemology. Some gendered macroeconomics fits within the mainstream economic approach, and some feminist economists draw on mainstream tools. But the way in which we will consider here how gender enters into macroeconomic analysis reflects the more common approach to feminist economics which accords with the epistemology of non-mainstream economics. This approach to gender has parallels with the issues raised within evolutionary economics about macroeconomics more generally (see e.g. Foster 1987, 2011). Both involve a critique of the limitations placed by the methodological framework of the mainstream on considerations of non-equilibrium change but also of sources of stability in social conventions and in prior commitments. Indeed, Foster’s (2018) evolutionary analysis of consumption provides a good bridge to consideration of gender and the household. The focus is different: while evolutionary economics focuses on reproduction through the lens of the firm, feminist economics focuses on labour force reproduction through the household within a wider social infrastructure. But both schools of thought emphasise the limitations placed on macroeconomic analysis by the mainstream reliance on the concept of the (rational, fully-informed, atomistic) representative agent. Their critiques therefore falls squarely within the more general political economy critique of mainstream economics. The approach to evolutionary economics to be applied here emphasises the importance of conventions or rules which adapt and evolve. This requires a focus, not purely on the macro or micro level, but rather on the intermediate ‘meso’ level (Dopfer et al. 2004; Dopfer and Potts 2008, pp. 20–21). Rules provide the foundation for individual behaviour, and in turn determine macroeconomic outcomes. Feminist economics similarly emphasises the effect of gendered social structures on individual behaviour and outcomes, and the scope for these structures to evolve, sometimes through conflict. To deal with gender simply by means of two (atomistic) representative agents—one male, the other female—is therefore to impoverish the potential for analysing the social conventions which govern gendered behaviour and the institutions which constrain it. Rather, gendered macroeconomics too needs to refer to the meso level. By exploring the application of a feminist epistemology to gendered macroeconomics, the hope is to contribute to an evolutionary perspective on gender. In what follows, we explore first in more detail how mainstream macroeconomics deals with gender issues. We then consider what macroeconomics more generally entails, and consider how it has been, and can be, gendered from a different, non-mainstream, perspective. Finally, considering the further application of feminist economics to macroeconomics can have relevance also for the future of evolutionary macroeconomics.",2
1.0,1.0,Review of Evolutionary Political Economy,23 April 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43253-020-00009-0,Belief reversals as phase transitions and economic fragility: a complexity theory of financial cycles with reflexive agents,May 2020,John Davis,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The current economic crisis, precipitated by the corona virus pandemic, demonstrates the inherent fragility of the contemporary capitalist economic system and the drastic consequences and costs in human suffering that result from neglecting its needed reform. From a period of seemingly high employment and feverish speculative activity in financial markets to depression conditions and widespread market crashes, this current economic system is marked by severe and abrupt swings and reversals in expectations and beliefs about so-called economic fundamentals. Yet, there is little theory in economics explaining expectation and belief reversals despite the fact that the concept of expectations has been central to thinking about the economy since J. M. Keynes. This paper, then, seeks to contribute to the theory of expectations and belief reversals by analyzing it an evolutionary and complexity economics framework. It formulates its analysis specifically in terms of the concept of reflexivity, drawing on the pioneering ideas regarding reflexivity of George Soros regarding reflexivity in financial markets. Consider first, then, the connection between an evolutionary-complexity approach to the economy and the reflexivity concept. Brian Arthur characterizes complexity economics as a framework for economic thought fundamentally different from standard neoclassical equilibrium theory in the following way: It is a different way of seeing the economy. It gives a different view, one where actions and strategies constantly evolve, where time becomes important, where structures constantly form and re-form, where phenomena appear that are not visible to standard equilibrium analysis, and where a meso-layer between the micro and the macro becomes important (Arthur 2013, p. 1). Arthur, then, emphasizes the reflexivity connection. In complex economic systems, economic agents’ actions and strategies constantly evolve because agents interact in networks of heterogeneous agents who all constantly revise and adapt their actions and strategies in response to how others revise and adapt their actions and strategies. That is, economic agents are adaptive economic agents. What emphasizing reflexivity may explain, then, is how people revise and adapt their actions and strategies in interaction with one another in continually changing circumstances. This understanding clearly requires that we make time central to the explanation of the economy. Reflexivity accordingly explains this time dimension in terms of the idea of a temporal feedback loop, whereby people’s expectations of their future interaction with others feed back on and influence their current actions and strategies, while their current actions and strategies feed forward on and influence their future interaction with others. In effect, reflexivity makes expectations interdependent across both people and time. We can summarize this by saying that reflexivity theory is a theory of the agency of adaptive agents embedded in evolving structures and networks of social and economic interaction. Following Arthur’s comparison of complexity theory and standard equilibrium theory, then, what reflexivity theory accordingly provides us is a relational account of socially and economically embedded adaptive agents compared with neoclassicism’s fixed preference account of atomistic agents. I thus characterize these adaptive agents as “reflexive economic agents” and describe their interaction in this paper in terms of reflexive economic processes. This paper begins to lay out the role reflexivity theory understood in this way plays in explaining how reflexive economic agents interact in complex economic processes. Where does one start? One of the most important subjects of application of reflexivity thinking in economics is interdependent expectations in financial markets. I begin with this subject—or actually one paradigmatic aspect of it, boom-bust cycles in financial markets—because it allows us to first focus on whole sets of heterogeneous expectations and explain reflexive behavior in a systemic way in terms of the evolution of a specific structure of interaction. A complexity-reflexivity approach nonetheless seeks to explain how structures of interaction and economic agents themselves co-evolve. My procedure, then, is to begin at the level of a structure of interaction to bring out what a reflexive process involves, and then turn to how this influences agents’ evolution, before turning back to how this influences the evolution of the structure in which they interact. Keynes initiated this approach in terms of interdependent expectations when he framed his beauty contest idea in reflexivity terms as a single set of interdependent expectations resulting from investors focusing only on what others believe are good investments (Keynes 1936).Footnote 1 More recently, Soros, who explicitly characterizes his analysis of boom-bust cycles and bubbles in financial markets as an application of reflexivity theory, links speculative expectations and expectations about economic fundamentals, and uses this to develop his view of how expectations operate in financial markets (Soros 1987, 2013). It seems, then, that if we are to explain reflexivity in financial markets in terms of interdependent expectations, whatever particular application we choose to adopt, what we first need to do is determine how we should describe different “sets” of expectations. To do this, I begin with Soros’ boom-bust analysis, since in combining speculative expectations and expectations about fundamentals, he provides a comprehensive view of what a set of interdependent expectations might involve. Boom-bust cycles and bubbles, of course, are just one financial market phenomenon. But for complexity-reflexivity theory, they are a paradigmatic one, because they concern how a specific, relatively well-defined structure evolves together with the evolution of agents’ expectations. For Soros, then, every boom-bust process has two components: an underlying trend in fundamentals and a misconception about value of a financial asset or stock based upon those fundamentals. In the boom, the trend in the underlying value is reinforced by the misconception about the future value of the stock that is driving up its price. The rising stock price improves the fundamentals on which that stock’s value is based, for example, in the form of greater capacity to finance operations or to acquire other firms, driving up earnings per share and thus giving further impetus to the stock’s price rise (see Soros 2013, p. 324 and Fig. 4). In reflexivity terms, speculators’ expectations of the future, in this case involving a misconception about the future value of the asset, feed back on and influences the present by raising the current market price and earnings per share, which then feeds forward on speculators’ expectation of the future, etc., in a continuing reflexive feedback loop. Yet speculative behavior, Soros argues, drives the stock price up faster than firms are able to improve earnings, and at some point, the price is seen to be too high relative to fundamentals, and the bust occurs. He associates the boom with a positive feedback process in expectations about the stock’s price—its increases lead speculators to expect even higher prices for the stock. After the bust, a negative feedback process prevails, and the stock price increases at a decreasing rate, reflecting underlying trends in earnings and the gradual improvement in the stock’s fundamentals. These latter circumstances involve what he calls “near-equilibrium conditions” compared with the bubble-like “far-from equilibrium conditions” that exist in the boom. In effect, the circumstances of a positive feedback cycle depart from and then collapse back on the circumstances of negative feedback, and the speculative episode of the bubble is replaced by everyday course of events in which businesses operate reasonably predictably. Soros’ focus, then, like Keynes’s, is on financial markets and stock prices, but in contrast to Keynes’s beauty contest idea, Soros’ reflexivity theory makes the boom-bust cycle depend on interrelated movements in stock prices and their underlying fundamentals. Since no one denies, including Keynes (cf. Marcuzzo 2020), that fundamentals play some sort of role in determining stock prices, his financial market conception of a set of expectations is perhaps better seen as a limiting case.Footnote 2 At the same time, since the determinants of and movements in stock prices and their underlying fundamentals are relatively independent, Soros’ analysis suggests that we should think not just in terms of one single set of expectations governing stock prices but also in terms of two different or heterogeneous types of expectation processes, one associated with the financial side of the economy itself, and one associated with economic fundamentals, whose interaction then explains boom-bust cycles, bubbles, and other similar financial phenomena. This perspective makes reflexivity theory a theory of interacting, interdependent expectations, involving a complex interaction of multiple, heterogeneous sets of expectations and different interacting, reflexive economic agents. I adopt this conception of expectations in this paper and develop it in the most basic way in terms of just the two sets of expectations involved in Soros’ analysis of boom-bust cycles. The immediate task of the paper, then, is to make two arguments to explain how these boom-bust cycles work: First, one about how the two sets of expectations regarding stock prices and fundamentals interact at the turning point in the cycle; Second, one about how these two sets of expectations interact in the upswing of a boom leading up to that turning point. The first argument has the goal of showing that the turning point in a boom-bust cycle involves a phase transition or a kind of qualitative change—an important object of explanation in complexity economics—due to a change in the relationship between the two sets of expectations that manifests itself in a wave of what I will call “belief reversals.” Soros does not explain why a bust occurs or why economic fundamentals re-assert themselves following a boom. He only says that at some point, agents’ views about stock prices become so far removed from the underlying trends determining stock prices that the bust ensues. But he also implies that the problem is that stock prices are “out of balance” with those underlying trends in fundamentals during the boom. The first part of my argument, then, explains this idea in terms of how these two types of expectations, that have gotten increasingly “out of balance,” get rebalanced at the turning point of the cycle. The importance of explaining turning points in boom-bust cycles in terms of how different sets of expectations get rebalanced for complexity theory, then, is that it identifies one mechanism by which the interdependence of agents produces changes in the structure of the economy, or at least an aspect of it. The goal of the second argument is to examine why these two types of expectations get “out of balance” in the boom. I follow Soros in explaining booms in terms of misconceptions about the nature of the positive feedback processes operating on stock prices and economic fundamentals but argue that the problem especially concerns positive feedback processes associated with economic fundamentals due to there being an inherent ambiguity involved in economic agents understanding their underlying cause-and-effect determinants. The general problem of understanding the underlying causal determinants of observable processes in the case of negative feedback is much less serious, because these prevail before and after the boom in “near-equilibrium conditions” when economic relationships are relatively stable. I thus argue that this biases economic agents in his “far-from equilibrium conditions” toward seeing positive feedback processes also as stable and predictable on the model of negative ones, though often they are not, and it is this that explains misconceptions in the boom about stock prices. What is particularly different about the way in which I approach reflexivity in this paper in connection with financial markets is that I treat expectation as a judgment, or rather as a reflexive judgment. There are two main reasons I take this approach. First, focusing on the judgments people make about the world makes it possible to talk about their beliefs, because people’s judgments reflect their beliefs. People’s beliefs about the economy also continually change as they interact with one another, and significant change in their beliefs is often associated with significant change in the economy. Thus, focusing on judgment takes us beyond simply mapping out changing sets of expectations, and gives us a way of understanding what motivates change in people’s expectations. Second, what is especially important about an act of judgment is its point-in-time nature. A judgment is a singular event or episode in historical time when agents consult their beliefs and take a position in interaction with others in ways that may influence how their interaction plays out. Thus, a focus on judgment as a singular occasion on which agents act on their beliefs and possibly change them—a “Minsky moment” (1982)—makes it possible to investigate both turning points as unique occasions involving significant shift in beliefs, and the speculative positions they adopt when the evidence for doing so may fall short of justifying those positions. Focusing on judgment admittedly gives my approach a somewhat different way of explaining complex adaptive economic systems compared with the way in which they are mathematically explained in much of complexity economics in terms of the nonlinear dynamics of agent interaction in networks. For both methods, an important explanatory goal is to explain phase transitions as qualitative changes in the structure of the economy. Phase transitions can be described quite well in mathematical terms, but this still leaves unexplained why a specific state of expectations produces a transition to a new state of affairs in the economy. Thus, an “uncomfortable thing” about many such models and explanations “is that there is no necessary proximate major cause for a sudden shift in the aggregate state” that would explain why an economy self-organizes itself on some new basis (Kirman 2010, p. 502). Thus, one goal of the judgment-based approach to reflexivity employed here is to explain in terms of configurations of beliefs, which we can discuss and evaluate in light of their specific historical circumstances. The “Reflexivity in general terms” section lays the basic foundation for the rest of the paper by defining and explaining the nature of a reflexive process with feedback loops, and by emphasizing the unique role that reflexivity plays in social science. The “First argument: turning points in boom-bust cycles as widespread belief reversals” section, concerning my first argument, describes the turning point in a boom-bust cycle as a phase transition brought about by a change in the relationship between two sets of expectations. I associate this change with a wave of belief reversals and describe how it can be precipitated by self-fulfilling or self-defeating prophecies understood as a special type of reflexive prediction. In section four, concerning my second argument, I argue that the misconception Soros believes operates in the upswing of a boom-bust cycle is due to an inherent ambiguity associated with the nature of positive feedback processes that drive the boom. I place positive feedback processes on a spectrum from relatively predictable to highly unpredictable, and argue that economic agents fail to recognize situations at the latter end of the spectrum because they are biased toward understanding cause-and-effect processes in terms of relatively predictable negative feedback processes. In the “Boom-bust cycles and the nature of reflexive economic agents” section, I draw some general conclusions about what reflexivity contributes to our thinking about complex economic processes and about what this implies about the nature of reflexive economic agents.",3
1.0,1.0,Review of Evolutionary Political Economy,11 March 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43253-020-00002-7,Was Hyman Minsky a post-Keynesian economist?,May 2020,Marc Lavoie,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Hyman P. Minsky is certainly one of the best examples of a person whose work is at the intersection of the various fields covered by the European Association for Evolutionary Political Economy. An obvious link with Schumpeterian economics is that Joseph Schumpeter was himself one of his two doctoral dissertation supervisors at Harvard University. But going beyond this obvious link, which could have been erased by a change of direction in Minsky’s views, a number of authors have shown the similar visions of Minsky and Schumpeter, with both seeing capitalism as an evolutionary process, associated with disequilibria rather than equilibrium, and with bank credit playing a fundamental role (Ülgen 2014). According to O’Hara (2007), Minsky’s work, notably his financial instability hypothesis, sometimes also called the financial fragility hypothesis, is a major source of convergence among heterodox economists and is at the heart of what he calls Institutional-Evolutionary Political Economy. Minsky has also attracted the attention of Marxian or Radical economists. Minsky’s claim, that financial crises are unavoidable although it may take a long time for the crisis to occur, with stability hiding destabilizing processes, reminds these economists of Marx’s dialectics or of the tendency of the falling rate of profit and its inevitable, but difficult to predict, real economy crisis (Dymski and Pollin 1992). Institutionalists can also maintain that Minsky is one of their own, since he has paid so much attention to the organizational workings of banks and other financial institutions, as well as the historical evolution of the financial system and its innovations, at a time where most of his colleagues were getting mostly concerned with formalization. Mehrling (1999, p. 129) affirms that Minsky “represents a continuation of the American institutionalist tradition of monetary thought.” Indeed, those who have worked with Minsky, such as Whalen (2013), argue that he is the best representative of what he calls the post-Keynesian institutionalist school of economic thought. Indeed, Randall Wray in another paper of this issue develops the ties between Minsky and institutionalism, not forgetting that Minsky received the 1996 Veblen-Commons award from the Association for Evolutionary Economics. Finally, most scholars would claim that Minsky was a key contributor to post-Keynesian economics at large, although as we shall see, some colleagues seem to disagree. All those that have worked on the writings of Minsky, who have been his students, or who were colleagues of Minsky, especially at the Levy Economics Institute, can certainly feel some pride in having been associated with him in one way or another. With the overnight market crisis of the summer of 2007 and the fall of Lehman Brothers on the 15th of September 2008, Hyman Minsky suddenly became an important figure in the Wall Street Pantheon of important economists, so much so that Wall Street spoke of the “Minsky Moment” when the prices of financial assets fell through the floor, as banks and financial investors were desperately trying to access liquidity (Whalen 2008). Minsky’s out-of-print 1986 book, Stabilizing an Unstable Economy, sold for hundreds of dollars on the internet, until it was reprinted. Recently The Economist (2016) considered that Minsky’s hypothesis, according to which “booms sow the seeds of busts,” was among the few seminal ideas in economics. Mainstream economists also started to read Minsky’s works, or to cite him, as was the case of Paul Krugman. A quick look at Google Scholar reveals that Minsky’s (1986a) book has collected over 6500 citations, twice as many as Minsky’s (1975) John Maynard Keynes, which I consider to be Minsky’s best book. However, this was not always so. Fazzari (1999), a long-time colleague of Minsky at Washington University in St. Louis, reported that the Web of Science Social Science citation index reveals that there were only 11 mentions of Minsky’s work in the then new mainstream literature on investment and finance between 1989 and 1997, four of which arose from Fazzari himself. It must be acknowledged however that in the 1980s and early 1990s, mainstream authors such as Ben Bernanke, Mark Gertler, Glenn Hubbard, Barry Eichengreen, Larry Summers, Paul Samuelson, and especially Benjamin Friedman did refer to Minsky when dealing with questions related to potential financial crises. Furthermore, it should be noted that Minsky was an active participant in some conferences of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), the Brookings Institute, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and that in addition he wrote papers for the Senate Commission on Credit and Banking and for the Joint Economic Committee. And I personally witnessed Minsky making a presentation at the Canadian Economic Council. Thus, while we may have felt that Minsky’s warnings about the rising financial fragility were a voice crying in the wilderness, he was indeed heard, but not listened to for decades. My ambition in this paper is to show that while Minsky is an unavoidable reference for all those who associate themselves with a political economy approach, from the standpoint of contemporary post-Keynesian economics there are some weaknesses in his works. These must be recognized, in the hope that newcomers to heterodox or post-Keynesian economics will avoid these oversights rather than repeat them. What I intend to do in the next section of the paper is to briefly recall the main features of what I call the bright side of Minsky’s approach. In the third section, I will present what I believe to be the limitations of some of Minsky’s works; this section will be longer than the previous one, as these flaws are not well recognized. Finally, in the fourth section, I will deal with the question that corresponds to the title of the paper: I will discuss whether Minsky is or is not a heterodox economist, or more specifically whether he is a post-Keynesian author. As surprising as it may seem, some colleagues—Paul Davidson, David Colander, Ric Holt, and Barkley Rosser, Jr—have argued that Minsky is not really part of the post-Keynesian school. The paper will conclude with an important lesson drawn from Minsky’s warnings.",5
1.0,1.0,Review of Evolutionary Political Economy,06 May 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43253-020-00007-2,A value-theoretic approach to economic dynamics and evolution—synthesizing different Marxian modules in a simulation model,May 2020,Frank Beckenbach,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The modern discourse in economics is (more than ever) about figuring out and applying model constructions. The purpose of these constructions is mainly to give orientation for discussions within the science of economics, and their role for empirical research is only of secondary importance (if it exists at all). Selecting mathematical methods and attributing economic semantics to the model elements are the essential features of these constructions. This discourse—and the specific way to use specific mathematical models—is part of the scientific procedures by which a mainstream economics is established and fostered. These procedures include defining standards of professionality, establishing criteria for selecting articles to be published in scientific journals and building scientific reputation based on citation frequency (cf. Fourcade 2009; Beckenbach 2019). This construction-based discourse of mainstream economics has spillover effects for the heterodox (non-mainstream) traditions of economics. Broadly considered, two such effects can be specified: firstly, a clarification effect that occurs through the application of mainstream tools as a source of new insights and, related to that, as a means of obtaining an updated assessment of the strength and weakness of the concepts or theories at stake; secondly, a castration effect that occurs through the elimination of elements not appropriate for such a model imposition—which are in most cases precisely those elements that are critical of the mainstream foundation. Not surprisingly, this kind of spillover can be observed also for the Marxist tradition in economics. It consists of reinterpreting Marx’s economic writings from the perspective of modern general equilibrium analysis by referring to the following model components: (i) the simultaneous production of goods by goods, (ii) fixed technologies and input/output coefficients, (iii) constant returns to scale, (iv) convex production sets or cones, (v) equilibrium in terms of quantities and income distribution, (vi) multiple alternatives/dual optimization under constraints and finally (vii) balanced growth. In each of these components, a specific combination of mathematical tools (such as equations and inequalities, linear (matrix-)algebra, eigenvalues, saddle points/fix points and convex sets) and economic semantics (technology, commodities, price, profit, interest and the like) has been determined in an almost undisputed fashion. Originating mainly in the works of von Neumann (1945/6), Debreu (1959) and Leontief (1941) and (partly) synthesized by Sraffa (1960),Footnote 1 these elements have been (in different combinations) applied in reinterpreting Marx’s economic writings (e.g. by Steedman (1977), Morishima (1973) and Roemer (1981, 1982)). This is not the place to summarise and assess all these applications and their repercussions, but it seems obvious that the clarification effect (as mentioned above) generated by these applications has made the status of the labour theory of value increasingly ambiguous. If considered as a theory about labour ‘embodied’ in commodities, it seems to run into difficulties of (at least partial) self-contradiction and should be abandoned or reformulated as a theoretical construct. But—according to the process sketched above—this is accompanied by a dubious castration effect consisting in suggestions to abandon value theory as such and to substitute it by selectively combining the above model components (i)–(vii). This is tantamount to getting rid of the main features of value theory, i.e. explaining precarious social interaction, money, social exploitation, accumulation, out-of-equilibrium reproduction and contested allocation as historically specific forms of capitalism. The following elaboration tries to escape from this trap. This necessitates going back to the Marxian conceptualization of these topics and assessing the role of the reference to (labour) values in this analysis. An advantageous background for conducting such an assessment has been provided by the publication of Marx’s ‘late’ economic manuscripts, which has now been completed (cf. MEGA II). This undercuts the reading of Engels’ publication of Marx’s manuscripts as ‘volume II’ and ‘volume III’ of ‘Das Kapital’ as being a more or less consistent whole.Footnote 2 Rather, it is now clear that the Engels’ edition is a very selective compilation from different stages of Marx’s research process.Footnote 3 Taking this into account, however, does not properly lead to the conclusion that Marx’s late economic writings are simply an unstructured intellectual quarry or a mere assembly of self-doubts that can be employed by the opponents of Marx’s approach as an easy opportunity for self-assured confirmation for their own projections (cf. e.g. Kurz 2018)—the origin of which was exactly the inappropriate reading suggested by the Engels’ edition. Rather, this new situation begs the question how Marx’s broad concept (firstly resumed in the ‘Grundrisse’, cf. MEGA II/1.1–1.2) has been differentiated into various parts and how these parts are linked together to form a whole in the later manuscripts.Footnote 4 According to this question, three propositions come to mind when looking at the totality of Marx’s late economic manuscripts: Marx’s research process manifests an increasing tension between two basic concepts for linking the various parts: on the one hand, the (Ricardian) idea of labour as an overarching denominator of all social activities and on the other hand, the (Hegelian) unfolding of social forms. In other words, in Marx’s later studies, it becomes increasingly difficult to subsume social forms under the dictum of embodied labour.Footnote 5 The circular nature of Marx’s research process is the reason why most parts of the manuscript devoted to the capitalist process as a whole have been written earlier than the published volume I of ‘Das Kapital’Footnote 6 and also earlier than most of the manuscripts dedicated to the circulation process of capital. Especially as regards the specified requirements for the reproduction and circulation of capital as a whole, it seems reasonable to postulate a need to update the older manuscript about the capitalist process as a whole (‘Gesamtprozess des Kapitals’) by incorporating these new insights about the circulation process. Looking at the concept as a whole, it seems obvious that Marx’s method of presentation (‘Darstellungsweise’) includes a recursive notion of value: its substance as well as its form is specified successively. Hence, there is no reason for an abstract and unchanged understanding of what value means. Accordingly, this kind of presentation has a multi-level property in that the same economic contexts are analysed at different levels of abstraction (e.g. simple and capitalist mode of circulation) (‘Zirkellauf der Darstellung’). Based on these propositions derived from the MEGA edition, an attempt is made in the following elaboration to specify the value concept without referring to the Ricardian notion of labour (embodied) as a more or less constant substance of value (Section 2) and to interpret the various modules of Marx’s analysis as a recursive unfolding of a value-theoretic treatment of the core features of capitalism (Section 3). Finally, these modules are synthesized in a conceptual model (Section 4). Part II of the article will present simulation experiments with the suggested model and draw some conclusions.",

It is crucial because, without its proper consideration, it becomes too easy for political economy to degenerate into one of two extremes. At one of these extremes is what may be called the reductionist position, according to which, it is sufficient for analysts to observe a small number of key variables, say, the aggregate share of wages in national income and the rate of profit, to be able to determine the remaining characteristics of an economy at any given point in time, or in any given period, as it is sufficient for policy-makers to seek control over simple variables. At the other extreme are those theorists who never cease being amazed at the novelties that capitalism throws to their attention, and for whom therefore, those novelties provide an endless well of inspiration for theoretical innovation, without criteria to distinguish the dubious and superficial from genuine theoretical insights. The rapid pace of monetary and financial innovation that arises as credit markets adapt to the shifting liquidity of long-term financial obligations, for example with securitisation, provides just such a series of institutional novelties among which serious analysis requires distinction between what is ephemeral and superficial, and what is driving changes in the dynamics of the system. Such changes too may require new policy instruments. The need to distinguish between different stages of capitalist development is shown up in the recent literature on financialisation, in which a close analysis of debt structures is replaced by undeveloped conjectures about how finance works. The study of financialisation is supposed to provide insight into the operations of finance in a market capitalist economy. The methodological foundation of such a study has to be discrimination between processes and the appearances to which those processes give rise. Furthermore, the distinction between processes and appearances goes beyond the old modelling distinction between exogenous and endogenous variables, since such variables are statistical data that are themselves the outcomes of underlying processes. Distinguishing between processes and appearances also takes us beyond notions of general equilibrium, not just because this is usually conceived in economic theory as a relationship between data that are appearances, but also because the concept of equilibrium presupposes the extinction of processes. The dynamic processes described, for example, in dynamic stochastic general equilibrium, or even in equilibrium business cycle models, are merely transitory, driven towards the elimination of those processes in a static equilibrium. On a historical scale, this was the basis of Veblen’s criticism of the teleology in Marx’s analysis of successive modes of production until the arrival of Communism (Veblen 1906). This paper argues that a financial cycle is the key process in understanding financialisation and at times a key process in economic activity in general. This is further explained in the section that follows. However, the financial cycle changes in different phases of capitalism associated with different financing structures. A second section puts forward a periodization of capitalism according to the financing of capitalist enterprise and the financial cycle of particular periods. A final section draws conclusions for theories of financialisation, financial macroeconomics, and policy. The paper does not take specific issue with the literature on financialisation that by now is so rich and idiosyncratic as to defy summary.Footnote 1 Two works, however, illustrate the distinctive evolutionary and methodological approach in this paper, namely Karwowski et al. (2019) and Duménil and Lévy (2011). The first of these exemplifies the strengths and weaknesses of the financialisation literature in its systematic analysis of statistical data that does not go into the processes of which this data are outcomes. Duménil and Lévy, by contrast, represent a reductionist approach in which financial outcomes in all stages of capitalist development are due ultimately to changes in an aggregate rate of profit, to which finance is ultimately subordinated. Here again, the key variables are represented by data without consideration of the processes that give rise to this data, or even the difficult question of how an aggregate rate of profit emerges in historic time from the heterogeneous activity of firms. This paper is concerned with the periodization of capitalism as a system of production and distribution. Accordingly, the financial processes that are considered here are the processes connected with the financing of capitalist enterprise. The paper does not discuss the financing of the state although, as will be argued in the section that follows, this is a crucial aspect of capitalist financing in the present phase. The financing of sovereigns and their wars was an important activity of banking centres in pre-capitalist times, and a factor in the decline and fall of those centres. However, even in those times, such financing of the state was always conducted alongside the financing of the nascent capitalism that was emerging. Nor does the paper consider the financing of private households, although this has featured greatly in virtually all the discussions and commentaries on the 2008 financial crisis and financialisation in general. In the view of the present author, most financing of the household sector involve purchases of residential property. This involves transfers between households: Household A buys a house from household B with a mortgage from a bank. Household A is now indebted and makes repayments with interest to the bank that provided its mortgage. However, household B now has the credit counterpart of that debt as a deposit in their bank account and receives interest from their bank. Even in the case of consumer debt on the purchase of new housing, most of the payment goes as an indirect transfer to the workers producing the consumer goods or new housing purchased. The process may accelerate the creation and circulation of money in the household sector. But if the money transfers are netted out, the effects beyond this redistribution of income in the household sector are negligible. However, the financing of capitalist enterprise is economically much more important because in a capitalist economy, that enterprise determines the dynamics of the system to a much greater degree than the economic activities of governments and households, although mainstream economics would have us believe that households make the essential saving and consumption decisions that are supposed to decide the growth characteristics of a market economy.Footnote 2 In particular, corporate debt is a key factor in the business cycle through its impact on business investment which, in industrial capitalism, is the major determinant of production and employment. The financial process that matters for business activity and capitalist dynamics therefore reveals itself through the balance sheets of capitalist enterprise. These balance sheets show on their assets side the means by which the future income of the firm will be obtained, through the plant, machinery, stocks of finished and unfinished goods and raw materials, and financial assets at the disposal of the firm. The liabilities’ side shows the financing of those assets through equity and debt. As Minsky pointed out, these are sets of dated future income and payment commitments (Minsky 1986, pp. 69–70). They may therefore be short-term payment commitments, in the case of short-term bank borrowing or bills of exchange, for example, or longer-term commitments, such as bonds or shares. Assets too may be short-term: such as stocks of finished goods or raw materials that are sometimes referred to as circulating capital, because they are rapidly turned over, or bank deposits. Factory or retail premises and capital machinery are longer-term assets. The financial process arises out of the financing of the assets by the financing that appears on the liabilities’ side of the balance sheet. In turn, the financial cycle is determined by the scale of that financing and how short- and long-term financing is combined with the acquisition of short- and long-term assets by capitalist enterprises. For Minsky, this gave rise to the particular financing structures that he classified as ‘hedge’, ‘speculative’, and ‘Ponzi’ structures, of which the latter became a crucial element of his financial instability hypothesis (Minsky 1986, appendix A). Towards the end of his life, he argued that American capitalism had gone through different stages of ‘Commercial capitalism’, followed by ‘industrial capitalism and wild-cat financing’, ‘financial capitalism and state financing’, then ‘paternalistic, managerial and welfare state capitalism’, which had now given way to ‘money manager capitalism’ (Minsky 1996). Minsky’s periodization was put forward in a paper that was broadly about that final stage of capitalist development. He had very little in that paper about previous stages, apart from his enthusiasm for Roosevelt’s New Deal in the ‘financial capitalism and state financing’ stage of capitalism. According to the paper, the key achievement of the New Deal was a ‘restructuring of capitalism which contained uncertainty’. The stages of capitalist development referred to American capitalism, rather than capitalism elsewhere, and did not discuss finance in any detail except in those latter stages. In particular, despite the crises in American stock markets in 1907 and 1929 (the latter had a very particular impact on Minsky’s thinking) that were formative for American financial institutions, notably the Federal Reserve Bank system, Minsky gave little weight to the importance of long-term finance and capital markets in capitalist enterprise. His remarks on American financing follow on from his financial instability theory which is essentially a banking analysis. Like Irving Fisher’s debt deflation theory that inspired him, Minsky’s financial crisis is about maturity transformation. It does not accommodate different kinds of maturity transformation, other than the one that banks perform in financing long-term assets with short-term liabilities. However, the medium through which the maturities of assets and liabilities are transformed, whether internalized on the balance sheets of firms or banks, or mediated through secondary markets, changes with the evolution of capitalism. The differences between the maturity of financing and that of assets, in turn, affect financial processes and the policies required for their stabilisation. This is further explored in the next section.",7
1.0,2.0,Review of Evolutionary Political Economy,26 June 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43253-020-00017-0,An evolutionary approach to international political economy: the case of corporate tax avoidance,August 2020,Ronen Peter Palan,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In Patterns of Discovery, the historian Norwood Hanson argues that theories are built in reverse, retroductively. ‘A theory is not pieced together from observed phenomena,’ he writes. ‘It is rather, what makes it possible to observe phenomena as being of a certain sort, and as related to other phenomena. Theories put phenomena into systems... A theory is a cluster of conclusions in search of a premise’ (Hanson 1958, 90). In retrospect, I recognise such patterns in the relationship between empirics and theory in my own studies of offshore finance, tax havens and corporate tax planning (Palan 2006; Palan et al. 2013). Following a long period of desk research, I have ended up in possession of a cluster of conclusions about the underlying political and legal dynamics that brought about a sprawling offshore world. These conclusions, or ‘answers’, in Hanson’s terminology, did not seat well with the theories that dominate my field of study, international political economy (IPE), rational institutionalism and Marxism. My quest for a theoretical framework that would reframe these answers as a coherent narrative led me in the direction of the work of Thorstein Veblen, John R. Commons and other members of a school of thought known as old institutional economics (OIE) or evolutionary economics.Footnote 1 In this article, I retrace the intellectual journey that pointed out for me the value of the OIE scholarship to contemporary IPE. Conventionally, taxation in general, and international business taxation more specifically, are understood as a classical public goods’ problem of free riding. While everyone benefits from the provision of political stability and good infrastructure provided by the fiscal state, the individual taxpayer has incentives to free ride by minimizing taxation (Kudrle 2017). When it comes to the taxation of international business, the state is in a particularly weak position because markets are increasingly integrated (the globalization thesis), whereas politics remains territorial (the state system). As a result, states find themselves, on the one hand, competing with one another for high value–added economic sectors and capital investment. They do so by offering state-of-the-art infrastructure support, including political stability and good education, health, legal and transport systems, ramping ramp up public goods provisions (known as the ‘competition state’ thesis). On the other hand, mobile capital plays one jurisdiction against the other by gaining subsidies and tax holidays. The situation is exacerbated because in the case of taxation, governments suffer from first-mover disadvantage: they lay out ‘precisely delineated rules, and then taxpayers are allowed to choose from this menu the transaction form most likely to reduce their tax bill’ (Schizer 1999, 1349). In the arms race between mobile capital and immobile state, there can be only one winner (Avi-Yonah 2019). Under such circumstances, the typical solution to the problem of free riding—treating all beneficiaries as one consumer and then dividing the cost equally or making public good private—cannot work because sovereign state divides the consumer. As a result, the battle against corporate tax avoidance has tended to focus on the inter-state collective action problems, with the view of reducing capital’s ability to play one against the other. Not much is wrong with the above explanation. Only that there is a rather subtle problem which rationalist theoretical frameworks seem to not be attentive to. If the above explanation captures well the core dynamics of international business taxation and tax avoidance in 2019, would such accounts have been equally valid, say, 50 years ago, in the year of 1969? What about 1919, 1819 or 1619? And what about 2069? Most would agree that the world was very different in 1619, in 1819 and perhaps even in 1919; and while the above account may capture certain trends observable already 50 years ago, it may be of limited use today. The account of dilemmas faced by states, regulators and the like are, in other words, time-specific. However, how does change come about? When and how does it affect the core dynamics of international business taxation? Does the change in the dynamics of international business taxation arise from forces that are entirely exogenous to business or not? These are the sort of questions that have been answered, and in my view, cannot be answered, within the bounds of theories that understand the dynamics of change in terms of interaction between fixed entities (the ‘state’, ‘corporation,’ ‘capital’, ‘rationality’, ‘actor’), but require instead, an evolutionary sensibility of the kind, I argue, provided by the OIE school. For presentation purposes, my retroductive reading of the dynamics of change in the offshore world is inverted. I begin by presenting my interpretation of Veblen and Commons’ ideas, centring in particular on those ideas and concepts that I found useful in my studies of the offshore world. I start, therefore, with a brief outline of those OIE ideas and concepts that proved useful, leading towards my interpretation of the core drivers of corporate tax avoidance in a globalised system of states.",4
1.0,2.0,Review of Evolutionary Political Economy,12 March 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43253-020-00006-3,Productivity and inequality in the UK: a political economy perspective,August 2020,Philip Arestis,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"We deal in this contribution with productivity and inequality from a political economy perspective, and from the point of view that emphasises the structure and power in an economic system. State intervention is an important dimension of this approach and of our contribution. This is mainly due to the behaviour of the private investment, which is attributed to volatile expectations and business confidence, its role to growth and cycles and its influence on the distribution of income and productivity. Since investment needs to be financed, financial markets and the creation of credit are also very important dimensions of this approach. In addition, wages and employment, monetary and financial aspects, and of course the role of the government and policy implications are further relevant and important dimensions.Footnote 1 Our focus is on the UK, where there has been a large and persistent fall in labour productivity and thereby increases in inequality. In the initial phase of the Great Recession (GR), between the first quarter of 2008 and the second quarter of 2009, real gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 6.3%. Employment by contrast fell by just 2.1%, significantly less than in previous recessions. As a result, the whole economy labour productivity (output per worker) fell by 4.3%Footnote 2. This produced a weaker productivity performance during the GR in 2008 and 2009 than in previous post-war recessions. The initial drop in productivity during a downturn is typically short-lived. In the previous two recessions, productivity began to rise again only after a few quarters and regained its peak level quite quickly as unemployment fell, while output began to recover (Patterson 2012, p. 13). In terms of the GR, the measured output per worker fell by 3.2% in absolute terms between 2008Q1 and 2012Q3. Almost 5 years after the start of the GR, labour productivity was 12.3% below its pre-recession trend (Disney et al. 2013). Moreover, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the productivity (output per hour) by the end of 2007 was 20% lower than the trend prior to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). Bryson and Forth (2015) show that labour productivity in the UK was 15–16 percentage points below its growth prior to the GFC. Also, there is a productivity gap of around 6 percentage points with respect to the rest of the G7 (see also Office for National Statistics 2015). Felstead et al. (2018) suggest, ‘The UK has a longstanding labour productivity gap with its international competitors. Following the 2008-2009 recession the situation worsened, with workers in France, Germany and the US producing on average as much in four days as UK workers do in five’ (see also Mason et al. 2018). Further examples, and in the case of the UK, are provided by Barnett et al. (2014). They investigate the ‘productivity puzzle’ between the GFC and 2012 to conclude that until 2011, there was a doubling of the proportion of firms with reduced output and flat employment (from 11% in 2005/2007 to 22% in 2011). In fact, it is suggested that between the GFC and 2012 labour productivity growth was 14% below the level of the pre-GFC trend growth rate. In terms of the falling labour productivity across firms of different sizes, it varied. It fell more sharply for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) than large firms; however, and by 2011, the productivity weakness became evenly distributed between SMEs and large firms. They also make the point that relative to 2007, in 2011, a greater proportion of firms had lower productivity. McCafferty (2018) reports that ‘on average since 2010, annual productivity growth has fallen to 0.5% (output per hour) or 0.7% (output per worker), down from the 2.2% (hour) and 1.8% (worker) of pre-crisis’ (p. 7). In fact, and as Haldane (2017, Table 1) shows for the past decade, the average productivity growth has been negative. This is very unusual, if not unique, historically. Such a lengthy period of stagnant productivity was only obvious back in the eighteenth century. Moreover, and as Haldane (2018) suggests in the case of UK productivity, ‘the problem is a big one by any historical standards’ (p. 2). It is also the case that the UK’s productivity performance is the worst among developed countries, which does not help growth (Financial Times, 11 July 2018). Interestingly enough, the UK Office of National Statistics (ONS) announced on the 6th of July 2018 (as reported in the Financial Times, 7, July 2018) that not many signs were there for productivity improvement. The Bank of England staff, however, saw ‘glimmers of hope on the horizon’ for productivity improvement (also reported in the Financial Times, op. cit.). The ONS also reported that productivity fell by 0.4% in the first quarter of 2018 and was only 0.9% higher than a year earlier. It should be noted, though, that the puzzle of weak productivity performance since the GFC is not confined to the UK. The UK experience is in line with that in several other European countries, although the present productivity weakness in the UK stands out more starkly (Patterson 2012, p. 16). In the US, productivity is by contrast strong (Patterson, op. cit.). In fact, and according to the ONS estimates, productivity over the period 2007–2016 was on average 18% higher in the other six members of the G7, 28% higher in the US and 35% higher in Germany than in the UK; and these gaps have been increasing since then (Tenreyro 2018, p. 5). Indeed, and as Haldane (2018) suggests, ‘the UK’s productivity slowdown appears to have been larger than in almost any other country’ (p. 2). However, the factors that explain productivity in other countries may not be the same as in the UK. Indeed, productivity and inequality ‘comparisons over time can depend on the measures used and specific time periods’ (Ravallion 2018, p. 628). This clearly suggests that careful analysis of individual countries’ labour productivity is essential. The question is what caused such a large and persistent fall in the UK labour productivity and in a number of other countries as well. Indeed, how could this ‘productivity puzzle’, and thereby inequality, be explained? In order to answer this question, we rely mainly on the UK experience in view of the large and persistent fall in labour productivity, and increase in inequality, as suggested above, but refer to other countries as necessary.",5

A number of innovation and political theorists (Mazzucato 2014, 2016; Perez 2016; Schot and Steinmueller 2016; Lundvall 2013; Block and Keller 2011) argue that never more than today, it is necessary to rethink the state’s entrepreneurial roleFootnote 1 in society and welfare. Their argument provides justification for the existence of the state not only as a set of institutions that guarantees social evolution through protection of markets but also as an entity capable of creation of markets in risky areas of knowledge and technology. This renewed defence of the state moves beyond classical political theory and especially contractarian theories of legitimacy and political obligation (Hobbes 1991; Locke 1960; Rousseau 1968). It emphasises the ability and willingness of the state to take risks and reduce uncertainty of economic agents for the sake of innovation that can make everyone better off. This paper insists that although the risk-taking argument of innovation theorists deserves further attention and analysis, it should not be abstracted from a holistic politico-theoretical approach to the state. Such an approach is necessary for a critical understanding of the complex set of predominantly political institutions which compose the state and more specifically, the democratic state that legitimises particular forms of risk-taking. Given that the authority of the democratic state (i.e. the power to shape discourses and behaviours) is derived from peopleFootnote 2 themselves (Hay and Lister 2006), any risk-taking for innovative enterprise and mission-oriented investment (Mazzucato and Pena 2015) ought to be justified and legitimised on the grounds of principled democratic procedures. This implies that mission-led innovation itself is a value-laden political process (Papaioannou and Srinivas 2018), requiring democratic participation of various publics in the decision-making and standards of fairness. Otherwise, it might lose legitimacy or become an instrument in the hands of an authoritarian state. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 explains the return of the state in innovation. Section 3 briefly revisits competing theories of the state. Section 4 discusses different forms of the entrepreneurial state and examines their legitimacy constraints. Section 5 focuses on mission-oriented innovation as a political process that has to address the question of fairness through social redistributive policies. Section 6 analyses the new role of the state in socially just innovation. Section 7 concludes by summarising the overall argument of the paper.",3
1.0,2.0,Review of Evolutionary Political Economy,08 May 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43253-020-00008-1,A value-theoretic approach to economic dynamics and evolution—synthesizing different Marxian modules in a simulation model,August 2020,Frank Beckenbach,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The emphasis of this analysis is generally on the development of the structural terms, i.e. relations of magnitudes rather than the magnitudes themselves. This not only is a consequence of the arbitrariness of the numerical calibration but also reflects insights from the literature on capitalist development, which reveal that the structural terms are in fact the main explanatory factors. Nevertheless, numerical calibrations and simulations are necessary for demonstrating the role of the structural terms (such as organic composition of capital, rate of surplus value and rate of profit) in the course of time. Hence, in the different simulation runs, the dynamic interdependence between the value-theoretic elements characterizing the different Marxian modules will be explained. These interdependencies are not wholly accessible by means of a (textual) conceptual analysis, which is implicitly confined either to a static assessment or to a rough and incomplete portrayal of the dynamic relations between the variables at stake. For all levels under consideration—production process, circulation and reproduction as well as the process as a whole—the model is not closed, i.e. there are elements that are relevant which are not explained by the model itself. The reasons for this openness are either pragmatic (avoiding over-complexity) or methodological (influence of historical contingencies). These elements are depicted as parameters; their influence is checked by sensitivity analysis. Regarding the mathematical basis (cf. part I, Section 4.2), the following parameters are relevant: For the production process: the rate of growth for the available labour population (δ), the power of wage labour (α), the factor for the surplus value dynamics (γ), the influence of the power of wage labour on the accumulation (β) and finally the incentive for safeguarding a ‘reserve army’ of wage labour (ρ) For the process of circulation and reproduction: the threshold for departmental disproportion triggering stagnation (λ1), the shrinking factor in case of a stagnation (λ2), the impact of circulation costs (λ3) and the costs of additional money (φ) For the process as a whole: the degree of departmental competition (ξ)Footnote 1 Some of these parameters can be calibrated and combined in such a way that the interdependencies of the capitalist core process exhibit features that narrow the gap between abstract analysis and observable varieties of capitalism. Hence, a self-evident access to specify ‘regime’ or ‘modes’ of the interacting core variables is given. The basis for the simulation runs is a standard configuration of these parameters depicting a rather smooth regime of accumulation in that the level of social conflict is moderate, and the frictions for reproduction and allocation are low (moderation regime; cf. section 2). The sensitivity analysis for the main parameters in such a configuration is the background for distinguishing other regimes on an exemplary basis and for analysing their outcomes: the social conflict regime (cf. section 3) and the crisis regime being differentiated according to the different types of crisis (cf. section 4). The numerical specification of the parameters in these regimes is summarized in Table 1.Footnote 2",

These events signalled a comparatively early start to the Australian ‘bushfire season’ which quickly became one of the most destructive as fires around the country burnt unremittingly until March 2020.Footnote 3 The states and territories of Australia Month-by-month the breakout of bushfires and their incessant burning continued unabated. In September, the north coast of NSW ignited and multiple out-of-control bushfires started in south-eastern, northern, and coastal Queensland. In October, the region south-west of NSW’s capital city, Sydney, and Gospers Mountain (about 300 km north-west of Sydney) ignited. The latter would become the epicentre of the biggest Australian bushfire starting from a single ignition point. The island state of Tasmania started burning too in October. In November, bushfires broke out near Geraldton, a coastal town about 400 km north of Perth, the capital city of the state of Western Australia. In the same month, a series of bushfires ignited east of the Victorian capital city of Melbourne and by year end had spread to the coastal town of Mallacoota, 40 km south of the border with NSW. Also, in November, bushfires started in the state of South Australia around towns located on peninsulas that abut the Great Australian Bight. In December, more bushfires broke out across NSW, Queensland, South Australia (including the emblematic tourist destination and unique wildlife home of Kangaroo Island), Tasmania, and Western Australia. In the same month, the NSW Gospers Mountain fire ‘jumped’ roads and rivers, and joined fires in the World Heritage listed Blue Mountains which are about 65 km from Sydney’s CBD. In early January 2020, bushfires broke out in the ACT circling the national capital of Canberra. Australia was on fire like never before. As the scale of the bushfires deepened, containment was elusive. Tens of thousands of volunteer firefighters, forsaking wages, risked their lives. Grief-stricken wildfire carers were unable to save many rescued animals. Telecommunications networks started to fail. Water supply systems were threatened with bushfire silt and ash. The Prime Minister took an untimely holiday which the public generally deplored. Airlines cancelled flights as the dense black smoke threatened landings. Summer holidays and Christmas–New Year celebrations were also cancelled. Thousands of people on holidays were evacuated from coastal towns.Footnote 4 The national broadcaster—the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC)—suspended radio programmes to present updates on ‘fire danger ratings’, leave zones, air quality/asthma alerts, weather forecasts, travel warnings, evacuation centre locations, and the status of the fire front across the nation. State Government Premiers declared ‘states of emergency or disaster’. Grim media pictures emerged of exhausted firefighters, traumatised citizens, burnt animals seeking refuge, and the charred ashes of homes, buildings, historical sites, vehicles and equipment. Several countries offered to assist. The Australian Defence Forces were mobilised. The Prime Minister proposed a national inquiry (Australian Government 2020a). Satellite imagery showed a torched, scarred Australia. Magpies—an Australian native songbird—mimicked emergency vehicles having heard so many. The central bank—the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)—announced that fire-destroyed banknotes would be redeemed (RBA 2020). The Lancet published an article about the serious health impact of the bushfires (Yu et al. 2020). Google searches on Australian ‘fires by me’ eclipsed the 2018 English royal wedding and the 2016 US presidential election (Beavis 2020). Payday loan companies circled bushfire victims. Social media went into overdrive as people sought to contact family members and friends, and inform fellow citizens of their plight. Stories of heroic acts filtered into the national consciousness. Day-after-day, ordinary Australians prepared or distributed food and water to firefighters, comforted strangers, and opened their homes to those who had lost theirs. Charities, overwhelmed with donations of clothing, toys, bedding, and other household items, pleaded for monetary donations instead. The iconic Sydney Opera House illuminated its ‘sails’—in support of the communities impacted, the emergency services and volunteer firefighters—and hosted a fundraiser for affected communities. The Australian bushfires were a touchstone for presenters and winners at the January 2020 self-absorbed Hollywood Golden Globes awards ceremony. A stampede of international celebrities, sports stars and companies ‘fell over themselves’ to lead donation pledges of around $A500 million for bushfire victims and the emergency services, the biggest fundraiser in response to an Australian disaster.Footnote 5 The British naturalist David Attenborough referred to the 2019–2020 Australian bushfires as ‘the moment of crisis’ for the world to no longer prevaricate on addressing climate change (Shukman 2020). Paul Krugman (2020) contended that this ‘unusually photogenic disaster’ was showing the ‘road to hell’. I do not deny the criticality of climate change and the urgency of action needed. Climate change does not, however, create bushfires but it can, and does, make them worse. Nevertheless, statements invoking climate change as the cause, seek—consciously or not—to delimit the focus of discourse about the recent bushfires to the single issue of ‘climate change’ and thus a more abstract realm devoid of the social dimensions which have been outlined above. I posit that the causes, management, and consequences of these catastrophic bushfires are embedded in a much more complex story of social reality and governing: a story of multiple dimensions reflected in a conjunction of cumulative events (including climate change) and (in)actions of nation and local states and institutions. To present my argument, this article is structured as follows. The following discussion in this introductory section outlines some germane aspects about Australia (the system of government, land mass, climate patterns, bushfire history, and role of volunteer firefighters) to establish context for the ensuing discussion, before presenting an overview of the scale, dimensions, and impacts of the 2019–2020 bushfires. Deploying a content analysis of government documents, media articles and other published materials, Section 2g discusses the ‘problem representation’ of these bushfires which is found to have transitioned through three forms in the official narrative: from a ‘natural disaster’ to ‘insufficient hazard reduction and bushfire preparedness’ to ‘the need for national emergency powers’. It is also found the posited solution morphed from ‘usual arrangements’ to ‘better hazard reduction’ and then became one of ‘constitutional change’. Section 3, underpinned by further content analysis, focuses on the key events, (in)actions, and institutions contributing to the scale and catastrophic impact of these bushfires. These include climate change, governing through disaster and land management practices, and disregard for indigenous fire practices. Section 4 concludes that the causes, scale, duration, and consequences of the bushfires reflect a complex potent conjunction of factors and issues which were years in the making. Australia has a federal system of government. Powers are divided, by the Australian Constitution, between the federal (national) government and the governments of six states and two territories. The national government has responsibility for inter alia defence, taxation, foreign affairs, and postal and telecommunication services. The state governments have more extensive responsibilities for matters that occur within their respective borders such as law and order (police), health services (hospitals), education, public transport, utilities (e.g. water and electricity provision), and disasters. The land mass of Australia is 7.8 million square kilometres (km2) compared with 9.6 million km2 for China and 9.8 million km2 for the US. More than 85% of the Australian population is concentrated along the eastern seaboard states of NSW and Queensland and in the south-eastern states of Victoria and South Australia (refer Fig. 1). Despite weather pattern variations across a vast land mass, the Australian climate is generally hot, dry, and drought prone. A severe drought has occurred, since the 1860s, on average, every 20 years or so, although the frequency and duration has increased since the 1990s (Anderson 2014). After the 1996–2010 drought, which impacted most of southern and eastern Australia, these same states of NSW, Queensland, Victoria, and Tasmania—a significant proportion of Australia’s land mass encompassing much agriculture (refer Fig. 1)—experienced prolonged, severe drought from 2016 until the first few months of 2020. Drought is generally defined, and measured, in terms of rainfall deficiency.Footnote 6 The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) declared 2019 as Australia’s driest year on record. The nation’s total rainfall in 2019 was 12% below that in the previous driest year in 1902 and 40% below the average (Australian Government 2020b). Most parts of Australia experienced well below average rainfall during the year, and year-end was exceptionally dry. The year 2019 was also Australia’s warmest year on record. The average temperature was 1.52 °C above the average, well above the previous record of + 1.33 °C in 2013, and outstripping the global average increase in 2019 of less than 1 °C (ibid). Maximum temperatures recorded even higher increases, 10 months were the warmest on record, and the nation had its six hottest days, hottest week, and hottest month.Footnote 7 This confluence of low rainfall and record high temperatures was, according to the BOM (ibid), driven by sea surface temperatures in the Indian and Pacific oceans and the north-south westerly wind belt that circles Antarctica.Footnote 8 Changes in Indian Ocean surface temperatures impact Australian winter and spring rains. Warmer waters off northwest Australia generate winds that harvest ocean moisture before sweeping down towards southern Australia to deliver above-average rainfall; cooler northwest waters have weaker winds picking up much less moisture and deliver well below-average rainfall. Since mid-2016, sufficient cooler northwest waters have not occurred to create the conditions for persistent and widespread rainfall. The Pacific Ocean’s surface temperature influences eastern Australia’s climate. Substantially warmer temperatures cause a shift in the equatorial trade winds and rainfall from northern Australia to the Pacific Ocean (an El Niño) causing drier weather. Cooler sea surface temperatures result in above average rainfall over much of Australia (a La Niña). These latter conditions were strong during 2010–2012 and led to some of Australia’s largest floods. During 2019, however, the ‘oscillation’ of these weather conditions was neutral. The ‘usual’ Australian seasonal pattern of westerly winds moving south during summer (bringing dry weather and pushing wet conditions to the north), and the reverse in winter (wet to the south and dry to the north), can be disrupted when—compared with the usual—these winds contract further towards the Antarctica or move much further north toward the equator. In recent years, during autumn–winter, these winds have contracted more than usual towards the Antarctica bringing drier conditions to southern Australia. Weaker winds from the Indian Ocean, delivering well below-average rainfall, have been found to be of more significance to south-east Australia rainfall patterns than El Niño conditions and to coincide with every major southern Australian drought from 1889 to 2009 (Ummenhofer et al. 2009). These ‘weaker winds’ have also been found to precede, since 1950, significant bushfires in southern Australia, and the frequency of extreme ‘weaker winds’ has increased as average temperatures have risen (Cai et al. 2009, 2018). Australia has a long history of bushfires given the high susceptibility of many parts of the land mass. Bushfires depend upon the source of ignition which may be lightning (the predominant cause) or human activity (accidental or deliberate), the composition of fuel load such as fallen tree branches, leaves and bark, and the amount of oxygen (Australian Government 2020d). Bushfire intensity and speed will depend on the concentration of fuel load and its moisture, wind speed, ambient temperature, and landscape slope (fires accelerate uphill). A ‘forest fire index’ (FFDI)—a measure of fire weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and dryness—is regularly forecast by the BOM, to assess the risk of bushfires across the Australian continent. A study of FFDI data, from 1950 to 2016, found ‘a clear trend toward more dangerous conditions during spring and summer in southern Australia, including increased frequency and magnitude of extremes’ (Dowdy 2017: 221). The 2019 national index was the highest since 1950 when records began. The destructiveness of Australian bushfires is generally measured in terms of fatalities, homes destroyed, and the area of land burnt. The 2019–2020 bushfires count as one of Australia’s eleven most destructive fires since the 1850s. Historically, only five other bushfires have caused greater fatalities, and only one has burnt a larger land area—1974–1975 in remote uninhabited central Australia (Richards et al. 2020). The 2019–2020 bushfires took 7 months to contain or extinguish and occurred across every Australian state and territory. These bushfires were so large and intense they spawned their own weather systems—firestorms—exacerbating the situation with swirling winds carrying embers over huge distances and producing dry lightning, sparking new fires which then coalesced (NASA 2020a). Fire and disaster management are the constitutional responsibility of the respective state and territory governments. Each state and territory has volunteer and paid firefighters; paid firefighters cover the metropolitan areas, and fire protection everywhere else is volunteer-based. More than 195,000 Australians are volunteer firefighters (about 4.5% of the rural population). The most populous state of NSW has the world’s largest number of volunteer firefighters (about 72,000) who cover about 95% of that state’s land mass. Due to the size of the land mass and propensity for bushfires, Australia relies on volunteer firefighters to an extent unparalleled elsewhere (Cull 2020). Historically, Australia’s bushfire fighting services evolved from small groups of landholders banding together in community-based brigades to fight a common threat. Over time, these brigades become relatively more connected as governments sought to standardise equipment and training. Although primarily funded through levies, it was not until post-Second World War that each state and territory government established a specific agency to coordinate the functioning and operation of the volunteer brigades. Over 17 million hectares were burnt according to the Australasian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council (Richards et al. 2020).Footnote 9 The Australian Government (2020f) more conservatively estimates a burnt area of over 12 million hectares.Footnote 10 To put these estimates in perspective, the size of South Korea is around 10 million hectares; Scotland and Wales combined are 9.9 million hectares; around 7 million hectares of the ‘Earth’s lungs’, the Brazilian Amazon, were burnt in 2019; and, in the same year, the Siberian fires affected about 2.6 million hectares and the Californian fires covered a little more than 105,000 ha (NASA 2020b). The scale of the 2019–2020 Australian bushfires, according to all estimates, was well in excess of recent major world fire events. By early January 2020, after months of burning, smoke from the 2019–2020 Australian bushfires had reached nearly 18 km above sea level, had crossed the Pacific Ocean and South America, and was predicted by NASA (2020c) to complete a circuit of the earth before returning to Australian skies. According to the United Nations World Meteorological Organisation (2020), the smoke plume from the fires was around 525 million hectares in size, and the equivalent size of the 11 largest states of the US. Within 4 months, these bushfires emitted an estimated 278 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, equivalent to more than half of Australia’s 2018–2019 total emissions (Global Fire Emissions Database 2020).Footnote 11 By late February 2020, the estimated emissions from these bushfires had escalated to more than 434 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service 2020). National parks and reserves, World Heritage–listed rainforests and mountain ranges, timber plantations, coastal regions, rural villages and towns, and farms were burnt. The capital cities, and major metropolitan centres, of each Australian state and territory were engulfed in orange haze and fine black dust for months. Thousands of people were evacuated from their homes. Major highways and transport routes became impassable across the continent leading to isolated communities, some of which were stranded on beaches for days without provisions, shelter, or contact with emergency services. Thirty-three people—including nine firefighters—died, 3000 homes and more than 7000 facilities and buildings were destroyed, 80,000 head of livestock were lost, and over a billion animals (koalas, kangaroos, platypuses, emus, wombats, lizards, and more)—species unique to Australia—perished (Australian Government 2020f; RMIT ABC 2020).Footnote 12 There was widespread population exposure to the bushfires. More than 14% (2.9 million) of adults were directly exposed and 78% of adults indirectly exposed (e.g. friend or family member property damage or threatened, smoke exposure, travel/holiday plans affected). Over 57% (11 million) of adults were physically affected by the bushfire smoke. A similar population proportion was worried or anxious about safety for themselves, family, and friends reflecting the widespread impact of the bushfires (Biddle et al. 2020). Nearly 450 people died from bushfire smoke effects, over 3000 people were admitted to hospitals for respiratory issues, and 1700 accessed hospital services for asthma.Footnote 13 The tangible cost of these bushfires—including national and state government relief programmes, lost income from farm production, tourism and fisheries, and replacement costs for destroyed buildings, contents and vehicles—has been estimated at over $A100 billion. The intangible costs for social costs like unemployment, suicide, domestic violence, and relationship breakdowns are considered to be higher at around $A130 billion (Read and Dennis 2020). These costs dwarf the $A7 billion estimated tangible and intangible costs from Australia’s deadliest fire, the 2009 Black Saturday fires in the state of Victoria, which burnt 430,000 ha and killed 173 people.",9

Foley,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"While philosophical speculation on the design of social, economic, and political institutions goes back at least to Plato (and perhaps further to Hammurabi), I will start this discussion at the end of the eighteenth century, in the radical and romantic response to the French Revolution. The nascent Industrial Revolution, the eclipse if not the collapse, of the religious monopoly over discussion of the social and political “good,” the enormous energies of mass politics unleashed by the bourgeois revolutions, and Enlightenment theories of political economy and political theory prompted a surge of radical criticism of existing social institutions and speculation on their future evolution. An important and persistent strain in this revolutionary discourse viewed the demonstrated (though not yet fully exploited) increases in productive power unleashed by the Industrial Revolution as offering for the first time in human history the possibility of creating a human society freed from material poverty and even scarcity of basic goods. “Perfectibilists” such as William Godwin (see Foley2006, ch 2) argued for a rational reconstruction of social institutions to realize these possibilities, engendering an intellectual reaction from figures such as Thomas Malthus, who proposed to demonstrate “mathematically” that population growth would doom such projects. “Really existing” capitalism proved quite capable of achieving enormous increases in social productive powers, but fickle in the distribution of the resulting gains. Industrial entrepreneurs accumulated fortunes, a growing “middle class” representing a significant minority of the population found niches that provided a degree of security and comfort in the exploding division of labor, but by and large productive workers found themselves subject to fierce competition for jobs that sharply limited their economic gains. These disparities were dramatic enough in the few parts of the world experiencing industrialization to interest many, particularly of the middle classes, in projects for a more rational and egalitarian organization of social production and income distribution. “Radical” movements demanding political reform of corrupt national systems, the universal extension of civil and political rights, free trade, republican forms of national political organization, and the like achieved major gains in countries like France and England. On the fringe of this basically bourgeois democratic radicalism appeared a flowering of theoretical writing on the possibility of reorganizing the industrial division of labor on “socialist” principles of rational allocation and egalitarian distribution. In the same period, there were numerous small-scaled “experiments” in the form of local communities seeking to organize industrial production in alternative ways. The history of these experimental communities, some of which lasted quite a long time, is an instructive lesson in the power of capitalist social organization to encapsulate and absorb economically deviant behavior. Neither the theoretical nor the experimental side of this socialism achieved much headway compared with the awesome force of capitalist accumulation in fostering proletarianization, urbanization, and globalization in line with its own logic of the pursuit of profit. Karl Marx’s political thought centered on the unfinished business of the French Revolution, which had transformed the landscape of European politics, weakening the monopoly on power of ancien régime landed interests and revealing the nascent strength of the industrial and financial bourgeoisie. The democratic and egalitarian ideological impulses unleashed by the revolutionary moment pointed toward a more complete transformation of European society; in class terms, the growing proletariat of industrial workers, increasingly organized and united to secure economic gains, provided the political base for such a transformational project. Marx entered the European political scene in the 1840s with a well-developed materialist theory of history, which saw class control of social surplus production through exploitative social relations as the mainspring of political and social change. His political work centered on the (somewhat quixotic) goal of persuading the European proletariat to make change in the class control of social surplus product the content of its program. Marx and his allies had some success in this direction: European politics of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries did become obsessed with the relation of the market and state and with mechanisms for sharing the wealth created by industrial capitalism through redistribution. The politicians of the European Left had less luck in transferring control of economic production from the capitalists to bureaucrats, despite some valiant attempts, particularly in the ruins of a Europe shattered by the Second World War. Marx’s revolutionary communism thus was grounded in a hard-headed realistic analysis of European politics and society in his own time. The economically radical aspect of Marx’s project was the idea that the proletariat would wrest control of the social surplus product from industrial and financial capitalists. Initially the proletariat would control the surplus product as a class (presumably exploiting itself in the fashion outlined in the Critique of the Gotha Programme), but with the longer-run goal of ending exploitation altogether. Marx branded his socialism “scientific,” because it grew out of an “objective” assessment of European political history in terms of class, and because it was grounded in the widely accepted conclusions of classical political economy. There is some originality (or possibly incoherence) in Marx’s thinking in this respect, since it is not obvious that social control over production is necessarily the economic content of a working-class political movement, nor that there is anything in the logic of classical political economy that would lead to the transcendence of private property as the keystone of economic organization. Marx seems to have had the “vision” that one end of this conundrum would supply the solution to the other. As I have argued (Foley 2006, ch 3) Marx did see that the combination of Smithian increases in the use-value productivity of labor due to the extension of the division of labor and Malthusian pressures keeping wages close to subsistence would lead to an unbounded rise in the rate of exploitation.Footnote 1 This trajectory of capitalist accumulation does pose some purely economic problems, mainly the question of where the aggregate demand to realize the potential product will come from; but it raises the even more explosive political question of how the small minority of capitalists can repress a working class which is so productive and sharing so little in the fruits of its own productive powers. The question of why a revolutionary European workers’ movement would adopt a program of social control of production proved somewhat more challenging to Marx’s genius for theoretical speculation. I will address this question in Section 2. The historical evolution of capitalist accumulation resolved the problem of the unbounded rise in the rate of exploitation in the frustratingly practical compromise of an increase in the use-value equivalent of wages at roughly the same rate as the increase in the use-value productivity of labor. This pattern, with interruptions, was sustained from the mid-nineteenth century to the 1970s; it asserted itself in a remarkably wide range of contexts for industrial capitalist accumulation, from Europe to North America to Asia. Since 1980, median real wages have ominously stopped rising at the rate of increase of labor productivity in the advanced capitalist economies; in fact, median real wages have become stagnant. Marx realized that the general rise of wages posed a fundamental problem for his revolutionary socialist program, since it could be argued (as Smith had already realized and innumerable later apologists for capitalism have repeated) that capitalism was as good or better a vehicle for sharing increases in the productivity of labor as socialism. This “trickle-down” ideology remains the bedrock of bourgeois political economy. Marx replaced the vision of an unbounded increase in the rate of exploitation (too much surplus value) with the more subtle and convoluted theory of the falling rate of profit (too little surplus value relative to the value of capital), discovering the pattern of capital accumulation often called “Marx-biased technical change” (see Foley et al.2019), which fits a wide range (but not all) capitalist economies undergoing industrialization.",3

Foley,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Barone and Pareto tackled the problem of socialist allocation using simple methods of the analysis of static economic equilibrium, centering on the idea that competition will force an equality between marginal cost and price. In the 1920s and 1930s, a group of mathematicians, statisticians, and economists, including notably Abraham Wald, John von Neumann, and Oskar Morgenstern, coalesced around Karl Menger’s “Vienna Circle.” Their discussions laid the groundwork for the mathematical approach to economics that dominated economic theory in the second half of the twentieth century. In particular, this work clarified the problem of how to keep prices from becoming negative through the application of “complementary slackness” conditions which allow for non-zero prices only when resources are fully utilized. One result of this line of thinking was to situate the problem of economic allocation of resources in the broader context of optimal control theory. The mathematical theory of optimal control concerns the design of feedback mechanisms that can stabilize complex dynamical systems to achieve particular goals. A paradigmatic example is the problem of anti-aircraft gunnery, which became a key aspect of military combat in the Second World War. As Mirowski (2002) observes, the duel between the anti-aircraft gunner (who tries to aim at the point where he thinks the bomber will be when the shell reaches the aircraft’s altitude) and the bomber pilot (who tries to evade the shell through maneuvering the plane) inspired von Neumann and Morgenstern’s zero-sum game theory and the “cybernetics” of Norbert Wiener. (It is also the root of modern financial theory, where the problem appears as the task of predicting where asset prices will be when a trader’s transactions are actually consummated.) One continuing tradition of thought takes the technocratic view that the task of socialism is to identify and implement a socially optimal allocation of resources and distribution of products. This is a “top-down” vision of socialism, in which the participants in the division of labor surrender their autonomy to a (presumably) benevolent centralized mechanism of social control. The development of sophisticated optimal control theory supports this top-down vision by revealing mathematically precise characterizations of the conditions for optimal allocation that are in principle generalizable to an arbitrary number of produced goods and capable in theory of dealing with problems of time and uncertainty. In this perspective, establishing socialism amounts to putting in place social institutions that can implement the solutions of optimal control problems. The power of these mathematical methods and the prestige of mathematics in the natural sciences disposed many sophisticated thinkers to accept the eventual triumph of optimal control methods as inescapable. Schumpeter (1942), for example, seems to have seen himself as fighting a doomed rear-guard action on behalf of an increasingly obsolescent capitalist entrepreneurial impulse in the face of an inevitably encroaching bureaucratic rationalization of social production. The top-down optimal control program gained momentum from two other important developments of the 1930s that the Second World War greatly accelerated. One was the input-output system of Leontief (1966), a compilation of data on inter-sectoral transactions at a previously inconceivable level of detail (on the order of dozens or even hundreds of economic sectors). To the technocratic socialist, it seemed only a short leap from Leontief’s tables to implementable plans of production and distribution. Indeed, during the Second World War, Leontief’s methods contributed significantly to resolving real-life bottlenecks created by planned armament production. A second was the invention of the digital computer by Alan Turing, von Neumann, and others, a result of converging streams from the pure mathematics of proof theory, the combinatorics of code-breaking, devices for guiding artillery, anti-aircraft guns and aerial bombing, and rapid advances in electronics. Von Mises had felt confident in attacking the concept of central-planning socialism in the 1930s on the ground that it was humanly impossible to solve all the equations that characterize competitive market equilibrium except through market interactions. But just a few years later, technocratic socialism had at its disposal a sophisticated mathematical representation of the allocation of social resources as an optimal control problem, a rapidly developing computing technology precisely adapted to solving such mathematical problems, and a rudimentary but generalizable input-output database on which to base calculations relevant to real-world allocation. The constituency for developing this nascent technology of social planning extended far beyond head-in-the-clouds socialist idealists. Like nuclear bombs, these social engineering innovations had played a centrally effective role in organizing the successful war effort. (In fact, a good argument could be made that the cumulative impact of the social engineering and planning innovations on the actual prosecution of the war far exceeded the marginal importance of nuclear weapons.) In the paranoid mirror-world of the Cold War, the extension of rational planning institutions seemed to offer a critical edge in the long twilight struggle. Perhaps it was an awareness of this threatening consensus that panicked Hayek into writing The Road to Serfdom, which conflates all varieties of collective social action into a monolithic “collectivism” threatening individual human liberty. In any case, it is not hard to see from a Marxist perspective that the program of technocratic centralized rational allocation would run into heavy weather with the capitalists themselves. The capitalist backlash left its mark on the economics profession, in the effective suppression of Lorie Tarshis’ Keynesian textbook and its replacement by Paul Samuelson’s carefully sanitized neoclassical synthesis, and in unremitting and ultimately successful pressure to marginalize and defund Leontief’s research program. The top-down “hard” program of technocratic centralized rational allocation of resources guided by real data probably reached its high-water mark in the late 1940s, though it continues to exert a real influence on political economic thinking and policy discourse to the present day.",3

Obviously, the call verges on the border of science fiction—and this is not a bad thing. Diverse strands of media studies and science and technology studiesFootnote 1 have shown that not only the development of science and (media) technology is deeply interwoven in social imaginaries about possible outcomes and their implicated futures, but there is a whole theoretical tradition in which societies as such are fundamentally constituted by imaginary relations.Footnote 2 But in all these discussions, one notion very seldom appears: that of an “imaginary economy,” meaning a collectively held system of more or less vague or detailed ideas, what an economy is, how it works, and how it should be.Footnote 3 Obviously a gigantic research field opens up (think alone of the traces of imaginary economics in science fictionFootnote 4)—so in the proposed paper only, one type of “imaginary economy” can be analyzed: It is the field that formed recently around the proposed usages and functions of 3D printing. In diverse publications,Footnote 5 the 3D printer operates as a technology that seems to open up a post-capitalist future—and thereby it is directly connected to the highly imaginary “replicator” from Star Trek. In these scenarios, a localized omnipotent production—a post-scarcity scenario—overcomes by itself capitalism: But symptomatically enough, questions of work, environment, and planetary computation are (mostly) absent from these scenarios. Who owns the templates for producing goods with 3D printers? What about the energy supply? In a critical and symptomatic reading, this imaginary economy, very present in a plethora of discourses nowadays, is deconstructed and possible implications for a post-capitalist construction are discussed.",1

Bettin,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Few depictions of global capitalism are as emblematic as the double role that human-used energy plays—both as an enabler and stabilizer of contemporary global society, but also as a transformer of earth’s ecosystems. Thus, socio-economic research should include the physical and material foundations of our human activities. The energy dimension is fundamental to academic research. Renewable energies become systemically important and diffuse beyond their niche (Markard 2018a) flexible supply-side options such as energy storage technologies require attention from scholars, as changes within the current energy system occur. Sustainability transitions in, e.g., food or processing, require the attention of socio-economic research; the current energy transition comprises issues such as heating, manufacturing, housing, and transportation of goods and services (Foxon 2017). Against this backdrop, this article focuses on the role of electricity in the energy transition—a topic of increasing importance, due to its centrality for many renewable energies, the electrification of key sectors like personal transport, and the increasing use of computers and “smart” devices (IEA 2019). In the past, many evolutionary economics concentrated on the supply side while neglecting demand in innovation process research (Dopfer and Nelson 2018). Entrenched in a pro-innovation bias, evolutionary economists and innovation researchers are increasingly adopting a transformation framework and seek to understand how (technological) innovation can benefit society, alleviate contemporary global challenges, and how policies can be framed accordingly (Schot and Steinmueller 2018). The goal of this article is to conceptualize a research focus that incorporates elements of the next phase of energy transition where renewable energies are expected to replace fossil fuels, requiring more consideration of infrastructure, social and political power, and physical embeddedness. To do so, the article synthesizes selected approaches that bridge different fields of knowledge and concepts. There are contributions from economic geography, innovation economics, science and technology studies (STS), transition studies, political sciences, and business studies (Köhler et al. 2019; Rakas and Hain 2019). The article starts with a brief review on innovation in contemporary capitalist and industrialized societies, stressing aspects of national innovation systems, diffusion, and specific technology innovation systems. A brief history of energy and electricity system development in capitalism follows, so as to emphasize the biophysical embeddedness of socio-technical energy systems.

As modern biology has discovered, the basic process that randomly emerged on earth as a living system seems to be a disequilibrium process being able to reproduce itself in its local environment some 4 billion years ago.Footnote 2 Reproduction is the emergence of a copy, of circumstances that allow for a mirroring of the original disequilibrium process. The spreading of copies, all of them in nearby places and usually imperfect mutations, is the precondition for the setting in of evolutionary selection mechanisms. The step from this first mirror mechanism providing a living mechanism to the next step, the grand evolutionary jump forward to the human species, can be imagined as a second mirror mechanism, which projects – better: reflects - biological evolution into the brains of the individual members of the human species.Footnote 3 Again, the reflected copies are imperfect; a plethora of filters sorts out what has been evolutionary learned as essential from the chaos of perceived impressions. Such a second mirror, such a set of filters, can only emerge if it is able to survive substantially longer than the lifespan of individual members of the species. In other words, the human species has been bound to use a shared language to become an enduring social entity. It is the exchange of perception filters, in the communicative capacity of tribes of human individuals, which enables and constitutes individual consciousness.Footnote 4 The existence of this second mirror is built on the primacy of the group.Footnote 5 Note that like the first mirror, also this second mirror provides imperfect copies in individual brains. In this context, a variety of diverse copies is regulated by the syntax and semantics of the shared language. The first part of this paper develops these ideas in more detail. Then—having convinced the reader that all social science necessarily has to put the diversity of internal modelling of individuals and their communicative exchange in its centre, i.e. has to be ‘complex’—some proposals on how to proceed (e.g. by agent-based modelling of essentials) and which problems (e.g. algorithmic language evolution, use of complex numbersand octonions) will have to be overcome are provided.",

It is a story about the co-evolution of technologies and institutions through changes in actors and networks and the way they drive economic growth and development over extended periods of time (Nelson et al. 2018). And it is a story about evolutionary complexity, which involves many players, their collaborative networks, and their ability to take advantage of inter- and intra-network knowledge flows, as well as the various national and local institutional arrangements within which the players relate (Kirman 2011; Frenken 2000). The lecture draws its inspiration from Schumpeter’s vision of long waves (1939) and developed further by Knell (2010, 2013, 2015) and then put in the context of global innovation networks. From the historical perspective, we know something about how the digital revolution and digitalization have transformed the economy and society over the past 50 years. Recent applications of these technologies have led to robotics, artificial intelligence, computerized algorithms, mobile sensors, 3D printing, and autonomous vehicles. A techno-economic paradigm can have many diverse problem-solving activities contained within the paradigm. These trajectories of endogenous technological change are cumulative, incremental, and path-dependent by nature and describe the evolution of technological opportunities of a specific industry or technology (Nelson and Winter 1982, Dosi 1982). The digital revolution created new opportunities for technical change and technological learning for those industries that have access to relevant networks. Universal availability of the microprocessor, rapid growth in computing power (Moore’s Law), and later extensive use in a wide variety of products and services both accelerated and enabled the growth of networked enterprise (Freeman and Louçã 2001). New forms of organization transformed the old Fordist paradigm into a digitalized network society, in which such networks matter not only for inter-personal communication but also for global innovation, R&D collaboration, inventor networks, spatial innovation clusters (i.e., Silicon Valley), and global value chains. The main idea of this paper is that the digital revolution not only transformed the world we live in but also created new ways to organize networks within it. While this idea is not new, it has recently become controversial because of the choice of theoretical argumentation. The notion of Industry 4.0 (Industrie 4.0 in German), for example, draws attention to the idea of industrial revolutions and its application to recent technologies, but it does not directly confront the ongoing theoretical debate on long waves and innovation networks. This article introduces a few of the basic ideas behind Industrie 4.0 and the Fourth Industrial Revolution and then discusses relevant issues in the work of Joseph Schumpeter, Christopher Freeman, and Carlota Perez on technological revolutions, long waves, and techno-economic paradigms. A summary of the first four techno-economic paradigms follows, which brings us up to the digital revolution and the rise of digitalized network society. Then we ask: How do networks fit into our story, and what are global collaborative innovation networks? The paper then concludes by how we might envisage the future and the sixth industrial revolution.",10

However, previous concepts and approaches for surveying and measuring such dynamics differ considerably. There is a large number of empirical studies on measuring technological change, using a broad spectrum of approaches ranging from patent counts (Archibugi and Planta 1996) over citations (Verspagen 2007) to the analysis of keywords in documents (Joung and Kim 2017). Conversely, studies in the field of network research have been based on a static point of view for a long time (Baum et al. 2003; Buchmann and Pyka 2015) leading to insufficient knowledge regarding the general “empirical understanding of innovation network evolution” (Buchmann and Pyka 2015, p.116). Furthermore, currently existing network indicators tend to only depict specific aspects of the network structure and barely the network as a whole, making it difficult to look at its general structural development. This also has consequences on a possible comparing view between technology development and network dynamics, as we need a deep insight into innovation system dynamics to understand technological change (Hekkert et al. 2007). Previous literature already suggested an existing co-evolution between research networks and technology (Orsenigo et al. 2001; Murray 2002) and indicates interesting effects of mutual influence. On the one hand, changes in research networks can be seen as drivers of technological development (Deeds and Hill 1996) while on the other hand, technological development may also influence the composition and structure of innovation networks (Anderson and Tushman 1990). As co-evolution can be seen as an important aspect in economics as well as sociology of technological change (Rosenberg 1982), it is not surprising that co-evolutionary processes regarding technology and innovation networks have already aroused the interest of the research community (Orsenigo et al. 2001; Murray 2002; Gilsing 2005). However, regarding especially highly transformative technological areas, empirical evidence is still scarce. Further, there currently seems to be a lack of consistent measurement to facilitate the comparability between the two processes. Based on these shortcomings, the aim of this paper is twofold: First, it aims at developing a new consistent method for analyzing change in research and technology networks. The second aim is to provide deeper insight into transformation processes within a currently highly transformative technological area: the automotive industry. We therefore adapt a methodology of a recent publication by Parraguez et al. (2020) and modify it for creating a network-based indicator for measuring both structural change in research networks and technological change. Afterward, we use this indicator to analyze transformation processes in the German automotive research network and the structure of automotive-related German patents as well as their co-evolution. The paper is structured as follows. In the second part, we give a short theoretical review on both technological change and structural change in research networks as well as their respective measurement in the literature. This is followed by a short review of corresponding co-evolutionary research in literature and an excursus about the change in the German automotive innovation system. The third part gives insight into the applied method and used data, while the fourth part presents and discusses the results. In the end, the fifth part provides a short conclusion.",

In the context of innovation policy, Weber and Rohracher (2012) illustrated the rationales for governmental interventions in order to initiate sustainable development and turn away from pure growth-thinking. In the past, classical mission-oriented strategies that go beyond a market-fixing mechanism and instead pursue market-shaping strategies have earned their justification. The idea of ‘tilting the playing field’ in the direction of markets or technologies identified by the government, generated the opportunity and necessity to anticipate and trigger desired technological paths, although they often focused narrowly on technical innovations (e.g. Apollo Project or Cleantech-industries) (Aghion et al. 2009; Mazzucato and Perez 2015, p. 245). Yet, the aim of modern innovation policies has progressed over time and adjusted to new conditions and challenges. Thus, increasingly more holistic, fundamental and normative elements of the socio-technical system are being targeted (Daimer et al. 2012). In fact, Kattel and Mazzucato (2018) portray the evolutionary development of innovation policy and categorise it into three stages. Accordingly, the most recent innovation policy era is characterised by normative principles and distinguishes itself from previous generations by its comprehensive approach that also includes non-technical innovations (Kuhlmann and Rip 2018). A prominent example of such a modern approach, that tackles far-reaching and fundamental shortcomings, is the Grand Societal Challenges (GSC), which are addressed, for instance, in the EU’s mission-oriented framework programme Horizon 2020 (Daimer et al. 2012). One integral objective within the EU’s GSCs as well as in various other sovereign countries is the implementation of a bioeconomy (GBC 2018; EU 2020). Over the last couple of years, the concept of a bioeconomy (the term ‘bio-based economy’ is used synonymously in this paper) has gained momentum due to the urgency to overcome dependence on fossil resources and also as a response to anthropogenic climate change. In simple terms, bioeconomy is understood as the concept of a ‘gradual replacement of fossil-based feedstocks with bio-based ones’ (OECD 2018, p. 11). A wide range of published strategy papers and interest groups, such as environmentalists or dedicated companies, have raised awareness of a bio-based economy as a leitmotif for politics, economy, the public and science. It shows that innovation policy and the character of targeted objectives have evolved successively. However, it is often not clear how a transition of policy goals is defined and consequently pursued. In light of this fact, it is our aim to assess whether and in what way the shift in political discourse from biotechnology to bioeconomy has been reflected by a transition in both funding programmes and projects. In order to achieve this, we go back to the origin of public bio-themed R&D support at a programmatic level, starting with systemic biotechnology funding, and illustrate the evolution from biotechnology to bioeconomy. At the same time, we trace the implementation at a project level so that we can both assess the actual execution of the stated transition and identify the priorities within the bioeconomy. For this purpose, we built a database consisting of all relevant bioeconomy projects that have been funded by the German government between 1995 and 2015. In the process, we divided the bioeconomy into its components to determine realised funding measures. We chose Germany as the observation unit due to its early commitment to the bioeconomy and the availability of sufficient data, which allows an examination of the funding patterns and for conclusions to be drawn about the policy change over time. With this study we are contributing to existing research in two respects. Firstly, by tracing the evolution of thematic shifts at both programmatic and project levels, we gain a better understanding of how political trends emerge, develop and are implemented. There is still a lack of knowledge about evolutionary mechanisms underlying policymaking processes. By addressing the different leitmotifs of biotechnology and bioeconomy support, we are able to shed light on the question whether policy evolution either follows a linear top-down approach or is rather accompanied by bottom-up dynamics and feedback loops. Secondly, social-science literature dedicated to the bioeconomy is still rare and based on different opinions about the bioeconomy’s scope. We therefore make the bioeconomy tangible by dissecting it and thus illustrate its comprehensive character along several parts of the value chain from raw materials to final products and industrial applications. This allows us to categorise and quantify its publicly funded knowledge-based component. This article is structured as follows: First we discuss the transformation of innovation policies and outline the topic of mission-oriented strategies more in greater detail. This is succeeded by a discussion of mechanisms in the policymaking process. Subsequently, we embed this discussion in the bioeconomy context, followed by an historical overview of bio-related funding in Germany on a programmatic level. Thereafter, the data at the project level are described, analysed and evaluated. Finally, the results are discussed and conclusions are drawn.",3

DeMartino,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"A central aspect of economic practice involves modeling future impacts of policy measures. Economists recognize of course that the social world is nondeterministic and/or should be theorized as such given epistemic limitations, which complicates forecasting. But economists typically presume nonetheless that they can map the probability distribution of policy effects which permits dependable estimates of expected utility and other magnitudes of interest. This belief is central to the twentieth century modernist economic project: to devise means to know the future so as to exert control in hopes of promoting social betterment. Orthodox micro- and macroeconomic theory has pursued various stratagems since the late nineteenth century to repress the problem of an opaque future. Stratagems include the assumptions of rationality and perfect information, partial equilibrium analysis with a liberal reliance on Marshallian ceteris paribus, the Walrasian framework with its omniscient auctioneer that yields general equilibrium only by disallowing trading at non-equilibrium prices (Walras’ tâtonnement process), and comparative statics that represses complex dynamics as the economy presumably evolves between period t0 to t1. Later on the new classical macroeconomists theorized economic actors as forming rational expectations of the future. Each, in its own way, sought to domesticate the future, providing economists with a time-travel machine that seemed to allow them to see tomorrow, today. But knowing future economic events is a fraught exercise. Just why this is so has been probed extensively over the past century by important epistemic iconoclasts, and I will not reproduce their arguments here.Footnote 1 The dissenters are right to perceive a specter of irreparable ignorance haunting economic analysis of the future. That insight has never been well received in the profession. It is disturbing to accept that there are tight constraints not just on what we know now and will know tomorrow but on what we can in principle ever know. It is equally disturbing to acknowledge that these epistemic limits crisscross the terrain of what both theoretical and applied economists would want to know and would need to know in order to do much of what they are presently doing. Those economists who have emphasized irreparable ignorance have tended to draw a sharp epistemic distinction between the future and the past. In a famous passage, John Maynard Keynes emphasizes our ignorance of the future, not the past. Speaking about events like “the prospect of a European war…the price of copper and the rate of interest twenty years hence…” he writes “About these matters there is no scientific basis on which to form any calculable probability whatever. We simply do not know…” (Keynes 1937, 213–214).Footnote 2 Knight (2014[1921], 199), too, was preoccupied with our ignorance of future events: “We live only by knowing something about the future; while the problems of life, or of conduct at least, arise from the fact that we know so little” (cf McCloskey 1990). Shackle (1992 [1972], xi) is most explicit about the distinction between the epistemic status of the past and future. Speaking of Myrdal and Lindahl’s conception of ex ante and ex post analysis, Shackle contrasts “the forward look into the void of unknowledge, and the backward look into the past with its ascertainable history” (emphasis added). The distinction between an ascertainable past and an unknowable future is intuitively attractive and has been readily accepted by many economists and others who probe the limits to knowledge. As Fischhoff (1982, 335) puts it, “Whatever the question we are asking, it is generally assumed that the past will readily reveal the answers it holds. Of hindsight and foresight, the latter appears as the troublesome perspective.” As concerns the past social world, we have a good bit of information, imperfect though it is, about what in fact happened. By “what happened” I mean the occurrence and sequence of certain events and the approximate values of many variables at regular intervals. As concerns the future, on the other hand, it seems that we cannot know in advance of its arrival the occurrence or order of many events, or the values of key variables. Consider a scenario in which economists are debating whether raising the minimum wage in New York will increase unemployment 1 year, hence, and if so, by how much. We expect that their predictions might conflict, but we might at least expect the economists to be able to agree on and be certain about the effects of past increases in the minimum wage. This question, we might think, submits to certain, objective analysis, relying on well-established theoretical models and empirical techniques. The intuition, however, is incorrect. Policy design, evaluation, and implementation are ultimately about control in two respects: by changing, say, this or that law, regulation or policy setting X, one can cause a predictable effect Y in line with one’s goals. The control of X enables the control of Y. Hence, it requires an understanding of causal mechanisms—what causes what, or by how much the magnitude of one variable affects another, and why (Heckman 2008). And when it comes to that kind of knowledge—knowledge of causal mechanisms and pathways—the basis for a sharp epistemic distinction between the past and the future evaporates. The reason for this, as will be discussed below, is that causal arguments in economics, whether they are situated in the past or the future, depend on counterfactual reasoning. But counterfactual arguments are by their nature fictitious. This implies that causal arguments in economics, too, are fictitious. As concerns causality,Footnote 3 then, and as I will endeavor to show, the past is no more epistemically available than is the future. Causal knowledge of the past eludes us in part because of cognitive biases that I will mention only in passing. I will probe here the more fundamental epistemic problem associated with counterfactualizing that would not be resolved even in the absence of cognitive biases. To anticipate a likely semantic concern, to say that social science counterfactuals are fictitious does not imply that they lack all reason or empirical grounding. As will become clearer below, I mean that they are statements about alternative worlds—recognizable worlds—which do not exist other than in our imaginations. As a practical matter, the correct standards of judgment, then, do not include their truth status or the truthfulness of the causal claims they sustain. But they can nonetheless be judged. The standard is their productivity—the degree to which they help us confront the unknowable worlds we inhabit and prepare for unpredictable futures. This is just how they are used by those in the field of “decision-making under deep uncertainty,” discussed below, where practitioners who acknowledge severe epistemic insufficiency look to discover robust, adaptive policy that promises to generate good outcomes over a very wide range of possible futures. Recognizing the fictitious nature of causal claims, then, promises to improve rather than obstruct good decision-making.Footnote 4",2
2.0,2.0,Review of Evolutionary Political Economy,03 November 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43253-020-00024-1,Veblen’s evolutionary methodology and its implications for heterodox economics in the calculable future,July 2021,Tae-Hee Jo,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"There is a perennial claim that heterodox economics has failed.Footnote 1 What does it mean by the ‘failure’ of heterodox economics? For example, Hodgson (2019) argues that the heterodox economics community has failed to “establish sufficient consensus over core issues and to develop alternative positions of power within academia” (4) and that “unrestricted tolerance of diversity within heterodoxy leads to a failure of quality control” (151). It is, however, not clear what Hodgson means by “sufficient consensus” and “a failure of quality control.” Given that heterodox economics is an umbrella term which refers to a wide variety of economics schools with distinctive methodological and theoretical commitments, it is doubtful that they can arrive at an indisputable consensus. To put it another way, given that economics is an evolving and value-laden body of knowledge, is it possible to reach sufficient consensus? Is it desirable that all the member of the scientific community hold the same view of what the core theoretical or policy issues are? Moreover, when Hodgson says a “failure of quality control,” it is presumed that the quality of heterodox research is low. Does it mean that heterodox research is inferior compared to mainstream research? What evidence brought him to make such a claim? Should we rely on the conventional journal rankings and citation impact factors created and maintained by private business enterprises (e.g., Clarivate’s Social Sciences Citation Index)? These questions shall be dealt with in the following sections. Other critics of heterodox economics have also made a similar argument that heterodox economics has failed in the sense that it has only limited acceptance by the mainstream of the economics profession and little influence on other approaches and policies. According to those critics, the failure is due to, among other reasons, heterodox economists’ self-marginalization within the economics discipline, antagonism towards the mainstream economics, unwillingness to engage with mainstream economists, and heavy ideological bias. Heterodox critics thus suggest remedies to overcome the failure and to have a better future of heterodox economics. Just to mention notable strategies: give up the label ‘heterodox’; engage conversation with mainstream economists (in particular, mainstream dissenters); reorient heterodox research from a ‘generalist mission’ (e.g., doing research on methodology and philosophy; aiming to replace neoclassical orthodoxy) to a ‘specialized’ mission (e.g., doing research on specific institutions); engage with other disciplines (e.g., philosophy, law, sociology, political science), and so on (see, for example, Colander et al. 2004, 2007–2008; Fontana and Gerrard 2006; Colander 2010; Holt et al. 2011; Rosser et al. 2013; Hodgson 2019). Apart from the ambiguity of the meaning of failure, the above critiques are problematic for multiple reasons (as discussed in detail later). A general problem of note is that critics, be they mainstream or heterodox, “blame the victims for their own marginalization and demise” (Lee 2013: 120). Heterodox economists are for sure partly responsible for the limited acceptance or influence in that their efforts to make their own theory and policy more appealing could be insufficient. However, it is not just the problem of heterodox economics. Marginalist-neoclassical economics in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was, for example, not widely received in the academy and policy circles. Likewise, any school of thought that challenges the dominant school has always faced a severe difficulty imposed from outside. Critics of heterodox economics, when they blame the victims, overlook the institutional arrangements within economics which have long systemically suppressed heterodox economics. The history of economics is abound with external pressures and attacks on heterodox economics via the institutional processes of hiring, promotion, publication, research evaluation and funding, etc., which have hampered the development of heterodox economics and marginalized heterodox economics within economics (Lee 2009). Once history is taken into account, it is hard to defend not only the blame-the-victims view but also the market-oriented view that economics develops through the ‘free market’ of ideas in which, as mainstream economists believe, ‘rational’ economists make an optimal use of scarce scientific resources which gives rise to the progress of economics. The free-market approach to the evolution of economics is grounded in an untenable Spencerian assumption that mainstream economics became dominant due to its theoretical-methodological superiority over other approaches that either have disappeared or survived with limited acceptance (see, for example, Wible 1998). Economics is a contested discipline in which its prevailing institutions are biased towards the dominant mainstream economics. In such an academic landscape, it is obvious that mainstream economists deliberately marginalize heterodox economics by way of controlling and perpetuating academic institutions in which their vested interests lie. Those critics who accuse heterodox economists of their ‘failure’ tend to overlook how economics has evolved, how heterodox economics has survived, and how academic institutions generate unfavorable conditions for heterodox economics. The debate on the nature and future of heterodox economics has been ongoing, and we should not avoid this debate if we are concerned with the future of heterodox economics. Instead of repeating what has already been said, in this essay, I subject some of heterodox critics’ arguments to critical examination from the perspective of Veblen’s evolutionary methodology. Veblen’s theory of the business enterprise will be used as an example, which exemplifies the case that a ‘blasphemous’ theory is ignored and marginalized even though it provides rich and perspicacious insights into economy and society, whereas those theories of the firm (e.g., new institutionalist and new evolutionary theories) that are akin to the neoclassical theory do not face the same fate as Veblen’s theory. It is also argued that social science does not follow the biological principle of natural selection and the survival of the fittest. What survives does not necessarily mean the fittest in the social realm. The history of science is replete with paradoxical incidents that an incoherent, irrelevant, or even wrong theory becomes dominant and widely accepted because it is one that serves the vested interests in academia and society. Economics is no exception. The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, Veblen’s evolutionary methodology is summarized to highlight its distinctive way of thinking with regard to the evolution and evaluation of theory. In Section 3, Veblen’s theory of the business enterprise is discussed focusing on its methodological characteristics, essential arguments, and implications. In Section 4, the implications of Veblen’s evolutionary methodology and theory for heterodox economics are discussed. In the last section, the main arguments of the paper are highlighted.",

However, we can note ‘The Unfamiliar Raúl Prebisch’ authored by Carlos Mallorquin that appears as a chapter in Ideas, Policies and Economic Development in the Americas (2007), a book coedited by Esteban Pérez-Caldentey and Matías Vernengo. In his chapter, Mallorquin (2007, pp. 98–122) argues that, although the conjugal term centre-periphery can be found in Prebisch’s early works, it was not until May of 1949 in La Habana, Cuba, that Prebisch presented a lecture entitled El Desarrollo Económico de America Latina y Algunos de sus Principales Problemas.Footnote 2 Prebisch’s 1949 Havana presentation offered at that time an altogether novel interpretation of ‘centre-periphery’. In the view of Mallorquin (2007, p. 110), the way in which Prebisch defines ‘centre’ and ‘periphery’ in this Manifesto represents a clean break with his earlier understandings, as Prebisch had fully transposed this abstract spatial notion to the real economy. Rather than depicting differences in capital movements, as he had in his earlier research documents, in this Manifesto Prebisch employs the spatial understanding of ‘centre-periphery’ in order to demonstrate the concrete economic reality, namely, the structural divisions of international labour. While Prebisch’s use of ‘centre-periphery’ back in 1949 is important to consider, Mallorquin does not inquire into the how and when Prebisch got started introducing this approach in economic analysis. Since their 2007 publication, Pérez-Caldentey and Vernengo (2012, 2015, 2016, 2018) advanced additional and valuable contributions that consider Prebisch’s research efforts prior to his starting to work for the UN’s Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA) in 1949, a department of the United Nations that is also known in Spanish language as Comisión Económica para América Latina, or CEPAL—with those employed at CEPAL sometimes noted affectionately as Cepalians. Pérez-Caldentey and Vernengo (2012) argue that in his inquiries into business cycles, Prebisch advanced the idea that the world economy could be understood as having one unified cycle that originated from a central economy, but which engendered varying effects on economies composing a periphery. Pérez-Caldentey and Vernengo (2018) also emphasize the level of sophistication and the importance of Prebisch’s use of ‘centre-periphery’ in his dynamic theory that appeared in 1948 with the publication of ‘Manuscritos de las clases dictadas por Raúl Prebisch en Buenos Aires sobre la dinámica económica’.Footnote 3 In the view of Pérez-Caldentey and Vernengo (2018), Prebisch’s ‘concept of economic space of centre-periphery’ differentiated monetary flows as well as the location of production in a structurally fractured world economy. These co-authors (2018, p. 17) argue that productive and circulative economic processes defined ‘the essence of Prebisch’s dynamic theory’ of world capitalism. Pérez-Caldentey and Vernengo (2012, pp. 13-4) also identify what they suggest are the early Keynesian influences that appear in Prebisch’s works. As an example, the co-authors cite that Prebisch had adapted John Maynard Keynes’ concept of multiplier to a ‘foreign trade multiplier’ to help account for a greater than expected increase in national income as a consequence of additional financial flows resulting from exports (Pérez-Caldentey and Vernengo 2012, p. 13). In ‘Reading Keynes in Buenos Aires: Prebisch and the Dynamics of Capitalism’, Pérez-Caldentey and Vernengo (2015, p. 2) cogently argue that, although considered an exponent of Keynesian economics in Latin America, Prebisch’s approach differs from Keynes’ intentions fundamentally in its ‘object and method of analysis’. As to whether Prebisch altogether rejected all ‘static’ and ‘equilibrium’ approaches to economics—either Keynesian or classical—the co-authors observe that he kept his analyses focused upon dynamics which he surmised could best explain historical specificities associated with actual geographical locations within distinct timeframes. Differences in approaches highlighted by Pérez-Caldentey and Vernengo (2015) prove to be of fundamental importance, signalling the range of topics that Prebisch would explore and advance as a professional economist. Though Pérez-Caldentey and Vernengo offer truly novel and welcomed insights into Prebisch’s evolving understanding of ‘centre-periphery’ as well as Keynesian influences in his thinking, we shall demonstrate that there are some less known influences—especially of German economists—that may have played a fundamental role in the evolution of Prebisch’s thinking and his ‘centre-periphery’ concept in particular. Our readings suggest that over key years of his career as a professional economist, Prebisch’s understanding of ‘centre-periphery’ evolved beyond his early studies of business cycles, deriving a novel contribution from these studies. After considering the extant literature on this subject of ‘centre-periphery’ and its appearances and uses in Prebisch’s contributions, what our inquiry now seeks to establish is that in his research efforts Prebisch remained consistent in differentiating and dividing economic activities into a ‘centre’ and a ‘periphery’. His consistency follows tendencies found in a larger body of research into the regional, national, and world economy.",2

Modern economies, societies, cultures, and languages have become increasingly integrated through international trade and regionalism, modern forms of international relations and politics, and the astonishing revolution associated with information technology and fast-paced digital world. What makes the present globalization different is the degree to which the technological revolution has led economic and cultural outcomes to be interconnected or converge. There is an implicit supposition in the pomposity of neoliberal globalization that the dynamics of the global capitalist system will ultimately make local cultures obsolete. Yet, several countries in East Asia, particularly China, have been resisting traditions from Western culture. For instance, the beliefs and practice of Confucianism have lastingly marked their governments, societies, and family patterns. Global capitalism advocates assumed the superiority of ‘Western values’, but they continually assert that material prosperity can be achieved within endogenous contexts. Mainstream attempts to apply a historical lens have engaged in gross simplifications and misreading of the relevance and importance of thousands of years of Chinese thought and culture. Nevertheless, any useful analysis cannot take place in the absence of historical understanding, which is precisely what orthodox theories, rational decision models, mathematical perceptions, and economic projections lack. The theory of the developmental state, therefore, is one useful option that has already been adopted in some areas. This theory permits countries to accept some of the practices of corporatism, but it should take apart others and redefine them within the ‘socio-cultural matrix’ in which they may be placed (Karagiannis and Madjd-Sadjadi 2007). Clearly, China and newly industrialized countries of East Asia have similar culture and tradition and their own heritages, which may be foreign ‘for all that North Americans and Europeans know of them’ (Doughty 2007, p. 1), given the absence of the wholesale importation of Western cultural norms to these societies. China is a particularly interesting case as the country has been able to organize its economy effectively. It has also developed its related philosophical and political structures, and has come to rank among the most influential nations in the world.Footnote 1 Moreover, while effective industrial strategies and policies are largely dependent on institutional design, they are heavily influenced by culture (Morishima 1982; Dore 1987).Footnote 2 Culture and tradition have had a profound impact on the Chinese economy because the ‘Great Power’ of China, its culture and institutions, survived and thrived despite shifting philosophical perspectives of its political leaders. The trend towards neoliberal globalization frequently seems to conceal the ‘active’ role of the sovereign government. Accordingly, the debate between the developmental state argument and the free market approach is based on the philosophical inconsistencies and false assumptions of most orthodox economic analysesFootnote 3 as well as the fallacy that free-market capitalism promotes perfect competition and increases prosperity. The Chinese saying ‘a crisis is also an opportunity’ motivates us to think realistically and avoid ideological blinders that can push unrestrictedly towards market fundamentalism. It is sufficient to make clear the need for a compelling argument for a re-evaluation of interventionism, which has already challenged neoliberal ideology with regard to its theoretical assumptions about human nature, the origins and ‘appropriate’ role of the modern nation-state, and the actual workings of the economy (Karagiannis and King 2019). On the positive side are matters such as capitalization of domestic economies, technology transfer, regional growth, the possibility of improvements in the host country’s balance of payments, innovative ideas, and the promise of beneficial cultural change. Within such a context, the focus of this contribution is to provide an analysis of socio-cultural and politico-institutional features that contributed greatly to the Chinese success. The argument, advanced here, is based on a developmental state analysis with ‘Chinese characteristics’. This is incompatible with the market supremacy and optimality conceptions of the mainstream.Footnote 4 Being more specific, it relies on heterodox, including evolutionary-institutional, topics like emergence, path-dependence, power, idiosyncrasies, and national development acumen; these appear to have played a significant role in China’s evolution and economic rise. In addition, a surge in policy implications of economic complexity is taken into account (Elsner 2019).Footnote 5 With some explicit considerations accounted for, Elsner (op. cit.) reveals the importance of long-standing heterodox threads, namely, the role of history, local culture and social psychology, institutional structures, political economy, and international relations. This contribution is structured as follows. Through a lens of political history, the first main section analyzes the country’s past development efforts since the late nineteenth century. Subsequent main sections discuss important aspects of an alternative economic development framework for China, based on a highly interventionist heterodox developmental state line of argument, by placing special emphasis on the country’s politico-institutional and socio-cultural traits. Finally, relevant summary and conclusions end the paper.",
2.0,2.0,Review of Evolutionary Political Economy,12 April 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43253-021-00040-9,"Objectives of the Review of Evolutionary Political Economy’s ‘Manifesto’ and editorial proposals on world problems, complex systems, historico-institutional and corruption issues",July 2021,Phillip Anthony O’Hara,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"It is great to see the emergence of the first three issues of REPE, to restart the process of (re)constructing an evolutionary political economy (EPE). Most readers of REPE, I am sure, are delighted to read the stimulating ‘Editorial Manifesto’, ‘Towards an Evolutionary Political Economy: Editorial to the Inaugural Issue of the Review of Evolutionary Political Economy REPE’, written by Silvano Cincotti, Wolfram Elsner, Nathalie Lazaric, Anastasia Nesvetailova and Engelbert Stockhammer (Cincotti et al. 2020). In it, several core issues are raised about the future development of the journal. Most readers are also likely excited to read of the manifesto’s desire to have ongoing constructive feedback of core issues for deepening the journal’s community of understanding of EPE and ways of enhancing it. As the editors say, ‘to be successful, this journal needs critical feedback from critical scholars’, as the ‘editorial team always welcomes comments on REPE’s agenda and issues’ (Cincotti et al. 2020: 8; emphases added). As a member of the International Advisory Board, having published more than 100 papers in journals/edited books, over a dozen volumes of books and special issues of journals, and written close to 800 referee reports, I felt it is my duty to provide detailed comments, since I had suggestions for being cognizant of promoting and through time likely adjusting the journal’s objectives. Reflections by readers, writers, referees and advisors associated with the journal, now and in the distant future, on the nature of the journal, set down for all to see in a normal issue of the journal, will likely be critical to its successful development and progress. This is especially true of the democratic style of governance and participation required for such a potentially progressive institution, as the journal is hoped to become. This paper presents the results of a close textual analysis of the editorial manifesto regarding its main objectives, and how they can be realized or improved upon now and into the future. The editorial manifesto of the REPE sought to (a) introduce the journal to its readers, (b) discuss objectives and (c) detail aspects of these objectives and other issues. The manifesto thus had many things to say in a short space. It also had to stimulate the reader so that they could get through the paper in an enjoyable fashion. It thus wasn’t going to state objectives specifically, or with logic-math equations, but was rather likely to treat objectives in a typically literary style. The manifesto was meant to stir readers into action (getting them to read papers, write papers, referee, provide advice and propose special issues) more than merely enabling them to understand the logical reasoning behind their arguments concerning objectives. As a consequence, the main objectives were often not much ‘emphasized, highlighted and repeated’, i.e. detailed, in the manifesto. Readers are thus unlikely to have easily noticed and remembered them all. This is where this current paper comes in. My objectives here are quite different from the manifesto in aggregate since, firstly, I want to be very specific about such objectives, secondly, to comment on them, and, thirdly, provide editorial suggestions regarding them. I delimit the scope of this paper to these three issues. However, due to the literary style of the manifesto, and its general aims (e.g. introducing readers to the journal), it was difficult to ascertain its main objectives and to contextualize them, merely through reading the paper (plus the ‘Aims and Scope’) several times. I realized much work would be needed to understand the objectives, and for this task I utilized several tools associated with a close textual analysis. Firstly, I employed ‘multiple readings’: reading fresh copies of the manifesto seven times over the period of seven weeks, using highlighters to isolate main points. Secondly, I did a ‘keyword analysis’: where different color highlighters isolate different aspects of objectives, such as isolating specific objectives, the context of objectives and ways objectives are to be put into practice. Thirdly, I used ‘contextual mapping’: where the context of objectives was discussed, including how objectives relate to each other. Fourthly, I read the CVs and some papers of the writers of the manifesto to understand the objectives in more detail. Fifthly, through a circular process, I was finally able to delineate the specific objectives (‘objectives separation’), as well as to holistically link the objectives together in one paragraph so they made sense (‘objectives aggregation plus context’). which took a lot of rearranging to complete the task. The final result of all this close textual analysis of objectives is to provide, firstly (1), a short paragraph/sentence statement of objectives of the journal (here and elsewhere below); secondly (2), in this section, to outline these six objectives separately; thirdly (3), in the subsequent sections of this paper, to state the respective objectives in more detail (citing the manifesto); and fourthly (4) to elaborate on them and provide ten proactive editorial suggestions vis-à-vis the objectives. In the rest of this section, we merely summarize the results of the close textual analysis of the editorial manifesto. Then, in subsequent sections, we (a) specify the objectives with contextual evidence from the manifesto, (b) discuss various aspects of the objectives and also (c) provide ten proactive editorial suggestions for promoting, deepening or modifying/critiquing such objectives. The first thing to do is to present a very summarized paragraph of the objectives, where the six main objectives are situated, in aggregate, as follows: REPE’s ambitions are to (1) (re)construct an EPE by examining pressing world problems and policies (2) using evolutionary PE themes; (3) stimulate potential convergence and unification of the schools and trends while (4) studying the evolution of complex systems and historico-institutional trends; and (5) scrutinize differences between the schools/trends and (6) apply trans-multi-interdisciplinary methods of analysis. The second thing to do is to state the six objectives in a little more detail, prior to documenting them more thoroughly with textual evidence in subsequent sections: Objective 1 is a clear desire to publish ‘cutting-edge’ research on critical ‘topical’ world problems, issues and policies, i.e. the ‘big political-economic issues of today and tomorrow’ (p. 7). Some of the applied issues, problems or policies mentioned in the manifesto include ‘innovation, networks, distribution, or social class [and] climate change’, as well as ‘economic crises, inequality, … unemployment, … financial instability, digital transformation, artificial intelligence, … environmental degradation, … climate change … [and] epidemics’ (p. 8). Objective 2 is a determination to examine these problems, issues and policies through the prism of various ‘heterodox-pluralist evolutionary and complexity perspectives’, including, for instance, ‘institutional analysis, critical political economy, heterodox macroeconomics, computational methods, and interdisciplinarity’ (p. 8). Editors are here alluding also to the future contributions of original institutionalists, neo-Schumpeterians, post-Keynesians, neo-Marxists, feminists and ecological political economists. Objective 3 seeks to promote discussion, interaction and potential integration (p. 1) and convergence (p. 4) among the various schools and trends of EPE. It is dependent upon the success of the other objectives (especially 1 and 2) leading to successful work on this third objective and is closely linked to the fourth objective: Objective 4 seeks to study and comprehend the process of change (p. 2) in real political economies, as well as schools of thought and perspectives, as they evolve through time in multifarious forms. This can be done, for instance, by the use of complex-systems analysis or historico-qualitative methods, or some combination of formal and qualitative methods (p. 2). Objective 5 states that ‘interdisciplinary’ (pp. 1, 3, 7, 8), ‘transdisciplinary’ (p. 2) and ‘multidisciplinary’ (p. 5) themes should inform many issues in EPE. One such theme emphasized in the manifesto is for especially post-Keynesian and Veblenian strands of EPE to incorporate international political economy (IPE) (p. 7) processes, problems and concepts into their edifice, so they are situated in a national-regional-global context of international relations and economics. Objective 6 is interrelated with concern for potential convergence and integration, since it deals with differences (p. 4) within and between the schools and areas of EPE. Some of the differences may be crucial, especially relating to positive and/or negative scrutiny of innovation (pp. 3–4); the role of individuals, and/or sectors-industries, groups and systems; formal complex-systems and/or qualitative historical systems (p. 2); and the degree of realism (p. 4) of micro-meso-macro-global models and simulations. Since it took me seven readings of the manifesto over seven weeks to delineate specifically what I think the objectives of REPE are, I don’t expect others to be able to understand them clearly from reading the manifesto in a single read, or even a double read. But there may be scholars among readers of REPE who understood them very quickly and easily; and some may disagree with my delineation of objectives (but see below for more details about them). Indeed, if I had done nothing else but delineated them, I would have been happy, given the effort required. But I have two other tasks to undertake. Firstly, I have to give some idea as to how I arrived at the six objectives, which is done in successive sections below. Plus I have to contextualize them, show how they are linked (at least to some degree). If I had just done these tasks (not only stated/delineated objectives but also explained how the text evidenced them, and contextualize them), and nothing else, I feel I would have achieved something significant. But I do have other tasks to undertake: for instance, making certain proactive editorial suggestions for the future workings of the journal in light of objectives. Some such suggestions will be more theoretical and others more strategic and administrative. Also, I leave it for others to provide details on and to critique these theoretical and administrative suggestions, by concentrating on them, for instance, in subsequent papers, since here, I can often merely just scratch the surface, given space limitations. So what the reader should expect in the rest of this paper is not a thoroughly exhaustive account of (a) how the text provides evidence for the objectives, nor for (b) how the objectives are contextualized, and not even for (c) suggestions about the future workings of the journal. Rather, you can expect notes whose purpose is to stimulate thinking, debate, discussion, criticism, writing, editing and contributing to editing and advising vis-à-vis REPE. We thus undertake these tasks with a thoroughly humble purpose in mind, merely to open the minds of readers to thinking about these issues, and for them to act on or criticize/reconstruct these arguments. It is in this context only that we investigate these objectives sequentially through the next few sections. As the paper evolves, we introduce various proactive editorial proposals (ten in all) for advancing or modifying the objectives. In the last main section, we scrutinize the potential for systemic editorial corruption of objectives and ways of preventing or limiting this. A conclusion summarizes the whole argument.",5

This functionalism has been challenged by two main streams within the financialisation literature. One stream has argued that firm boundaries do not emerge ineluctably and optimally to resolve market-based problems; rather firm boundaries are shaped by shareholder preferences and expectations which may produce suboptimal strategic, allocative and social outcomes. This stream argues that investors award premiums to companies that spin-off or outsource low-return parts of their business producing disaggregated corporate structures that generate larger profits from fewer assets (Davis & Kim 2015; Zuckerman 1999). This may allow CEOs to articulate simpler corporate narratives about performance drivers and strategic intent (Froud et al 2006), but can hollow out important skills, resources and innovative capacities (Lazonick 2015). Another stream focuses less on investor perceptions and more on managerial conceptions of control—i.e. shared understandings about how best to organise and run corporations for profit—and how a shareholder value conception of the firm encouraged the same processes of corporate disaggregation (Fligstein and Shin 2007). Our approach to boundary formation follows in this tradition of critique, but reflects the rather different disciplinary backgrounds of the authors. For social anthropologists, there is a long history in the study of boundary-making as part of a social process, as entities emerge through acts of exchange. This work has questioned the taken-for-granted nature of the existence of social groups such as tribes or clans, and has instead explored the ways in which their existence is elicited through perspectives which highlight particular relations, obscuring others. We apply these same insights to firms. Similar themes appear in accounting research. As Llewellyn (1994) notes, accounting does not just enable the ‘organization of production’, it is implicated in the ‘production of the organization’ by making boundary decisions about the thresholds of a transaction—i.e. what falls inside and what outside the organisation when it transacts with other entities in its environment, and how those exchanges are represented through internal systems of valuation, reporting practice and accountability which bind the organisation together. Boundary-drawing almost always involves moral questions about rights, responsibilities and obligations and where boundaries lie, classically, for example around how to account for the externalities of an exchange. Our contribution therefore is to focus on how conceptions of rights and obligations shape the legal form and reporting practices of the financialised corporation, with redistributive effects. Our core argument is as follows: that all market relations are simply one form of social relation. Consequently, the boundaries of the corporation emerge from formal and informal acts designed to fix the limits of relational obligation at a particular moment. Predominantly, though not exclusively, we view boundaries as constructed through socio-legal and accounting processes. We argue that this process of fixing is a dialectical one which can involve choices and often conflict over which relations are deemed to be legally and morally legitimate at particular moments. Boundary drawing, therefore, involves an ongoing struggle to impose a ‘line of sight’ which subjects firms to renegotiations around the norms, conventions, rules and laws which—for extended periods—create a relative fixity to those boundaries. In this context, what gives entities their different ‘character’ is the particular way in which boundary thresholds are established—i.e. how chains of relational rights and obligations are extended or curtailed in order to create particular bodies. This, ultimately, allows us to distinguish firms from other kinds of social entities and to examine changes in the legal form and reporting practices of those entities over time. This approach implies that rather than looking for a singular ‘theory of the firm’, that our focus should be on the social and technological processes through which particular kinds of firm come into being and evolve. In order to examine how the curtailment or extension of rights and obligations bring different types of entities into being, we use the parsimonious concepts of ‘dams’ and ‘flows’. This approach departs from existing financialisation work on firm boundaries in two ways. First, we follow Robe’s (2011) conceptual distinction between ‘the firm’ as a grouping of social and technological activities and relations, and ‘the corporation’ as an individual corporate person and reporting entity as it is legally recognised, where the role of the latter is not merely to represent the economic outcome of the activities of the former, but to organise that representation in time and space in a way that reflects, reinforces and constructs the interests of the dominant social forces that comprise the firm at any one moment. Conceptions of rights and obligations take us, therefore, to the constitutive effects and distributional implications of particular legal forms and reporting practices undertaken by the corporation. This differs subtly but importantly from conceptions of control which focuses more on questions of firm governance and the physical organisation of firm operations to achieve profit-making, or at least conflates the identities of firm and corporation. Second, we take the view that conceptions of how the world ought-to-be can differ from the world that is subsequently structured by those conceptions. The relation is not necessarily performative; it can be ‘virtual’ producing unintended outcomes (Miller 2002). It is possible, in other words, that a conception of rights and obligations can be advanced by groups who then gain materially from those conceptions, even though the rights and advantages that accrue to those actors are not immediately obvious from those conceptions. This idea that different conceptions can be accommodated or subverted helps us to understand some of the more puzzling contemporary developments in this era of financialisation, which—if agency theory is to be taken at its own estimation—was supposed to discipline management and increase returns to shareholders. The first is soar-away CEO and CFO pay and the associated rise of top to bottom inequality driven mainly by wages not capital income (Piketty 2018). The shareholder value revolution has been rather more permissive than disciplinary when it comes to senior executive pay. The second, as examples of corporate collapses with accounting irregularities mount up, is the growing sense that we are living in what Jim Chanos has termed, ‘the golden age of fraud’—that the shareholder value revolution has—counterintuitively—increased agency problems, producing the incentives, means and contexts for directors to engage in the dark arts of creative accounting and the obfuscation of risk through the corporation’s legal form, leading to an explosion of malpractice for personal gain on the blind side of investors. Our paper attempts to understand these unexpected outcomes of financialisation through a theoretical lens which focuses on the different conceptions of rights and obligations that give form to the corporation and its boundaries. We first revisit mainstream economic theories of firm boundary formation, critiquing the social-disembeddedness of those accounts. In the following section, we then develop our alternative theory of boundary formation, drawing on the idea that conceptions of rights and obligations, extended or curtailed, constitute an entity through processes of exchange. To clarify this argument, in the next section we apply those ideas to the moral arguments made in support of limited liability in the Companies Acts of the mid-nineteenth century, and the forms of relationality and obligation envisaged and show how a certain set of relational obligations—the claims of commercial debt providers on shareholders—were limited (or dammed) in order to create a new entity—the modern limited liability company (LLCFootnote 1 hereafter)—that directed flows of wealth in new directions through the corporate form. A following section then explores how, with the advent of agency theory, notions of shareholder indemnity to incentivise investment were displaced by a morality premised around the inalienable rights of property owners and how this moral conception sought to dam control rights to create new flows that would maximise shareholder returns. We argue that this ‘financialisation of the firm’ had important implications for corporate governance and financial reporting practice, which counterintuitively increased rather than disciplined the discretionary power of directors. In a final concluding section, we discuss how the shareholder value revolution produced a form of managerialism which fostered modes of relationality and obligation—new dams that direct flows—which facilitated greater intra-firm inequality and increased the strain on the firm as an economic and moral entity.",2

A Minskyan analysis of the behavior of non-financial companies in a financialized economy,December 2021,Eduardo Mantoan,Vinícius Centeno,Financialization and Development Study Group (FINDE/UFF),Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The literature on endogenous business cycles developed by Minsky points out that an economy that shows a predominance of firms with fragile balance sheets is more exposed and vulnerable to shocks arising from both the goods and services markets, as well as the financial markets. Balance sheet fragility arises because decisions at the firm level are made based on expectations about uncertain returns which, if negative, may lead to an unexpected increase in indebtedness. As long as the financial system is willing to provide credit, firms will be able to meet their financial commitments, albeit becoming increasingly dependent on borrowing new capital and on the uncertainty of the markets. Thus, a reversal in expectations, where a significant number of firms present high financial instability, triggers the downward phase of an economic cycle. Moreover, in a context of a financially integrated economy, business cycles tend to be more severe, and the recovery is slower.Footnote 1 Over the last decade, but especially from 2015 on, Brazil has experienced deep changes in its macroeconomic conditions, leading to a serious recession (2015–2016) and a slow recovery (2017–2019). With that in mind, this paper aims to measure the degree of financial fragility of publicly traded non-financial firms in Brazil between 2012 and 2019, as this period encompasses the deceleration of the positive investment cycle that had begun during the commodities boom in the mid-2000s, as well as the recession of 2015–2016 and the period preceding the shock due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The empirical literature on the financial fragility of firms is relatively scarce in Brazil due to the difficulty in accessing a long and consistent database on firms’ balance sheets. A recent work that discusses financial fragility according to Minsky’s hypothesis is Feijo et al. (2020); using panel data from the Annual Industrial Survey, the authors developed an analysis of the recent investment cycle in Brazil (2007–2017), arguing that the 2008 international financial crisis hit the Brazilian economy in the ascending phase of a typical Minskyan cycle. They conclude that the deceleration of aggregate demand in the 2010s played an important role in increasing the financial fragility of industrial firms. Meyer and de Paula (2021) also discuss the financial fragility of non-financial firms for the same period using the Economática database.Footnote 2 The authors identify that financially fragile firms in the face of corporate management policies aimed at maximizing the shareholder inhibit productive investments. Capital markets are still incipient in Latin America, which means that corporate governance and the usual features of financialized companies are not widespread practices.Footnote 3 Gottschalk and Torija-Zane’s (2017) research is relevant reference concerning investigating investment behavior and financialization in non-financial corporations in Brazil. The authors look into the behavior of Brazilian listed corporations focusing on the 2008–2015 period to evaluate to what extent and in which ways financialized practices have taken hold among Brazil’s large corporations (p. 162). The authors conclude by the predominance of macroeconomic developments in explaining the slowdown in corporate investments after 2010. Also, the authors report a greater indebtedness of Brazilian non-financial companies after the global financial crisis, although investments in immobilized capital had decelerated. In the authors’ words (p. 185), “Brazil’s path towards long-term sustainable economic growth depends on a dynamic corporate sector that invests strategically and innovates. Financialization practices in themselves are not a crucial inhibiting factor for unlocking investment and innovation by Brazilian corporations, although in conjunction with other factors, they may become an obstacle as well if they increase financial volatility.” Pushing forward the agenda on financialization and financial fragility of non-financial corporations in Brazil, the present paper sheds light on how non-financial companies faced the 2015–2016 recession. The data of consolidated financial statements were obtained from the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM).Footnote 4 We show that non-financial companies were highly leveraged in the pre-recession period and chose to prioritize the restructuring of their balance sheets and debt profile in the post-crisis. To do so, large non-financial companies deepened their financialization practices. Therefore, the building up financialization practices during the recent recessive period, on the one hand, combined with the weak recovery of aggregate demand following austerity fiscal policy on the other, help to explain the slow recovery of the Brazilian economy in the second half of the 2010s. Although the analysis focuses on the Brazilian case, we believe that the recent Brazilian experience can be taken as a good example of the failure of austerity policies and liberal reforms in financialized economies to overcome a downward phase of the business cycle. In the case of Brazil, austerity policies and liberal reforms, instead of recovering the confidence of both domestic and international private investors, have induced large firms to postpone long-term investments, and therefore, depressing aggregate gross capital formation. In order to analyze the macroeconomic implications of the financial instability of non-financial companies, the remainder of this paper is divided into four sections. Section 2 revisits the literature on the phenomenon of financialization and its connections to the economic cycle. Section 3 presents some insights on Brazil’s economic performance in the 2010s. Section 4 proposes a financial instability proxy for 100 publicly traded non-financial Brazilian companies and an aggregate financial stability index that, together with the analysis of the liabilities and cash flow structures, allows us to understand the reasons for the slow recovery after the 2015–2016 recession. Lastly, Section 5 offers the final considerations.",3

Fuller,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Financialization is a concept that is subject to criticism, particularly concerning whether it is too ambiguous or ill-defined to offer practical value to researchers. These debates are arguably best captured by Ewald Engelen (2008), as well as Brett Christophers (2015) and Manuel Aalbers (2015) in dialogue, who collectively present a nuanced view of a concept with problems — but also with potential utility. There is no doubt that financialization can mean a great number of things — so many that any effort to cover all of its meanings in would run a serious risk of incoherence. As Christophers notes, there were already at least 17 different meanings assigned to the term financialization by the end of the 2000s (Lee et al. 2009) — and more have proliferated since. Even those more positively disposed to financialization as a concept readily concede this point: financialization means a lot of different things. Moreover, its history as an idea can be narrated in different ways. Some trace the concept back to Giovanni Arrighi (1994), others prefer citing Magdoff and Sweezy (1987), and one could argue that the appropriate place to start the discussion is with the (disparate) early twentieth century contributions of Rudolf Hilferding, RH Tawney, Adolf Berle, and Gardiner Means. This paper follows Aalbers (2015, 216) in arguing that the primary value of financialization is in connecting “different disciplines but also different levels of analysis, from the very micro to the very macro – and demonstrating how they are related.” That is, it has value as an umbrella term reminding us that, while studies of financialization might examine very different subjects in very different ways, they remain part of a broader whole. This value is reflected in the two most oft-cited definitions of financialization, the first from Aalbers (2017, 544) building on an older — but broadly very similar — definition offered by Gerald Epstein (Epstein 2005, 3): I define financialization as “the increasing dominance of financial actors, markets, practices, measurements and narratives, at various scales, resulting in a structural transformation of economies, firms (including financial institutions), states and households” financialization means the increasing role of financial motives, financial markets, financial actors, and financial institutions in the operation of the domestic and international economies. As Aalbers himself notes, these definitions need to be refined in order for operationalization in any specific context; however, their comma-laden inclusive phrasings capture the multifaceted family resemblances that hold the financialization literature together. Yet, this begs the question of whether tying together such distinct ideas is of value in the first place. For Aalbers — and for your present author — the answer is yes. Many of the scholarly communities engaged with financialization struggle with communication across disciplinary, sub-disciplinary, methodological, and ideological boundaries. Human geographers, sociologists, anthropologists, political economists, economists, and housing specialists all discuss ideas that would fit under the umbrella definitions above. However, these communities struggle to understand and cite one another and often fail to recognize that they are carrying on closely related conversations using slightly different conceptual frames. The same occurs within fields across functional lines: one political economist might be focused on how financialization works for non-financial firms while another political economist does the same for households, and another for the state. Arguably most importantly, financialization bridges multiple levels of analyses: the financialization of individual life cannot be considered wholly separate from efforts to understand financialized accumulation regimes — and intermediate-level theories concerning institutional actors such as banks or businesses or households connect to both the micro and macro levels. Ultimately, the fundamental value of financialization as a concept stems from these linking functions. By classifying discrete processes as financialization and linking them together within a unified concept, we effectively engage in what Alexander Wendt (1998) would describe as constitutive explanation. The act of classifying a thing as financialization calls into being an understanding of modern society in which the rising salience of finance and financially mediated social relations play central roles. Such a broad definition would be impossible to operationalize in a single way because it encompasses a multitude of interrelated processes. The key task for a scholar writing on financialization is therefore to indicate which of these processes they are investigating and how they link it to the broader whole. Of particular interest here is financialization as it pertains to the home. This could be defined by using the Aalbers definition above with an emphasis on housing specifically. Another good definition specifically intended for this purpose comes from the UN Human Rights Council (2017, 3) which defines housing financialization as: [S]tructural changes in housing and financial markets and global investment whereby housing is treated as a commodity, a means of accumulating wealth, and often as security for financial instruments that are traded and sold on global markets. It refers to the way capital investment in housing increasingly disconnects housing from its social function of providing a place to live in security and dignity. Through the early 2010s, most of the research into housing financialization revolved around homeownership. While certain aspects of contemporary housing financialization can be traced back to the advent of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in the USA or even the earlier development of covered mortgage bonds in Northern Europe, the explosion of interest into housing financialization typically coincides with the expansion of the 1980s’ housing bubbles, their bursting during the 1990s, and reemergence in the early 2000s. Reflecting the linking value of the financialization concept, this era of housing financialization cannot be understood without the broader context of banking deregulation, international capital flow liberalization, collapsing interest rate controls, and welfare state retrenchment across the developed world. Even though many of the instruments at the heart of housing financialization had existed for decades, it was not until the 1980s that a combination of factors accelerated the process of integrating housing wealth into mainstream financial markets. Much of the early literature in the field of housing financialization was thus centered on teasing out the causes and consequences of the transformation underway — with particular emphasis on rising precarity and broader macroeconomic instability (c.f. Aalbers 2008, 2017; Aalbers and Christophers 2014; Fuller 2016; Fuller 2019). Like financialization itself, the value of housing financialization is that it functionally connects similar scholarly discussions across different academic communities. The value of this linkage is perhaps most evident when looking at works that could be part of the financialization literature but are not generally thought of that way. This is particularly true in mainstream American economics — likely due to the baggage of heterodoxy associated with a term devised by Marxists. Thus, scholars such as Atif Mian and Amir Sufi (2014; 2018) essentially engage in work that very clearly sits under the financialization rubric — even drawing many of the same conclusions — but do not use the term. Similarly, the emergence of the “safe assets shortage conundrum” within economics is closely related to why capital has tended to reach out and integrate new classes of financial assets (Caballero et al. 2017) — but this is generally not considered part of the financialization literature. The lack of interactions between these different communities has arguably weakened them all — the economists do not cite the sociologists and human geographers, who in turn rarely cite the orthodox economists, leaving us all the poorer for it. The final section of this paper will return to lessons we have taken from the housing financialization literature in order to assess whether these lessons are modified at all by considering not just the financialization of owned homes, but the financialization of rented homes as well. That is, what explanatory value is offered by setting rental housing financialization aside as a concept unto itself? It is to this question that we now turn.",7
2.0,3.0,Review of Evolutionary Political Economy,26 October 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43253-021-00058-z,Ties that bind and blur: financialization and the evolution of sovereign debt as private contract,December 2021,Giselle Datz,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Financialization has been defined as the increasingly predominant role of financial incentives, strategies, logics, and tools in the global capitalism (Epstein 2005; Davis and Kim 2015). It is “both an economy-wide shift” and the “conjunctural application of specific financial values and technologies” to global economic production (Nesvetailova 2012: 68). The outcome is not only credit expansion, but “a profound change in the very processes by which credit is issued and distributed in the financial and economic system” (Wansleben 2020: 187–88). Moreover, financialization is neither entirely novel nor a purely private sector phenomenon. As Flandreau et al. (2009:1) remark, this “emergence of global finance [associated with the 1990s financial globalization] was really a re-emergence.” By 1900, “the use of modern communications to transmit prices; the development of a very broad array of private debt and equity instruments, and the widening scope for insurance activities; the expanding role of government bond markets internationally; and the more widespread use of forward and futures contracts, and derivative securities” spread to and linked major economic financial centers from Europe to the Americas, Asia, and Africa. Nonetheless, the evolution of international capital markets has not been linear. Rather, not only has broader financial integration been interrupted by domestic political imperatives that led to protectionism and capital controls, but, beyond macroeconomic policy switches, the “microeconomics of financial globalization” has endured marked changes (Flandreau 2017; Obstfeld and Taylor 2003). When it comes to foreign debt, “the way the business of originating and distributing foreign debt is organized” has gone through a “profound transformation” in the twentieth century (Flandreau 2017: 160). Before the interwar era, underwriters functioned as “gatekeepers of liquidity and certification agencies.” While the less prestigious underwriters originated bonds most likely to default, more reputable intermediaries dealt with less risky bonds. In contrast, thanks to the rise of rating agencies who provide assessments of sovereign risk, today “defaults are randomly distributed across underwriters,” who have “become aggressive competitors in a new Speculative Grade market” that did not exist in the past (Flandreau et al. 2009: 7). Then, the underwriting business was highly concentrated. It provided a number of services for which large fees were collected. Quality standards were high, and most bonds originated were akin to today’s investment grade securities. Nowadays, the business has become less concentrated among a few firms that, given economies of scale, charge less for their services (independently of bond spreads). Quality standards have decreased, and there is very limited cooperation between the borrower and the underwriter (Flandreau et al. 2009: 11). Moreover, as sovereigns became more reliant upon bond finance, debt management evolved into a more autonomous and specialized function in public bureaucracies. The financialization of sovereign debt management turned public debt into actively traded financial assets, backed by deep secondary markets and financial logics assimilated by state officials (Karwowski 2019: 1011). The clear imperative is still to reduce the cost of debt (i.e., the interest paid on these bonds) through auctions featuring competitive bidding by bond investors (Fastenrath et al. 2017: 276–277, Datz 2008, Karwowski and Centurion-Vicencio 2018). Within this insightful literature on the financialization of the state, however, debt is a financial asset whose legal coding or contractual form is mostly taken for granted in the debt management process, remaining thus largely exogenous to its financial relevance. As all contracts, the foreign sovereign bond contract is a legally binding agreement between the parties involved on their rights and commitments. Its current design encapsulates the incremental evolutionary process initiated in the early 2000s, which saw in contractual changes a substitute for a necessary, albeit (so far) politically untenable, global sovereign bankruptcy mechanism (Gelpern et al. 2015; Brooks 2019; Brooks and Helleiner 2017). We turn next to the peculiar features of the foreign sovereign bond contract before tracking its contemporary evolution. Since it was the Argentine debt restructuring, following the country’s 2001 default, which sparked a new consensus on contractual changes, the case is explored below. As Choi and Gulati (2004: 929) describe them, “sovereign bond contracts are a special breed of contract. The parties involved are among the most sophisticated in the world financial markets, the amounts involved are large (hundreds of millions of dollars, in any given issuance), there is an active secondary market, and there is no meaningful regulatory body that interferes with contracting practices.” Absent a formal set of universality applicable bankruptcy procedures, sovereign debt can never be discharged, and sovereign bond contracts can supposedly last forever (Lineau 2014). No creditor can be forced to accept a restructuring deal that offers less than face value. Indeed, refusing to join a debt restructuring deal (i.e., holding out) is a strategy pursued by a minority of bondholders. Since the early 2000s, this possibility and its often-uncertain outcomes have been a cause of concern for debtors, their lawyers, creditors who do accept debt exchanges, international financial institutions, private trade associations, the UN, and, prominent among other public agencies, the US Treasury (Krueger 2002, Guzman and Stiglitz 2016; Sobel 2016). Sovereigns, in turn, are exceptional debtors, “uniquely vulnerable and … uniquely protected” (Buchheit 2013: 107). Despite not having access to debtor protections akin to those provided by corporate bankruptcy laws, sovereigns have enjoyed some protection in the legal arena. Even if sovereign property held abroad can be subject to seizure through a court judgment in favor of the creditor, money judgments are almost unenforceable by courts since most sovereign assets are immune from legal execution, and debtor countries can hide their executable assets outside of countries were litigation takes place (Gelpern 2013).",

Its purpose is to enable the exchange of goods and services while avoiding the complications and the inefficiencies tied to barter. According to the different procedures used to orchestrate the clearance of monetary obligations between two or more agents, payment systems are usually divided between two archetypal types of settlement architecture: real-time gross settlement (RTGS) and net settlement (NS).Footnote 1 RTGS is a system in which credits and debts between agents are regulated through payments as soon as they arise. The main advantage of RTGS is the elimination of the insolvency risk, since contracts among the parties involved are settled through immediate payments. However, the adoption of the RTGS system entails liquidity costs due to the need to employ financial resources when entering into a financial obligation, to which the operational risk during the execution of the payment should be added. NS deviates from RTGS in both timing and regulatory procedures. In specific terms, the structure of NS makes it possible to clear two or more obligations at the same time through a bilateral netting settlement (BNS) or a multilateral netting settlement (MNS).Footnote 2 Netting procedures make it possible to lower the expository level among agents, shrinking the liquidity costs necessary at the time of execution. Thus, netting reduces both liquidity costs and operational risk. However, by postponing the execution time of the payment, there arises a credit risk which disincentivizes the use of the procedure altogether. In order to deal with credit, liquidity and operational risks, the actual functioning of payment systems usually relies on an economic institution, i.e. a central clearing counterparty or clearinghouse, whose roles are those of securing the execution of trades, providing insurance and disclosing information. While there is a large body of literature on the optimal design of clearinghouses (Duffie and Zhu 2011; Duffie et al. 2015; France and Kahn 2016), far less attention has been paid to the preconditions favouring the endogenous emergence of such an institutional device in the first place. To address this issue, we take inspiration from the historical experience of the New York Clearinghouse, a private arrangement established in 1853 during the American Free Banking Era as described by Chauduri (2014). Theoretically speaking, free banking consists of a monetary system with no barriers to entry into the banking sector and where all banks can issue their own currency, the value of which is determined by market forces just like the value of a commodity. The most renowned cases of free banking occurred in Scotland (1716–1845) and in the USA (1837–1863). While the former is considered a success storey, the latter is regarded as a case of high monetary instability which led to the spontaneous formation of some key financial institutions, like regional central clearing counterparts and the Federal Reserve System, intended to provide emergency liquidity and coinsurance arrangements (Anderson et al. 2018; Gorton 1984, 1985; Hoag 2011; Jaremsky 2015, 2018). In this paper, we employ agent-based simulations to identify what circumstances enable the endogenous formation of a clearinghouse when BNS and MNS protocols are in competition with each other. We have two purposes: (i) to reflect on whether the multilateral netting may spread once the netting circuit is managed by a clearinghouse and (ii) to study under what conditions such an institution is likely to emerge spontaneously. We frame our analysis in terms of experiments performed in a network-based computational laboratory, an approach that has been largely applied to the study of financial systems, with emphasis on systemic risk (Battiston et al. 2012a, b; Grilli et al. 2015), financial-real market interactions (Delli Gatti et al. 2010; Riccetti et al. 2013; Bargigli et al. 2014) and the analysis of interbank markets (Tedeschi et al. 2012; Gaffeo and Molinari 2015, 2016; Gaffeo et al. 2019). The novelty of our work consists mainly in its presentation of a process of endogenous formation of a central clearing counterpart vis-à-vis the extant literature on netting rules, which usually considers the presence of clearinghouses as exogenously determined.Footnote 3 In this regard, our computational agent-based model is suitable for analysing the economic dynamics which emerge in the payment systems whenever the agents can freely decide the type of settlement to which they resort. We test the model for two competing systems of settlement, namely the BNS and the MNS, and for different economic scenarios, payment networks and transaction costs. Therefore, our model fits into the literature on payment systems. A large part of this literature focuses on the trade-off between net and gross settlement. Without pretending to be exhaustive, Angelini (1998) investigates how, in RTGS systems, banks tend to postpone interbank payments in order to save the costs of reserves. Such rational behaviour for the debtor banks turns into a problem for the creditor banks, which must increase their reserves in order to unravel the uncertainty about their inflows. Chakravorti (2000) develops a model in which banks use a MNS in order to analyse the liquidity cost-default risk trade-off. The main result of the model consists in identifying the maximum number of defaults sustainable by the banking system compatible with an orderly functioning of the payments settlement. Kahn and Roberds (2001) investigate the liquidity constraint induced by an RTGS system in an interbank network. They show how, in the absence of intraday credit, RTGS distorts the interbank market, causing suboptimal liquidity allocations. Galbiati and Soramaki (2013) analyse how the topology of a financial network can influence a clearinghouse’s need for margins. In general, clearinghouses require margins from debtors in order to mitigate credit risk. The authors find that the need for margins is higher for tiered networks than for highly concentrated ones. This is mainly due to the fact that a tiered network displays unbalanced positions towards the clearinghouse. Gaffeo et al. (2019) study how, for banking networks hit by shocks on external assets, the GSFootnote 4 and BNS systems perform differently in terms of the number of defaults and losses absorbed by equity and bank deposits respectively. Considering the different levels of capitalization, depth and topologies of the interbank markets, the authors find the BNS to be clearly dominant on the metrics considered. This result does not appear to be straightforward for liquidity shocks (Gaffeo and Gobbi 2021). Furthermore, our work can be included within the literature dealing with market evolution. In particular, our paper pertains to the literature that analyses the competition between two institutional systems. Among others, Kugler et al. (2006) investigate the competition between decentralized bargaining and centralized markets. The authors show how the choice of the system by the agents depends crucially on their set of preferences and on the fact that these can change endogenously over time. Moreover, Neeman and Vulkan (2005) show that agents tend to prefer centralized markets over decentralized ones. Nevertheless, exchanges on decentralized real markets are not zero. This may depend on the presence of assets that are not perfectly homogeneous, on risk-averse agents, as well as on the fact that transaction and operational costs are higher in the centralized case than in the decentralized one. Gerber and Bettzuege (2007) study the competition between two markets in the presence of trading frictions and liquidity effects. Their main findings are that in an evolutionary process when the costs of choosing one or the other market are low, agents tend to choose only one of them. Conversely, whenever costs exceed a certain threshold, agents spread over both. The presence of several institutional models in which the same type of goods or services are exchanged is a very common case in reality. Alós-Ferrer et al. (2010) try to explain this phenomenon through a model that develops the competition between market designers by comparing it with the case in which there is only one monopolistic designer. The authors show that whenever traders can choose between multiple platforms, they tend to coordinate on the platform with prices that are structurally higher than the market clearing price. The implication of this phenomenon is that market designers tend to develop non-market clearing platforms, while the monopolist-market designer systematically introduces a market clearing platform. The long-term persistence of inefficient institutions has also been investigated by Alós-Ferrer and Kirchsteiger (2006) and Alós-Ferrer et al. (2021). Alós-Ferrer and Kirchsteiger (2006) study a pure exchange economy in which there are several trading institutions that lead to rationing and only one characterized by market clearing. Their artificial economy is populated by backward-looking traders who choose which institution to join according to the performance achieved in the previous period. In this context, the authors find that the market clearing institution is achieved independently of the features of the other non-market clearing institutions. Nonetheless, some non-market clearing institutions are stochastically stable. Alós-Ferrer et al. (2021) built a system in which two institutional frameworks coexist. One is a double-auction institution where buyers and sellers trade without a specific auctioneer. The other is an institution where the seller is the price maker and the buyer can accept the offer or not. The paper shows that when sellers face decreasing return to scale, there is a rapid convergence towards the double-auction market. Conversely, where sellers are characterized by constant returns to scale, both institutional models persist. Finally, we developed our model in order to explain a specific historical case. Nevertheless, our framework could be used to explain the clearinghouse formation mechanism for B2B networks, as in the case of the WIR Cooperative Bank and the Sardex clearing circuit (Stodder 2009; Stodder and Lietaer 2016; Lucarelli and Gobbi 2016). The remainder of the paper is divided into three further sections. In Section 2, we describe the technical aspects of the model and its underlying dynamics. Section 3 illustrates and discusses simulation outcomes. The last section is devoted to final remarks.",

On the worker-side, wages between high and low educated employees diverge (Autor et al. 2003; Autor et al. 2020b), employment dynamics polarize in a U-shaped pattern across skill groups (Goos and Manning 2007; Goos et al. 2014; Autor and Dorn 2013) and income for top earners further pulls away (Atkinson et al. 2011; Saez and Zucman 2020). On the firm-side, adoption rates of new technologies are uneven and firms disperse further in terms of productivity (Andrews et al. 2016; Berlingieri et al. 2017) and skills (Card et al. 2013; Song et al. 2019), market shares are increasingly allocated to a few large firms (Autor et al. 2020a) and returns to capital are more and more unevenly distributed (Furman and Orszag 2015).Footnote 1 At the same time, recent evidence points to an interconnection of the phenomena at the worker- and firm-level. In particular, the availability of matched employee-employer datasets has brought about a new strand of empirical results focusing on the role of the firm in shaping inequality dynamics and labour market outcomes. Starting from the work by Abowd et al. (1999), the evidence overwhelmingly points to an important role played by firm heterogeneity (Bagger et al. 2010; Faggio et al. 2010; Card et al. 2013; Barth et al. 2016; Song et al. 2019; Criscuolo et al. 2020; Bormans and Theodorakopoulos 2020). For example, Song et al. (2019) assess that two-third of the rise in wage inequality from 1978 to 2013 in the USA can be explained by between-firm differences. A natural question arising in this respect regards the main driver of this pervasive polarization. Several studies focus on firms’ investment in IT capital and link productivity dispersion (Dunne et al. 2004; Faggio et al. 2010) or market concentration (Bessen 2020) to heterogeneous ICT adoption rates. Inline with this, Andrews et al. (2015), Andrews et al. (2016), and Akcigit and Ates (2019) find a slowdown in technology diffusion from leader to laggard firms. Others link the widening gap between firms to the rise of intangible capital (Crouzet and Eberly 2018). As a consequence, these different investment rates into software or IT across firms have then contributed to the dispersion in wages (Faggio et al. 2010; Barth et al. 2020). The agenda of this paper is to improve our understanding of two so far less studied aspects of the relationship between technological change, industry dynamics and evolution of income inequality. In particular, we focus on the differences between short- and long-run effects of a technological regime change and examine how these effects depend on the type of technological evolution emerging under the new regime. More precisely, we distinguish between two technological regimes. First, a regime under which the frontier moves in many relatively small steps, such that producers using the technology when investing can select from a large choice of close to the frontier instances of the technology, which we refer to as the Frequency scenario. Second, we consider a regime characterized by less frequent and larger jumps in the frontier technology, labelled as Increment scenario. Referring, e.g. to Malerba and Orsenigo (1997), one can think of the software industry as an example of a Frequency scenario, since ‘... opportunity conditions are very high with a wide variety of potential technological approaches and solutions ... Therefore, one would expect specialization ... with many innovators.’[p.113]. On the contrary, Malerba and Orsenigo (1997) describe the computer industry characterized by ‘... high technology opportunities with limited technological variety … Therefore, one would expect few innovators to be present in the industry ...’ [p.113] and in particular, if we consider the transformative effects of technological breakthroughs like touch-screens for tablet computers, this industry can be considered as an example of what we refer to as the Increment scenario. Also, the distinction between exploration and exploitation by March (1991) gives rise to different technological dynamics represented by our two scenarios. Here, the Increment scenario corresponds to technological change mainly driven by exploration, i.e. a process where firms try to find fundamentally new approaches for designing or producing a certain product. Since many of the explored new approaches do not result in solutions dominating the current frontier, such a regime leads to rare productivity jumps at the frontier, which however tend to be large. Innovation processes mainly focusing on exploitation of existing technologies, on the other hand, lead to smaller but more frequent improvements in the technological space and hence correspond to our Frequency scenario. For both scenarios in our setting, the change in the technological regime leads to a temporary acceleration of productivity growth, which then eventually flattens out again. Such a process might be induced by a technological paradigm shift as it has been described by Dosi (1982) and Perez (2010). As has been argued in this literature, it should be expected that the technological trajectory emerging after such a shift flattens after some time such that the growth rate returns to a value similar to that before the arrival of the new regime. Nevertheless, innovations such as the computer or today’s digital technologies affect the development of the some industries in a long-lasting way (Freeman 2009; Knell 2021). In our setting, the speed of technological change is increased for a finite time interval after the shift; either by increasing the frequency of new innovations arriving or by increasing the productivity jump a single innovation gains. As we will see in Section 4, in setting the economic conditions under which firms make their investment decisions, the technological environment influences firm’s behaviour in line with the evolutionary tradition (Malerba and Orsenigo 1993). In our distinction between these scenarios, we use a reduced form representation of the change of the technological basis of the production process in the sense that we assume that the technological developments are fully embodied in the capital used for production and increase the productivity of the production process. The upstream sectors offer their downstream buyers different palettes of capital goods which evolve over time due to technological change. The main research question we address in this setting is whether the type of change of the technological frontier—Increment vs. Frequency—has systematic implications for the medium- and long-run dynamics of industry concentration and inequality even if the average productivity growth rate is the same in both scenarios. Furthermore, we want to improve our understanding of crucial mechanisms responsible for the dynamics emerging in these two scenarios. We carry out our analysis within the agent-based Eurace@Unibi model (Deissenberg et al. 2008; Dawid et al. 2019), which captures the interplay of the labour, capital and goods market as well as the endogenous diffusion of new technologies in the firm population and the updating of worker (specific) skills due to on-the-job learning. Furthermore, the model captures complementarity on a firm level between the specific skills of the employees and the quality of the installed capital goods, as well as the heterogeneity of workers with respect to general skills (e.g. level of education), which determine the speed by which workers are able to improve their specific skills. These properties make the model particularly suitable for addressing our research questions. Our experimental setup to investigate the channel from technological change to inequality relies on a variation in the technological frontier (the most productive capital good offered to firms). In our setting, the dynamics of the frontier is determined by the number of innovations in a given time period and the factor by which the productivity of a new vintage improves on the previous frontier technology. Starting from a baseline scenario with a fixed trajectory over the whole simulation run, we model the Frequency scenario by assuming that productivity increasing innovations arrive more frequently than in the baseline, whereas in the Increment scenario, the frequency of innovation remains unchanged but the average productivity increase of each innovation is larger. Both scenarios share the same average productivity growth rate. This variation in the trajectory of the frontier occurs for a given amount of time, after which in all scenarios technological growth returns to the baseline values. The main insights from our analysis are that temporary technological regime change has both short and long run effects on concentration and inequality and that these effects indeed differ qualitatively between the the Frequency and the Increment scenario. In the short run, the acceleration of technological change leads to a somehow larger productivity dispersion across firms and associated with this an increase in wage inequality. Allocation of worker skills across firms and market concentration is however hardly affected. These effects are qualitatively the same under the Frequency and the Increment scenarios. The key differences between the effects of technological regime change under the Frequency and the Increment scenarios emerge only in the long run, where under the Increment scenario a bimodal firm distribution with respect to productivity and (specific) skills of workers emerges. Technological laggards face growing unit labour costs, which reduces their competitiveness and make their market shares shrink. This reinforces market concentration up to a point where all general skill groups in the population profit from the high productivity of the high tech firms. Hence, the economy approaches a state with very high concentration, but decreasing wage inequality. Under the Frequency scenario, such a self-reinforcing concentration dynamic does not arise. If workers all have the same general skill level, only a strongly reduced concentration effect appears under any of the scenarios, which shows that the mechanism crucially relies on the fact that the speed of specific skill acquisition is heterogeneous between workers and that high productivity firms can explicitly target fast learning workers (those with high general skills), which on average also have higher specific skills. Finally, we find patterns of hysteresis, i.e. long run effects of the temporary change in the frontier dynamics, since even after the return to baseline values, the long-run market concentration and inequality dynamics differs depending on which technological regime was active during the period of accelerated technological change. We show that also this path dependency on the aggregate level is driven strongly by the heterogeneous skill distribution. Our setup is related to models that incorporate a technological revolution in settings with labour that is heterogeneous in the ability (or costs) to employ the new machines, such as in Greenwood and Yorukoglu (1997) or Caselli (1999). Accelerated technological change leads to uneven adoption rates of technologies under skill differences among firms and a shift in demand to high ability workers, which in turn increases wage inequality. On the other hand, the mechanism in our model leading to further skill segregation is found in sorting models such as Kremer and Maskin (1996). However, in contrast to our model, the segregation in Kremer and Maskin (1996) is initiated by negative productivity spillovers from low- to high-skilled workers. The higher the complementarity between the different tasks performed by the heterogeneous workers, the stronger the divergence among firms. In our model, segregation is not driven by the organizational setup within the firm, but rather by the feedback loops of firms decisions on labour and capital market reinforcing and amplifying the dispersion. Overall, these mechanisms are inline with aforementioned empirical findings (Dunne et al. 2004; Faggio et al. 2010), which document a link between increasing productivity and wage dispersion on the firm-level. Related to this paper is the canonical task–based model as in Acemoglu and Autor (2011), which offers an explanation on labour market polarization (Autor et al. 2003; Goos et al. 2014). The model in this paper is different in two ways. First, all skill groups are complementary towards capital goods in the Leontief production function and hence, we do not allow for substitution between capital and labour and rely on a fixed capital to labour ratio. Second, we focus on the role of the endogenously evolving industry structure in shaping the labour market under different technological regimes. So far, the theoretical literature has devoted little attention to the impact of firms and competition in shaping polarization on the labour market. The canonical model as in Acemoglu and Autor (2011) is based on a representative firm and only distinguishes between different tasks. In contrast, within the Eurace@Unibi model firms compete and are heterogeneous in productivity. Irrespective of their general skill all workers can be employed and matched with any machine where the advantage of a higher skill level lies in the ability to learn faster during the endogenous formation of the specific skills on the job. The paper is part of a growing literature applying agent-based models to macroeconomic analysis (Dawid and Delli Gatti 2018), labour markets (Neugart and Richiardi 2018) and innovation economics (Dawid 2006). Closely related is Hepp (2021), in which a similar setup is used to investigate the effect of an acceleration in technological change on firm-level determinants of the largest emerging firms. Other previous publications relying on the Eurace@Unibi model focus not only on policy analysis in different areas such as regional cohesion (Dawid et al. 2014; 2018b), banking regulations (van der Hoog and Dawid 2019), fiscal stabilization (Harting 2021), de-unionisation (Dawid et al. 2021), optimal containment policies during the COVID-19 crisis (Basurto et al. 2020), but also on the diffusion of competing technologies in the context of climate change (Hötte 2021) or the role of social networks for inequality dynamics (Dawid and Gemkow 2014). Issues related to inequality dynamics and labour market polarization as well as its interplay with technological change have been studied also in the framework of several other agent-based macroeconomic frameworks. Most prominently, the K+S model has been developed to investigate the interconnection of technological and inequality dynamics (Dosi et al. 2017; 2020a, b). In a recent publication (Dosi et al. 2021), the model is extended to distinguish between endogenously arriving incremental and radical innovations in the upstream sector, whereas the later creates new downstream sectors with a higher product complexity. The focus of the analysis is on the dynamics of labour demand and its interplay with consumption patterns. An earlier extension of the K+S model by Mellacher and Scheuer (2020) incorporates heterogeneous worker types and investigates the skill biased technological change hypothesis in a setting with endogenous technological change. Silva et al. (2012) find increasing wage inequality in a setting with unbiased technological change and labour market frictions stemming from an endogenous matching process. Caiani et al. (2019) show that higher wages for lower skilled workers leads to stronger economic growth in an agent-based model with a segmented labour market, heterogeneous propensities to consume and endogenous innovation rates. Terranova and Turco (2021) present an agent-based model to investigate the dynamics of concentration and stagnation emphasising the importance of technological knowledge accumulation as a source of market power. Finally, Bertani et al. (2020a, b) introduce intangible capital in the Eurace model and investigate the dynamics of increasing returns as well as technological unemployment due to increased investment into the new technologies. The specific contribution of our paper relative to this literature is that we focus on short and long run implications of a temporary acceleration of the speed of the technological frontier and also that we explicitly analyse how the type of technological change, driven by few large innovations or by many small ones, influences the industry dynamics and the evolution of wage distribution. In particular, the consideration of the joint dynamics of endogenous skill adjustment by workers and firm decisions about adoption of newest technology vintages allows us to obtain new insights into the process of innovation driven growth in such a setting. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we sketch the model and in Section 3, we describe the experimental setup for this paper. Results and discussion are given in Section 4 and we conclude in Section 5. Technical details such as the parameter choices as well as results of statistical tests can be found in the Appendix A–B.",2

The capitalist model also remains the only cultural system that seeks to establish itself around the world by exporting societies based on individual interest (Vigliarolo 2017). A large market society is born, guided by individual interests and today more than ever legitimate in the international financial markets, also due to the process of globalization that was about to take place.Footnote 2 In fact, the tension between individual interest and collective/relational identity (we call in these page ontological reason of peoplesFootnote 3) reaches its highest level through economic globalization that reveals important problems that today affect the “quality of democracies”Footnote 4 in terms of affirmation of rights for all. In this direction, a study by Daly and CobbFootnote 5 (1989) shows that, from the second half of the 1970s in the United States of America, the growth of monetary wealth measured through the Gross Domestic Product no longer corresponded to real welfare (which included services and distribution of wealth), but with new poverties and conflicts. A situation that is also observed both in problems with the environment (externalitiesFootnote 6) and with the phenomenon called jobless-growth.Footnote 7 Many factors are at play in this new reality, among them, social behavior as evidenced by the concept of social capital, defined and observed by BourdieuFootnote 8 in capitalist societies. Everything is reduced to personal interests, even social relationships (Vigliarolo 2017). The economy is no longer concerned with carrying forward the identity of the peoples but with maintaining the systems at their level of efficiency (economic positivism). In fact, the father of the most famous Keynes, John Neville Keynes, in 1891 proposed the distinction between positive economics and normative one.Footnote 9 By positive economics is understood “the description of the functioning of an economic system, as it is”; and by normative economics, it is understood “the evaluation of what is desirable for its costs and benefits.” In other words, economic positivism, based on utilitarian rationalism, takes over economic science and leaves out important considerations such as “what kind of society do we want to build?” Considerations that are also built with the tools of the culture and in a relational way (among people and with natural environmental). For all these reasons, we can affirm that individual interests, that is the aim of the micro economy, founded by Adam Smith, are inadequate to carry out the social welfare for all people who live in a relational way; and, on the other hand, the macroeconomy founded by Keynes, deals only with a demand consumption of goods, without saying anything if these goods are related to the rights of peoples or respond only to the imperative of growth. For Amartya Sen, for example, this represents the crucial problem of the contemporary era that needs to be answered, that is, how can we overcome utilitarian rationalism and narrow this gap? With these assumptions, the article proposes the need to reconvert the utilitarian individual reason into a collective ontological reason as the basis of the economy. To this end, it proposes an intermediate space between the micro and the macro, defined meso-economicsFootnote 10 where cultural social values are introduced to guide the economic process and relate it back to what peoples consider important, essential for the life of the whole context. So, we affirm that the factors of an ontological production are no longer only land, labor and capital but also cultural elements reflected in goods and services that give economy a direction in social terms.Footnote 11 In this perspective, a reflection is proposed starting from the actual era of financial capitalism to describe financialization and structural financial crises based on individualistic social capital. Then, the article proposes concepts such as that of the ethical social capital and the demand for peoples’ rights as opposed to an aggregate demand for generic consumer goods and services, at the basis of the formation of an economic socialization process that can be an answer to the problems induced by financialization. Before continuing, it is important to introduce clarify some terms that have been introduced and will be used in the course of the reasoning. With individual interest, taking up the distinction of rational action with respect to an end and a value of Max Weber,Footnote 12 we are referring to an end outside of us, such as, for example, monetary maximization that (typically of the capitalist accumulation system), can contain the separation of the useful bonum from the honest bonum.Footnote 13 That is, the scope is free from implications of the process (how it is achieved) or of ultimate impact in the entire context (social and environmental externalities). It means that the individual interest is not necessarily related with an ontological reason and responds to real need/identity but, in this case, only to maximize financial capital. In this direction, we can read “the real limit of capitalist production is capital itself, it is the fact that capital and its self-valorization appear as a starting point and a point of arrival, as the end of production” Marx (ed. 2012, p. 1083). Or how capitalist production “does not [has] the [primary] purpose of satisfying needs but that of making a profit” (Giacché 2009, p. 22). Related to this definition, an important concept we use in this paper is ontological reason. We refer to an intersubjective dimension that guides the relationship with materiality and social life in the construction of an order that cannot be reduced to a dimension of growth of resources but is linked to values, meanings and principles also reflected in goods and services that people consider important for their lives, needs and determine the full exercise of their rights. That is, the identity of men and women who live in a society also deeply depends on the relationship with others and on the context (even material). So, by ontological reason, therefore, we mean everything that is linked to the identity of a social context (potentially or already constituted) phenomenological observable in terms of rights (aspects of Being) of all the components and agents without compromising, at the same time, the rights of future generations and components (called socio-natural ontological sustainability). Finally, methodologically, in the following reasoning some concepts, such as micro/macroeconomics, will be treated in terms of ideal types,Footnote 14 underlining some characteristics considered important in the context of the proposed arguments. In the following, we can read the different sections in which the arguments will be exposed. We can divide them in two main parts. In the first one, we expose the causes of the loss of the ontological reason of economy in favor of financial interests without relation with production. In the second one, we respond to the question: “How to refound the relationship between society-economy and finance?” With these objectives, the relationship between current financial capitalism and financial crises will be presented in the second paragraph; in the third, the problems due to financialization will be exploited in terms of loss of relationship with society; in the fourth, the so-called new social practices will be exposed, such as social economics and ethical finance in response also to the financialization of the economy; in the fifth, the process of formation of ethical social capital will be exposed starting from the concept of social practice; and, in the sixth, the meso-economy will be defined as a space where all this could be built in terms of the socio-economic process. Finally, in the seventh section, some conclusions will be drawn.",

In his article, “Between Lévi-Strauss and Braudel: Furtado and the Historical-Structural Method in Latin American Political Economy,” Boianovsky (2015) considers ways in which Furtado encountered French methodological influences which he would carry back to economists’ circles in Latin America. Boianovsky (2015, 14) notes that Furtado linked his understanding of “structure” back to Perroux and some others French thinkers outside of the field of economics, including the eminent anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss. However, Boianovsky neglects considering Nogaro’s influences, and then he limits his linking of Byé to Furtado, merely noting that Byé had served as Furtado’s dissertation advisor. Somewhat like Boianovsky, in his article “Furtado, Le Brésil et les Économistes Français: Influences Croisées,” Alain Alcouffe (2008, 13–16) links Furtado back with Perroux, while just mentioning the importance of Byé and altogether neglecting Nogaro’s influences. To degrees, this proves understandable; as Alcouffe focused mainly upon French economists who were visiting Brazil as invited professors, and Nogaro was not listed among them. Author James Cypher registers as an active researcher, author and exponent of American Institutionalism. In his article “The Origins of Developmentalist Theory: The Empirically Based, Historically Contextualized Political Economy of Furtado,” Cypher (2014) presents a precise description of Furtado’s approach and preferred methods. Cypher purports that Furtado appears to adopt his approach and method from Perroux’s teachings. However, while considering Perroux’s influences, Cypher altogether fails to detail influences of other prominent French scholars—such as Byé and Nogaro. What helps to further differentiate this inquiry from the authors and their papers cited above is that I shall advance the position that les trois professeurs français—namely, Perroux, Byé and Nogaro—are best understood as representatives and also exponents of a distinctly French tradition that could be found in France’s larger intellectual scene which spilled over into social sciences, including economics. Though Perroux, Byé and Nogaro could indeed be understood and approached as individuals and as autonomous, independent thinkers, what is advanced with this inquiry is how their approaches appear to generate a synergy that profoundly influenced Furtado’s formation as a development economist. After his stint in Paris that involved his studying and then writing up and defending his doctoral dissertation, Furtado would later contribute towards advancing theory and policymaking in South America across several decades of the post-war era, all of the while reflecting these base French influences from which he benefited during his time at La Sorbonne during the late 1940s. Indubitably, Perroux should be considered one of the most prominent economists in all of France during the 1940s and 1950s. In addition, he educated, trained and influenced a generation of young economists who studied under him. As one of Perroux’s disciples, Byé served not only as Furtado’s thesis advisor, but he also needs to be recognized as a pioneering researcher focused upon systemic imbalances in international trade. This area of research would emerge some years later as one of the key areas of inquiry undertaken by exponents of Latin American Structuralism—including Furtado. Finally, Nogaro could be noted as the main French thinker dealing with economic methodology at the time that Furtado was studying in Paris, and his influences are readily found in Furtado’s appreciation for the historical research upon which his doctoral dissertation is based, as he dealt with the economic colonial history of Brazil across the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.",

Evidence from the “Belgian Big Bang”,July 2022,Tom Duterme,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The question of the emergence of stock exchanges as we know them today — computerised, globalised and in competition — is rarely asked by mainstream economics, which is not very inclined to historicise its object of study. And when it does pay attention, the answer is brief and scathing, governed by one of two complicit determinisms: sometimes the “technological revolution” forced the stock exchanges to modernise; sometimes the “liberalisation of capital movements” put the exchanges in competition with each other, forcing them to converge on the most efficient model. Thus, a representative of this perspective can state that “until recently, exchanges have been considered part of the national identity and, therefore, ‘untouchable’ monopolies with a mutualised structure. This situation was untenable given the increasing international competition arising from new technology and regulatory reforms” (Slimane 2012, p. 50). From an analytical point of view, it follows that the comparative studies of European stock exchanges, mainly carried out by works on “market microstructure”, could be reduced to the usual model of competition; indeed, “exchanges operating in a competitive environment can be analyzed as firms” (Domowitz and Steil 1999, p. 34). From a political point of view, the liberalisation of financial markets appeared to be a natural and necessary evolution. More surprisingly, historical studies of European stock exchanges have also often taken up the postulate of competition as a force for convergence towards the Anglo-Saxon model (introduced in Europe by the 1986 reform of the London Stock Exchange). Thus, at the end of their investigation of the determinants of the Big Bang, Bellringer and Michie (2014) conclude without elaboration that this reform made London “globally competitive”. The effect of the Big Bang on other exchanges seems to constitute an unquestioned “backdrop”, the “context” within which one investigates… but not on which. For example, in the case of the reform of the Paris Stock Exchange, both Cerny (1989) and Lagneau-Ymonet and Riva (2010) treat foreign competition as a backdrop to study, respectively, the originality of a socialist deregulation and the conflict between bankers and stockbrokers. The same is true of Posner’s (2005) cross-cutting work on “new stock markets, created in the context of lively competition among Europe’s stock exchanges” (Ibid, p. 12). In contrast to these two approaches, this article proposes to problematise the role of competition in the emergence of modern stock exchanges from the Evolutionary Political Economy point of view. For this issue is not self-evident and deserves to be problematised: in what cases, and under what conditions, has competition from a foreign exchange in general, and the London Stock Exchange in particular, forced stock market modernisation? As White’s (2013) study of the NYSE in the 1920s illustrates, the forces of competition between stock exchanges are plural, of varying intensity and dependent on institutional factors that deserve analysis. Moreover, the dynamics of cooperation and complementarity between financial centres can just as easily be fostered by globalisation (Schenk 2020). In other words, the decisive impact of foreign competition in the reform process of a national stock exchange is a hypothesis that needs to be tested, rather than a trivial element of context. This article proposes a reassessment of this hypothesis based on a historical study of the reform of the Brussels Stock Exchange. The Evolutionary Political Economy (EPE) approach is particularly suited to this undertaking. Contrary to mainstream economics, it addresses power issues in the evolution of the economic system, thus breaking with any determinism — technological or economic (Hanappi and Scholz-Wäckerle 2021). Contrary to traditional financial history, it opens up to the contribution of many disciplines, including economic sociology — which makes it possible to grasp the weight of social norms and conventions in the evolution of an institution (Cincotti et al. 2020). In addition to its historical contribution, this article offers a first mobilisation of the framework of EPE to the themes of the emergence of modern stock exchanges. On a more theoretical level, it proposes on the one hand to broaden the conceptualisation of power — generally confined to the economic (market power) and political (balance of power) dimensions — in order to embrace cognitive power: we believe that the notion of “performativity of economics”, already well established in other fields such as the Social Studies of Finance (e.g. MacKenzie 2006; Muniesa and Callon 2013), can enrich the framework of EPE. On the other hand, it intends to assert the contribution of economic sociology to EPE: through the concept of “tropes” (Borch 2016), we will grasp the importance of social norms in the emergence of the modern stock exchanges. This article therefore proposes a socio-historical perspective on stock markets. More broadly, it also feeds into the political economy debate on financialisation, understood here as the increase in the power of the financial sector over the rest of the economy (exemplified by shareholder value, tax dumping, etc.). Indeed, the reform of the stock exchanges represents a key step in the advent of finance-led capitalism (Guttmann 2008). In particular, the introduction of competition between financial intermediaries — coupled with incentives for stock market savings — profoundly reshaped the logic of capital allocation: from an elitist investment governed by a relationship of proximity between the saver and the expert and therefore mainly oriented towards national issuers, we have evolved towards a “popular” investment dictated by impersonal diversification strategies and therefore much less focused on national securities. This was a necessary condition for the emergence of a transnational community of investors capable of putting both companies and states in competition. Yet, while the characteristics and consequences of this side of financialisation have been documented in different regional contexts (e.g. Storm, 2018), its causes have been less explored locally. The Belgian case study thus offers a fine-grained view of financialisation “in the making” — which has been pointed as a blind spot in historical approaches to this topic (Beck & Knafo, 2020). The rest of this article is structured as follows. First, we will retrace the main stages of the reform of the Belgian stock exchange, which has so far been poorly documented.Footnote 1 Semi-structured interviews with its main (living) actors, as well as an analysis of the documents that guided this reform, will allow us to grasp the omnipresence of the argument of “international competition” in the debates (Sect. 2.1). Then, we will problematise the argument, using data and analysis that has since become available (Sect. 2.2). The latter will greatly relativise the threat of capital flight to London; it will therefore be necessary to investigate the foundations of the reformers’ argument (origin of the figures, author of the reports…), in order to account for this divergence (Sect. 2.3). It will appear that some minor, even erroneous, documents were brought to the centre of the debates, overshadowing other publications that would probably have oriented the Brussels Stock Exchange differently. Finally, we will identify the roots of this powerful argument (Sect. 3); in this way, we will be able to provide an alternative and more faithful answer to our research question, by assessing — all in all — the economic and rhetorical impact of competition on the emergence of modern stock exchanges.",1

In a pioneering work, Kuznets (1955) investigated the relationship between inequality and economic growth. With the data available, admittedly limited, he concluded that inequality must increase in the early stages of development, and then it would decrease naturally and gradually in later stages. From that work, an idea became widely accepted: after initial stages of income concentration, inequality would naturally decrease as a result of economic development. Although this “inverted U curve” often bears his name, Kuznets (1955) recognized the complexity of the phenomenon and the limitations of his hypothesis. The later literature, however, focused on the economic transition described by him and, in many cases, gave his hypothesis the status of law (e.g., Robinson, 1976). T﻿he “inverted U curve” hypothesis was well suited to the movement of expressive reduction and stability of European and North American inequality observed since the first decades of the twentieth century. The theory also offered an explanation for the growing or persistent concentration of income in peripheral countries. Along with the hypothesis, the perception that “it was enough to be patient, and before long growth would benefit everyone” was globally spread (Piketty, 2014, p. 11).
  In the last decades of the twentieth century, however, the trajectories of inequality in developed countries stopped following the Kuznets hypothesis and the theories that were based on it. Contrary to expectations, the last section of the inequality curve started to take the opposite direction: an upward slope. As Milanovic (2016, p. 47) concludes, “the indubitable increase in inequality in the United States, the United Kingdom, and even in some fairly egalitarian countries like Sweden and Germany, is simply incompatible with the Kuznets hypothesis”.
 In the twenty-first century, the deconstruction of the “inverted U curve” consensus was reinforced by the proposition of a new paradigm on the trajectory of inequality. Studies carried out by Piketty (2014) and his collaborators conclude that the significant reduction of inequality in developed countries cannot be explained by any economic determinism, but essentially by events that caused the compression of capital and its income in the early twentieth century (mainly the 1929 crisis and the two world wars), in addition to public policies implemented from and due to these events.Footnote 1 Even developed countries less directly affected by the physical destruction caused by these shocks underwent social and institutional transformations that resulted from them—such as mass mobilization, invasive government intervention and high taxation of income and capital (Piketty 2014; Scheidel 2017). This new paradigm, however, seems at first to be less relevant for understanding the trajectory of labor income inequality.Footnote 2 Although Piketty (2014) stresses the need to distinguish the nature of different incomes, his approach is mainly dedicated to total inequality measured from the income held by the top end of the distribution—which comes largely from capital. The compression of capital and its income, for the French economist, is responsible for explaining the fall in total inequality. Wage inequality would have remained relatively stable in developed countries since the end of the nineteenth century. Regarding the French case, his main example for the European trajectory, the author states: “The significant compression of income inequality over the course of the twentieth century was due entirely to diminished top incomes from capital” (Piketty 2014, p. 272). Piketty’s reading of the long-term trajectory of inequality, which is robust and enormously influential, requires attention. What happened to wage inequality in the twentieth century? For Piketty’s approach, which prioritizes total income measured from the top, capital income naturally plays a leading role. However, while allowing good inferences about total inequality, top incomes, by definition, do not capture variation within the lower part of the income distribution (Lindert 2015b; Roine; Waldenström, 2015). When the extreme top and capital income are disregarded, and we only address wage inequality, it is possible to see a movement of great compression, which concerns the vast majority of the population. It is this pronounced compression, relatively neglected, that we will examine below. Until the first decades of the last century, wage differentials were assumed to maintain long-term stability (Brown 1979; Clay 1929; Hicks 1948; Reder 1968; Rowe 1928; Thurow 1975). That perception would rapidly change. Based on data from censuses and national case studies, Lydall (1968) concludes that wage differentials in rich countries, such as the USA, the UK, Canada, and Sweden, had gone through significant reductions (Lydall 1968). In the same period, also based on international evidence, Reder (1968) highlights an extensive decline in wage differentials. The author notes that these differentials “appear to have remained constant for relatively long periods of time and then to have declined sharply within a very few years”. This reduction occurred, between 1938 and 1962, in the USA, Canada, and in all the (nine) European countries analyzed, in addition to Australia and New Zealand (Reder 1968, p. 408). Also based on industrial worker’s wage differentials, Brown (1979) argues that there was a widespread compression of inequality in the period of the world wars. The author notes that this compression was preserved even with the suspension of wage controls and the normalization of supply and demand shocks after the end of the conflicts. After the wars, when controls were removed, and some of the shifts in supply and demand were reversed, the same processes and pressures that narrowed the skill differential during the war now worked to reopen it. In the cases we are discussing, however, after neither war did it return to its former size. A major change thus seems to have been brought about within the wage structures concerned. These and other findings have led to a general recognition of a contraction of the differential for skill as a common feature of the developed economies since 1914. (Brown 1979, p. 78) The compression of wage inequality is confirmed by specific national case studies. Data analyzed by Rottier (1957), Routh (1965) and Machin (1996) show a process of significant reduction and relative stability of wage differentials in the UK between the world wars and the 1980s. Similar processes are also found in studies dedicated to the trajectory of wage inequality in Nordic countries (Hibbs and Locking 1996; Rehn 1957), in Portugal and Spain (Guilera 2009) and in Japan (Scheidel 2017). The USA is the greatest example of the leveling discussed. Already pointed out by Redder (1968) and Lydall (1968), the profound decrease in wage inequality at the beginning of the twentieth century has been analyzed again along with attempts to understand its recent increase (e.g., Goldin and Katz 1999; Goldin and Margo 1992; Piketty and Saez 2004). This reduction, observed mainly during the 1940s, is described by Goldin and Margo (1992) as “The Great Compression”. According to these authors, after the Second World War, the USA experienced a “wage structure more egalitarian” than had ever been seen in that country. Even more important is the finding that this “new wage structure remained somewhat intact for several decades” (Goldin and Margo 1992, p. 2).Footnote 3 The North American leveling is also highlighted by Atkinson (2008), who gathers and analyzes evidence from different sources on the trajectory of wage inequality in several developed countries—in addition to some cases that have already been mentioned. Atkinson (2008, pp. 60, 66) notes, for example, that the “Great Compression did indeed take place in Canada, with a timing that suggests that it was not confined to the war years”. Also in Germany, even though data are deficient until the 1950s, there was a “significant fall” in wage inequality from the postwar to the mid-1980s.
 Considering all the compressions discussed, it seems possible to argue that there was a significant leveling of the wage structure from the interwar period onwards; this trend, with greater or lesser fluctuations, would only be reversed in the last decades of the twentieth century.Footnote 4 Roine and Waldenström (2015, p. 508) conclude that wage differentials “declined almost unanimously in Western countries” in the twentieth century. In short, the great leveling of inequality in developed countries seems to go far beyond the top of the distribution (largely composed of capital income), so well analyzed by Piketty (2014).
 Although the wage leveling discussed is associated with the two world wars, with which its beginning coincides, it can hardly be reduced to them. Regarding the USA, Goldin and Morgan (1992) find that the effects of the destruction and chaos of the conflicts are not sufficient to explain the “Great Compression”: the wage structure did not immediately return to pre-war levels, as it did after the First World War, and the compression of wage dispersion was not interrupted after the end of the second conflict. Likewise, Piketty and Saez (2004) conclude that the effects of wars do not explain the maintenance of wage compression in the following decades—which is also true for the European cases. The new wage structures, and especially their maintenance at relatively low levels, are due, we will argue below, to transformations that occurred from the great shocks, but are not limited to their direct effects. It seems certain that the wage compression can hardly be explained by the deterministic hypothesis of the “inverted U curve”. As Roine and Waldenström (2015, p. 508) argue, “the twentieth-century drop in pay differentials does not seem to be driven by the forces suggested by Kuznets”, but mainly by what the authors refer to as “institutional developments”. As we will see, there is a growing understanding that institutional developments, taking different forms in specific national cases, cannot be separated from comprehensive social transformations. We argue that the history of income distribution in the twentieth century, especially with regard to wage dispersion, is associated, along with other factors, with the reconstruction of social norms of equity. The nature of these transformations will be explored in the third part of this paper. Before that, we need to observe the trajectory of inequality in Latin America, where there was no such compression and the social transformations that promoted it elsewhere.",1

Mason,James B. Stewart,William A. Darity Jr.,Male,Male,Male,Male,"This investigation develops insights from stratification economics to examine factors contributing to the persistence of gross wealth disparity between blacks and whites in the USA. The specific focus of stratification economics is on group-based inequality, particularly inequalities between ethnic and racial groups. Ethnic or racial disparities long have been treated as relatively peripheral objects of study in economics, largely relegated to the domain of labor economists, despite the fact that at least one of the major types of group-based inequalities, wealth, bears only a weak relationship to employment and earning outcomes. The magnitude and persistence of American racial wealth disparities have garnered much attention in the social science literature, including the field of economics, over the course of the past 15 years. Sociologists Oliver and Shapiro (2006) launched intensive research in this area with their book Black Wealth/White Wealth. However, traditional approaches have failed to recognize how the economic value of racial identity influences individual and collective wealth-generating processes. In contrast, we focus on the extent to which the wealth gap can be attributed to the cumulative effects of both past and present racism. Wealth differences provide material incentives that encourage the continual reproduction of racism in American society. On the one hand, the race is a form of individual and group property (Harris 1993), that is, a wealth-generating characteristic. On the other hand,  race is also a form of personal identity, that is, a produced good whose demand is responsive to changes in the costliness of racial identity. Darity et al. (2006) and Darity (2005) provide a theoretical framework for the analysis of group membership and identification and the economic implications of investments in-group identity. In this study, we use a game-theoretic model, inspired by the principles of stratification economics, first developed in Darity et al. (2006) that enables us to explore wealth accumulation trajectories and racial identification choices of two hypothetical racial groups across six different social regimes. The six regimes examined are labeled color blindness, equal opportunity and non-racialism, equality of outcomes and payoffs, Invisible Man, phenotype discrimination—tomming and passing, and reparations. Simulations covering one hundred periods are generated for each regime and resulting patterns of wealth disparities and identity decisions are compared across the regimes. We find it makes a major difference whether policies to address intergroup inequality are “universal,” with an anticipated disproportionate benefit for the subordinate group, or they are targeted specifically to benefit the subordinate group. We also find that prospects for an integrated society without a renewal of intergroup differences in wealth depend not only upon closing the wealth gap in the near term but also on structural/institutional changes in the social system. The second section provides a brief discussion of the origins and foci of stratification economics. The third section provides background information about each of the social regimes examined in this investigation. The fourth section introduces the model and presents the simulation results for each regime. The final section summarizes the simulation results, discusses the policy implications of the analysis, and reflects on the future of stratification economics.",7

Davis,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In economics, saying people are socially embedded means their social relationships affect individual behavior. This can be understood in a weak sense, as in mainstream economics when people’s social identities (Akerlof and Kranton 2000) or social preferences (Fehr and Fischbacher 2002) are included in their utility functions. It is a weak sense in that since people are still individual utility maximizers, social relationships only count for as much in people’s lives as they prefer. Social embeddedness is, in effect, optional, and people remain essentially independent of their social relationships. However, social embeddedness can also be understood in a strong sense, as in heterodox economics when people are viewed as social beings. Social relationships, particularly people’s social identities, play a fundamental role in determining people’s choices in that individual agency is modified by their social relationships, and people act on others’ choices even though their choices are nominally their “own” and are expressed as their “own” choices. This strong sense of social embeddedness has been extensively investigated in social psychology’s social identity theory in terms of how individuals act as representative agents of social groups with which they identify and behave in a pro-in-group/anti-out-group manner (Tajfel and Turner 1979). Essentially, people make choices they believe are in the group’s interest their own choices. People are still individuals, and still make choices independent of their social identities when those identities do not matter, but act as representative agents of those groups when they do. This paper uses this strong sense of social embeddedness to show how economies stratified by social groups, as explained in stratification economics, structurally limit the capability development of individuals in disadvantaged social groups while promoting it for individuals in advantaged social groups. It does this by addressing two questions. What are the mechanisms and processes by which this occurs? And how do these mechanisms and processes reinforce hierarchical relationships between social groups in socially stratified economies? This paper answers these questions by explaining how social identity stigmatization as a micro-level mechanism and social exclusion as a macro-level process interact to reinforce and sustain social group hierarchy in socially stratified societies. It argues that the interaction of stigmatization and exclusion produce two types of shortfalls in people’s capability development compared to what people can achieve in democratic societies. Section 2 advances a model of selective stigmatization whereby, of individuals’ different social identities, the ones stigmatized by individuals in positions of power are those that work to sustain social stratification and existing social group relationships. I characterize capability shortfalls in this case as capability devaluations because they result from what people in positions of power actively do to those over whom they have power. Section 3, drawing on stratification economics, the paper explains how exclusion by social group identity works as a macro-level process to produce a second type of capability shortfall. I characterize capability shortfalls in this case as capability deficits because they reflect average differences between social groups resulting from the overall hierarchical structure of society. Section 4 shows how stigmatization as a micro-level mechanism involving interaction between individuals and social exclusion as a macro-level process involving interaction of social groups work together to produce combined capability shortfalls of individuals for individuals in disadvantaged social groups. It explains this overall effect using a simple, bottom-up/top-down complexity theory analysis developed by Herbert Simon (1962). Nonetheless, it distinguishes social policies aimed at combatting social stratification as they apply to stigmatization as a micro-level mechanism and to social exclusion as a macro-level process, while arguing that they are both needed to foster democratic societies that promote individuals’ capability development irrespective of social identity.",2

Scott III,Kenneth Mitchell,Joseph Patten,Male,Male,Male,Male,"This paper uses stratification economics and an economics of exclusion framework to analyze the student loan system in America (Addo and Darity 2020; Darity 2005; Davis 2019). We study how student loans affect subgroups along racial and class lines in ways that impede or exclude Black and first-generation college students from the wealth and income benefits of higher education (Ards et al., 2015). Orthodox economics assumes individuals possess agency to overcome race, class, and other identities that face discrimination; in contrast, stratification economics refutes this thinking, arguing instead that dominant groups embed unfair advantages into new or reformed policy areas. William Darity (2005) states, “Stratification economics examines the structural and intentional processes generating hierarchy and, correspondingly, income and wealth inequality between ascriptively distinguished groups” (p. 144). Accordingly, stratification economics offers the ideal framework to examine the student loan system because it has generated significant and persistent disparities among groups of borrowers, and it has exhibited via policy and rule choices discriminatory practices that perpetuate financial and social inequities. Financing of higher education did not always exist in its current form. Prior to the 1980s, grants combined with direct government aid to colleges and universities financed higher education, and this coincided with an era when Black, Hispanic, and first-generation students encountered daunting barriers to entry into higher education. For example, up to the end of the 1960s, there were still 19 states operating segregated universities and colleges (Litolff, 2007). Publicly subsidized college costs benefited mostly white students who received the income and wealth gain advantages from low-cost college degrees. This in turn placed college educated white families in a better position than non-white families to participate in the current loan-based system predicated on tapping household wealth (Addo and Darity 2020; Brown 2021; Hamilton and Darity 2017; Houle and Addo 2019). Policymakers claimed greater access and eventual income and wealth gains for underrepresented groups as the official rationale behind the shift from a public-funded system to the current individual-funded system; however, after four decades, these goals remain largely unrealized for Black and first-generation students. Our paper proceeds as follows: First, we examine the history and structure of the student loan system and how, contrary to its original purpose of promoting social mobility, the system has instead created insurmountable student debt traps for many Black, low-income, and wealth-poor student loan borrowers. We identify several factors that explain increasing borrower default rates, and how Black and first-generation students are harmed and ensnared by the system. For example, we find that when looking exclusively at college-educated households, income and wealth inequities between races is both significant and persistent over time. Second, we use data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (2021) and the Survey of Consumer Finances (2021) to analyze intergroup disparities among student loan borrowers based on race and class. Specifically, we address how much student loan debt exists among these groups and the repayment outcomes on this debt. Third, based on our empirical findings, we provide some policy proposals to reduce intergroup college-funding disparities that lead to indebtedness among Black and first-generation college students.",2
3.0,3.0,Review of Evolutionary Political Economy,03 June 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43253-022-00076-5,Economic insecurity in the family tree and the racial wealth gap,October 2022,Jermaine Toney,Darrick Hamilton,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"There is a growing body of literature that documents the magnitude and persistence of the racial wealth gap (Blau and Graham 1990; Sherraden 1991; Conley 1999; Heflin and Pattillo 2002; Shapiro 2004; Altonji and Doraszelski 2005; Oliver and Shapiro 2006; Robles et al. 2006; Taylor et al. 2011; Kochlar and Fry 2014; Meschede et al. 2015; Munoz et al. 2015; De La Cruz-Viesca et al. 2016; Kijakazi et al. 2016). Like other economic indicators, racial difference in wealth is influenced by variations in familial and individual socioeconomic indicators, but it is more affected by racial difference in the socioeconomic status of nonnuclear kin (Darity et al. 2015). Scholars have explored the roles of bequests, inheritance, in vivo transfers, and intergenerational transfers in general (see for example, Gale and Scholz 1994; Menchik and Jianakopolos 1997; Avery and Rendall 1997; Charles and Hurst 2003; Gittleman and Wolff 2004; Nam et al. 2015; Rauscher 2016; Begley 2017). The magnitude of the racial wealth gap is tied to the economic well-being of households. Using the data from the 2009 TNS Global Economic Crisis Study, Lusardi et al. (2011) document that 37.7% of Black households, yet 27.3% of White households, are unable to gather $2000 within the time frame of 30 days. Evidence of uneven economic anxiety is also described in a report by the Federal Reserve Board (2016). In contrast to 66% of White middle-income earners, only 53% of Black middle-income earners disclose that if given a month, they would be able to pay a $400 emergency expense. An explanation for this disparity is that Black middle-income households are more prone to have relatives who are financially insecure (Heflin and Pattillo 2006). According to our analysis of the Federal Reserve’s 2019 Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED) data, Black households are twice (16%) as likely to borrow from family or friends during an emergency compared to their White counterparts (7%). Indeed, Chiteji and Hamilton (2002) find that middle-income Black families are linked to a higher prevalence of economic insecurity in relatives (parents and adult siblings), which is the third largest contributor to the racial wealth gap, below that of an indicator of permanent income and the wealth holdings of their parents. This paper updates estimates of the analysis by Chiteji and Hamilton (2002), extends the breadth and depth of economic insecurity of relatives, and widens the scope of the intergenerational framework to grandparents, parents, adult children, and cousins. We focus on grandparents and cousins because they are members of the same family tree; yet, they have grown up in different public policy regimes or historical racial orders. We map our Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) sample of generational peers and multiple generations (see Appendix 8.) to a racial order, a decision that is motivated by Dawson and Francis (2016) and Dawson (2014), who contend that a racial order is associated with a given historical moment and can powerfully influence intergroup disparities in socioeconomic status. Note that our grandparent sample (first generation) is in their teenage years in 1968. Given this, the sample is lower bounded by the Jim Crow era (Emancipation to the March on Washington), which was characterized by legal terror and segregation, and upper bounded by the Civil Rights era when there was greater access to full participation and citizenship. Our contemporary sibling and cousin samples (relational peers in the third generation) are below the age of 22 in 1984, which places them under the neoliberal racial order. The origins of the neoliberal racial order date back to the tenure of President Ronald Reagan, circa 1981 to 1989 (Dawson 2014; Dawson and Francis 2016), during which time there were direct and indirect effects on the attainment of socioeconomic status and wealth, such as market restructuring and widespread deregulation. In this paper, we hypothesize that wealth accumulation will be greatly weakened for middle-income households with proximity to a larger kin network of economic hardship. We estimate the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition with indicators of three generations of kin network economic hardship and find that economic insecurity in the family tree is one of the largest contributors to the Black-White wealth gap among middle-income earners, even more so than educational attainment. By exploring these dynamics, we bring additional insight into how familial networks of affluence and poverty contribute to wealth inequality.",2

The economics of institutional variety in a pandemic,April 2023,Smita Srinivas,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Under what conditions is industrial policy sustainable? Can the pandemic’s real-world industry response point to how sustainability might emerge in industries? A wide economics and economic development scholarship now recognises industrial development as an institutional process of transformation driven by distinct technological capabilities. This acknowledgment that there may be various ways to achieving industrial development is partly recognised in policy parlance by the SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure). UNIDO (2022) for example, defines industrial response during COVID-19 as central to the context of SDG 9. “Findings documented in the report strongly reaffirm the centrality of Sustainable Development Goal 9 (SDG 9) to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” (UNIDO 2022, xi), and goes further to define SDG 9: Sustainable Development Goal No. 9 (SDG 9): Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation. This goal promotes raising industry’s share of employment and GDP by 2030, integrating small-scale industrial and other enterprises into value chains and markets, upgrading infrastructure and industries with greater resource-use efficiency, using clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes, boosting scientific research, upgrading technological capabilities and encouraging innovation (UN 2015) (UNIDO 2022, xviii). This paper argues that a significant institutional variety (IV) of industrial customs, norms, guidelines, standards, regulations and other laws, exists in industrialising contexts. In principle, there are different ways of constituting, combining and carrying out such economic activity. Micro-level industrial and technology adjustment cannot always replicate a European or US template, and this is well recognised in economic development analysis. However, it is less well recognised that while different ex-ante institutional combinations are in principle possible, only some combinations of institutions are technologically possible and industrially sustainable in practice. This combinatorial open-endedness, yet specificity, requires more explicit attention (Srinivas 2018, 2020, 2021a, b). The pandemic experience has underscored these gaps of understanding nations and industries’ responses. Wealthier industrialised countries and their health systems have experienced major economic and health hurdles. In the first full year of the pandemic, 2020, world gross domestic product (GDP) dropped by 3.3 percent, an estimated loss of 255 million full-time jobs, and an expected additional 97 million people into poverty (UNIDO 2022, 4). Industrial impact was widespread and adaptation mechanisms wide: Survey data during COVID-19 of a sample of firms in 26 Developing and Emerging Industrial Economies (DEIEs) small and medium enterprises (SMEs) show clear impact from the pandemic within every size category, and service sectors, firms or industries vulnerable to COVID-19. Furthermore, SMEs may experience an impact 10 times or more what larger firms experienced, and after the height of the pandemic, a drop in sales 14 times higher than larger firms in the ‘robust’ industry category (UNIDO 2022, 5). For some industrialising nations in particular, pandemic and war geopolitics outside their controls have required new institutional combinations to maintain essential commodity and energy supply chains and urgent focus on indigenous technology development and domestic investment sites. Despite technology transfer barriers for the last 40 years in domains such as semiconductors, nuclear, aviation, aerospace (satellites and rocketry), food, chemicals and biotechnologies, investment has risen in Asian economies as investors (domestic, overseas migrants, institutional) all seek stability. India as the fastest growing economy today and the world’s fifth largest economy, with World Bank growth forecasts of 6.9%. It has seen a 13% rise in FDI with digital sector dominance across multiple sectors and a record inward remittance for a single country of $100 billion expected in 2022 (World Bank 2022). Given China’s 4% rise in 2020, Chinese political disruptions and pandemic shutdowns in 2021–2022 and the continuing Russia-Ukraine war, both China and India seek investment, growth and lend urgency to ‘sustainable’ industrial policy reforms. Furthermore, industrialised economies of Asia have also participated in global supply chains and acted as suppliers to other non-Asian industrialised economies during the pandemic (Falk et al. 2021). Data also shows that during COVID-19, ‘sustainability’ of industries and their regional impact is correlated to the adaptation to severe drop in demand, access to resources (including labour-intensive goods and services since people were under lock-down or ill) and management of logistics bottlenecks (including national border closings). Table 1 indicates industrial response as “robust” or “vulnerable”. This industrial data does not however clearly resolve which combination of institutions (norms, customs, guidelines, standards, regulation, laws) emerges as resilient, but it can accept that societies may move toward different types of combinations that, at least for a while, serve them well in building technological capabilities during and despite the pandemic. Moreover, only some countries have had ‘sufficient’ technological capability and institutional adaptability to manage trade shutdowns and domestic response. Only some institutional combinations are thus ‘sustainable’, i.e. adaptable, resilient, or less costly in health, ecological, or financial terms across time. These institutional adjustments in some industrialising economies have also been possible under shorter time scales than might have been expected. Regions, industries, firms and workers are therefore axes that can throw some light (if not full conclusions) on the effects by the end of 2021 (see UNIDO 2022 Report summary). Thus, while it appears that some ‘developing’ countries managed better ‘than expected’, these responses require more micro and meso-level context to study and evaluate. COVID-19 has also required substantial (and “robust”) health industry response itself, creating technological investments and generating new science and manufacturing pressures. The structure of this paper is thus as follows. Section 2 lays out the challenges of the combinatorial approach to institutional variety in evolutionary political economy and why it is essential to debates on sustainable industries. Section 3 addresses two co-existing health sector cases in India that saw sharp demand and uncertainty during the pandemic (1) Ayurveda and (2) oxygen production and delivery, to analyse the nature and degree of their institutional variety and ‘industrial’ facets. Section 4 presents preliminary observations of the two cases. Section 5 discusses ecological and economic facets of SIPs in health to connect institutional variety and industrial sustainability.

Doing so is important because mainstream economic accounts are highly influential: they have, in essence, shaped industrial policy making in Africa (Hutchful 2002; Killick 2010; Stiglitz et al. 2013). Also, existing studies have long subjected more classical, institutional and evolutionary economics theorising about industrial policy to systematic empirical research both in Africa (e.g., Peil 1972; Jeffries 1978; Andræ 1981; Whitfield 2018) and elsewhere (see, for example, Amsden 1989; Rodrik 2014; Noman and Stiglitz 2015; Gollin et al. 2016; Aiginger and Rodrik 2020), in both policy (Quartey et al. 2020) and popular (The Economist 2020a, 2021a) analyses. Some studies have tried to evaluate mainstream theories of industrial policy, too (e.g., Ewusi 1981), but these theories have in more recent years evolved (Rodrik 2014; ﻿Aiginger and Rodrik 2020; Weiss 2020). The embrace of industrial policy in mainstream economics in which there is a more active role for the state in setting conditions for industrial take-off is quite distinct from the prevailing theory during the era of structural adjustment programmes in which economic policy focused on removing barriers to private sector participation and on creating a conducive business environment. In addition, the new mainstream economic theory of industrial policy gives more room to new institutional economics, greater space for ecological considerations, and fresh arenas for indigenisation. The question is whether this new theory is analytically sound in terms of what it promises regarding growth, redistribution, and sustainability. Our review of the literature (Obeng-Odoom 2022) shows that we know quite a lot about the prospects of state-led industrial policy, both in terms of space and time, and quite a the class power of manufacturing workers, and economic growth. However, many questions remain. Theorising industrial policy across and within schools of thought seems to require a little more work. Probing questions of sustainability and linking them to growth and not just spatial inequality, but also social inequalities within space constitute a second research frontier. Third, and most fundamentally, industrial policy research appears to be about capital and its accumulation. Much like the global literature, barely any of the studies on industrial policy has given a central place to urban land, which is usually framed as marginal to industrial policy making or theorising, except in the role of creating an ‘enabling environment’ for capital to flourish. Oil cities in Africa constitute a point of departure for raising three resulting research questions (RQ): (1) What are the essential features of the urban economic growth that arises from implementing the new mainstream economic theory of industrial policy (Growth)? (2) How congruent are the claims of the new mainstream economic theory of industrial policy with the empirical realities of trends in urban inequalities (Distribution)? (3) In what ways have the implementation of the new mainstream industrial policy shaped urban socio-ecological experiences (Sustainability)? Existing research on oil in Ghana abounds. Major studies (e.g., Obeng-Odoom 2014, Heilbrunn 2014; Andrews and Siakwah 2021) have typically focused on the resource curse theory, Dutch disease, anomie, social dysfunction, factor endowment hypothesis, neo patrimonialism, and rent seeking. Therefore, they examine oil and deindustrialisation (Dutch Disease); not oil,  industrialisation, and the new theory of industrial policy based on which I have raised three research questions. To address such questions, it is crucial to develop a specific institutional political- economic approach, central to which is land from which oil is extracted either onshore or offshore. Such a methodology must also prioritise Africa, which, although it was central to W. Arthur Lewis’s pioneering theorising about industrial policy (Lewis 1953) is typically the focus of relatively little research. Yet, Africa is a major seat of oil production in the world: 11 per cent of global production and 8 per cent of total global reserves (Obeng-Odoom 2014, 2020). Just as importantly, contrary to claims that Africa is deindustrialising (Rodrik 2015), Africa is, in fact, reindustrialising. The share of manufacturing workers in sub-Saharan Africa increased from 7.2 per cent to 8.4 per cent between 2010 and 2021. Since 2001, manufacturing output has increased by 91 per cent (The Economist 2021a, p. 30). Based on this approach, I focus on Sekondi-Takoradi, Ghana’s oil cities, to evaluate the orthodox case for industrial policy. Using metropolitan data, plans, and laws, along with regional and national data from census and survey reports, this paper argues that industrial policy has been too strictly tied to (urban) economic growth which has not, contrary to the theorising, led to ecologically sensitive (urban) economic development. Growth policies have cumulatively generated rising urban inequalities and ecological problems in the twin Ghanaian oil cities. This lack of congruence between the case for, and outcomes from, the pursuit of a particular industrial policy can be partly explained by insufficient industrial policy engagement with persistent inequality and unsustainability. More fundamentally, it can be explained by the presence of Henry George’s (1879/1935, pp. 118, 125, 128) concept of ‘absentee and alien landlord’Footnote 1, a class which, according to George, lived off the private appropriation of socially created rents in places to which they had no attachment and in which they considered their presence temporary. In turn, absentee landlords have no interest in making long-lasting investment. Because these absentee landlords do not actually contribute to production, the ‘resource rents’ they demand are draining, a payment by producers to speculators for which there is little or no return for the land (George 1879/1935, p. 128). An alternative industrial policy should seek to recoup socially created, but privately appropriated, unearned income, reinvest this resulting revenue in ways that directly build state capacity, directly address persistent inequalities, directly attend to ecological crises, and directly seek to create industries that avoid the problems of ‘progress and poverty’, which Henry George (1879/1935) famously showed were the ‘cause of industrial depressions and increase of want with increase of wealth’. Marion J. Levy, Jr. (1997, p. xxi) has even called for ‘absentee governance’ ‘to alert us to the lack of participation and statesmanship that becomes ever more critical as we become ever more interdependent’. These arguments are developed in three sections. Theoretical Claims discusses mainstream economic theorising about industrial policy, resulting studies, and remaining questions. Researching Ghana describes how the research questions are addressed, and Results provides answers to the research questions.",4
