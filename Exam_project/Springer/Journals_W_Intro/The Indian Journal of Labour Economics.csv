Zimmermann,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"For too long, research efforts in labour economics have concentrated largely on the provision of jobs and decent work conditions. Often, however, poor health conditions lie at the root of inequality and poverty. While it is broadly accepted that general health is important for welfare and work performance, the relevance of mental health is still widely ignored. Therefore, this paper makes a case for the relevance of mental health to labour economics, draws attention to the under-documented fact that mental health problems may arise due to exogenous health shocks, like arsenic poisoning of drinking water, and investigates the effect of drinking arsenic-contaminated water on mental health. If the arsenic level in water is unsafe, drinking it for a prolonged period can lead to arsenicosis, symptoms of which include black spots on the skin and subsequent illnesses, such as various cancers. This may have consequences not only for the well-being of those affected and their families, but also for their labour supply, productivity and poverty. Education and appropriate information provision may help the affected adjust better, as individuals and in communities. The empirical background draws on data from a household survey in Bangladesh, a country with wide (natural) arsenic contamination of groundwater, to construct several measures for arsenic contamination. These measures include the actual arsenic level in the respondent’s tubewell and past institutional arsenic test results, as well as the collected arsenicosis symptoms of household members and their physical and mental health. It is found that suffering from an arsenicosis symptom is strongly and negatively related to mental health, even more so than from other illnesses. Section 2 discusses the relevance of mental health issues for labour economics. Section 3 explains how mental health or subjective health well-being can be measured. Section 4 presents the issue of arsenic contamination of drinking water. Section 5 documents the efforts to trace the causal effects of drinking arsenic-contaminated water on the likelihood of experiencing mental health problems. Finally, Section 6 concludes and discusses the policy implications.",1

The reasoning for this argument originates from the so-called ‘rigid’ labour laws, which allegedly do not allow industries to fire workers when needed. The argument sounds convincing, especially when one reads that our labour laws appear to protect the rights of workers rather than of industry, but there is little empirical evidence of significant labour market inflexibility that hinders industry from adjusting labour cost during downturns. This study draws its justification from the fact that the empirical literature, which supports the notion that there is inflexibility in the labour market during downturns and upturns in the manufacturing sector in India, is miniscule. One strand of literature from other countriesFootnote 1 argues that during recessions, fall in employment is deeper in recession than the rise during boom while fall and rise in output are of same intensity during recession and boom respectively. If short-run fluctuations occur in labour markets, they may have significant implications on total employment in the economy.Footnote 2 Comprehending short-run responses of employment to output provides useful insights into the short-run dynamics of their relationship, and these insights help in designing policy responses to optimise outcomes in recession. This paper examines these arguments in the context of the organised manufacturing sector in India. Specifically, it tries to answer the following questions. Are employment fluctuations strongly asymmetric? Does output fall as sharply in recessions as it rises in booms? Are falls in employment sharper than outputs? How does employment respond to falls and rises in output? Theoretically, demand for labour is derived from output, and the association between the two is assumed to be positive. The equilibrium condition for a profit-maximising firm restricts the elasticity of production with respect to the variable factor input between 1 and 0, which means that the average and marginal products of labour are declining but positive. These limits on the production function determine a feasible range for the demand for labour. The operation of diminishing production to variable input makes the demand-for-labour curve downward-sloping. This reasoning predicts that the elasticity of labour demand with reference to output will range between 0 and (-)1. Since output is positively associated with labour, and their relation is guided by diminishing returns in production, any decline in output reduces employment more than its rise with respect to an increase in output. Hence, average and marginal productivity of labour will also increase during such range. The fall in output slows down utilisation of existing capacity and results in the rise of the average and marginal products of labour. Labour responds more to downward shifts in the production function than to the movement along the curve during recession. Conversely, during the operation of increasing returns, the demand for labour responds in a manner opposite to what has been concluded assuming diminishing returns. Moreover, at the macro level, heterogeneity among firms becomes decisive, as do adjustments. Firms vary in size of operation, nature of product, technology intensity, and stage of production as per variable returns to labour. Firms facing increasing returns may respond differently than firms facing decreasing returns. Similarly, large firms may react to the situation differently than small firms. In fact, reactions towards skilled and unskilled workers may also differ. These predictions of economic theory are cross-checked against the data. The rest of the paper is divided into the following parts: (2) review of studies; (3) data and methodology; (4) empirical analysis; (5) panel estimation; and (6) conclusion.",
59,2,The Indian Journal of Labour Economics,04 April 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41027-017-0052-9,Rural wages in India: Recent trends and determinants,June 2016,Himanshu,Sujata Kundu,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female," In rural areas, the growth rate of real wages started decelerating in November 2013. This followed a period of rapid rise in agricultural and rural wages since 2007–08, unprecedented in the post-independence history of India. Although various explanations were offered for this sudden rise in rural wages, the debate is far from settled. While proper understanding of the factors responsible for the acceleration in the rise in rural wages is important in itself, it is also crucial in understanding two related phenomena in the Indian economy, both of which coincided with the rise. First, an improvement in rural real wages impacts rural poverty and, therefore, has positive welfare implications. Second, if not accompanied by productivity gains, an improvement in rural real wages can influence food prices by enhancing demand and pushing up the cost of production.  Several studies look into these two dimensions separately and show how rural wages correlate with rural poverty (Bardhan 1984; Sen 1996; Deaton and Drèze 2002; Datt and Ravallion 2007; Reddy 2003, cited in Vakulabharanam 2007; Radhakrishna and Chandrasekhar 2008).Footnote 1 Moreover, real wage is also an approximate poverty indicator in its own right, because it measures the reservation wage, i.e., the lowest wage at which labourers are prepared to work if the labour market is competitive, at least on the supply side. Therefore, examining rural wages becomes important as an indicator of rural workers’ well-being. It has been argued that a rise in wages unaccompanied by increases in productivity could build up a wage–price spiral by raising aggregate demand on the one hand and pushing up production cost on the other, thereby balancing, or offsetting, the positive effect upon welfare (Nadhanael 2014; Guha and Tripathi 2014). The rise in rural wages, particularly between 2007–08 and 2010–11, was such that the rate of growth of rural nominal wages was higher than the inflation in consumer price indices, hinting at larger macroeconomic implications. In this context, this paper will, first, go over briefly the levels and trends of rural wages in India in nominal and real terms over the last decade. Second, it will look into various factors that have played a major role in determining the changes in wage rates. By undertaking a detailed and disaggregated analysis of changes in wage rates in rural India, particularly since the late 1990s, this study attempts to contribute to the debate among academicians and policymakers over the causes of the unprecedented rise in rural wage rates. Although many studies analyse trends and variations in rural wage rates in India, most of these analyses are at the state-level (Bardhan 1970, 1973; Bardhan 1973; Lal 1976; Jose 1974, 1978, 1988, 2013; Tyagi 1979; Narayanamoorthy and Deshpande 2003; Himanshu 2005; Srivastava and Singh 2006; Usami 2011).Footnote 2 But considerable variations exist between districts and regions in states, which often vary with respect to a large number of socio-economic, demographic, and institutional factors. Therefore, it has been correctly pointed out in Acharya (1989) and Himanshu (2006) that regression analysis carried out at the state-level to explain factors determining rural wage rates may average out regional variations across states and lead to misleading and erroneous conclusions. Hence, it is important to carry out region-level studies to form a concrete idea of the formation and variations in rural wage rates. This study, using wage data from Wage Rates in Rural India (WRRI) at the state-level and data from National Sample Survey (NSS) Employment and Unemployment Rounds at the state and region levels, extends the analysis by Acharya (1989) and Himanshu (2006), and thereby fills a void in the literature.Footnote 3 It seeks to address the issue at the level of both states and agro-climatic regions. It tries to cover a much longer period than earlier studies. Therefore, the results obtained here will likely portray reality better than earlier studies. The paper has been organised as follows. Section 2 provides a brief review of the literature with regard to the formation of rural wages, and factors determining levels and trends in rural wage rates and their regional variations. Section 3 provides details of the various data sources used in this study and their limitations as pointed out in the literature, and indicates the major data sources on rural wages in India. Further, it states the reference points used in this analysis and briefly goes over the trends in rural wages observed in the past decade. Section 4 provides the results obtained from the regression analyses carried out to look into the major factors of the trends in rural wage rates. This is followed by a brief conclusion in Sect. 5.",8

These MNCs relocated their production centres to developing countries, where labour is cheap and abundant (Bacchus 2005), and set up mostly export-oriented, labour-intensive manufacturing industries, such as modern electronics and traditional garments. These industries provided women new opportunities, and benefited them (Caraway 2007), but adopted flexible practices and violated labour rights to minimise production cost, which led to deterioration in working conditions (Standing 2011). This dichotomy has stimulated great debate among scholars and policymakers on the nature of women’s employment in the modern manufacturing sector, especially in developing countries like India. The Indian economy has experienced decent growth during recent years (7.6 per cent in 2015–16 and 7.2 per cent in 2014–15) after a sluggish performance in the preceding years (4.7 per cent in 2013–14, 5.6 per cent in 2012–13 and 6.2 per cent in 2011–12). This was spurred by strong manufacturing sector growth, which reached 9.3 per cent per annum in 2015–2016 (ILO 2016). The manufacturing sector, which contributes 15 per cent to India’s GDP and just 12.6 per cent of total employment (Kapoor 2015), generated 17 million jobs between 1999–2000 and 2011–12. It has the capability of creating employment opportunities for large numbers of India’s low-skilled and unskilled unemployed. In particular, women’s employment (9.8 per cent in 1999–2000 to 13.4 per cent in 2011–12) has increased more than men’s (11.4 per cent in 1999–2000 to 12.5 per cent in 2011–12) during 2004–05 to 2011–12 (Goldar 2013). This phenomenon is more pronounced in modern manufacturing, such as the electronics industry. With technological upgradation, and rising demand of electronic goods, the electronics manufacturing industry has expanded rapidly, and created a large number of low-investment assembly jobs for women (Mehta 2016). Under the Government of India schemes of ‘Make in India’ and ‘Digital India’, electronics manufacturing has been identified as a key industry, and is expected to create 1.8 million additional jobs. These additional jobs would be productive, and would hence provide reasonable level of income to the worker and also generate surplus for further growth and employment creation (IER 2016). Against this backdrop, this paper raises two questions. What kinds of job is modern manufacturing creating for women? What are the factors shaping access to better quality jobs in the electronics manufacturing industry? The paper is organised as stated. Section 2 reviews the literature. Section 3 presents the paper’s objectives. Section 4 provides the framework and methodology. Section 5 discusses the findings. Section 6 provides the conclusions and makes policy suggestions.",

It is generally observed that family responsibilities affect both men and women. However, they affect women more due to gender stereotyping of roles at home, such as caring for children and the elderly. Time-use surveysFootnote 1 of 26 OECD (The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries and three OECD enhanced engagement countries (China, India and South Africa) indicate that on an average, women devote more than twice as much time to household work as men (OECD 2012). Family constitutes a large part of personal life. The term reconciliation reflects the tensions underpinning the relationship between work and family responsibilities.Footnote 2 As traditional care givers, women particularly find themselves under increasing pressure to manage responsibilities of both paid work, unpaid domestic work and care work. The term “work-life balance” is used in policy debates concerned with the distribution of time and effort between work and other aspects of life.Footnote 3 Much of the academic literature on care has discussed the conflicting situation experienced while balancing work and family (Bittman and Rice 2002; Glezer and Wolcott 1998; Kaila 2005). Many feminist scholars have talked about the redistribution of unpaid work at home and renegotiation of responsibilities within households, to ensure equitable division of labour between men and women and the role of the state to absorb some of the responsibilities formerly performed by households (Fraser 1996; Bittman 2004; Razavi 2007; Beneria 2010). Much of the feminist legal scholarship has reiterated that recognition of care as a right, distribution of care rights and recognition of social reproduction is equally important as employment relations (Busby 2011; Fudge 2013). It is generally observed that in most organisations, employee-related workplace policies and practices rest on the age-old assumption of male employees having a dependable support system back home, run presumably by their wives to take care of their familial responsibilities and also personal needs; thereby allowing them time and energy to focus exclusively on their professional contribution and growth (Saxena and Bhatnagar 2009). However, in the present context, as women engage in many professional endeavours, there is also an increase in dual-earner families. Reconciling the demands of paid work and household work and care responsibilities becomes even more challenging for women workers. Such a situation induces increasing pressure on them due to the institutionalisation of gender stereotypical roles which categorise them as traditional care givers. There is no denying that the sustenance of women in the labour market depends largely on effective policies at the workplace on work and family life reconciliation. Women who enter the labour force at an early age and have childcare and family responsibilities bear this double burden and may spend less time on labour market activities due to their domestic household responsibilities. The increasing trend towards informalisation with the increase in contract employment has deprived many workers from access to all social security benefits. As organisational polices have been mostly in favour of permanent employees, most women workers who are in contractual and part-time employment are placed in a disadvantageous position, nor are they  eligible for any social security benefits, especially maternity related benefits and childcare. It thus becomes important to examine state and organisational policies that would encourage more women to take up paid work and simultaneously ensure greater gender equality in sharing of domestic and care roles. After stating the research methodology, this article begins by examining international developments on the recognition of the right to care and ‘Workers with Family Responsibilities Convention,’ 1981 (ILO No. 156). The article discusses the main findings of the study with respect to the organisational policies in the five sectors in which the respondents were working. The focus is to understand women’s experiences and how organisational policies affect their ability to reconcile work and family responsibilities. In the end, the paper puts forth policy recommendations for effective organisational policies that enable women to balance their professional and family responsibilities as well as promote greater gender equality in taking up care and domestic roles.",
59,3,The Indian Journal of Labour Economics,17 August 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41027-017-0062-7,Influence of NREGS on Agricultural Wage Determination in West Bengal: A Dynamic Panel Approach,September 2016,Amit Kundu,Sanjib Talukdar,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Government of India has initiated the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS), whose basic objective is to provide 100 full man-days of employment to each willing rural household in each financial year. It is expected that the NREGS can generate income support for the poor and raise agricultural productivity and profitability in the long run by creating different productive assets related to agriculture. For example, the Employment Guarantee Programme (EGP) in Maharashtra was able to avert famine during the drought of 1970-73 and reduced poverty. The Rural Public Works Programme in Bangladesh significantly contributed to rural development and increased agricultural productivity through the creation and maintenance of rural infrastructure (Drèze and Sen 1991). Employment generation through the NREGS emphasised income insurance in the agricultural labour market where seasonality plays a critical role (Basu 2013). Public works programmes have long been instituted as measures of poverty alleviation during times of economic distress. These programmes have been implemented by policy makers globally—Botswana (1960), the Indian state of Maharashtra (1978), Tanzania (1978), Chile (1987), Bangladesh (1983), The Philippines (1990), Pakistan (1992) and Kenya (1992). The distinguishing feature of NREGS is its rights-based framework, under which the programme “guarantees” 100 days of minimum-wage employment to each rural household in the country (Mahajan 2015). Initially, it was thought that employment would be provided mainly during the agricultural slack season when the rural poor especially, the landless labourers were absolutely jobless. Dev (1995) reported that Maharashtra’s EGP and agricultural employment were complementary in the sense that EGP employment was high during the lean season (April–July) and low during the peak season (October–January). He showed that in two villages within Maharashtra, a negative correlation was observed between the EGP employment and agricultural employment, where the values were −0.68 and −0.33, respectively. On this basis, he concluded that NREGS should not compete with agricultural labour-hiring decisions. But, to reach the target and for proper utilisation of funds, the local panchayats should sometimes offer jobs under the NREGS even during the agriculturally busy season within the multiple cropping framework mainly during the period of cultivation after the rains. Before getting employment through NREGS, it is required to have job card from local panchayat.  As a result, the agricultural labour households had two choices: either the labourer could work as an agricultural labourer or under the NREGS. The small as well as marginal farmersFootnote 1 also had two choices. They could commence agricultural production for the second crop with the help of hired and family labourers or could engage themselves and their family members under the NREGS on the assumption that all the working members of the marginal farm households were job card holders. This actually increased their bargaining power and forced the landholders of farmer households to raise the workers’ wages during the hiring period. Basu et al. (2009) developed a theoretical model to analyse different implications of such public policy in the context of the labour market. According to them, such a programme introduced ‘contestability’ in the agricultural labour market where the government and the landlords were two different employers. They had shown that the outcome with respect to wages and the overall levels of employment in the labour market depended on the degree of distributional concerns of the planners. In effect, the implementation of the NREGS raised the reservation wages of the agricultural labourers in an imperfectly competitive rural labour market, which could reduce private employment in a standard framework (Kundu et al. 2014). Reddy (2013) comments that the introduction of the NREGS, with minimum and equal wages for male and female workers, did bring about not only an increase in the overall agricultural wages but also, a reduction in the male-female wage differential. According to him, wage increases were reported in a number of states like Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat and West Bengal etc. and higher wages in NREGS diverted workers from agriculture and created labour shortages there. The Report of the Commission on Agricultural Costs and Prices (2012) issued by the Government of India has argued that the NREGS has been one of the factors contributing to an increase in agricultural wages. The report mentioned that the trend in real wages of the farm labourers, irrespective of gender, increased at a slower pace between 2000 and 2004, but thereafter, the real farm wages increased significantly, which coincided with the phase of NREGS implementation. Haque (2013) comments that the NREGS resulted in a substantial increase in market wage rates of the agricultural and the non-agricultural labourers and notes that the fact is confirmed by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) 66th Round. Contrary to the above observations, Mahajan (2015) explained that public works programmes like NREGS had made little impact on the enhancement of agricultural wage rates. But, in her empirical exercise, she did not mention that agricultural wages in a particular period are very dependent on the agricultural wage rates of the same region in the previous period. Actually, Osmani (1991) maintains that agricultural labourers could refuse to accept wage rates less than what they got in the previous period for fear that it would lower the wages for everybody—in the present and the future. But this concept was markedly absent in Mahajan’s paper. It is clear that the NREGS is an important public works programme initiated by the Government of India and substantial funds have been allocated to it. In this context, after addressing the limitations of the above investigations, it must be seen whether NREGS’s expansion may be held responsible for the gradual enhancement of farm wages. The investigation was undertaken on the basis of a district-level study in West Bengal, an agriculturally developed Indian state, which however, witnessed a gradual fall in participation of people as agricultural labourers in agricultural activities. According to different NSSO reports, in 1993-94, 64.7 per cent of the total labour force in West Bengal was engaged in agricultural labour, but between 2009 and 2010, these figures declined to 59.4 per cent. This was indicative of a rise in unemployment in rural West Bengal, which happened because, after successful implementation of land reforms, there was a clear decline in the size of land holdings of the farm households. A large section of the marginal farmers had to depend on their families for labour during cultivation. Against this backdrop, the expansion of the NREGS proved vital to enhancing the cropping intensity in West Bengal (Kundu and Talukdar 2016). In West Bengal, it has been observed that there is a huge gap between the numbers of job cards issued and the numbers of households demanding employment. The extent of the gap has varied from district to district. In terms of expenditure of available funds, the rating of the first phase districts in West Bengal has not been very high. It may be noticed that except in 2008-09, there have been gradual enhancement in the utilization of NREGS related funds in all the districts of West Bengal over the years after implementation of this programme. However, it is also evident that none of the first phase districts have been able to utilise the available funds, totally. This reflects a lack of initiatives on the part of the implementing agencies. Summarily, it may be understood that fund utilisation has been improving and this may be attributed to the constant persuasion from the state. Let us now consider the number of days of employment available to the rural households under this scheme in West Bengal. While the generation of employment of at least 100 days is the basic target of all activities in the rural employment guarantee scheme, this is a legal guarantee and the objective is to provide livelihood security in rural areas. The scheme’s success depends on the extent to which it is possible to provide livelihood security. The district-wise performance with regard to employment generation per household, however, shows considerable variations especially since none of the districts have been able to come close to the minimum target set in the employment guarantee scheme notwithstanding the fact that performances of districts have varied. Despite this huge gap between 100 days of employment and the number of days for which employment is actually generated, the available data shows that a few households have managed to get 100 days of employment in a year. Since the present exercise covers the period up to 2012-13 and due to the unavailability of relevant NREGS data on West Bengal for 2011-12 and 2012-13, the above analyses pertain to the years 2006-07 to 2010-11. However, there is a common message that the performance of West Bengal under the NREGS turned positive from 2011-12 onwards. A clearer picture emerges from Table 1 while the inter-district picture related to NREGS work is evident in Table 2. Section-1 of this paper specifies the research objectives while Section-2 details the sources of data and Section-3 investigates whether the NREGS can influence real agricultural wage rate in West Bengal. This paper seeks to investigate whether the expansion of the NREGS across the districts of West Bengal could influence the real agricultural wage ratesFootnote 2 in the state. To do that, the researchers considered eight periods’ data from 18 districts of the state between 2005-06 and 2012-13. Before detailing this exercise, it is imperative to study if there has been any enhancement in the real agricultural wage rates in West Bengal during the time period mentioned above and/or whether the real agricultural wage rate has increased across all districts at all, during this time. For this investigation, the researchers depended solely on the ‘time effect’ and the district-specific ‘individual effect’ in the static panel regression model. These exercises were not cited separately and explicitly but the observed results were discussed briefly here. This paper checks for possible enhancements in the real agricultural wage rates over the time period mentioned above in West Bengal during the post NREGS implementation period, by considering 18 implementation districts of West Bengal except ‘Kolkata’ as units. Since, NREGS was implemented in West Bengal from 2006-07, the researchers use 2005-06 (the year immediately prior to implementation of NREGS) as the base year and subsequently, examine the progress through different years up to 2012-13. In this way, they track the chronological variation in agricultural wages after the implementation of the NREGS starting from a base year before it was initiated. Data on average agricultural wage rates in different districts of West Bengal in different years is taken from ‘Statistical Abstract’ published by the Government of West Bengal and from the “Evaluation Wing, Directorate of Agriculture, Government of West Bengal”. Thus, the paper creates a panel data comprising of 18 districts (cross section units) and 8 time periods resulting in 144 pooled observations. Our a priori hypothesis is that, variations in real agricultural wages are likely to be influenced positively by the number of works related to the provision of irrigation facilities, micro irrigation works and rural connectivity works all of which, occur under NREGS. The variables are represented by the number of works completed in a particular financial year. The data of those variables for different districts of West Bengal in different years are collected from the NREGS website updated by the Government of India. It is obvious that if more assets were created and completed under the NREGS, more employment in terms of man-days would be generated. Besides that, these created assets could also positively impact agricultural productivity. Average rainfall in the region may also be considered as another factor impacting the real agricultural wage rates. Its value in different districts in different years may be calculated on the basis of data published by the Statistical Abstract, Government of West Bengal. By investigating only the ‘Time effect’ after considering the real agricultural wage rate as a dependent variable, it is observed that initially, the estimated values of the parameters of the time dummies are positive but low and statistically insignificant. However, a sudden jump in the values of the co-efficient of the ‘time dummy’ occurred from 2010-11 and the coefficients became statistically significant. It may be concluded that the enhancement in the average real agricultural wage of West Bengal is noteworthy from 2010-11. Upon investigating only the impact of the district-specific ‘Individual effect’ on the real agricultural wage rate, it was observed that the estimated values of the co-efficients of each dummy variable were positive and statistically significant, however, the values were not the same. So, it may be inferenced that the values of the real agricultural wage rates have increased across the considered districts within the considered time period. However, due to certain geographical and adminstrative differences among the districts, these values of the estimated co-efficient are not same i.e. the increment of real agricultural wage rate across districts is not uniform. On the basis of the two results above, the paper concludes that there is a pronounced ‘time effect’ as well as ‘district-specific effect’ on the real agricultural wage rate in West Bengal in the post NREGS implementation period. It is also imperative to investigate whether the expansion of NREGS has positively impacted the gradual enhancement of real agricultural wages across districts of West Bengal during the time period in question. When examining NREGS work, the researchers have considered, separately, three major types of work undertaken in a majority across the state i.e. ‘provision of irrigation facilities’, ‘micro irrigation project’ and ‘rural connectivity’, and completed in different years. ‘Provision of irrigation facility’ work indicates NREGA work on private land. ‘Micro irrigation work’ indicates NREGA work on public land. ‘Rural connectivity’ work indicates enhancement of road conditions and transport facilities in the village economy. While these three types of work did not expand uniformly they developed assets and impacted the agricultural labour market from the supply and demand sides albeit not always identically. The underlying dynamics have been identified as: NREGS work could be undertaken on private lands of the SCs, STs, BPLFootnote 3 families and the beneficiaries of land reforms. After successful implementation of land reforms in rural West Bengal, where the paper observed predominance of marginal and small farm households, NREGS work was widely implemented under this scheme. It aimed at provision of irrigation facilities, horticultural plantations and land development facilities of the individual land holders.Footnote 4 Now if this type of asset creation work through NREGS could be expanded, then, larger numbers of marginal famer households would be inclined to move toward family farming in the post-rainy season mainly with the help of the family labour force. Besides that, the job card holders in the family could undertake similar work under this scheme on their own lands. Such expansion of work could reduce the supply of labour in the agricultural labour market in the post-rainy season and give an impetus to NREGS. Hence, a fall in labour supply could enhance the agricultural wage rate thus indicating how the ‘pull’ factor works in the agricultural labour market. Expansion of irrigation facilities on public land through micro irrigation work may help farm households in that locality to enhance their cropping intensity by increasing the gross cropped area and move towards crop diversification. Such shifting could give an impetus to employment generation in the farm sector while simultaneously ensuring employment for labourers under NREGS. Such ‘contestability’ in the labour market may reduce the supply of agricultural labourers engaged in farm activity. If NREGS work is available in the locality, an agricultural labourer may not be interested to work as agricultural labourer because to earn one man-day wage, he has to work at least eight hours. But through NREGS, a physically capable labourer may earn one man-day wage devoting much less effort and working less than eight hours in a day. A hike in labour demand and shortage in labour supply can jointly enable an enhancement in the agricultural wage rate in an area thus, indicating how the ‘push’ and ‘pull’ factors work in the market. Improved rural road connectivity as well as accessibility in addition to water conservation activities under the NREGS, can provide an impetus to rural infrastructure development. This encourages small and marginal farmers to move towards multiple cropping by cultivating different food crops and horticultural products in the post-rainy season. It also generates more economic security through new ventures while the better conditions of roads reduces the costs of migration of the local rural labour force. This may encourage the rural labourers to move to urban areas for higher paid jobs in the urban informal sector. Shortage of labour supply and enhancement of labour demand may thus, create an upward pressure in the agricultural wage rate in the labour market Apart from these, rainfall may also influence the agricultural labour market. A period of good rainfall may incentivise small and marginal farmers to undertake multiple cropping in the post-rainy season (Kundu and Talukdar 2016). This will enhance the demand for agricultural labourers while the NREGS will get a boost in this period. So agricultural labourers can choose between these two types of work. However, only under certain conditions, can the agricultural labourers work under the NREGS and not as farm labourers (Kundu et al. 2014), as a result of which, there may be shortage of labour supply leading to increased agricultural wage rates. This paper investigates this using the following model: Here agwage

it
 is the real agricultural wage rate of the ith district in the tth time period. ‘provofirr

it
’ denotes total number of NREGS work completed in private land in the ith district in the tth time period. ‘microirr

it
’ indicates total finished NREGS work related to micro irrigation in the ith district in the tth time period.Footnote 5 This basically reflects NREGS work related to minor irrigation conducted on public land for the enhancement of irrigation facilities for the farmers in the locality. ‘ruralconnv

it
’ indicates the total number of works completed pertaining to rural connectivity of the ith district in the tth time period and rainfallit shows average rainfall of the ith district in the tth time period. It is possible to gain an illustrative idea about the disparity in both dependent and independent variables across districts in each year through the descriptive statistics in Table 2. Table 2 shows that the average daily real wage has a tendency to fluctuate over the time period studied. The same is the case with the values of standard deviation. The values of the coefficient of variation indicate an upward trend up to 2010-11 and thereafter, a decline. This reflects that the wage disparity marginally increases up to 2009-10 and then, increases significantly in 2010-11. Subsequently, there is a marginal reduction in wage disparity. From Table 2, it is observed that the mean values representing the provision of irrigation facilities steadily increased except in 2008-09 whereas values of standard deviation all along displayed an upward trend with a big jump in the year 2010-11. The cross-district disparity in this regard expressed by the coefficient of variation also increased over the years except in 2009-10. In case of the micro irrigation works, the variation across districts over different years has shown a downward trend except 2010-11. Not only that, the disparity in this regard across districts has been relatively lower than that in case of provision of irrigation facilities. The cross-district disparity in different years in case of the rural connectivity works has been much lower than what has been observed in the two previous cases. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that Birbhum and West Midnapur have done a commendable job in this regard. As far as the average rainfall is concerned, both the mean values and standard deviation across districts in different years have not varied much except in the limiting years. Again barring the initial and terminal values, the cross-district disparity has shown a downward trend in other years. Initially, the researchers performed the Hausman Test to understand whether they would apply the Fixed or Random Effect model to estimate the Static Panel data mentioned above. The Hausman Test offers χ
2 (4) = 150.47 and it is significant at the 1 per cent level. So, to estimate the Static Panel data, the researchers have to apply the Fixed Effect model. The result of the Fixed Effect model of Eq. (1) is given in Table 3. According to the above Fixed Effect model, asset creation under the NREGA, such as the ‘provision of irrigation facility’ and ‘rural connectivity’ plays a positive role to enhance real agricultural wage rates in West Bengal, but the micro irrigation work and average rainfall do not play any role when agricultural wages are being determined in West Bengal. It is true that agwage

it
 is very much dependent on agwage

i(t−1) and this is also observed even at constant price, agwage

it
 > agwage

i(t−1). So, the average agricultural wage rate of the ith district of West Bengal in the tth period also depends on the average agricultural wage rate of the same district in the (t − 1)th period (Osmani 1991; Kundu 2006). This happens because the agricultural labourers of a particular district are not willing to accept a wage rate, which is less than the wage rate of the previous period. If we want to incorporate lnagwage

i(t−1) as another regressor in Eq. (1), then, Eq. (1) will become a dynamic panel data model. Since lags of the dependent variable are necessarily correlated with idiosyncratic error, traditional Static Panel data model estimator, such as the Fixed Effect and the Random Effect estimator will become inconsistent due to the presence of the endogenous regressor. Eq. (1) can now be written asFootnote 6: The dynamic panel regression model mentioned above has the following characteristics: It has a short time dimension (t = 8) and a larger district dimension (n = 18) i.e. n > t. Time-invariant characteristics (fixed effect), such as geography and demography (which is denoted here as θ

i
) may be correlated with the explanatory variables. The larger the size of the district, the more number of works possible through NREGS. It is also assumed that |β
1| < 1 and µ

it
 are serially correlated. Actually, the fixed effects are contained in the error term of Eq. (2), which consist of unobserved district-specific factors υ

i
 and the observation-specific error term ɛ

it
 i.e. μ

it
 = υ

i
 + ɛ

it
. In the Arellano-Bond modelFootnote 7 (Arellano and Bond 1991), the researchers take the first differences to get rid of the individual-specific effects and use all the past information of the dependent variable lnagwage

i(t−1) as instruments.Footnote 8
 Here, the OLS estimation is inconsistent because lnagwage

i(t−1) is correlated with µ
i(t−1). So, the regressor (lnagwage

i(t−1)-lnagwage

i(t−2)) is correlated with the error (µ
it
 − µ
i(t−1)) in Eq. (2). The Arellano-Bond had shown that the additional instrument variables may be used in the estimation to avoid bias. There is however, no need for instruments from the same external sources. For the transformed model, the variable lnagwage
it
 and the predecessors are valid instruments. These instruments, like the lnagwage

i(t−2), lnagwage

i(t−3) can be used in the GMM approach to obtain an asymptotically efficient estimator of β
1. The model is then, over-identified. Now to identify whether the over identified restrictions are valid or not, the researchers depend on the Sargan Test. Initially, the Arellano-Bond one-step estimation was computed. But the Sargan TestFootnote 9 showed χ
2 (20) = 76.17408 and that is statistically significant, which means the Null Hypothesis (H0: over-identifying restrictions are valid) has to be rejected. Hence, it is required that the model as well as the instruments be reconsidered. In this situation, a two-step estimation procedure is an alternative. Actually, the Arellano-Bond two-step estimator is consistent and asymptotically efficient when HeteroskedasticityFootnote 10 is observed. The two-step estimation procedure offers the results as shown in Table 4. The Sargan Test of the Arellano-Bond two-step estimator reveals χ
2 (20) = 17.42349 and it is statistically insignificant. So, the null hypothesis is accepted and proves that the Arellano-Bond two-step estimation is appropriate. The moment condition of the GMM estimators is valid if there is no serial correlation in the error term. The researchers are then, concerned only with the second and higher order auto-correlation. Since AR(2) is statistically insignificant, it may again be concluded that Arellano-Bond two-step estimator of Eq. (2) is acceptable. Blundell and Bond (1998) had shown that Arnello-Bond two-step GMM estimator performs poorly when the dependent variable here—‘lnagwage’—is close to a random walk because the untransformed lags are weak instruments for the transformed variables. It is observed that \(\left| {\widehat{{\upbeta_{1} }}} \right| = .8441\), which is very high, and close to 1. Hence, the presence of ‘Random walk’ where \({\hat{\beta }}\) is high and ‘t’ is small, is noticed. To tackle this problem, the researchers depend on Blundell-Bond’s (1998) two-step estimation procedures instead of one-step, whose result is also provided in Table 4. Here too, the Sargan Test shows χ
2 (26) = 17.78607 and it is statistically insignificant. The auto-correlation test also justifies the model. The Wald χ
2 value is significant and this establishes the appropriateness of the model. On the basis of the Blundell-Bond two-step estimator, it is established that the NREGS work, such as the ‘provision of irrigation facility’, ‘micro irrigation’ and ‘rural connectivity’ plays a positive role for the enhancement of the real agricultural wage rate of West Bengal. But as the values of the parameter estimates are very small, it may be said that the influence of NREGS on the average real agricultural wage rate is not so strong. This idea follows the result generated by Mahajan (2015). The same thing also happens for ‘average rainfall’, which continues to play a significant role when the decision is made about crop cultivation in the period post the rainy season. But, since the value of the co-efficient of the lagged dependent variable is very high, it may be said that there may exist some non-NREGS related factors, which significantly impact the determination and enhancement of the real agricultural wage rates in different districts of West Bengal.",

Autor et al. (2003b) use this approach to assess the role of rapid computerization and automation of occupations. Accordingly, studies building on this find that technological advancements have been causing the phenomenon of “job polarization” in the USA - i.e. the decline in share of workers with middle-skilled occupations (Acemoglu and Autor 2011; Autor and Dorn 2013). Such jobs are easily routinized and automated and thus shrinking over time, whereas heavily manual tasks as well as abstract tasks that involve sophisticated analyses, creativity and interpersonal skills are hard to automate, and have experienced an increase in both the share of employment and returns as measured by wages. Job polarization as a trend has now been documented for various developed countries such as the U.K (Goos and Manning 2007), West Germany (Dustmann et al. 2009), various organization for economic co-operation and development countries (Michaels et al. 2013), all of Europe (Asplund and Barth 2011) and according to more recent ongoing studies, even in Portugal (Fonseca et al. 2015). However, there has not been any analysis of task content of occupations for developing countries, especially in South Asia. This is the first study, to the author’s knowledge, that conducts this analysis for a developing country. India is a unique country to examine in this narrative about job polarization, given that it is very different from the countries that have already been studied. It is the largest employer of unskilled workers in the world, but also has a significant population of skilled workers in the services sector. While it is not heavily industrialized, it does have a vibrant information technology sector, which allows for growing penetration of technology in various sectors. One would expect that technological adoption is lower when it comes to high cost capital-intensive technologies that can be substituted by cheaply available manpower. However, technology may seem like a cheaper alternative in the services sector, where the costs of adoption are similar to cost of employment of middle-skilled workers whose jobs can easily be routinized. Two sources of data have been used for this analysis. The first is data from the employment and unemployment rounds (Schedule 10) from the National Sample Survey (NSS) for India for the years 2005, 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2012 which provides information on the principal activity of workers. This is as defined by the three digit National Code of Occupations (NCO 2004) and five-digit National Industrial Classification (2008), along with hours of work, wages, education, age, gender and region among other important variables. Information is also used from the occupational information network (O*NET) database, from which the author used information on task content of occupations to merge on to the NSS dataset. Using this information, the author calculated scores of the task content for each three-digit occupation for further analysis. Occupations were classified into three main groups based on their task content: non-routine cognitive, routine cognitive and routine manual. There were no occupations that could be mainly classified as non-routine manual, thus there are only three main categories in this exercise. Using this new data, the author finds that there is evidence of job polarization when studying employment trends in India. First, workers with graduate and higher education are primarily engaged in non-routine cognitive tasks, while workers with lower than “middle-school” education are mainly engaged in routine manual tasks. Further, the share of employment in routine cognitive intensive occupations is the lowest at about 15 per cent, but mostly stagnant during the period under analysis, i.e. from 2005–2012. The share of routine manual tasks in employment has been declining in the period of analysis whereas the share of non-routine cognitive tasks has been increasing. This corroborates the hypothesis that employment in tasks that can be routinized should decline over time with rapid innovations, improvements and lowering costs of technology. Decomposing the changes in employment shares of occupations reveal that for routine cognitive tasks, the slight decline in employment share is explained by a reduction in the intensity of routinized cognitive tasks across all industries. The increase in the employment share of non-routinized occupations can be explained due to an increase in share of services and occupations intensive in non-routinzed cognitive tasks as well as due to an increase in the intensity of non-routinized tasks within most industries. Similarly, the decline in the share of employment of routine manual occupations can be explained both by the shrinking of industries intensive in these routinized tasks as well as a decline in routine manual intensive tasks within industries. An investigation into the returns to workers specializing in each occupation type reveals that the wages of workers engaged in non-routine cognitive and routine cognitive occupations rise faster than wages of workers engaged in routine manual occupations. The author finds that for male workers, wages in non-routine cognitive tasks are higher as compared to routine cognitive tasks across almost all years, whereas for female workers, the wages in routine cognitive tasks are higher than non-routine cognitive tasks. While there is no direct explanation for this, an investigation into the industry of occupation would reveal more details. While the employment distribution in India resembles the job polarization observed for developed countries, the share of employment of routine cognitive tasks although declining, does not change substantially for the period under consideration. This could be because most of the automation in routine cognitive intensive occupations has already occurred. However, our decomposition analysis reveals that while the routine cognitive tasks have been declining across all industries on average, there is an expansion of industries that use routine cognitive tasks. In a country like India, information technology has been penetrating at a fast rate, but has a much larger scope, so we should expect such automation to continue. For routine manual tasks, however, the hypothesis that technology is automating manual tasks holds, as is evident in the declining shares of routine manual industries. The average share of such jobs is still high, especially higher compared to most industrialized countries because despite the decline in price of technology, extremely low wages in India make labour intensive technologies a more profitable proposition. However, with continuously declining prices of capital-intensive technologies and innovations, we should expect this trend to continue. As a result, the returns to such occupations are also falling over time. Routine manual intensive sectors are also shrinking on average in terms of employment share, while service occupations that are more intensive in non-routine cognitive tasks are increasing on average. Non-routine intensive occupations are increasing in terms of task intensity and industry shares, along with experiencing an increase in average wages paid out to workers primarily performing these tasks. The author believes understanding the implications of these trends is extremely important for understanding the future of employment opportunities in a country like India. While most of its workers are employed in routine manual jobs, and these constitute a non-trivial share, automation of these jobs poses a threat to both employment and wages of workers currently employed in such sectors. In related work, the author also studies the impact of tariff liberalization and offshorability of tasks on occupations, which the author believes will reveal more insights into how current trends are changing the nature of job opportunities in developing countries. Section 2 describes the data sources used for this study and the methods used for calculating the task content of occupations. Based on these task intensities, the rest of the sections consider trends in occupational groups. Section 3 shows the relationship between the skill of workers and occupational groups, Section 4 shows the trends in employment across various occupation groups and Section 5 shows the trends in average wages. Section 6 investigates whether it changes across industries or changes in task intensities within industries that is primarily responsible for changes in employment shares. Section 7 examines how returns to workers specializing in occupations defined by task intensities have been evolving over time and Section 8 concludes.",3

The high dynamics observed in the labour market was offset by the adjustment of workers’ wages due to greater competition in the supply of labour, which along with the increase in real minimum wage, led to the flattening of the average wage in the market (in terms of minimum wage). Data from Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra a Domicílio (PNAD) by the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE) indicate that the average income per minimum wage dropped from 3.82 (R$ 1.337,00/R$ 350,00 minimum wage at the time) in 2006 to about 2.83 (R$ 1.725,00/R$ 724,00 minimum wage at the time) in 2014. Therefore, labour market expansion and dynamics appear as important variables in determining wages. The higher the labour market dynamics, the shorter is the duration of employment. For economics theory, employment duration is a positive attribution in determining wages, aside from association to the quality of vacancies and productive efficiency. In general, employment duration is seen as a measure of efficiency in the labour market due to the costs generated for economic agents by the increase in turnover. This association is explained by the existence of human capital specific for the activities developed by the worker (Farber 1999). Therefore, short duration time on the job tends to compromise economy as it brings productivity losses for the applicant (companies) and labour suppliers (workers) which might lead in medium and long term, to a decrease in investments in human capital by the companies and the very accumulation of experience by the worker. On the other hand, a less dynamic labour market makes the occupational insertion of workers more difficult. Therefore, considering workers in situation of unemployment, unemployment duration represents the increase of financial and psychological costs (Ljungqvist and Sargent 1988; Denn Hann, Haefkee and Ramey 2001) which added to skills depreciation and the lack of a productive activity causes greater wage loss for workers when they are (re)inserted in the labour market (Addison and Portugal 1989; Pissarides 1992; Edin and Gustavsson 2008). Thus, in addition to income loss during unemployment, workers are penalized when they find an occupation (Arulampalam 2001). The wage loss related to recent employment is called throughout this paper wage cost of unemployment. According to data from Pesquisa Mensal de Emprego (PME), by the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE), the average employment duration in Brazil leaped from 335.1 weeks in January 2006 to 373.8 in January 2014 (an increase of 11.5 per cent) indicating greater stability on the job concerning formal labour market. On the other hand, the average duration of unemployment dropped from 50 weeks in 2006 to 26 weeks in 2014 (14 per cent reduction) according to data from Pesquisa de Emprego e Desemprego (PED), suggesting that the Brazilian labour market has become more dynamic in recent years. National and international literature on economics provide studies on the impact of permanence in situations of unemployment and employment as well as their respective durations on workers’ income (Abraham and Farber 1987; Altonji and Shakotko 1987; Kassouf 1998; Addison and Portugal 1989; Matos and Machado 2006; Fernandes 2015). In general, results corroborate the theory highlighting permanence on the job as a variable that contributes to higher wages, while the incidence on the condition of unemployment has the reversal effect, reducing wages when workers return to formal labour market since during unemployment, work experience cannot be cumulated, previously acquired abilities can be compromised, and the acquisition of new competences might be inhibited (Gregory and Jukes 2001). Based on these facts our paper analyses wage cost of unemployment through the impact of unemployment on workers’ wages. In so, two groups of workers are analysed comparatively: group 1: composed of permanent workers (workers that were employed throughout the period of analysis) and group 2: formed by newly employed workers (workers who were unemployed but became newly employed in the period of analysis). By using data from the (PME) Pesquisa Mensal de Emprego, 2006 to 2014, the objective of this study is to investigate the salary cost of the incidence of unemployment through the analysis of wage differentiation/decomposition to verify the existence of relevant differences in income between these groups caused by the incidence of unemployment. In terms of methodology, different econometrics techniques were used such as (OLS) Ordinary Least Square, Quantile Regressions and the methods of Chernozhukov, Fernández-Val and Melly (2013) and Firpo, Fortin and Limieux (2009). Regarding the studies on differential of salaries research has generally focused on profiling workers with emphasis in the differences between men and women (Oaxaca 1973; Neumark 1999; Duraisamya and Duraisamyb 2016) and white and afro descendents individuals (Cotton 1998; Matos and Machado 2006), job characteristics, particularly for jobs in rural and urban areas (Xin and Junsen 2001), and public and private sector (Rahona-Lópeza, Murillo-Huertasb and Salinas-Jiménezb 2016). However, research seldom compares employed workers who previously experienced unemployment (citing only studies by Arulampalam 2001; Burda and Mertens 2001; Gregory and Jukes 2001), especially if focused on the Brazilian labour market, the dynamics of which (turnover) are different from European countries and the United States. (BRICs) Brazil, together with Russia, China, India and South Africa have more similar characteristics in relation to their labour market. Aside from this introduction, the paper is divided into four sections. The second section approaches methodology issues focused on the Chernozhukov, Fernández-Val and Melly (2013) or CFM (2013) model and PME database from 2006 to 2014. The third section provides a descriptive sample analysis and econometric results of the impact of employment and unemployment duration on wages. Finally, the last section presents our final remarks.",2

In several developing countries, governments have actively revised the minimum wage on a regular basis and even in advanced economies such as Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States, minimum wages have gained importance to address wage and income inequality. It is being increasingly recognized that, if minimum wages are effectively designed and implemented, then it can help improve working conditions for workers, and reduce poverty and inequality. India has a long tradition of minimum wages and the adoption of the Minimum Wages Act in 1948 is still considered to be an important piece of labour legislation. However, to date minimum wages are applicable to only a small proportion of workers and does not cover all wage workers (Rani et al. 2013). There has been a lot of intense academic and policy debate about meaningful wage policy including introduction of a binding national minimum wage for all workers over the past decadesFootnote 1 (Belser and Rani 2011; Anant and Sundaram 1998; Ghose 1997; Sankaran 1997; Handy and Papola 1974). Yet, what has been achieved so far is quite limited in scope, which is a non-binding national minimum wage floor in 1991. At the present juncture the wage code bill which consolidates four Acts,Footnote 2 also makes a recommendation for a binding and statutory national minimum wage, but the extent to which it will gain political support and is implemented remains to be seen. Though the Indian economy grew at around 7 per cent since the mid-1990s (Rani and Sen 2018 forthcoming), income inequality remains high when compared with other developing economies among the G20 countries (Rani and Furrer 2016). The opportunity has not been seized to implement a meaningful and enforceable minimum wage system, as has been observed in other developing economies like Brazil and China with comparable growth rates (ILO 2013a). Against this background, this paper makes an attempt to look at minimum wage policies and institutions in developing economies and the role they have played in providing a decent wage floor and securing a minimum living standard for low paid workers and their families, and what policy lessons can be learnt for improving the minimum setting mechanism and enforcement within the Indian context. With regard to the structure of this paper, the next section discusses minimum wage institutions to determine wages in labour surplus economies. Section 3 provides a review of empirical evidence of the effects of minimum wages on labour market (employment and prices), and societal outcomes (poverty and inequality) in developing countries. Section 4 gives an analysis of some of the issues and concerns related to minimum wage policies in the Indian context and the lessons that can be learnt from the experiences of other developing economies. The final section concludes with a discussion of the need for a meaningful minimum wage policy in the Indian context.",2

In many emerging market economies, working conditions, wages and environmental standards have deteriorated, particularly, in plants producing for export. Every year, the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) documents widespread abuses of workers’ rights. According to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the following workers’ rights are fundamental: freedom of association (Convention No. 87); the right to organise and bargain collectively (Convention No. 98); and prohibitions of forced labour (Convention Nos. 29 and 105), discrimination in employment (Convention Nos. 100 and 111), and child labour (Convention Nos. 138 and 182). The workers’ rights covered by these core conventions are an inseparable part of human rights because they were adopted by consensus of ILO members, ratified by most member countries, covered by UN (the United Nations) covenants and several human rights declarations, and reaffirmed repeatedly at international summits. The problem with the ILO’s conventions is not only that ratification is voluntary but also that compliance is essentially voluntary since the ILO has no enforcement mechanism to speak of. The court of public opinion is called upon through cautiously worded ILO reports on violations of individual countries. The international labour movement has reacted to the ILO’s ineffectiveness in dealing with labour rights abuses in the context of a rapidly globalising economy by calling for a so-called social clause, i.e., a labour rights provision to be embodied in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and more recently in bilateral trade agreements. The Trans Pacific Partnership, initialled by the heads of the participating countries in October 2015, contains such a clause. Predictably, employers’ associations, many governments and the overwhelming majority of economists contend that trade agreements are not an appropriate means of enforcing minimum standards. However, critics do not stop at the question of how to enforce international social standards but also cast doubts on the usefulness of international standards in principle (Grossmann and Michaelis 2007). It is, therefore, necessary to examine whether international labour standards serve a useful economic purpose. The question of whether international workers’ rights are economically justified touches upon the fundamental economic understanding of the nature of the market as a social regulatory mechanism. In highly simplified terms, the various concepts of the market can be reduced to two paradigmatic approaches: the neo-classical and the neo-institutional ‘schools’. From the neo-classical standpoint, welfare-increasing efficiency gains can be achieved in foreign trade only if unhindered trade permits product specialisation based on comparative cost advantages. Even in the case of infant industries, protection is considered a suboptimal policy. Any domestic distortions should be addressed by subsidies, rather than protection. The neo-institutional approach, by contrast, points to the destructive potential that market mechanisms can have on trade between nations because of the absence of a central regulatory authority at an international level. According to that view, foreign trade should, therefore, be flanked by domestic social legislation and regulated externally by multilateral agreements. If criticism on purely ideological grounds is to be avoided, it is necessary to challenge these approaches on their own ‘home domain’. Therefore, this paper will show that, despite the prevalent opposing view among neo-classical economists, even neo-classical economics lends itself to theoretical justifications of international labour rights. Practitioners of institutional economics, of course, provide many reasons for taking the ‘high road’ on labour rights. However, even an institutional viewpoint cannot rule out short-term costs for countries adhering to higher standards. In contrast to most economic treatises on international labour rights, this paper will argue that the question of competitiveness is not a North–South issue, but a South–South issue. Even small increases in costs due to higher standards will put the respective countries at a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis their competitors at a similar level of industrial development. Therefore, developing countries will be limited in their ability to raise labour standards on their own. This competitive situation, however, may be the very reason why labour rights have to be negotiated internationally. Raising standards will have to be done in conjunction with other countries by multilateral agreement.",2

Most labour protections, such as laws limiting hours of work, guaranteeing a minimum amount of income, or protecting workers from unfair dismissal are contingent on the recognition of an employment relationship. Typically this employment relationship is one that is full-time, continuous, and bilateral between a recognized employer and his or her employee –commonly referred to as the ‘standard employment relationship’. Over the past several decades there has been an increase in the use of non-standard employment in developed and developing countries alike. Non-standard employment encompasses four groups of employment arrangements that lacks some or all of the features of standard employment. It includes temporary work, part-time work, temporary agency work (and other forms of multiparty employment relationships, including labour contracting) and disguised and dependent self-employment. Some of these employment arrangements are informal, such as casual work, but others are formal, such as workers employed on fixed-term contracts or workers who are hired by a temporary work agency to perform work at the clients’ place of business. Given the importance of casual work in developing countries, most work in these countries is ‘non-standard’ but there are nonetheless important pockets in the labour market where standard employment has existed, such as in manufacturing, state-owned enterprises or the public sector. This article focuses on the growth of non-standard employment arrangements in these segments of the labour market in developing countries that were previously the locus of ‘standard’ jobs. While informality is still a significant concern as many developing country workers do not benefit from any labour protection, the increase in non-standard employment has merely compounded problems for workers and the labour market, while potentially undermining productivity growth in the modern sector. Despite much rhetoric in labour policy debates about how labour protections privilege ‘insiders’ to the detriment of ‘outsiders’, increased reliance on non-standard employment merely adds to the already heightened levels of insecurity felt by informal workers, since even if they do land a ‘formal’ job, the working conditions may not be much of an improvement over informality. In addition, by lessening protections for workers, enterprises have less of an incentive to invest in their workers or in productivity enhancing technology or organizational improvements, potentially undermining economic growth. The article begins with a discussion of the multiple purposes that the employment relationship holds, why this institution was developed and the different sets of responsibilities that enterprises assume in exchange for managerial control over the worker. It then reviews evidence on the growth of non-standard employment across different countries of the world, and how firms are using temporary employment. This is followed by a discussion of the implications of the use of non-standard employment for workers’ well-being, for enterprises, and for the labour market and economy in general. The last section addresses the role of labour regulation in steering the use of non-standard employment and why it is important.",4

These workplace disasters in Bangladesh, Peru, Honduras and several supplier countries (Manik and Yardley 2012; Burke 2014; O’Connor 2014) have served to shine a light on the deep precariousness of work in the bottom tiers of global garment chains. They also highlight the limits and inability of private forms of governance and company codes of conduct in reaching them (Locke 2013; Lund-Thompson and Nadvi 2010). Labouring under unsafe and unprotected working conditions, obscured from view by many layers of informal contracts, these informal workers indirectly supply to some of the world’s largest brands, yet are outside the sphere of influence of both states and industry regarding adequate and effective oversight, accountability and monitoring. As such they are the next frontier in the wider search for means to diffuse labour standards and decent work to all workers. Private regulation grew out of the need to reconcile the demands of an increasingly internationalized, multi-sited production system with the jurisdictional limitations of national labour laws in monitoring and regulating cross-border economic activity (Locke et al. 2007; Locke 2013). Yet, questions persist about the cherry-picking of benefitsFootnote 1 and their piecemeal diffusion to subsets of workers (such as improved working conditions for some workers but not othersFootnote 2 in complex production networks) (Barrientos and Smith 2007; Barrientos 2008; Barrientos et al. 2011; Posthuma and Nathan 2010). Concerns also persist over the potential for widespread gaming of the system of inspections and monitoring by some companies and contractors (O’Rourke 2002). Evidence is thus building that company-led initiatives, while necessary, are insufficient to link corporate growth with sustained social upgrading and improved labour conditions in the global economy. At the same time, it is also true that without any private regulation and company codes of conduct, there would be many more labour disasters at the base of Global production networks (GPNs) and Global value chains (GVCs), given the weakness of public sector regulation, or at least weak enforcement, in many supplier countries (Locke 2013). Therein lies the dilemma for the world of private governance: how to ensure a wider socialization of safe and improved working conditions that can reach deeper down the value chain, and even beyond it, in the face of intensified competition, short lead times, low margins, relentless price pressures and the powerful search for low costs. This paper reports relational contracting at the base of global value chains (GVCs) of home based embroidery workers in Mewat, India. This experiment sought to ensure better paying, safer and more transparent working conditions for the most vulnerable workers in the garment chain. The novelty of the experiment lies in the networked nature of intermediation in the contracts that link the workers to export markets. The network, most importantly, involves a partnership between leading global buyers (Gap Inc. in this case) and government that together coordinated contracting and training ties among exporters, a local socially embedded civic organization and area-based informal hand embroidery workers, most of them women.Footnote 3 Beadwork and hand-embellished embroidery add significant value to high-end garments sold by upmarket brands across the world, but is often associated with some of the most unstable, precarious and poorly paid work riven with problems of exploitation and the use of child labour (Mezzadari 2011; Unni and Scaria 2009). Beholden to tiers of middlemen and contractors, hand workers often have no idea whom they produce for and hence, have little recourse in the event of harassment, exploitation, unfair wages, reneged contracts, non payment or disasters such as fire and building collapse. The experiment author reported on achieved, for a period of time, improved incomes, elimination of child labour, and safe and transparent working conditions for hundreds of female embroidery workers in Mewat. The report was compiled by Gap, the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the government (see ICCR 2011). The issue was already highlighted in a short documentary film by the British Broadcasting Corporation in 2010 (ICCR 2011 and Gap DGP Interview 2011). The paper is based on 24 interviews conducted in Mewat and in the national capital region (NCR) between 2011 and 2013 through a purposive, snowball sampling method and with a range of actors. Six interviews were conducted with key informants that included two Indian government officials from the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD) and the Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD); the former director of global partnerships and social responsibility for Gap, who was responsible for spearheading and leading the project for its first year and half of operations; with IM, a Gurgaon based buying house and supply chain management company that partnered with Gap to manage the project’s market linkages; the leader of Sociey for the Promotion of Youth and Masses (SPYM), a non-profit organization that anchored, coordinated and helped run the project on a daily basis; and two focus group discussions with embroidery workers in Mewat’s Hathin region, one of two villages involved in the project. Additional interviews were conducted with two exporters (RD, OCL)Footnote 4 that partnered with Gap and the government in the project. Interviews were also conducted with three SPYM field workers in Mewat who helped with daily operations. A short visit by a research assistant was also made to Nagina, the second village in Mewat involved in the project. All interviews were conducted in 2011, with follow up interviews with SPYM in 2013. These open-ended qualitative interviews and focus groups were triangulated by analysis of internal reports on the programme prepared by Gap and SPYM, as well as published accounts of other embroidery clusters available in the literature (Mezzadari 2011; Unni and Scaria 2009). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 analyses the origin and antecedents of the programme. Section 3 unpacks the traits and structure of the Mewat Model. Section 4 reports the outcomes and challenges over the first two years of the operation of the programme up to the recession and then how it fared later. Section 5 presents the conclusion.",3

Traditionally seen as a temporary phenomenon, undertaken due to surplus labour and/or stagnant economy, the informal labour force is expected to comprise of the very young, or very old, who are illiterate or undereducated, with minimal training/skills (Hart 1973) and lack access to the formal labour market. Over time, with liberalisation, creation of global production chains and consequent emergence of ‘alternative’ or ‘flexible’ employment arrangements, the profile of informal workers and nature of employment arrangements have changed considerably. One such manifestation is the informalisation or contractualisation of the formal-sector labour force, i.e. engagement of workers in informal employment arrangements within formal (private limited and public sector) enterprises. Moroever, while continuing to be the predominant form of employment in most under-developed and developing economies (Charmes 2012), it has become a prominent form of employment in developed economies as well (Katz and Krueger 2016). The evolution of informal employment has given rise to alternative conceptualisations for its motivations. Some theorise that the informal economy is intrinsically linked to the formal and hence grows in tandem (‘structuralists’) through subcontracting and outsourcing arrangements (Ghose and Chandrasekhar 2015; Unni and Naik 2013). Others opine that participation in informal economy may be voluntary because the benefits of informal employment outweigh those of formal employment (‘voluntarists’) (Amuedo-Dorantes 2004; Günther and Launov 2012; Maloney 2003; Tybout 2000).In such cases, the informally employed may be highly educated, skilled professionals working independently in non-formal employment arrangements. Indeed, in recent years, more ‘hybrid’ conceptualisations have emerged which suggest that all of these motivations may simultaneously operate in the informal economy (Marcouiller, Castilla and Woodruff 1995; Fields 2004; Maloney 2004). Aggregating informal employment to a single statistic, as is often done, overlooks these varied manifestations and motivations. Recognising this, the analysis in this paper adopts an internationally accepted conceptual framework that juxtaposes job characteristics, specifically the availability of social security benefits, alongside enterprise attributes to categorise forms of non-agricultural informal employment. Such a disaggregation allows for a comparative examination of traditional forms of informal employment – self-employment and informal employment within informal enterprises, against the emergent informal employment within formal enterprises. Are informal workers in the informal sector different from their counterparts in the formal sector? In particular, does the conventional notion of informal workers being from either ends of the age spectrum, uneducated and unskilled apply to both types of informal workers? Using a multinomial probit model with correction for selection bias, this paper compares the motivating factors that influence an individual’s participation in different forms of employment revealing whether significant differences exist across workers engaged in different types of employment. The next section describes the definitions adopted for the analysis and introduces broad categories of informal employment. Section III chronicles trends in employment types, across rural and urban India, by industry and gender composition. Section IV describes the methodological challenges and the appropriate econometric techniques used in estimating determinants of employment outcomes. Section V provides estimation results and Section VI concludes.",5

The image of the United States (US) as a land of opportunities has attracted millions of immigrants from across the world. In several pockets of India, migration to the US is a common aspiration (Roohi 2017) and even considered to be a natural part of one’s life goals or career progression. In cities like Hyderabad and Bangalore, it is common to have apartment complexes where everyone boasts of a relative “settled” in the US. As of today, more than 2.5 million Indian immigrantsFootnote 1 live in the US, making India’s contribution to the pool of immigrants significant in absolute numbers (alongside Mexico and China). It is interesting that this has been achieved in just a few decades. As seen in Figure 1, while there were around 12,000 Indian immigrants in the US in the 1960s, the number increased sharply to nearly half a million in the 1990s to over two million in 2015. As Chakravorty, Kapur and Singh (2016) aptly write, it reflects an immigration pattern that “began as a trickle, then became a steady flow, and finally turned into a steady torrent in the last two decades.” Indian immigrants in the US. Source: Table titled largest U.S. Immigrant Groups over Time, 1960-Present MPI Data Hub, Migration Policy Institute These numbers prompt an important question – what has caused the spike in Indian immigration to the US in the past few decades? The answer lies partly in two coinciding phenomena – the introduction of the contemporary form of H1B visa program in the US in the 1990s and the sudden growth of the Information Technology (IT) sector in IndiaFootnote 2. The H1B visa allowed employers to hire high skilled foreign workers, and the latter created a potential labour force that was well educated and English speaking, and could be employed in the US (Varma and Rogers 2004). Since its inception, Indians have been among the largest recipients of the H1B visa, as shown later in the article. According to data put out by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and Department of Homeland Security in the fiscal year 2016 alone - of the total 180,057 H1B visas issued by the US, 70 per cent were granted to Indians. The H1B visa program has also benefitted Indian companies such as Infosys, Wipro, Tata Consultancy Services, who have been among the largest employers of workers under the H1B receiving over half of the share of this visa in the past (Goel 2017). It is clear that the H1B visa program has played a central role in bringing large numbers of Indian immigrants to the US in contemporary times. However, this chronicle of Indian immigration is incomplete without the inclusion of H4 visa holders – given to spouse and children of H1B visa holders, who have also moved to the US in very large numbers. For instance, in fiscal year 2016, 84 per cent of the 131,051 H4 visas were issued to Indians, a proportion that has increased consistently over time. Herein lies a paradox. The lives and experiences of dependents have rarely been accounted for in academic and policy discourses that are fixated with H1B visa (Balgamwalla 2014). This is probably because dominant frameworks of analysis place immigration in the realm of labour supply and demand, wages and other aspects of political economy, which dictate H1B visa cycles. The H4 visa on the other hand does not fall under this purview because by design it disallows dependents from seeking employment or entering the labour force. As has been previously observed by others, the omission of H4 visa holders from official and mainstream accounts of immigration has several repercussions. First it creates and perpetuates stark gender hierarchy in the labour force and within the household (Balgamwalla 2014; Bragun 2007; Ravindranath 2017). There is enough evidence to suggest that the H1B visas cater to fields that are heavily dominated by male workers (Raghuram 2004). Thus, it can be claimed with a degree of certainty that when dependents are kept outside the labour force by law it means systematic exclusion of women from economic and intellectual opportunities that are otherwise available to their spouses. This also translates into discrepancies within the household in terms of intra-household allocation of resources and money, and decision-making power as I show in the discussion section. Second, prevailing visa norms bracket H4 visa as a subsidiary visa that has no legitimacy except when seen in conjunction with the H1B visa. Although this may be true legally, such a myopic approach fails to critically evaluate the long-term impacts of a restrictive visa regime on the lives and career graphs of women living as dependents. This article claims to contribute to the existing body of work on ‘gender and international immigration’. Aqualitative research approach has been used here to provide an alternative account of immigration that is centred on the invisible dependent visa holder and to decode the various components of the visa structure that implicates women for being dependents. The rest of the paper is divided into the following sections: the next section outlines the key aspects of H4 and H1B visa and discusses the broad contours of the visa regime that bestows differentiated sets of rights upon the two visa holders, which shape their experience of being an immigrant. It also includes a brief description of the recent employment authorization (also known as EAD) process initiated by the Obama administration that allows a small section of H4 visa holders to enter the labour force. The paper purposefully touches upon both kinds - those with EAD and those without, to investigate if (and how) the “opportunity” to seek employment influences their lives. This also enables us to reflect on the consequences of the reversal of the EAD, which the current Trump administration is keen on undertaking to purportedly overhaul the immigration process. The section thereafter explains the methodological framework of this qualitative study. The discussion section looks at the implications of the H4 visa and the EAD on three major aspects - dependents’ personal well-being, socialization processes and career graphs. The concluding section reflects on the current administration’s immigration stance and what that might entail for H4 visa holders.",2

Iyer,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"This paper presents a critical analysis of the role of corporate ownership versus proprietorship in shaping the industrial sector and hence, remunerations to workers. The central analysis of the paper is to present wage estimations of workers employed in corporate and proprietorship enterprises to assess how the two different types of ownerships shape wage payments to workers and employees. It provides a comparative analysis across the corporate sector and proprietorship enterprises that have been shaping the hidden landscape of the industrial sector and its silent contributions to job creation. The analysis is based on understanding structural shift analysis through the gaze of three main theorisations: Process of industrial development, Presence of dual labour markets, and The nature informal sector in the economy. The paper does not seek detailed analysis of each theorisation, but presents the interplay of some of the key outcomes on India’s industrial landscape. The Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) datasets since 1980s show that on an aggregate, there has been some rise in labour absorption in the industrial sector. In absolute terms, employment has increased from six million in 1984–85 to about 10.76 million, viz., by about 2.47 per cent per annum. However, this rise has not been gradual; in the period 1981–2004, job creation was negligible. There was some recovery in 1995–2001 when the industrial boom happened, but subsequently there was a phase of joblessness. Nagaraj (2004) estimates a loss of over 1.3 million jobs among the working class during the lean phase. The implications of this reduction were real wages per worker increased by over 77 per cent between 1992 and 2001. Thus, one could argue that while joblessness indicates a stagnation in the industrial activity, improvements in real wage rates represents an improvement in productivity per worker in the factor markets. Could such an argument be true? Does it succeed in capturing the nature of structural shifts in the manufacturing sector? We argue that this offers only part of the explanation. The next section discusses the formation of industrial development process since the 1980s until 2015 with regard to formation of proprietorship enterprises processes, which we refer to as ‘structural shift’. It tries to explain how the sectoral differences between the two have followed unique paths over a period such that currently there is a notable breakdown in the nature of industrial expansion in both categories. The analysis also seeks to explain the differentials in employment generation and value-added processes in these two sectors. The structural analysis is deepened in Sect. 3, where the worker-factory ratios are presented across both types of organisations and the impact of output and invested capital, to juxtapose the nature of transformation taking place in both kinds of organisation. Section 4 discusses wage estimation and partial correlations and determinants of wage outcomes. The empirical findings are presented in Sect. 5 where time-series estimates are presented, and the last section presents concluding remarks.",

Mamgain,Shivakar Tiwari,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Regular wage/salaried jobs are regarded as the good jobs as they are steady and secure, pay well, meet labour standard and offer social protection (Fields 2011). Such jobs are most sought after form of employment across the world. In India and in other developing countries the proportion of working poor among regular salaried workers is least as compared to casual wage labourers and self-employed that too as own account worker (ILO 2014; Papola and Sahu 2012; IHD-ISLE 2014). It is generally believed that regular salaried employment, broadly meets the ILO criteria of “Decent Work” which advocates promotion of decent and productive work in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity. However, opportunities for such regular employment are very limited in India as compared to many other countries like China, Malaysia, South Africa and Brazil (ILO 2014) due to predominance of informal activities, thereby entailing a tough competition for getting such jobs. With about 87 million workers in regular salaried employment, they constituted about 18.4 per cent of total workers in India during 2011–12. Thus, over half of the Indian workforce is still dependent on self-employed form of employment, mostly as own account workers with precarious jobs. Another 29 per cent workers are in casual wage works. Related to limited regular employment is high incidence of unemployment among educated labour force (Mamgain and Tiwari 2016), who are reluctant to work in other forms of employment, i.e., self or casual employment. The craze for and related magnitude of demand for public sector jobs is also evident from the recent advertisement of Government of Uttar Pradesh for group D positions. Against 368 posts of peons about 2.3 million applicants applied including 0.15 million graduates, 24969 post-graduates and 250 doctorates!! The minimum qualifications for peon level positions is school education and bicycle riding experiences with a monthly salary of Rs. 16000/- (PTI 2015, 17 September, Lucknow). Though both public sector and private sectors are the major sources of regular employment in India, opportunities for such employment were significantly curtailed in public sector since the economic reforms of early 1990s. The size of employment in public sector, as provided by Director General of Employment and Training (DGET, Ministry of Labour) significantly reduced from 190.58 lakh persons in 1991 to 176.09 lakh persons in 2012. Further, the size of employment in private organised sector increased at less than desired rate from 76.77 lakh persons to 119.7 lakh persons during the period. The absolute decline of 14.49 lakh regular salaried jobs in public sector since 1990s, thus seriously affected the opportunities for decent employment, particularly for population groups belonging to Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs), who are entitled for reservation in such jobs by the Indian Constitution. The growing employment opportunities, though at a very slow pace, in the private organised sector have definitely benefited SCs and STs. But their access to such jobs in the private sector is still much less than their proportionate share in population. There has been a big debate on extending reservations in private sector jobs in the organised sector during last decade (Thorat et al. 2007). The question of access to regular employment opportunities has again attracted a huge public attention recently, particularly in the context of demand for reservation of employment in public sector by other social groups. This issue of extending reservation in public sector jobs to various population groups has also made political upheavals and public unrests in the past. The recent agitation by Patel community in Gujarat and Jat community in Haryana demanding reservations in public sector jobs only shows how society attaches high values to regular employment in public sector. While there is a rich body of literature available on employment and unemployment issues in India, there are two major gaps which have not been adequately addressed for understanding development in the Indian labour market. One is the extensive analysis of regular employment opportunities from the perspective of tenurial and social security across different types of enterprises, i.e. public, private and informal in India and its states. Second is the access of marginalised groups such as SCs, STs and Muslims to regular employment. There is hardly any study which could explain determinants of participation of different disadvantaged groups in access to quality regular jobs. This assumes importance in the present day context as the growing casualisation and contractualisation of employment both in public and private sector has adversely affected the quality of jobs for all but more so for SCs and STs (Kannan 2014). As is well known, SCs and STs are historically poor and socially excluded groups who are entitled for reservation in public education, employment and political participation by Constitution of India for overcoming such historical disadvantage. Later the benefits of reservation were extended to OBCs also. This paper is an attempt to fill this gap. The paper finds informal sector as a major source of regular employment in India which hardly meets the criteria of decent work. A large number of regular employment that was created between 2004–05 and 2011–12 also was devoid of tenurial and social security benefits, and the access to quality jobs in private corporate sector yet remains far low for SCs and STs as compared to other social groups. The paper is organised in the following fashion. Section 2 discusses the data used in the study and methodology adopted for the analysis of access to decent jobs. The next section analyses the features of regular employment and determinants of its access to various social groups are explained with the help of Logit model in Section 4. The concluding section comments on findings and offers policy suggestions for achieving decent employment crucial for inclusive development and poverty reduction.",3

If a society lacks the ability to manage its human resources, it will not be able to reach its full potential in economic or social areas. In this regard, the central role of women in economic development cannot be ignored. However, one of the key features of the labour market is a lack of gender balance. Despite rising women’s participation in the workforce, the employment rate among them is seriously affected by supply side factors. Trade liberalisation is defined as the movement towards free trade through tariff reductions and removal of other trading obstacles. Trade openness is an element that affects employment since manufacturers tend to use the less expensive female workforce to reduce their products’ final price. In a general classification, inequality in wages in writings across the world, based on the inequality analysis scale, branches out in two main areas. In the first, researchers investigate the effect of the gender wage gap at the international level in developed and developing countries. In the second, the discussion is about the wage premium and the gender wage gap between the professional and amateur workforce in a country or in a number of countries. This paper does not address the first concern. In almost all research papers and projects, trade openness and trade policy are considered to be the causes of the gender wage gap. The well-known Heckscher-Ohlin model is the theoretical basis of these studies. According to this theory, countries become professional in manufacturing products for which they have enough resources. Developed countries have the expertise in manufacturing products for which they have the professional workforce. Correspondingly, developing countries manufacture products for which they can use their amateur workforce. International trade increases the relative wages of the professional workforce in developing countries if and only if the relative price of their products increase. Two popular implications of the Heckscher-Ohlin model are: a direct relationship with the effects of trade on wages and prices of other production elements on one hand; and the Stopler-Samuelson theory on the other. The production elements equality theory emphasises the fact that open trade gradually balances the relative and absolute price of production among countries. One of the most important outcomes of the Heckscher-Ohlin model is the Stopler Samuelson theorem. This theory analyses the tariff status and income distribution among production elements. It is concluded from this theory that the import rate status increases an item’s price that is almost rare in that country. The Stopler Samuelson theory includes the presuppositions of Heckscher-Ohlin trade theory. It follows from the theory that trade liberation in each (trading) country increases the demand for production factors that are more plentiful in that country, which consequently increases its price. Since there are large numbers of professionally skilled workers in developed countries and amateur ones in developing countries, trade liberation between these two groups increases the demand and professional workforce wages in rich countries. At the same time, in developing countries, the same increase is seen in the amateur workforce’s wages. As a result, trade liberation in developing countries unlike in developed countries decreases the gender wage gap. This proposition has been extensively researched in recent years. These researches have deployed different methodologies and varied criteria for measuring trade liberalisation while investigating its relationship with the gender-wage-gap and wage rates. One general classification is possible among the experimented works. One set of research studies investigate the subject using aggregated data. The other set deploys micro data, at the level of housing and agents. Kumar and Mishra (2008) in their research on India found a significant negative relation between trade policy changes and a change in gender wage-gap using micro data. Goldberg and Pavcnik (2001), using data at family level for their research in Colombia, found a significant positive relationship between tariff and the wage premium. Santos and Arbache (2005) investigated trade openness and wage discrimination using the simple econometric model to analyse economic openness on industries sector. The authors found evidences of economic openness reducing the gender wage gap and they believe that commercial modifications reduce production costs (wage included). Becker (1971) investigated the effect of international trade on the gender wage-gap and found that trading increases competition between businesses and consequently reduces discrimination and reduces gender differences. Siddiqui (2009) deployed Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model in his study while investigating the impact of trade liberalisation of the production and consumption sectors on gender-specific issues in Pakistan. The simulation results indicated that trade liberalisation increased female employment for jobs that did not require expertise and even more in other jobs but did not change the discriminatory job divisions against women. Aguayo-Tellez et al. (2014) deployed statistics from families and businesses in the 1990s to analyse the effect of trade liberalisation on the female workforce in Mexico. The study suggested an increase in women’s employment, which led to an increase in their nominal wages. In addition, the changes in trade-based industries increased female wages up to 40 per cent between 1990 and 2000. The reduction of export tariffs was positively related with industry growth and benefits to female workers. Female employment in export industries significantly increased. Ultimately, evidence based on the increase in the negotiation abilities of female workers was found as well. Juhn et al. (2014) in their study on Mexican women’s employment indicated that trade openness had encouraged the export of products, which in turn which increased female employment. Autor et al. (2012) studied the effect of Chinese product imports in the American market and found that both men and women’s employment had decreased in the US but more so in women’s jobs. Berik et al. (2004) in their study on the effect of trade openness on wages found that any increase in trade openness adversely affected the gender wage gap in East Asia. Black and Brainerd (2004), however, came to a different conclusion for the United States and stated that competitive industries had experienced a gender wage gap reduction. Oostendorp (2004) used the information based on 80 low-income economies and concluded that increase in trade reduced the gender-wage inequality. However, different results were obtained for professional workers in low-income economies. Menon and Rodgers (2008) studied the effect of international trade on gender-wage inequalities in India during 1983–2004 to find that trade liberalisation increase led to a wider gap in wage gender inequalities in manufacturing industries. Finally, the results in general show that increasing trade openness affects employment and wage and decreases gender wage gaps positively, whereas increasing government size negatively affects this. The current study attempts to investigate the effects of government size and trade openness on gender wage gap in select middle-income countries in East Europe, West Asia, Northern Africa and South America during the period 2001–2013. The study population comprises 35 developing countries. It is hypothesised that increase in trade openness would reduce the gender wage gap and the government size would increase the gender wage gap. The research model and methodology will be discussed in the following section and the results will be finally analysed.",2

Although both men and women get involved in such activities, the proportional involvement of women is much higher than men. This particular mode of labour force participation is however a phenomenon found only in certain South Asian countries and is not a common feature of developed countries with properly functioning labour market. According to the Labour Force Survey (LFS) 2010 as high as 53 per cent of the women who were in the labour force were employed as unpaid family workers, where the corresponding figure for men is around 7 per cent. In spite of such a significant involvement in the work force, non-remunerative nature of such work has made it unrecognized with almost no attention paid by the policy makers or academicians towards its pattern and trend. The huge contribution of this unpaid family work especially in the context of Bangladesh however needs careful and thorough analysis for strategic policy formulation for the labour market. The pattern and trend of unpaid work of Bangladesh also has certain features that have made any analysis on it particularly interesting. For example, unpaid workers are found to have certain degree of education which provokes further analysis to investigate the reasoning behind the unpaid state of their labour market participation. Unpaid workers are also found in an overwhelming number in households headed by self-employed males indicating unpaid work more of a choice of household instead of individual. All such features of unpaid work coupled with the presence of overwhelming number of women therefore provoke a careful analysis of it. This paper, with the help of secondary data and existing literature has made an attempt to shed light on the unpaid component of the labour market in Bangladesh. In particular, with the help of two national level Labour Force Survey data, this paper analysed the key characteristics of unpaid worker and examined any changes in its pattern that might have occurred over time. It also compared the differences/similarities of different socio-economic as well as household factors in choosing unpaid and paid employment. In order to understand the importance of unpaid work in household income, with the help of a simple methodology, an attempt has been made to estimate the unpaid (or hidden) contribution of unpaid work at household.",

One important facet of the development process is the diversification of occupations and employment with workers moving away from primary activities to secondary and tertiary activities. In this paper, we analyze the process of diversification of employment in the rural areas of India, in particular, the growth of rural non-farm employment, across fifteen major states in the last forty years There are two contrasting views about the role of rural non-farm employment in the development process. One view is that it is a residual sector and its relative importance in the rural areas should decline with agricultural development (Hymer and Resnick 1969). This sector mainly employs workers who are unable to find jobs in the agricultural sector. The growth of the rural non-farm employment is largely a manifestation of the economic distress caused by the failure of agriculture to gainfully absorb the growing rural population (Vaidyanathan 1986). The other view is that it is an integral part of the rural development strategy in the developing countries. The growth of rural non-farm sector plays a critical role in the alleviation of rural poverty, particularly in the case of small and marginal farmers (Ravallion and Datt 1995). It plays a central role in the skill and human capital formation in the rural areas (Hazell and Haggblade 1991). There is a symbiotic relationship between the growth of agricultural and non-farm sectors. The growth of the rural non-farm sector is crucial for the agricultural development due to its strong forward and backward production linkages (Ranis and Stewart 1993). In this paper,Footnote 1 we analyze the determinants of the incidence of rural non-farm employment (proportion of non-farm employment in total employment) and its growth in the fifteen major states for the period 1972–2010 using National Survey Organization (NSSO) data on employment and unemployment. There are three distinctive features of our analysis. Firstly, we use panel data method for the econometric analysis which allows us to incorporate time-invariant unobserved characteristics of states. Secondly, we analyze the rural non-farm employment of both male and female workers. Existing studies on the rural non-farm employment focus on male workers (e.g. Dev 1990; Unni 1991; Kumar 1993; Basant et al. 1998; Kashyap and Mehta 2007). Thirdly, we analyze the dynamics of rural non-farm employment by using dynamic panel data regression model. In particular, we examine the issue of convergence in the rural non-farm employment i.e. whether states with initially low incidence of rural non-farm employment have a higher growth rate in the non-farm employment than the agricultural employment compared to states with initially high incidence of rural non-farm employment. The issue of convergence in the rural non-farm employment has received scant attention from researchers, though data suggests that the proportion of rural non-farm employment in the total rural employment varies significantly across states. In addition, these differences have been persistent over time. This raises the issue whether states with a low share of non-farm employment would catch up with states with high share. One may expect that states with relatively low levels of rural non-farm activities will have a higher rate of return from this sector than agricultural sector. Other things remaining the same, this sector will receive more investment and over time there will be convergence in the share of rural non-farm activities in total rural output and total rural employment across states. However, there is also a possibility that some states can specialize in the agricultural sector and some states in the non-farm sector depending on geographical, social and economic factors. In this case, there will be non-convergence. The main findings of our analysis are as follows. Firstly, there are significant gender differences in the determinants of the rural non-farm employment. The incidence of non-farm employment of male workers is positively affected by urbanization, rural literacy and rural unemployment. On the other hand, the incidence of rural non-farm employment of female workers is positively affected by agricultural productivity and the incidence of rural poverty. Secondly, there is a strong evidence of convergence in the incidence of rural non-farm employment for both male and female workers. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 examines the trend in the non-farm employment across states. Section 3 discusses the econometric model and explanatory variables used in the regression. Section 4 analyzes the regression results. This is followed by the conclusion.",

In this paper current trends, conceptual issues, methodological approaches and research results are combined in twelve stylised facts on the relationship between technology and employment. They identify in an effective way the key issues, help us understand a complex phenomenon, and may stimulate an urgent policy debate on the challenges our societies face in a variety of fields. The twelve stylised facts are the following ones. (1) Technology is shaped by social relations Technology does not ‘fall from the sky’, it is not ‘neutral’. It is a social construction largely shaped by the logic of capitalism and by power relations in society. Scientific advances and human knowledge offer opportunities for technological innovation that may lead a nation’s economy and individual firms in very different directions. Research and innovation efforts at the technological ‘frontier’ are combined with the adoption, adaptation and diffusion of already available technologies, shaping a country’s growth trajectory. In emerging economies, choices on technology adoption are related to countries’ development strategies, relying on particular advantages in terms of knowledge base, capital stock, absorption capabilities, institutional and infrastructural setting, low labour costs, social and environmental conditions, etc. The technological solutions, the resulting economic activities—private or public, market or non-market—the combinations required for the quantity and quality of capital and labour employed, the economic and social outcomes are the results of decisions of key economic players and government policies. Examples include decisions on knowledge generation, research and education, energy sources, transport and digital infrastructures, exploitation of natural resources, manufacturing technologies, health services, environmental and climate change effects. As such, key decisions on technology should be the object of national policy debates and democratic political process. (2) Technology saves human labour; technological unemployment is a serious concern The history of technology is made of efforts for expanding human capabilities, replacing harder tasks and saving labour. In capitalism technology is embodied in the means of production and in the knowledge of workers. Since the industrial revolution of the nineteenth century, capitalism has developed machines and technologies that could replace human labour, reducing wage costs, accumulating capital and generating more profits. Technological unemployment is therefore a serious concern, rooted in the nature of capitalist production. The actual relevance of technological unemployment in particular times and places depends on the dynamics of development and on the rules and institutional arrangements on working time; in phases of expansion compensating mechanisms and public policies may offset job losses associated with technological change. (3) In the digital age the nature and boundaries of work are changing The evolution of technologies is best understood as a succession of techno-economic paradigms rooted in a set of major innovations that affect the direction of development. Since the 1980s, we have seen the emergence of the new techno-economic paradigm based on Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), based on rapid improvements in knowledge, computing and communication systems, digitalisation, networks and automation of production. In this digital age the nature of work is changing, in particular in many information-based and platform-run activities, from the media to the arts, from education to many private services. What is changing are the boundaries between market and non-market goods, between private and public goods, between work and (unpaid) human activities, between waged employment and other forms of (somehow paid) work. Google, Facebook, AirB&B and Uber are major examples of businesses thriving on this transformation; conversely, Wikipedia and open source software are examples of online creation communities providing new types of public goods through cooperative unpaid activities. When we discuss the employment impact of digitalisation, we should understand the importance of all these shifting boundaries. (4) Different technological strategies have contrasting employment effects There is too much talk of an indifferentiated ‘technology’—affecting us all in a deterministic way—and not enough attention to the different technological strategies pursued by different actors pushing knowledge and its applications in sometimes diverging directions—just think of innovations in solar energy as opposed to coal and fracking technologies. Within a given firm, technology could mean the introduction of new products, new processes, new forms of organisation; we can identify, on the one hand, a strategy of technological competitiveness where new products open up new markets, leading to job creation; conversely, in a strategy of cost (or price) competitiveness labour-saving new processes and organisations are introduced, leading to job losses. A dominance of one or the other strategy leads to diverging employment outcomes of innovation. The measures we use for technology—and the interpretations we provide—have to identify this diversity. The diffusion in most advanced and emerging countries of innovation surveys on firms makes it possible to understand this diversity of technological efforts, moving beyond the limitations of R&D and patent data as technological indicators. (5) Industries differ in their employment dynamics and role of technology Employment changes are not the same in all firms and industries. Some expand and some decline, and technology usually plays a role. The high-technology/low-technology distinction and—in a more refined way—the Pavitt’s Taxonomy of industries provide useful ways for differentiating the evolution of economic activities and employment pointing out the role played by specific technological activities. The empirical evidence shows that industries with higher technological activities tend to show better employment performances, although with many exceptions in particular countries and periods. Moreover, in different industry groups the innovation–employment relationship tends to take different forms, with the job-creating effect of new products stronger in science-based industries and the job-destroying effect of new processes stronger in traditional industries. The consideration of this heterogeneity of technologies and industries provides novel insights into the innovation–employment link. (6) We can see the employment impact of technology at the firm, industry and macroeconomic levels Job changes can emerge, as a result of innovation, at the firm, industry and macroeconomic levels. Product innovation tends to have a positive job-creating effect at all levels. Firms innovating in both products and processes, however, may be successful in expanding output and jobs, but often do so at the expense of non-innovating firms, with little net job creation. Industry and aggregate studies generally point out the possibility of technological unemployment, which emerges when industries or countries see the prevalence of process innovations in contexts of weak demand and low entry of new firms. In an open economy innovation may lead to competitiveness and exports, weakening the demand constraint or, conversely, domestic demand may increase imports when foreign competitors are more innovative in terms of price or quality; the job-destroying effects of technology tend to be intertwined to those of offshoring of domestic production. (7) Technological change is a disequilibrium process; demand and economic structure matter Mainstream economics is based on an equilibrium view of product and labour markets; technology is generally viewed as an exogenous factor affecting production processes; after a technology shock price and wage adjustments are expected to lead to a new labour market equilibrium. New growth theory has improved on this approach by assuming that in some firms innovation is endogenous and its effects spill over to the rest of the economy. Under these assumptions there is little room for understanding technological change and its employment effect. Conversely, disequilibrium approaches, combining Neo-Schumpeterian and evolutionary insights with the post-Keynesian perspective on the key role of demand and structural change provide the most appropriate tools for understanding innovation and its employment impact. (8) Business cycles affect technological change and its employment impact Schumpeterian insights have long stressed the connection between technology and business cycles. Both innovation patterns and jobs are affected by upswings and downswings. Expansions provide space for new products, new markets, new jobs; recessions bring new processes, restructuring and job destruction. The nature of the innovation–employment relationship changes from the upswing to the downswing of the cycle. Periods of major crises—such as the years since 2008 in Europe—are moments of major structural change when weaker firms and industries disappear, new labour-saving processes are introduced leading to the loss of large numbers of low skill jobs. Only when new demand starts an upswing in the business cycle, the opportunities for introducing new products open up again, bringing with them new job creation. (9) The impact of technology is different across occupations and skills Technologies are not all the same, nor jobs are. The quality of jobs—in terms of occupations, skills, educational levels, etc.—has to be considered when we investigate changes in employment. Contrary to long held expectations of a technology-driven upskilling of work from blue collar to white collar jobs (skill bias technical change), what is emerging in most countries and industries is a more polarised employment structure, with larger numbers of managers, professionals and technicians, and more unskilled manual workers, especially in services. This trend also emerges when we look at the nature of ‘tasks’ performed (routine biased technical change) distinguishing between routine jobs—both cognitive and manual (such as those of clerks and factory workers)—that are easier to replace with computers, and non-routine activities (such as those of those of managers and gardeners). In this analysis, however, attention should be paid to the hierarchies in place—in terms of power, control over work and remuneration—and the occupational structure sheds more light on current change than a focus on ‘tasks’. These developments are the current manifestation of a fundamental characteristic of capitalism—its tendency to introduce technology in ways that allow less skilled (and lower paid) labour to be used. The emergence of a more polarised occupational structure has major implications for educational requirements and welfare policies, and is likely to be problematic in terms of wage levels, inequality and prospects for social mobility. (10) Labour market conditions are relevant, but employment outcomes are not determined in labour markets alone The importance of efficient and flexible labour markets as a tool for reducing unemployment is emphasised by mainstream approaches and policies; their view is that the impact of technology is more positive when firms easily find the desired quantity and quality of workers with low wages and moderate employment protection rules. In fact, the impact technology has on jobs is determined when innovations are designed and when labour demand takes shape, well before transactions on the labour market take place. Their role is clearly important in assuring an appropriate match between labour demand and supply in terms of education and skills levels; in finding wage levels that encourage productivity improvements and their appropriate distribution between labour and capital; in developing labour market institutions that may encourage innovation. The process of technological change, in fact, is shaped by social relations—including the balance of power between capital and labour—that are reflected in the way labour markets operate. (11) In emerging countries employment outcomes are jointly affected by technology and catching up The construction of technological capabilities is a crucial component of the development process; it can be achieved through the acquisition and adaptation of foreign technologies; participation in global production networks organised by multinational firms; development of a domestic knowledge base and innovative potential. For many emerging countries the availability of innovation surveys comparable to European ones has made it possible to document the diversity of technological strategies that are carried out. A major trade-off has emerged between the acquisition of foreign technology and efforts for developing domestic R&D. The employment impact is driven by complex and contrasting forces; the acquisition of foreign machinery may introduce the same labour-saving bias found in advanced countries; once emerging countries reach some technological capability, they may enter export markets with a large potential for job creation; catching up in productivity levels may reduce employment; achieving independent capabilities may open up the possibility to reap the job creating benefit of product innovation. Still, for emerging economies the structural problems are likely to be more serious, and the compensation mechanisms less relevant than in advanced countries, possibly making the employment impact more problematic. Four trajectories linking innovation, development patterns and employment can therefore emerge: technological dependency; imported technological capabilities; integration in international technology networks; independent technological capabilities. (12) Technology is an engine of inequality; profits benefit more than wages, wage disparities increase Income inequality has reached record levels in most advanced and emerging countries and is now a major economic and political challenge. In the last three decades in many economies, national income has experienced a shift of 10–15 percentage points from wages to profits; productivity growth is leaving behind wage growth; poverty rates increase. The way technology has driven economic change is part of the problem; new product and markets allow large profits; new processes lead to job losses and lower wages; more precarious jobs and lower employment protection reduce labour costs; digital platforms allow new forms of low-wage work outside labour contracts. In most countries policies—on technology, trade, industry, labour markets, taxation, welfare expenditure, etc.—have favoured such increase in disparities, resulting in major economic and political problems. Even the OECD now acknowledges that ‘when income inequality rises, economic growth falls’. Radically new policies should ensure that labour may benefit from innovation and productivity in the forms of higher wages, lower working hours and improved working conditions. Technology is shaped by social relations 
The first stylised fact we propose is a way to conceptualise technology that has to be made explicit before the investigation of its economic and employment impact. Much economic research treats technology as exogenous, often with the (unrealistic) properties of a public good. In fact, technology itself deserves a close investigation, identifying the mix of public and private knowledge that supports its development. Studies on particular technologies, on discoveries, inventions and the introduction and diffusion of particular innovations have shown the complexity and uncertainty of such processes. Existing technologies have been shaped by institutional and social contexts, government policies, business strategies, technology push and demand pull effects. Different countries and firms have often made different technological choices in their investment in particular industries, in the hope to become the ‘standard’ and the dominant market player. Just think of the current choices world automobile firms face on the source of power—gasoline, diesel, gas, electricity, hybrid or hydrogen. Mistakes and failure are the rule rather than the exception. The process of ‘creative destruction’ identified by Joseph Schumpeter is an effective tool for understanding such developments. In exploring the employment impact of technology, our starting point has to be a view of technology as a social construction, shaped by the logic of capitalism and by power relations in society. Technology saves human labour; technological unemployment is a serious concern 
Stylised fact 2 deals with the fundamental economic function of technology. While technology has always been developed with the aim to expand human capabilities, in capitalism, the introduction of machines and successive waves of technologies have followed a specific logic. Technology is embodied in the means of production and in the knowledge of workers; machines are generally designed to save and expand the reach of human labour, reducing wage costs, allowing greater capital accumulation and higher profits. For two centuries, a major positive effect of technological change has been reducing the quantity of human labour required by economic activity. The average annual working time of workers has rapidly declined; in the last three decades, however, this reduction has stopped and has been reversed in many countries. Instead of distributing the benefits of innovation and productivity gains in terms of shorter working hours for all—with constant wages—we have less people working longer hours, while unemployment is high. This is the preferred outcome for capital, setting its own rules for the employment of labour; previous declines in working hours were the outcome of social conflict and political decisions, creating complex institutional arrangements and social rules regulating the use of labour. The lack of political and social action on this issue is turning the liberating potential of innovation into a difficult problem of technological unemployment. The debate on these issues started with the industrial revolution. At the end of the eighteenth century, James Steuart drew attention to the difficulty of reabsorbing the unemployment caused by mechanisation, in spite of the positive effects from the construction of new machines and price reductions, and already envisioned a role for the government. Adam Smith linked the invention of machines to the division of labour and emphasised its labour-saving effects. Jean-Baptiste Say had no doubts about the ability of markets to adjust, while Thomas Malthus emphasised the positive effects resulting from the strong demand dynamics experienced by England at the time. The optimism of classical economists in the early nineteenth century contrasted with the impoverishment of the English working classes—industrial workers, small artisans and displaced peasants—who had started to organise trade unions and to launch Luddite struggles against the job losses and deskilling brought about by mechanisation. David Ricardo was convinced that the economy could compensate the negative employment effects, but in a passage in the chapter ‘On machinery’, added in the third edition of his Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, argued that ‘The opinion, entertained by the labouring class, that the employment of machinery is frequently detrimental to their interests, is not founded on prejudice and error, but is conformable to the correct principles of political economy’ (Ricardo 1951:392). Karl Marx emphasised the losses for workers in terms of jobs, skills, wages and control over their work resulting from the way mechanisation was proceeding at the time and argued that unemployment grows as technical change displaces labour more rapidly that the accumulation of capital demands new workers. Marx viewed capital accumulation as a constant search for new production techniques and new products (a key starting point for the work of Schumpeter). High unemployment assures lower wages and greater control over workers; along this road, however, capital accumulation ultimately encounters the problems of finding adequate markets and demand (Heertje 1973; Vivarelli 1995, 2014; Pianta 2005). Marx had clear that the textile machines of the industrial revolution in England had their employment impact at the global level, also on the cotton artisans far away in the British empire and quoted the British Governor General reporting from India in 1834–35: ‘the misery hardly finds a parallel in the history of commerce. The bones of the cotton-weavers are bleaching the plains of India’ (Marx 1961, p. 389). The possibility of technological unemployment is therefore a fundamental characteristic of capitalism. In a global economy the expansion offered by new technologies and the dislocations they introduce on previous production systems may take place in different locations. The possible ‘compensation mechanisms’ that may mitigate technological unemployment are discussed in Stylised fact 6, where the macroeconomic dimension is addressed. Machines and technologies also require new types of labour, new forms of work organisation. Marx’s argument that capitalism has a tendency to take the control of the labour process away from workers and transfer it to machines, expanding the power of capital over labour has been made again by Braverman (1974) in the context of Fordist-type mass production in the USA, where a ‘degradation of work’ could be identified. In the age of Information and Communication Technologies, the potential for enriching or deskilling work has been pointed out by several studies. Adler (1992) found that both processes take place as a result of different strategies of firms, suggesting that ‘the use of new technologies will in general be more profitable when entrusted into more highly skilled employees’ (id. p. 3) with broader roles, greater competences and continued learning. However, it has been argued that ‘there is a fundamental contradiction between the potential of computerization to enrich working life and increase productivity and the development of the technology in the pursuit of authoritarian social goals’ (Shaiken, 1984, p. 5) as management has often introduced new technologies and shaped work organisation with the primary aim to increase control over workers (see also Noble 1984). The intensification of work is a frequent outcome, with firms pressuring workers to produce more effort; this is the result of the increased possibility to monitor work through ICTs, the weakening or absence of trade unions and overall changes in social relations and attitudes to work. In a recent book, Brynjolfson and McAfee (2014, p. 10–11) argue that ‘rapid and accelerating digitization is likely to bring economic (…) disruption, stemming from the fact that as computers gets more powerful, companies have less need for some kinds of workers. Technological progress is going to leave behind some people, perhaps even a lot of people, as it races ahead’. Technological unemployment, in short, is among us, and requires a careful understanding of its mechanisms and remedies. In the digital age the nature and boundaries of work are changing 
Stylised fact 3 identifies key changes in the nature of work that are emerging in the digital age. The most appropriate concept for understanding the economic role of technology is that of techno-economic paradigms (Perez 1983, Freeman and Louçã 2001). Building on the work of Kondratieff and Schumpeter, we can argue that capitalist development is characterised by a succession of techno-economic paradigms based on a cluster of core technologies with a major diffusion potential across the economy and with rapidly reducing costs. Steam power and the textile machines of the industrial revolution were the key elements of the first techno-economic paradigm; the present one has emerged in the 1980s and is based on Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), with a current acceleration in digitalisation, networks and automation of production. The way labour is used in our digital age differs significantly from the previous techno-economic paradigm of ‘Fordist’ mass production that had emerged in the 1940s and declined in the 1970s. ICTs and digitalisation have changed the boundaries between market and non-market goods, between private and public goods, between work and (unpaid) human activities, between waged employment and other forms of (somehow paid) work. AirB&B is turning a spare room in the house from a gift to a friend into a market good to be sold, requiring a new type of ‘self-employed’ work mixed with social interaction. Some market goods have been replaced by non-market activities, with job destruction on the one hand, and free access to improved goods and services on the other hand—the creation of knowledge as a public good in Wikipedia is carried out by unpaid online cooperative efforts, as opposed to paid work for producing and selling the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Leisure-type communication by individuals has been turned by companies such as Facebook into a profitable activity exploited for advertising and market services. As new digital platforms emerge organising work for thousands of people—such as Uber for driving services—the nature of work changes, with an appearance of occasional ‘self-employment’ and a reality of complete control by the platform corporation. In the European context much attention is now devoted to the ‘Industry 4.0’ perspective where large firms and government policies invest in accelerating digitalisation and automation of manufacturing and services, with important efforts in the areas of robotisation, ‘Big Data’, ‘Internet of things’, ‘Cloud computing’ and ‘platform economy’. This model of digitalisation and automation raises major challenges to the future of work in terms of quantity and quality of jobs, education and training, employment contracts, career prospects, social security implications, union protection and broader social relations (Guarascio and Sacchi 2018; Acemoglu and Restrepo 2017). Different technological strategies have contrasting employment effects 
Stylised fact 4 emphasises the heterogeneity of innovative efforts. The diversity in the possible trajectories of technological change means that the economic analysis of technology has to investigate the specific innovations that are introduced in the context of particular business and development strategies. This may concern a country’s growth trajectory, an industry’s evolution or a firm’s strategy. The Schumpeterian distinction between new products, new processes and new organisational forms in firms is crucial for identifying such heterogeneity. We have an innovation when a firm first markets a new product or introduces a new process; the road open to followers in the same industry (in other countries, too) is the imitation of new products (perhaps with incremental improvements, and adaptation to new users’ needs); firms in all sectors may decide on the adoption of new processes or use of new (intermediate) products generated in other industries (and/or countries). The latter two lead to the diffusion of innovations throughout the economy, in both production and consumption. These types of innovation greatly differ in their nature, economic relevance and labour market impact. Product innovations (in both manufacturing and service industries) can be based on internal innovative activities as well as on the acquisition of new intermediate or capital goods. They may replace old products or may be designed in order to reduce costs, with little or no net effect on employment, skills and wages. On the other hand, new products meeting a demand with high elasticity may expand output, leading to job creation; may increase variety and quality, leading to skill upgrading; both developments may turn a part of the productivity increases into higher wages. Process innovations (including those in the delivery of services) usually replace labour with capital (often with new investment based on information and communication technologies), leading to efficiency gains and job losses (Pianta 2001, 2005). When the new products are investment goods, they represent a product innovation in the industries producing them, and process innovations in the industries acquiring them, with contrasting effects on jobs (Edquist et al. 2001). This heterogeneity of innovation can be summarised in different technological strategies (Pianta 2001): (a) a strategy of technological competitiveness where firms or industries carry our R&D, introduce new products, open up new markets, searching for quality and technological advantages; this may result in job creation (if new products are not simply a substitution of old ones); (b) a strategy of active cost (or price) competitiveness where new processes and organisations are introduced with the aim to replace labour, reduce costs, restructure production and improve price competition; this generally results in job losses. (c) a strategy of passive cost (or price) competitiveness where no significant innovation is introduced and firms try to compete mainly on the basis of labour cost reductions. While in innovating firms and industries, new products and new processes often coexist, it has been shown that it is possible to identify the dominant strategy that shapes employment effects (Pianta 2000). In order to identify this heterogeneous technological strategies, however, empirical analyses have to move beyond the use of R&D, patent data or the adoption of ICTs as technological indicators and use data from innovation surveys on firms, that are now available not only for Europe, but also for a large number of emerging countries (see Stylised fact 11 below). Innovation surveys (based on the OECD-Eurostat Oslo Manual and on the Bogota Manual) provide information based on surveys that are representative of the universe of firms that document the presence of innovation in products, processes and organisations; the expenditure for innovation (R&D, design, new machinery, marketing, etc.); the objectives that are pursued (from opening up new markets to reducing labour costs); the barriers to innovation; the share of sales associated with new products and their degree of novelty (new for the firm only or new for the relevant market); the relevance of policies, and many other aspects. By using this approach, it is possible to break down the view of an undifferentiated technology affecting employment and to test the contrasting employment effects of strategies of technological or cost competitiveness. A large evidence is now available on European countries showing that manufacturing and service industries where product innovation is important in driving technological competitiveness have positive employment effects. Conversely, labour-saving cost competitiveness efforts lead to job losses. The employment consequences of product and process innovations are visibly different in terms of the ex ante objectives of firms’ innovative strategies, in terms of ex post introduction of innovation by firms, and in terms of the specific impact on sales. (Pianta 2000; Antonucci and Pianta 2002; Mastrostefano and Pianta 2009; Bogliacino and Pianta 2010). The diversity of innovation in emerging countries is discussed below in Stylised fact 11. Industries differ in their employment dynamics and role of technology  Stylised fact 5 looks at the heterogeneity of industries in terms of their technological activities and innovative strategies. The distinction between high and low technology industries and firms is frequently used in order to identify activities where knowledge and innovation are more important. Figure 1 shows the long-term evolution of value added, employment and labour productivity in high-technology and low-technology manufacturing and service sectors in five major EU countries. In high-technology industries value added has almost doubled between 1995 and 2007, with downturns in the crises of 2002 and 2008–2009; employment has increased by about 25% only, with major productivity improvements. Conversely, low-technology sectors showed a value added growth of about 20% with a very modest dynamics of employment and productivity. The importance of innovation and the more sustained demand dynamics for high-technology productions are clear factors behind these contrasting patterns.  Source: Cirillo (2016a), OECD STAN data Value added, employment and labour productivity in high-technology and low-technology manufacturing and service sectors in five major EU countries (DE, ES, FR, IT, UK). A more careful investigation, however, can group manufacturing and service sectors in the four categories of the Revised Pavitt’s Taxonomy (Pavitt 1984; Bogliacino and Pianta 2010) that provides a relevant conceptualisation of the differences in the process of technological change by classifying firms and industries on the basis of their dominant sources of innovation, the forms of appropriation of technology and market structure. The four groups include the following: (a) Science-based industries include sectors based on advancements in science, where R&D is the main source of innovation such as chemicals and pharmaceuticals, office machinery, R&D and business services. High technological opportunities are associated with a strong internal innovative effort. Together with specialised supplier sectors, they represent the most innovative sectors and a source of innovation for the whole economic system. (b) Specialised supplier industries create specific products for users-industries, and these typically include machinery and equipment and consultancy services, with an active role for human capital. High levels of Research & Development expenditure (R&D) and a tacit transferring of knowledge among workers characterise a strong internal innovation process. (c) Scale- and information-intensive industries include sectors characterised by large economies of scale, high capital intensity and strong relevance of organisational improvements such as motor vehicles, rubber and plastic products, banking services. (d) Supplier-dominated industries include traditional sectors (including food, textiles, clothing and traditional services); they typically direct efforts towards the mechanisation of productive processes; innovation principally sources from suppliers of equipment and materials. Figure 2 shows the rates of change of employment in Revised Pavitt classes in manufacturing in six major EU countries. Science-based and specialised supplier industries—the most innovative ones—have some growth of jobs from 1996 to 2000, with a steep fall in the crisis of 2001–2003 and a recovery up to 2007. Scale-intensive industries have stagnant employment up to 2000 and job reductions up to 2% per year in the following years. Supplier-dominated traditional industries have continuing job losses reaching − 5% in 2004–2005. Can we identify the specific role of technology in these contrasting trends? Source: Lucchese and Pianta (2012), OECD STAN data Rates of change of employment in Revised Pavitt classes in six major EU countries (DE, ES, FR, IT, NL, UK). When the analysis of the innovation–employment link is carried out separately for each industry group, different mechanisms can be identified. Considering 38 manufacturing and service sectors in eight major European countries in 1994–2004, the following results have emerged. The (modest) expansion of employment in science-based sectors has been driven by new products and by the net entry of new firms, while labour-saving process innovation has no significant effect. In specialised supplier industries weaker positive effects of new products and stronger negative effects of new processes have been found. Scale- and information-intensive sectors and the traditional industries grouped in the supplier-dominated category have recorded net jobs losses that are explained by labour-saving new processes and wage growth, while the increase in demand is the only factor supporting job creation (Bogliacino and Pianta 2010). These findings suggest an important role of heterogeneity in industries—an even greater one can be found for firms—and point out the relevance of sectoral studies for identifying the specific relationships between innovation and employment. We can see the employment impact of technology at the firm, industry and macroeconomic levels 
Stylised fact 6 stresses a methodological point—the impact of innovation on the quantity and quality of employment can be assessed at the firm, industry and macroeconomic levels. At each level of analysis we focus on a specific context and approach and we can shed light on different relationships (Pianta 2005). The firm level The most direct employment impact of innovation is found in the firms that introduce them; the available evidence suggests that firms innovating in products, but also in processes, grow faster and are more likely to expand their employment than non-innovative ones, regardless of industry, size or other characteristics. In the case of new products, the job-creating effect is associated with expanded output (as an example of this approach see Vivarelli et al. 1996). In the case of new processes, the resulting productivity gains may lead to price reductions, larger market shares, higher output, requiring new employees. However, firm level studies cannot identify whether the gains of innovating firms are made at the expense of competitors (the business stealing effect), or whether there is a net expansion in overall jobs. Moreover, firm level studies are frequently carried out on panels that are not representative of the universe of firms; they tend to focus on manufacturing firms alone; entry or exit of firms left outside the panel may account for a large part of employment change; in this context generalising the results of firm level studies may be problematic. The industry level Industry level studies can account for the direct effects in firms and for the indirect impact within industries, including the competitive redistribution of output and jobs from low to high innovation intensive firms, and the evolution of demand (and therefore output and jobs) resulting from the lower prices due to innovation, given the price elasticities of the industry’s goods. The industry level allows to differentiate between the variety of technological regimes and strategies and, on the other hand, to bring in the demand dynamics of specific sectors, taking into account country differences in economic structures. Innovation generally has a net job-creating effect in those manufacturing and service industries showing high demand growth and an orientation towards product innovation, while a dominance of new processes may result in job losses. The overall employment effect of technology depends on the countries and periods considered, but in general is more positive the higher demand growth and the industry’s technological level, the greater the entry dynamism of new firms, and the orientation towards new products. Differently from the analysis of firms, whose demand is expected to be highly elastic, an industry’s demand is constrained by the (relatively slow) evolution of domestic and foreign demand; countries with a greater economic dynamism are likely to receive a disproportionate part of the employment benefits of technology, leaving to countries with lower innovation the burden of greater job losses (as examples of this approach see Pianta 2000; Bogliacino and Pianta 2010). It should be pointed out that in this regard service industries do not differ substantially from manufacturing (Evangelista and Savona 2002, 2003; Bogliacino et al. 2013). The macroeconomic level The most complete view of the employment impact of innovation is provided by a macroeconomic perspective that can integrate all the indirect effects through which technological change affects employment—changes in prices and quantities of goods; shifts in demand patterns, investment capability and interest rates; differences in international openness of the economy; changes in wages and amount of jobs. This is the approach typical of the debate on ‘compensation mechanisms’; a comprehensive investigation on their relevance has been carried out by Vivarelli (1995), Simonetti et al. (2000). The compensation mechanism via decrease in prices has emerged as the most important one: new technologies may make lower prices possible, increasing international competitiveness and output, offsetting job losses due to the original innovation. This outcome, however, is contingent on the lack of demand constraints, on the decision of firms to transfer in lower prices the productivity gains due to the innovation, and on the lack of oligopolistic power in the relevant markets (Sylos Labini 1969). The compensation mechanism via new machines may create jobs in the industries in which the new means of production are made, responding to the increased demand for equipment by users. However, the rationale for mechanisation is by definition saving on the overall use of labour, putting a limit on the relevance of this mechanism. The compensation mechanism via new investment argues that the temporary extra profits available to the innovator may be turned into new investment if profit expectations are favourable (and assuming that Say’s law operates); this, however, may expand production capacity and jobs, or may introduce additional labour-saving effects. The compensation mechanism via decrease in wages is typical of the neoclassical view of the labour market. As technological unemployment appears, wages should fall and firms should hire more workers. This mechanism, however, is based on strong assumptions as to the feasibility of any combination of labour and capital, competitive markets, flexibility of wages and labour markets. The compensation mechanism via increase in incomes operates in the opposite way, through the increased demand associated with the distribution of part of the gains from innovation through higher wages, as has happened in large, oligopolistic firms in mass production industries. However, any wage increases can hardly be large enough to sustain additional aggregate demand. Finally, new products may lead to new economic activities and new markets (welfare effects) or, on the other hand, they may simply replace existing goods (substitution effect); in a dynamic economy—such as the USA—this effect could be significant (Vivarelli 1995). While this approach is the most comprehensive and satisfactory for explaining the overall impact of technological change on employment, the complexity of the construction of the model, the problems in specifying all relevant relationships, and the lack of adequate data limit the feasibility of this approach. Simulation studies The employment impact of innovation has also been studied through the use of a simulation approach. Leontief and Duchin (1986) have found that the diffusion of computer technology and automation in the USA economy would have negative employment effects; their analysis was based on an input–output model incorporating strong assumptions on the productivity-enhancing effects of process innovation, but no demand dynamics. A general equilibrium model with a sectoral structure, which assumes full employment, has been used for simulating the employment impact of different scenarios of technology-based productivity growth and of the composition of consumption, in a study by IPTS-ESTO (2001) on the European Union. The results show an overall positive impact on jobs, differentiated according to the alternative sectoral distributions of R&D and innovation efforts; the best outcomes result from the concentration of efforts in high technology industries. While they are interesting as explorations of alternative futures, the results of such simulations are weakened by the models’ inability to identify either technological unemployment (when general equilibrium or DSGE models are used) or most compensation effects (when input–output models are used), and on the arbitrariness of the assumptions on the diffusion and productivity of new technologies. In sum, technological unemployment can be detected at the industry and macroeconomic level and is generally associated with low demand dynamics, lower technological activities or high international competition in high-technology industries, and a dominance of process innovations. In open economies the generally positive role of new products and demand has to be combined with the importance of national specialisations, economic structures and the intensity of international competition, resulting in winners and losers in terms of job creation. A large attention has also been devoted to the combined employment effects of technology and globalisation; offshoring of domestic production can have a similar job destruction effect as technology in advanced countries, creating jobs in emerging economies (Bramucci et al. 2017; see Stylised fact 11 on the latter). Technological change is a disequilibrium process; demand and structural change matter  Stylised fact 7 moves to the level of economic theories, discussing how they have addressed the innovation–employment nexus. Mainstream economic approaches are based on an equilibrium view of product and labour markets; technology has long been considered as an exogenous factor affecting the whole economy with new production techniques that require changes in the combinations of capital and labour. Price and wage adjustments ensure that equilibrium in labour markets is achieved; the ‘natural’ rate of unemployment may increase, but the presence of technological unemployment is ‘assumed away’ in this approach. The ‘new growth theory’ has introduced some improvements with models where innovative efforts—proxied by technology, learning and education—are endogenous in a subset of the economy and ‘spill over’ to non-innovating firms, opening up the possibility of unemployment effects. In these perspectives unemployment is essentially considered as a labour market phenomenon, ignoring both technological unemployment and Keynesian unemployment—due to a lack of aggregate demand. Concern is mainly on the flexible operation of labour markets; downward changes in wages and labour conditions are expected to eliminate unemployment. Labour economists, in turn, have explained changes in employment and wages with main reference to the demography of jobs, macroeconomic factors, wage costs, bargaining modes and the flexibility of labour markets. The usual assumption is that of general (or partial) equilibrium of markets, that is, all output finds its demand, and all workers ready to accept the current wage find employment. Technological change is often reduced to new production processes (and new production functions), with models rarely envisaging the emergence of product innovation. When employment losses appear, they lead to downward adjustments in wages and a new equilibrium; when this is not achieved, responsibility is attached to the lack of flexibility of labour markets, with excessive union power or institutional rigidities, such as the minimum wage. The impact of technological change cannot be understood within such a framework. Technology is by definition a disequilibrating process, long pointed out by Marx and Schumpeter. Approaches that have built on such insights include the following: (a) Neo-Schumpeterian approaches have developed the concept of techno-economic paradigms, associated with long waves of capitalist developments. The rise of the paradigm based on Information and Communication Technologies creates and destroys a large amount of jobs; employment expansion can be expected only once the mismatches between the new technologies and the old economic and social structures and institutions are overcome, with a two-way adjustment. Innovation has to be adapted to social needs and economic demands; economic and social structures evolve under pressure from new technologies. New technologies need to be matched by organisational changes, new institutions and rules, learning processes, the emergence of new industries and markets, and the expansion of new demand. A long adjustment process is required, and persisting mismatches can lead to unemployment (Freeman et al. 1982; Freeman and Soete 1987, 1994; Freeman and Louçã 2001). (b) Evolutionary perspectives have argued that technologies improve through innovations that expand variety and through selection in market processes; the emphasis is put on change rather than equilibrium and the role of heterogeneity, path dependency, feedbacks loops is emphasised. As analytical tools simulation and models based on heterogeneous interacting agents are often used (Nelson and Winter 1982; Dosi et al. 1988). This approach offers an appropriate understanding of the process of technological change, but has not yet produced detailed studies of its employment impact. (c) Post-Keynesian views of structural change emphasise the importance of demand in driving economic growth and the importance of a country’s sectoral structure; industries are assumed to grow or decline on the basis of the joint evolution of technology on the one hand and demand on the other (Pasinetti 1981). A strong expansion of demand—both domestic and foreign—offers room for creating new economic activities and jobs alongside the job destruction resulting from technology; new products tend to be introduced in phases of expansion when they can more easily meet new demand. A country’s success in job creation, however, also depends on its economic structure, reflecting the relative importance of high and low tech activities and the type of innovations that are introduced (Bogliacino et al. 2013, see Stylised facts 4 and 5 above). The process of structural change, with countries’ different abilities to contract declining industries and expand production and employment in emerging ones, plays a major role in explaining employment performances. Better outcomes are found in countries with a greater activity in sectors with fast growing (at the world level) demand and output, and with greater ability to reshape their economic structures. Worse outcomes are found where a larger part of employment is in industries more exposed to the negative impact of labour-saving technological change and globalisation, and where more rigidities exist in the economic structure. Over the past three decades in this regard Europe and the USA have evolved along opposite patterns. The USA has experienced faster growth of population, labour supply and GDP than Europe, with the expansion of new sectors based on product and service innovations, in more competitive labour markets where less regulation on minimum wages and union power are found. This has resulted in a faster growth of new jobs (compared to Europe) at the top and bottom end of the skill structure, and this polarisation has been amplified in terms of wage inequalities by the lower regulation of USA labour markets. Conversely, in Europe lower demand and greater competitive pressure have led to a slower dynamics of GDP and jobs; this macroeconomic context has led firms to favour new process technologies that have significantly reduced low skill employment, with little room for new job creation; wage polarisation has at first been mitigated by stronger European rules on wage setting and employment protection, but in the last decade labour reforms in most EU countries have moved in the direction of more precarious work, lower protection and greater wage disparities (see ILO 2015). In the conclusions of our book ‘The employment impact of innovation’, writing in 2000, before the introduction of the euro, we wrote that ‘within the European Union, the current constraints on the expansion of demand, set by the terms of the European Economic and Monetary Union may turn out to be serious factors preventing the evolution of economic structures towards a direction more consistent with the potential offered by technological change’ (Pianta and Vivarelli 2000, p. 211). The low economic and employment growth of Europe since then—and in particular after the 2008 crisis—confirms how important an expansionary macroeconomic policy is in order to capture the potential employment benefits of technology. Business cycles affect technological change and its employment impact 
Stylised fact 8 introduces the time dimension. Capitalist development takes place in cycles; expansions of production bring new jobs, recessions lead to job losses. Technology too develops in cycles; expansions provide space for new products, recessions bring new processes and restructuring. The effects of cycles can be huge, as happened in Europe after the 2008 crisis; in 2008–2014, more than 6 million jobs were lost in Europe (EU 28) and 4 million in Greece, Spain, Italy and Portugal alone. Figure 3 shows how uneven the employment impact of the crisis has been in the EU, with no net job loss in Northern EU countries, limited losses in Eastern economies and the heaviest impact in the countries of Southern Europe, where a significant job growth had taken place in pre-crisis years. Employment change over the business cycle by country groups in Europe. Average annual growth rates, percentage change Figure 4 shows the same cyclical effects for the occupational structure of major European countries (skills are addressed in Stylised fact 9 below); in the expansion more polarised jobs emerged; in the recession a major destruction of low skill blue collar jobs took place. These trends are accompanied by different technological strategies; in expansions new products may open up new markets and offer new jobs, while in recessions new processes may come to dominate technological change, leading to restructuring and job losses. Employment change over the business cycle by professional groups. Average annual growth rates, percentage change, five major European countries (DE, FR, IT, ES, UK) The analysis of these cyclical patterns has been carried out by looking at the impact specific innovations have on jobs in the different phases of the business cycle (Lucchese and Pianta 2012; Cirillo et al. 2018). Mainstream views include Real business-cycle approaches that have assumed technology shocks as sources of fluctuations in growth (Galì 1999); endogenous growth studies assumed that downswings can stimulate productivity through a restructuring that eliminates inefficient firms (Aghion and Saint-Paul 1998). As described by Stiglitz (1993), during upswings retained profits can allow firms to overcome the financial constraints to innovation. Conversely, neo-Schumpeterian perspectives have emphasised the role of business cycles and long waves as fundamental aspects in the emergence and diffusion of technology. For Schumpeter, innovation is uncertain and discontinuous; expansion, in turn, is uneven and unbalanced (Schumpeter 1934). For Mensch (1979), innovations are introduced in bundles during depressions: in upswings, firms can exploit rents from a higher demand for existing products; in a downswing, expected profits are lower and introducing innovations appears as a more attractive strategy. Kleinknecht (1982) emphasised the role of depressions in stimulating innovations, although the evidence is uncertain. For Freeman (Freeman et al. 1982; Freeman and Louçã 2001), depressions can increase incentives to innovate, but strong demand with expanding markets creates high expectations of profits and important opportunities for the introduction of major innovations leading to the expansion of employment in emerging industries. Freeman also suggested that business cycles could have an impact on the type of innovations introduced in the economy; product innovation is associated with phases of strong growth, while process innovations seem to be ‘more attractive to entrepreneurs in periods of pressure on profit margin and during the downswing of long waves and even in depressions’ (Freeman et al. 1982, p. 4; Freeman and Louçã 2001). Recent empirical evidence has found that high technology sectors are particularly vulnerable to cycles, as shown in Fig. 2 by the higher fluctuations of employment in science-based and specialised suppliers industries, while scale-intensive industries have a higher degree of market power that can explain the greater stability in their employment patterns over the cycle. Findings have shown that during upswings the potential for Schumpeterian profits from major innovations is greater, and this favours the introduction of new products and the expansion of new markets. On the other hand, in industries where innovations are less important, the expansion of demand lowers the competitive pressure and the need to innovate; during upswings even less-efficient firms may survive and profit. Conversely, during downswings, the lack of demand may discourage the introduction of new products and may increase competition based on costs and prices, leading industries to focus on new processes that lead to labour-saving and cost-cutting in the context of restructuring and exit of less-efficient firms. During upswings aggregate industry growth, as well as productivity increases, appears to be supported by both new products and new processes, as both technological and cost competitiveness may lead to output or efficiency improvements. During downswings new processes associated with restructuring appear relevant in containing the fall in economic activities, while new products and demand lose their importance (Lucchese and Pianta 2012; Cirillo et al. 2018). The structural effects of slumps should not be ignored; recessions disrupt the mechanisms of innovation-based growth and push firms towards a technological trajectory based on labour-saving new processes that increase efficiency but destroy jobs. Along with jobs, competences, skills and production capacity are lost during recessions, with the risk of setting the trajectory of growth on a lower path of development. The impact of technology is different across occupations and skills 
Stylised fact 9 breaks down total employment into different qualities of jobs, defined by skills, tasks and occupations. Within the mainstream, studies on skill biased technological change have focused on the complementarity between technologies and skills, predicting an increasing importance of skilled workers (Berman et al. 1994; Autor et al. 1998; Chennels and Van Reenen 1999; Acemoglu 2002, Acemoglu and Autor 2011). A ‘race’ was also expected between the increasing demand for high skills due to the introduction of technologies and the supply of skills in the labour market (Goldin and Katz 2008). In fact, what is emerging in most countries and industries is a more polarised employment structure, that is documented by the nature of ‘tasks’ performed (routine biased technical change) distinguishing between routine jobs—both cognitive and manual (such as those of clerks and factory workers)—that are easier to replace with computers, and non-routine activities (such as those of those of managers and gardeners) (Autor et al. 2003; Autor and Dorn 2013; Goos and Manning 2007; Goos et al. 2014). Routinisation has a strong effect on job changes; the effects of technology on skills are often mixed with those of foreign trade. In the case of US industries in the 1990s, the job destroying impact of innovation appeared to be dominant, while international trade played a minor role (Berman et al. 1998). The impact of the Great Recession on jobs in the USA has been recently investigated by a set of studies edited by Card and Mas (2016); weak demand dynamics, the lack of hiring by small firms, the role of imports from China were identified among the factors contributing to slow employment growth in the USA. Considering the skill structure of US jobs, Beaudry, Green and Sand (2016) suggest a deskilling pattern in the occupational structure due to a contraction in the demand for skilled workers performing cognitive tasks, leading to a stagnation in their wages. Such trends—they argue—have been accelerated by the collapse of the US housing bubble. Therefore, high-skilled workers moved down the occupational ladder and displaced lower-educated workers in less skill-intensive jobs, suggesting a deskilling pattern in the occupational structure. More solid and systematic evidence may come from data based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) that could be organised in four main groups: managers, clerks, craft and manual workers (see Table 1); these occupational groups are able to account for the employment hierarchies both in terms of education attainments and wages (Cirillo et al. 2018). Figure 4 above provides an overview—for the five largest EU economies—of the patterns of change of the four professional groups in the years before and after the crisis. During the upswing from 2002 to 2007 employment growth has not reflected a general upskilling of jobs, but rather a polarising pattern has emerged, with expanding jobs for managers and for the lowest skilled manual workers, while mid-level skills for both white collars (clerks) and blue collars (craft workers) declined. This polarising pattern is particularly evident in services. The picture is different after the start of the crisis; a major destruction of blue collar jobs has taken place, with managers only increasing the number of jobs. Craft workers have a worse dynamics than manual workers, reflecting the expansion of ancillary jobs in low qualified activities (Eurofound 2013) that is a key element of the pattern of polarisation. Growth in managers is stronger in Spain, Italy and France—where catching up effects in the skill structure could be relevant—while increases in manual workers are found in Germany, Spain and Italy. Data for 38 manufacturing and service industries in five major European countries highlight the connection between nature of innovation and occupational group (see Cirillo et al. 2018). Figure 5 shows that the share of managers in total employment is positively associated with the share of firms introducing an innovation (either new product or new process), with a wide dispersion due to industry and country diversity. Figure 6 highlights the negative association between the share of manual workers and that of firms introducing an innovation. Industries with greater innovative potential are characterised by higher skills, while those where manual workers constitute the bulk of the workforce have the lowest technological activities. Source: Cirillo et al. 2018 Innovation in firms and shares of managers in employment. Averages 1999–2011, five European countries, 38 manufacturing and service industries, percentages. Source: Cirillo et al. 2018 Innovation in firms and shares of manual workers in employment. Averages 1999–2011, five European countries, 38 manufacturing and service industries, percentages. Empirical investigations have shown that each occupational group is differently affected by innovation and other factors of change. Managers are the group that is most favoured by the introduction of product innovations, while process innovations negatively affect the jobs of low skill workers. It has also been shown that the impact of offshoring is parallel to the one of process innovation, with negative effects especially for low skill workers. If we investigate the different effects during the business cycle, we find that the gains in the expansion are concentrated in managers, while in the recession the largest losses hit craft and manual workers (Cirillo 2016a, b; Cirillo et al. 2018). These findings suggest that standard relationships between innovation and jobs are disrupted during downswings (Card and Mas 2016). The hierarchical position of different occupational groups is not irrelevant for understanding decisions on innovation; this may contribute to explain the ability of stronger occupational groups (managers) to benefit from new product technology and preserve their jobs even during recessions; conversely, the weaker professional groups (manual workers in particular) have been hardest hit by job losses associated with new processes and to the restructuring taking place during recessions. These different outcomes are the result of how different professional groups are able to control decisions in firms, shape the type of technological change that is introduced, and protect themselves from potential threats in markets and technology, building on their bargaining and contractual position. Labour market conditions are relevant, but employment outcomes are not determined in labour markets alone 
Stylised fact 10 brings us to the labour market, where the number of jobs and wage levels are determined. For mainstream economic approaches this is the most important context for assessing the employment impact of technology. For the alternative approaches investigated above in this paper, the key mechanisms shaping the innovation–employment nexus are operating well before the labour market stage—in the dynamics of technology and in the product market where labour demand takes shape. In the labour market, in fact, equilibrium is found simply moving along a given labour demand curve, encouraging at the same time a greater supply of labour, typically through education and ‘active labour market policies’. Mainstream views emphasise the need for efficient and flexible labour markets as a tool for addressing unemployment, reducing union power, collective bargaining agreements, employment protection and minimum wage regulations. The US labour market is often portrayed as a model of efficient operation, and in the past decade many European countries have moved in such a direction introducing labour ‘reform’ packages. In this perspective employment dynamics is expected to be driven by wage levels; business cycles have a role here as workers and unions reduce their wage claims in periods of high unemployment (Pissarides 2009; a discussion of wages is in Stylised fact 12 below). Technology factors are largely neglected by these approaches; besides wage levels, mainstream views and policies have targeted ‘excessive’ regulations and rigidities as the culprit of the imperfect working of the labour market; a large attention has gone to the types of employment contracts (open ended or temporary; full or part time), hiring and firing restrictions, the presence of labour rights, unions’ bargaining power, welfare conditions, etc., as factors that could prevent a more ‘efficient’ operation of labour markets. In most advanced countries policies have gone in this direction, leading to the decline of standard employment—full time, permanent jobs with union contracts, employment protection, social insurance and pension systems. The 2015 International Labour Office report has documented the rise of non-standard jobs and has showed that ‘over 6 out of 10 wage and salaried workers worldwide are in either part-time or temporary forms of wage and salaried employment. Women are disproportionately represented among those in temporary and part-time forms of wage and salaried employment’ (ILO, 2015, p. 13). In the alternative approaches for understanding the innovation–employment nexus discussed above, labour markets do play a role, but attention goes to the segmentation of labour supply and demand on the basis of education and skills; on appropriate education, learning and training activities; on the way workers’ learning may support continuous innovation in firms; on employment contracts and their impact on technological activities; on the appropriate welfare protections that may reduce exposure to social risks and encourage innovation; on the way wages can capture a fair share of the productivity gains made possible by technological change (see Stylised fact 12). In fact technological change—as a process shaped by social relations (Stylised fact 1)—responds to the social and institutional constraints that emerge in a society; labour market conditions, rules on working time, labour rights and social protections are fundamental aspects of the way human labour interacts with particular technologies. In emerging countries employment outcomes are jointly affected by technology and catching up 
Stylised fact 11 addresses the specific conditions of emerging countries. The ability to introduce new technologies is now seen in developing economies as a crucial element in the process of industrialisation. Major efforts to introduce new products and processes, to imitate rapidly frontier innovators, to widely adopt new capital equipment and production technologies, to diffuse the use of new goods and services are now under way in many developing and emerging economies, from Eastern Europe to China, from India to South-East Asia, from Latin America to Southern Africa. This process is highlighted by the success of some Asian countries (most recently China and India) in shifting from a paradigm of technology adoption to one of domestic knowledge generation (Chadha 2009; Altenburg et al. 2008), although the ability of other countries to follow the same road has been questioned (Sargent and Matthews 2008; Perez 2008). Such attention to technology has led to a rapid diffusion in these countries of innovation surveys, replicating and adapting the model first developed in Europe (OECD 2005; Eurostat 2008; Blankley et al. 2006). The advantage of innovation surveys is in their ability to document the complex and multidimensional nature of technological change in firms (Dosi 1982; Pavitt 1984), offering a variety of indicators on inputs, outputs, sources, objectives and hampering factors. A detailed investigation has reviewed and compared the evidence from innovation surveys in emerging countries referring to the time period between 2002 and 2006 (Bogliacino et al. 2011). A summary of the main findings is provided below. Table 2 shows that in general EU-15 outperforms emerging countries in terms of innovative output, but the variance among the latter is very large. There are a few Asian countries—such as South Korea—whose performances are comparable or higher than the EU-15. Most emerging countries and countries or recent accession to the EU have innovative output that is moderately behind EU-15 levels. A few countries lag behind the EU by a substantial margin—such as Russia, Ukraine and Thailand. It should be pointed out here that data on innovative turnover refer to the share of sales of products that are new to the firm, including therefore both innovation and imitation; for example, Malaysia has a 42% share on innovative turnover, but the percentage which does not result from imitation is about 14%. Figure 7 shows the trade-off between the two major priorities in the expenditure on innovation—on the one hand, the prevalence of R&D, typical of countries closer to the technological frontier and engaging in original innovation; on the other hand, the concentration of resources on the introduction of new production technologies (usually developed elsewhere) through the acquisition of new machinery and equipment. Countries in the process of industrialisation tend to devote the large majority of their technological efforts to the latter; this is the case of Latin America (with the exception of Brazil), Russia, South Africa, but also of the Central and Eastern European countries that have recently joined the EU. On the other hand, China, other Asian countries and Turkey have an intermediate position, devoting their efforts in roughly equal shares to R&D and new machinery; this shows that such countries are moving closer, at least in some sectors, to the European pattern of expenditure for innovation. R&D and acquisition of new machinery in selected countries. Data are expressed as share of total innovation expenditure Table 3 shows the main objectives of innovation; strategies based on new and improved products may be linked to a search for new markets and a wider product range, while efforts focused on production processes may lead to greater capacity and flexibility, or lower labour and other production costs (again, data do not add up to 100 as they show the share of firms indicating each objective as relevant). Quality improvement appears as the dominant objective in emerging countries, associated with other product-related efforts; in parallel, innovation in processes aims at strengthening the productive capacity—especially in Asia and Latin America—with concerns on labour costs playing a more limited role. In the evidence above a systematic comparison between manufacturing and service industries has been provided. Results are generally consistent across different variables; innovative efforts and outputs tend to be stronger in manufacturing, with services following closely in most countries. Combining this empirical evidence (Bogliacino et al. 2011) and key insights from the existing literature—in particular Abramovitz (1986), Lall and Pietrobelli (2002), Freeman and Louçã (2001), Perez (2002)—the following patterns can be identified. In emerging countries technological change mainly takes the form of acquisition of new machinery and imitation of the products and processes developed elsewhere. Both technology adoption and imitation can spread rapidly among firms in emerging countries, with the benefits typical of catching-up processes. Innovation, however, requires resources and institutions; in emerging countries the gaps are not simply of a quantitative nature—the amount of R&D, of higher education, of high technology investment—but concern the nature of the national system of innovation, with a frequent lack of integration between firms in the production system, the financial sector, research and education activities and the policies of the public sector. The evidence on the sources of knowledge and obstacles to innovation points out the importance of building a coherent innovation system. Innovation is pushed by industrialisation and pulled by growth of markets. On the supply side, the dominance of new machinery among innovative expenditures and the importance of technology adoption suggest a close link to the process of industrialisation. On the demand side, countries integrated in international production networks are able to diffuse modern production competences adopting new process technologies, finding expanding markets for products that imitate those of advanced countries. Being exposed to international competition favours innovation. When facing external competition, firms tend to adopt technology faster, a result that has emerged also in advanced countries. However, this does not mean that developing economies automatically benefit from opening up to trade and foreign competition in all industries; where domestic capabilities are inadequate and dynamic scale economies are not yet reached, opening up may simply put domestic firms out of business, losing part of the production system. The search for a trade-off between these opportunities and risks is a matter that should be addressed by national industrial policies (Cimoli et al. 2009). The affiliates of multinational corporations tend to be more innovative than the national average, another result that has also emerged in advanced countries (Castellani and Zanfei 2006). This is linked to intra-firm knowledge flows and to the strategies by foreign firms aiming to exploit their competences and technologies in local markets. However, little domestic technological capabilities may be produced, the integration between foreign affiliates and local firms can be modest, and the spillover effects in terms of knowledge, competences and productivity can be small. The main obstacle to innovation is its economic cost and the lack of finance, again a result also found in advanced countries. In emerging economies the absence of advanced and forward-looking financial systems is a major weakness of national innovation systems. Building on this empirical evidence, a typology of four trajectories linking innovation, development and employment could be proposed. (a) Technological dependency is typical of countries with a small industrial base, where the main part of the economy is made up by agriculture or export commodities. Technology—in different forms—is generally acquired from abroad. The lack of a knowledge infrastructures prevents the exploitation of foreign technology that remains difficult to adopt and imitate. The actual effects on productivity and employment may be uncertain. (b) Imported technological capabilities are found when there is significant acquisition of foreign technologies by domestic firms through new machinery and learning processes, leading to new productions, but with no inventive capabilities. This pattern may be typical of economies that are resource-intensive, commodity-exporting or at the first stages of offshore production; they tend to be unable to build a critical mass of domestic knowledge base. The acquisition of machinery may allow some catching up in productivity levels; however, alongside machinery they may import the same labour-saving bias typical of advanced countries in very different employment contexts. (c) Integration in international technology networks is the pattern typical of open economies with close links between foreign-owned domestic firms and the system of international production of multinational firms. We can find here transfer of technologies, growing production capabilities and participation to innovative activities, mainly through the acquisition of new machinery. This may lead to positive innovative performances, but with a limited consolidation of the domestic knowledge base. The employment impact is driven here by export demand which could require large job creation. However, key decision on the types of technologies used may remain in the hands of the multinational firms controlling international production, leading to very different (and unstable) innovation–employment relationships. Recent evidence includes cases—such as those of Foxconn and Nike—of advanced robotisation strategies that may replicate in emerging countries the massive labour-displacing effects of advanced economies. (d) Independent technological capabilities is a trajectory characterised by the development of internal innovative capabilities and activities by domestic firms (ranging from R&D to design, imitation and adaptation of foreign know-how), leading to new productions for the internal and international markets, and the ability to compete with advanced countries at least in some product groups and industries. This is the condition of the largest emerging countries that face the challenge to extend and diversify their technological activities. The employment impact of such trajectory includes the job creation effects of new products in areas of national strength and is moving closer to the pattern discussed in the case of advanced countries. Elements of these different trajectories may coexist in different industries of emerging countries, with a complex interaction between technology, development patterns and job creation. However, for emerging economies the employment impact of technology may appear to be more problematic than in advanced countries; structural problems are likely to be more serious, and the compensation mechanisms could be less effective (Karaomerlioglu and Ansal 2000). The diffusion of automation is also creating new challenges for emerging countries (World Bank 2017). Technology is an engine of inequality; profits benefit more than wages, wage disparities increase 
Stylised fact 12 concerns the distribution of the benefits of innovation between capital and labour and among workers. There is ample evidence that the current patterns of technological change have contributed to the unprecedented rise in income inequalities in most advanced countries (Franzini and Pianta 2016; Piketty 2013). An effective way of documenting the loss of labour and the gains of capital as a result of technological change is provided by Fig. 8, drawn from the ILO Global wage report, showing productivity and wage dynamics in the 36 largest economies since 1991. Innovation is a main driver of productivity gains; productivity growth has not been particularly rapid, with average increases around 1.2% per year, but wage increases have been left behind and are basically flat since 2009, with average increases around 0.4%. Wage increases equal to productivity growth are generally required if we want to maintain a stable distribution of income between wages and profits. The effect of technology on income distribution between profits and wages, and on disparities among workers is examined below.

From: ILO (2014), Global Wage Report 2014/15, p.8. © 2015 International Labour Organization Disparities between profits and wages In advanced countries over the last decades the functional distribution of income between labour and capital has seen a shift of 10–15 percentage points of national income from wages to profits, resulting in a major increase in inequality. Real wages have fallen for a large number of workers. The 2012 OECD Employment Outlook argued that the reduction in the labour share was linked to labour-displacing technological change, to a rise in domestic and foreign competition—including delocalisation and imports that replace national production—and to the reduction of public ownership through privatisations (OECD 2012, p. 111). An investigation on the dynamics of profits and wages in manufacturing industries, covering ten European countries in the period 1994–2001 (Pianta and Tancioni 2008), has shown that the real growth of wages per employee was less than half that of total profits. In high innovation sectors, profits increased by close to 8 per cent a year, three time as fast as wages. In low innovation industries profits growth was 3.5 per cent, again more than twice that of wages. While increases in labour productivity are the source of increased remuneration for both capital and labour, the conflict over distribution is a strong factor in explaining the relative gains of profits. Wages tend to grow faster in the sectors where innovation expenditure (largely due to wages for high skill researchers) is higher, while profits are driven both by the importance of new products and market power, and by restructuring through the diffusion of new processes and wage depressing job reductions. The lesson of such evidence is that technological change has the general effect of favouring profits over wages. Profits increase through separate mechanisms in industries relying on technological or cost competitiveness; conversely, wages grow only when innovation is associated with higher skills of labour; the result is greater inequality rooted in the functional distribution of income (ibid.). Disparities among wages Wage inequality has significantly increased. A preliminary clarification concerns the remuneration of top managers that is often classified as ‘wage’ but in fact is part of the distribution of a firm’s profits. Even once we eliminate the rapidly growing compensations of top managers, disparities among wages are relevant along many dimensions. Across educational levels and skills, wages tend to be higher and grow faster for workers with higher education, higher skills or using computers at work (for reviews see Chennells and Van Reenen 1999; Acemoglu 2002). Across industries we generally find that advanced services and high innovation manufacturing industries have higher wage levels and faster wage increases, even in the countries with a weaker technological dynamism. Conversely, low innovation industries tend to have a modest wage dynamics, with a wide spectrum of variation; these patterns clearly result in growing wage polarisation (Pianta 2004; Galbraith 2012). Innovative strategies also emerge as important factors. A study at the industry level, covering ten manufacturing and service sectors in seven European countries (Croci Angelini et al. 2009), has found that a higher wage polarisation is found in industries with strong product innovation, a fast employment dynamics and high shares of workers with university education; sectors with greater opportunities for expanding markets and jobs are likely to show increasing wage inequalities, as managers and high skill workers can obtain part of the rents from innovation. Conversely, wage compression is typical of industries characterised by the diffusion of new process technologies, high shares of workers with secondary education who can increase their competences and productivity by working on new machinery, obtaining higher relative wages (usually in a context of relatively high unionisation and labour market regulation), leading to reduced wage disparities. Again, the effects of technology on wages are often combined with those of foreign outsourcing resulting in a stronger downward pressure on wages of low skilled workers (Feenstra and Hanson 1996, 2003; Bogliacino et al. 2016). However, the relationship between innovation and wages may also run in the opposite direction; low wages, precarious work and high labour market flexibility can eliminate a major incentive for introducing innovation in firms, resulting in worse technological performances (Kleinknecht 1998; Cetrulo et al. 2017). Labour market institutions also play a major role in the rise of wage disparities. In the last three decades all major international organisations—such as the OECD and the IMF—have asked governments to introduce labour market ‘reforms’ going in the direction of more flexibility, lower employment protection and union power, based on the mainstream argument discussed in Stylised fact 10 that more flexible labour markets help reduce unemployment. Such policies have been introduced in a large number of countries, resulting in high wage disparities. A surprising reversal in policy advice has now emerged. The last OECD report on inequality (OECD 2015) emphasises the responsibility of weaker labour market institutions in the rise of wage inequality. The report acknowledges that ‘declining union coverage had a disequalising effect on the wage distribution’ and that ‘high union density and bargaining coverage, and the centralisation/co-ordination of wage bargaining tend to go hand in hand with lower overall wage inequality in both OECD countries and emerging economies’ (OECD 2015, p. 42; see also OECD 2011). A specific attention is devoted to the rise of non-standard jobs that ‘can also be associated with precariousness and poorer labour conditions’, lacking ‘employment protection, safeguards and fringe benefits enjoyed by colleagues on standard work contracts’; the consequences are that ‘a non-standard job typically pays less than traditional permanent work (…). These earning gaps are especially wide among low-skill, low-paid workers: non-standard workers in the bottom 40% of earners typically suffer wage penalties of 20% (…). Non-standard workers also face higher levels of insecurity in terms of the probability of job loss and unemployment and, in the case of temporary workers, report significantly higher job strain’ (ibid. p. 31). The OECD now advocates a minimum wage that ‘can help supporting low-wage workers and low-income families while avoiding significant job losses’ (ibid., p. 42). A similar argument has been made by the IMF in a study (Dabla-Norris et al. 2015) showing that a decline in organised labour institutions is associated with higher inequality measured by Gini coefficients, ‘likely reflecting the fact that labor market flexibility benefits the rich and reduces the bargaining power of lower-income workers’. Additional evidence shows that ‘more lax hiring and firing regulations, lower minimum wages relative to the median wage, and less prevalent collective bargaining and trade unions are associated to higher market inequality’ (Dabla-Norris et al. 2015, p. 26). The above evidence suggests the need for policies addressing the distribution of the productivity gains resulting from technological change. Over the past decades, innovation has mainly benefited capital in the form of higher profits, top earnings and financial rents in a context of increasing pressure on firms from investors demanding high financial returns. Conversely, technological change has often hit workers with job losses associated with labour-saving new processes, with new forms of low wage precarious work, with stagnant real wages. Technology is one of the engines of income inequality that has now reached record levels in many advanced and emerging countries. Such disparities are not only a problem of social justice, and they also undermine the possibility of growth and efficiency—as argued also by the OECD: ‘when income inequality rises, economic growth falls’ (OECD 2015, p. 60). New policies are therefore required for changing this state of affairs, for shaping technological change in the interest of society; for reducing its negative employment effects; for making sure that the gains from innovation and productivity go to labour in the forms of higher wages, lower working hours and improved working conditions.",14

Over the years, technological innovations have brought colossal benefits. They have increased labour productivity and raised standards of living across the globe. However, all major technological innovations, starting from the great industrial revolution, have also coincided with a fear of technological unemployment and a significant churning in labour markets. The current wave of information- and communication-based technological progress is no exception. The advancement of digital technology and consequent increase in automation has once again instilled the fear of mass unemployment. It has been argued that if digital innovations continue at the current pace, machines, in the near future, will be able to substitute labour in most economic activities, leading to a workless world (Rifkin 1995). However, these predictions have come from public activists and not from accredited researchers. Economists have tried to dispel these concerns. Citing the standard compensation theory,Footnote 1 researchers have argued that there are many compensation mechanisms which, in the long run, can counterbalance the initial negative impact of labour-saving technological changes (Vivarelli 2012). For example, technology may reduce the demand for labour in traditional industries; however, it simultaneously increases the demand for labour in new industries that emerge from technological innovations. Similarly, technological progress reduces the unit cost of production, and if demand for goods is price elastic, the overall demand goes up, leading to an increase in demand for labour (Smolny 1998). Yet another mechanism works through an increase in income. Since technological progress increases labour productivity, it can translate into an increase in income of labour and hence higher consumption. Finally, the compensation mechanism can work through a decrease in real wages. In a competitive market with perfect substitutability between labour and capital, technological unemployment implies reduction in wages which induces firms to use more labour. The compensation theory is not free from limitations as all compensation mechanisms mentioned above are based on one or another assumption that may or may not pass the test of reality. For example, job creation through a reduction in unit cost is possible only in perfectly competitive markets where the reduction in unit cost is passed on to consumers. In the case of oligopoly markets, this mechanism may not work at all as producers may decide to increase their profits rather than passing on the benefits to consumers. Job creation via an increase in income is possible only if the benefits of increase in productivity are shared with labour, which may or may not be the case in today’s globalized world where labour unions have become extremely weak. Similarly, the idea of job creation through reduction in wages not only collides with the Keynesian idea of effective demand, but also depends on the level of labour market flexibility (for detail see Vivarelli 2012). Nonetheless, despite all these limitations, the theory of compensation mechanism has withstood the test of time as world has not witnessed any increase in structural unemployment despite many waves of technological revolution in the past. The technology-induced-unemployment or end-of-work hypothesis may be farfetched. However, there is a consensus that technological change always affects labour by changing the job mix and skill demand. The adoption of new technology makes a few traditional skills and jobs redundant while creating the demand for a new set of skills, leading to a labour market disequilibrium which could result in higher wage disparities. It is now widely documented that the ICT revolution has also coincided with an increase in wage disparity across the globe. It has been observed that despite huge increases in the relative supply of college graduates, return to skill has kept increasing over the last 25 years or so. This phenomenon has induced some researchers to argue that the recent wave of technological change has been biased towards high-skilled and educated workers. The advocates of skill-biased technological change (SBTC) cite two facts to prove their point; first, the increase in demand for skilled workers has been driven by within rather than between industries. Second, there has been a very strong within-sector correlation between various indicators of technological change and increase in demand for skilled workers. The hypothesis of SBTC is not only conceptually attractive but it has also proved empirically quite successful (Autor and Dron 2013). However, of late, the SBTC framework has received a lot of criticism for equating education with skill and also for its inability to explain the mechanism by which technology affects the demand for different categories of labour or skill groups. Moreover, strong evidence of labour market polarization in many countries has also raised concerns about the validity of SBTC. Some researchers have recently tried to address these limitations by proposing a hypothesis of task-biased technological change (Goos et al. 2009, Autor and Dron 2013). Instead of dividing labour into skilled and unskilled categories, these models try to understand the skill requirement of different jobs through a task-based framework. These models categorize the tasks performed by labour into two broad groups, routine tasks and non-routine tasks, both of which are imperfect substitutes of each other. The routine tasks are those which can be codified and therefore can be easily performed by machines. By contrast, non-routine tasks require human interaction and hence cannot be mechanized easily. The non-routine tasks are further divided into two subgroups; non-routine abstract tasks and non-routine manual tasks. These models illustrate that recent improvements in ICT and a consequent decline in the price of ICT capital have reduced the labour input demand for routine tasks. By contrast, it has increased the labour input demand for non-routine tasks in general and non-routine abstract tasks in particular, which are complementary to computerization. Since non-routine-task-intensive occupations are concentrated at the top and bottom of the wage pyramid, it has led to polarization of the labour market. In short, these models suggest that recent spurts in technology have increased the demand for high-skilled workers at the cost of intermediate-skilled workers. The Indian manufacturing sector is not isolated from the current wave of technological change. Since the opening up of the Indian economy to foreign trade and technology in the mid-1980s, Indian manufacturers have invested substantially in technology upgradation. However, little effort has been made to study the impact of technology on demand for labour within the manufacturing sector. Against this backdrop, this paper examines the impact of technology on employment and skills demand in the Indian manufacturing sector. The analysis in this paper has been restricted to the organized manufacturing sector because of two reasons. One, the available data on unorganized manufacturing sector are not sufficient for this kind of study. Second, and more importantly, the use of advance technology is not expected to be very high among the unorganized manufacturing sector. Estimating the alternative specifications of the dynamic labour demand equation, the paper argues that technology has not reduced the aggregate demand for labour in Indian manufacturing once we allow the output to vary. However, our results suggest that the adoption of new technology has significantly changed the demand for skill in Indian manufacturing. The adoption of new technology has increased the demand for high-skilled workers at the cost of intermediate skills leading to a polarization of job opportunities within the manufacturing sector. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 provides an overview of technological upgradation in the Indian manufacturing sector. Section 3 summarizes the growth and changes in composition of manufacturing employment over the last three decades, while Sect. 4 describes the empirical methodology and data sources. The results are discussed in Sect. 5. Section 6 concludes with a recapitulation of the main findings and some policy implications.",9

Labor economists have traditionally considered technology to increase the productivity of and accelerate the demand for high-skilled workers. This idea is the basic foundation of the so-called skill-biased technical change (SBTC) hypothesis, that is, the expectation that the complementarity between technologies and human capital favors high-skilled workers to the detriment of low-skilled ones (Goldin and Katz 2009). Empirical evidence on the USA during the 1980s and more recently on Great Britain and Europe (Levy and Murnane 1992, Katz and Murphy 1992, Krueger 1992) confirms increased employment for technology-intensive high-skilled occupations and substantial displacement of low-skilled manufacturing occupations due to substitution by capital in the form of computers and automated machinery. Similar trends were also observed in college wage premia, with substantial increases in the wages of college-educated workers relative to that of high school graduates (Katz and Murphy 1992, Card and DiNardo 2002). While SBTC provides an important explanation for the increase in the relative supply of high-skilled labor coupled with rising wage inequality in the US labor market throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the tenet has come under closer scrutiny in recent years. On a conceptual level it has been pointed out that the mono-dimensional portrayal of skills underpinning SBTC neglects that workers perform a variety of workplace tasks and that different tasks require different types of skills. Therefore, changes in technology may affect differently the demand for certain types of tasks and the way in which skills are assigned to these tasks (Acemolgu and Autor 2012). A second weakness concerns the inability of the SBTC hypothesis to accommodate recent empirical evidence on the phenomenon on employment polarization, in particular, fast growth of high-skilled as well as low-skilled workers accompanied by a decline in the demand for middle-skilled occupations such as clerical and manufacturing jobs (Krusell et al. 2000; Autor et al. 2008; Goos et al. 2009). As this pattern is observed in coincidence with the diffusion of information and communications technology (ICT), the SBTC conjecture that an increase in capital intensity favors “monotonically” workers with higher levels of skills has been decisively refuted (Autor et al. 2003; Goldin and Katz 2009; Acemoglu and Autor 2012). From these critiques stems a burgeoning literature on the relation between technology and labor and on the determinants of employment polarization. Two explanations stand out. The first is that ICT is a substitute for human labor in “routine” tasks that are the core of middle-skilled occupations such as clerical jobs (Autor et al. 2003; Goos and Manning 2007). However, technological progress complements “non-routine” tasks that form the basis of high-skilled abstract occupations such as research and development, but is neutral toward non-routine menial jobs that have a high manual content such as personal services. Taken together, these processes yield a “non-monotonic” growth of employment by skill level at the upper and lower tail of the distribution with an increase in their relative demand, and the hollowing out of the middle part of the distribution. The second explanation refers to the effects of globalization and, in particular, to job outsourcing and trade competition from China and India which have been observed to be major sources of job losses in manufacturing (Autor et al. 2013; Lu and Ng 2013—for an alternative view on this, Bloom et al. 2013). Trade with less developed and developing countries gives access to cheap labor and provides greater scope for offshoring of procedural routine-intensive tasks that require minimum complexity, thereby reducing the relative demand and wages for such occupations on the domestic front. Furthermore, import competition on the global level affects quality improvement decisions of domestic producers and subsequently increases the relative demand for non-routine skills. The interpretative framework underpinning the empirical analysis of these forces focuses on the changes in the skill content of occupations. This approach, known as the “task-based model” (Autor et al. 2003; Spitz-Oener 2006), accommodates crucial findings of labor market changes due to the diffusion of technology and the imbalances brought about by international trade and forms the first building block of the current study. In spite of widespread consensus on the role of these global forces in shaping employment pattern in industrialized economies, the expectation is that they play out in very peculiar ways within specific contexts. There is no single top-down path to economic development, and the contribution of demographic, sectoral, regional and socioeconomic factors to productivity growth and competitiveness is contingent to the particular circumstances of the attendant local economy. Consequently, there is demand for country specific evidence that can elucidate the extent to which the changes triggered by technology and trade are amplified or hampered by regional characteristics, sectoral shifts in occupational composition and local institutions. The literature has so far concentrated on the case of the USA (Autor and Dorn 2013), and there is a lack of empirical evidence on other areas of the world economy. The present study takes the cue from this backdrop and proposes an empirical analysis of the structural changes in the employment structure of West Germany during the period 1979–2012. The main focus is on the dynamics of employment agency districts, that is, on harmonized territorial units identifiable on the basis of recruitment offices, and underlying educational settings such as apprenticeship system, changing consumer preferences and subsequent growth of low-skilled service occupations in explaining employment polarization. Accordingly, the project builds on and contributes to existing literature on job polarization by: (1) disentangling employment dynamics across employment agency districts in West Germany using task-based approach, rather than examining aggregate trends on a macro-level; (2) assessing the extent of traditional forces such as technology and trade, and whether the timing of their impacts is coincident with those of US-based studies; (3) exploring the validity of “reallocation effect” and growth of non-college service occupations in the context of Germany, as recently documented in the US labor markets; and, (4) investigating the effect of institutional factors such as apprenticeship training on such regional employment structure. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 provides the conceptual background and a review of existing literature. Section 3 presents the data sources, construction of relevant measures and the empirical strategy applied. Section 4 summarizes the main findings, and Sect. 5 concludes the paper with policy implications and steps for future research.",2

An extended definition would call it a means to fulfil a human purpose (in the singular), in the plural as an assemblage of practices and components, and in an overall sense as the entire collection of devices and engineering practices available to a culture (Arthur 2009, 28). Within a set of technologies or an assemblage of technologies in a period, there are some technologies that have pervasive effects—effects that are economy wide in nature or at least affect a large number of sectors. These were called general-purpose technologies (Freeman and Luca 2001, taking up from Bresnahan and Trajtenberg 1995). General-purpose technologies help identify an era such as that of steam (along with iron and steel) in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, that of electricity and oil in the twentieth century, and then the current information and communication technology (ICT) of the first decades of the twenty-first century (Freeman and Luca 2001; Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014; McAfee and Brynjolfsson 2017). ICT is identified as the current general-purpose technology, which in the form of digitization is affecting all areas of production and even many aspects of social and political life with the rise of digital interaction and social media. These general-purpose technologies could also be identified as the core technologies of an era. It was Schumpeter (and Marx before him) who identified technological change as the key feature of capitalism, characterizing it as creative destruction—the destruction of old forms of production and the creation of new ones (1944). Any technological change has this feature of creation and destruction, but when a general-purpose technology is developed, then the change takes the form of a gale-force of change which affects the entire economy. Some analysts (Freeman and Perez 1988) call this a change in the techno-economic paradigm, where a general-purpose technology makes possible a reordering of the overall organization of production. Brian Arthur refers to the continuous formation and re-formation of structures (2015: 2).
 For instance, the development of steam as energy source enabled the development of the factory system, with the centralized production of energy and centralized production of goods. This, simultaneously, destroyed the old household-based craft method for production of goods that could be mass produced. Electricity led to the development of the assembly line with its Ford–Taylor system of mass production. The development of ICTs has cheapened the transaction cost of supervision between firms and promoted the splintering of production between firms and even between geographies in a new form of organization of production in global value chains (GVCs), the latter in order to utilize labour arbitrage with different wage rates in different countries (Gereffi 2018; Baldwin 2016; Nathan et al. 2016). ICTs are now being developed and deployed across every economic sector and over all social, and even political fields. This is a change brought about by the application of the general-purpose digital technology that is spreading its effects all over the economic and society. The latest phase of this change with ICTs is sometimes identified as the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Schwab 2016). But in the perspective of changes in general-purpose technologies, the current change due to the development and even generalization of ICTs can be better as a phase of the deployment of ICTs, rather than as a change in general-purpose technology itself. The general-purpose technology, over time, spreads and affects the production of various, even all, sectors of the economy and society.",6

Naik,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"There has been widespread debate in the economic literature regarding the changing composition of trade in the aftermath Washington Consensus regime, which enforced the structural adjustment programme among developing economies. The policy mantra of the regime was rested on “stabilize, privatize, and liberalize”—give market free rein strategy (Rodrik 2006). Following structural adjustment programme, many developing countries that had followed “inward-looking” industrialisation strategy began to liberalise their economy by gradually opening up its industries to the global market. One of the major setbacks that followed trade reforms were on its pre-mature export-oriented industries. The changing global production structure (from Fordism to post-Fordism), governed by the industrialised countries, made them fall prey to the global production network. It has been noticed that majority of developing countries found to have shifted their export basket towards capital- and skill-intensive products (Lall 2004; Veermani 2012). However, the premise of such claim that manufacturing sector has become more capital and skill intensive in its exports could well be an oversimplification of the observed phenomena. In the post-Fordist mode of production regime, where production processes are highly complex and scattered across the globe, the factor intensity of export could potentially vary among participating countries, depending on nature of production (Lall 2004). In this grand design of structural adjustment programme, India was no exception. It is evident that following new economic policy of 1990s, Indian economy has undergone, among other things, a massive configuration in its merchandise trade basket. The composition of India's merchandise export trade shows that the share of natural resource and unskilled labour-intensive products has seen a consistent decline in its share since the policy change, whereas the share of capital- and skill-intensive products reported to have increased markedly over the years (Veeramani 2012; Felipe, Kumar, and Abdon 2013). This change, however, is understood as the country’s failure to specialise in its comparative advantage that lies in semi-skilled labour intensive activities (Veeramani 2012, p. 98). One of the main arguments behind this discontent is that this change has not only obstructed in generating employment in the formal sector, but also reported to have abetted informalisation in the economy (Goldar and Aggarwal 2012).  It has been argued that the stiff competition from across the globe has pushed the country to embrace ""race to the bottom"" approach to stay competitive in the global production network. This changing approach to trade has given rise to informalisation of the organised manufacturing sector (Chatterjee 2008). The increasing displacement of formal employment in manufacturing sector due to unabated global competition, among other reasons, has resulted in growing informalisation—casualiasation and contractualisation of labour force—of the sector (Papola and Sahu 2012). Against this backdrop, this paper aims to look at the different aspects of India’s manufacturing sector under liberalisation regime. The study intends to examine the compositional change in the country's manufacturing trade based on basic economic categories (BEC) and factor intensity. Moreover, the study would focus on understanding the linkages between nature of manufacturing trade and growing informalisation of manufacturing sector. This paper is broadly divided into four sections, excluding the previous one. Section 2 critically discusses the theoretical debate on trade, employment and informalisation, specifically under new global production structure. This section provides for an analytical framework to comprehend the current changes in production structure and corresponding employment situtation in the country under liberalisation era. Section 3 provides a brief account of literature on trade liberalisation and its impact on manufacturing sector. Section 4 provides a brief account of the country's manufacturing trade and its compositional changes over the period. Section 5 elucidates concepts and methodology used in the paper for the empirical analysis. Section 6 discusses empirical findings on various components of export oriented manufacturing industries and  its employment relation. The last section provides concluding observations while attempting to place the country within the global production structure.",1

Such initiatives highlight the creation of specialized employment opportunities. It should be noted that the cost reduction permits the firm to undertake additional functions (better employment opportunities or informal human capital) that are firm specific and permits the firm to be seen as a collection of distinct but complementary processes (also see, Stigler 1951). The firm, according to Stigler, is stranger to the existing environment and has to undertake such functions in an informal way. The functions, targeting larger volume of production, would involve (1) arrangement of informal finance, (2) informal creation of exact specification of machinery for industrial differentiation, (3) purchase and storing of materials, and (4) undertaking modern transport, marketing, creation of communication channels, extension of credit to buyers, etc. Young’s focus was on the possibility that profitable division of labour would induce external economies in the sense that other firms (in general) would imitate, and such imitations would induce further external economies that would translate into the opportunities of further division of labour (i.e. sophisticated industrial differentiation). The implication is that higher production (with higher returns) would be associated with such increases elsewhere (with further feedback effects that magnifies such increases), and this outcome of technological progress cannot be consistent with a well-behaved production function-based conception of resource-constrained full employment outcome. Padhi (2014a, b; Padhi 2015a) argued that the new employment underlying division of labour facilitates specialization in intermediate goods production with the use of machinery, permitting intermediate costs reduction. The specialized employment opportunities also permit the specialization in trading and marketing, to access higher market access. They are complementary in the sense that if higher market access through such specialized trading takes place with a given price of the product, and if the higher market-enables division of labour permits intermediate costs reduction, as real output is increased, the outcome permits higher money value added per unit of real (double deflation) output (see, Padhi 2015a). This higher money value added can permit both higher wages to the specializations labour force both in production and in trading/marketing, etc., (that would command higher money wages) and higher returns to the firm—the incentive to initiate the division of labour. Putting it differently, if price of the product (with a given mark up) remains same, the higher labour productivity can permit both higher wages and profits. These advantages with respect to specialized labour force that promotes the external economies; they change the competitive environment; other firms would generally imitate, guided by the prospect of higher market access that permits higher returns. In fact, the firms who do not do so may lose out (in terms of their market shares). However, specialized employment opportunities, as better supply-side factors, can do that much. If division of labour-led larger market share (and higher returns) is based on the demand diversion from others, money expenditure remaining the same, it will not induce similar practices elsewhere (that also needs higher market share). Therefore, following Kaldor (1972)’s suggestion, the division of labour (and the specialized employment opportunities) has to be seen as finance-led investment, which (in the Keynesian fashion) leads to an increase in aggregate money expenditure. If so, different firms adopting division of labour would provide larger market for each other, leading to profitable opportunities for the generalized adoption of division of labour in the economy. The external economies, supported by this larger market size, confer the advanced status—Young (1928, p. 326) visualization of constant coming up of new products, new tasks, new process, products, etc. The important issue is: What explains the Youngian external economies-led transition from initial division of labour within the firm to an advanced form that typifies division of labour between firms—more roundabout methods of production when specialized firms start producing specialized tasks. For Young, this working out of external economies—the generalized adoption of division of labour and the coming up of sophisticated further division of labour, etc.—is guided by profit motive and therefore should be viewed as natural phenomena in an economy—if the market size is increasing (that permits the profits). Kaldor (1966) provides a specific mechanism that guides the external economies. He interprets Young in maintaining that the realization of division of labour-led dynamic scale economies permit learning by doing that in turn promotes the scope of further division of labour (and industrial differentiation) in a cumulative way. The focus is on increases in capital labour ratio that permits the dynamic learning’s outcome—Kaldor’s technological progress function with respect to (cumulative) accumulation of capital—a variant of Arrow’s learning by doing. The present paper’s perspective on the other hand holds that it is the specialized employment opportunities that are the sources of dynamic learning by doing. Padhi (2014a) suggests that the Youngian endogenous growth process embodies a sophisticated learning by doing process that is different from that of its conceptualization by Arrow’s. In the latter, for example, learning by doing is basically a process of getting acquainted with the machines, or the setup costs (see, Scherer and Ross 1990, pp. 147–148), permitting higher labour productivity as output (or investment) is increased. However, this process does not alter the nature of machines, nor it facilitates further endogenous improvements; the improvements are exogenous, as in the orthodox theories, enabled by exogenous formal science (see, also, Scott 1989). Youngian learning by doing is different; it is learning by doing to innovate, or improve the nature of machines, which has cumulative characteristics. To elaborate, following Padhi (2014a; 2018; unpublished, for further implications), the division of labour signifies specialized employment opportunities (in different tasks) that have the ingredients of ‘formal human capital’ in latent forms. For instance, the specializations, initially, taking place in an informal way (see, Stigler 1951), and encounter technical and economic problems. However, since the specializations permit higher market access (and returns to the firm), the difficulties would induce the firm/engineer to undertake a careful investigation of the principle underlying the specialization—to master them. Therefore, such inventions—division of labour—induce ‘academic research’ and learning by doing—the ‘scientific interest’ to understand the processes that in turn results not only in perfecting the specializations, but also in the improvement of the machines involved. Not only that. The generalized adoption of division of labour, i.e. increasing returns in production possibility, could result in different firms focusing on different sets of specializations—there is no sameness in the adoption. This facilitates another type of learning by doing. This can be called, following Araujo and Kerndrup (2001) (quoting Hakansson 1993), the across firm boundary interactive learning. In addition, the coming up of many specializations, the ‘regional’ existence of specialized labour force and the effective formal science, permits what can be called the Marshallian industrial district-based general progress-related learning by doing. It should be stressed that in the process any well-developed market does not exist for the learning by doing-based coming up of new specializations. Then, this market failure induces the firm (embodying the adaptive engineer) to undertake informal research on its own or outsource it by inducing others to undertake such research, i.e. the coming up of formal science, to improve. Therefore, the learning-based external economies created by division of labour are much broader in scope. They not only refer to the generalized adoption of division of labour but also indicate the coming up of the scientific interests/formal science. This is important; for example, commenting on the effectiveness of R & D efforts, Scherer (1967) notes that it is a continuous effort in which each sequential step provides knowledge useful in the next step (Scherer 1967); higher the accumulated useful knowledge, the lower would be the costs of the creation of new scientific ideas. In addition, the development process, with many specializations in many fields, and the ensuing scientific investigations (and discoveries) in many fields, seen as ‘an interrelated whole’, also benefit further effective growth of science (see, Scott 1989, pp. 140–141). It is but true that such interactive learning has to be based on employment opportunities created by diverse division of labour. The role of formal science, embedded in R&D activities, is also important. Here, however, the present paper does not give primacy to the contribution of autonomous academic research (i.e. the role of formal science emphasized in the neo-classical school of thought), but argues, following the logic of Schmookler (1966), Scott (1989, pp. 131–135) and others (see, Padhi 2015b), that a development process—like the Youngian one—forms the basis of effective academic research (see Padhi 2015b). This understanding indicates a symbiotic relationship between useful knowledge (and problems gathered from specializations) and its investigation by science. On the one side, the more the sophistication of industrial differentiation, the more sophisticated is the learning by doing, supporting the growth of science. On the other side, even if the development of formal science is induced by specific problems, the investigation leads to the generation of new ideas that can have multiple uses, and can create new tasks. This possibility of further industrial differentiation forms the basis for further growth of science. Coming back to the main focus, the existence of domestic advanced development process that creates specialized employment opportunities and embodies diverse set of learning adds dynamism to the economy in many related sectors. As Stigler (1951), it is this domestic capabilities in narrow specialization and the specialists concerned that confer the developed status; undeveloped countries can copy or import the outcomes—say, capital goods, formal science, etc.—but if the domestic process and specialists are lacking, they would always lag behind.",2

An increased emphasis on the growth of manufacturing was driven by the fact that it can contribute to capital accumulation, technical change and bears strong bidirectional linkages with agriculture for labour absorption and higher growth. Agriculture, being home to a large segment of poor and unskilled workers having low levels of productivity, has limited capacity to sustain the labour force. Therefore, the performance of manufacturing sector should accelerate to absorb people working in agriculture and also in the urban informal sector. This approach has its roots in the dual-sector model propounded by Lewis (1954). It explicated the growth of a developing economy in terms of labour transition between the two sectors: the ‘capitalist’ and the ‘subsistence’, and envisaged a continuous expansion of the former through shifting of surplus labour from the latter. However, such industrialisation has remained a challenge in most of the developing countries. Even in cases where a successful industrialisation has occurred, it has not fully translated into productive jobs. India also adopted this path of development immediately after independence. It initiated far-reaching reforms in the industrial sector. Since then, the organised (registered) industryFootnote 1 has grown at a rapid pace, but the rate of growth in employment has failed to meet the expectations. While the share of agriculture income in total national income has been decreasing consistently to reach 15% by the 2000s, the employment share has remained high at nearly 55%. Initiation of economic reforms at the beginning of the 1990s was a turning point in India’s economic development. The reforms brought in their wake significant reduction in industrial tariffs and NTBs, flow of foreign capital and gradual dismantling of licensing in the manufactured intermediate and capital goods. Domestic market reforms supplemented with a greater openness to external trade were expected to induce higher growth and productivity through technology transfer and competition, which could increase the pace of job creation. Since India’s comparative advantage has historically been in unskilled labour-intensive industries, it seemed likely that economic reforms would allow such industries to yield higher benefits and thereby create employment. Unfortunately, this has not been the case so far, as India’s organised manufacturing has experienced a considerable slowdown with respect to employment, amidst a consistently high rate of growth in output (Singh et al. 2017). Even labour-intensive industries such as food processing, textile and clothing have been experiencing a deceleration in employment growth for quite some time. And if at all labour is employed, it is not deemed gainful due to an increasing informalisation.Footnote 2
 This subject of informalisation in the labour market has occupied a centre stage within the academia and policy circles. Among many, Goldar (2014), and Sen and Das (2015) have explained a slow pace of employment growth in organised manufacturing by growing capital intensity, which has undoubtedly led to higher labour productivity but lower demand for labour. Within the labour-intensive industries, a low demand for workers is also explained by falling rental rate of capital owing to trade reforms. Yet another explanation given is the stringent labour regulations, and hence significant inflexibilities in the labour market. The focus has largely been on the Industrial Disputes Act (IDA), 1947, which forms the basis for regulation of job security in the organised manufacturing segment due to strict dismissal norms being laid down under it. As per Chapter V-B of the Act, any firm employing 100 or more regular workers has to seek permission from the Labour Department, with jurisdiction over the firm, before any layoffs or retrenchment. The concerned labour department rarely gives such permission, even in cases where the unit is unprofitable and on the verge of closure. Goldar (2014) reiterated that such labour market rigidities have not only impinged upon job-creating potential of organised manufacturing, but have also held back the favourable effects of globalisation. Given the fact that labour regulations cannot be enforced in the unorganised sector (also called informal), employers may find advantageous to shift to it and exercise greater flexibility in terms of hiring and firing of labourer or employ them on contractual basis. Workers are left with no choice other than to remain in the unorganised manufacturing or work on contractual basis and hence remain devoid of regular hike in salary and other employment benefits. Such labour market rigidities are increasingly seen to affect the performance of the organised manufacturing. Literature has examined this aspect under two distinct and contrasting perspectives, viz. Distortionist and Institutionalist. The former believes that regulations disrupt free market functioning and act as impediments to labour market changes in response to economic shocks and hence advocate greater labour market flexibility.Footnote 3 In contrast, the proponents of the Institutionalist view argue that labour institutions facilitate redistribution between employers and workers and hence advocate the presence of institutions for a wide range of positive effects on economic outcomes. The outcomes essentially hinge on an empirical analysis. Among many, Cesar and Alberto (2003) and Botero et al. (2003) concluded on the basis of a panel of data for more than 70 developing countries that the industrial growth is distorted by stricter labour regulations, which may result in higher unemployment. In the Indian context, Besley and Burgess (2004) classified each state as being pro-worker, neutral or pro-employer and assigned scores of + 1, 0 and − 1, respectively, based on the amendments done in the IDA 1947. The assigned scores were cumulated over time to arrive at a ‘regulatory measure’ in each state every year. The authors concluded that the economic performance of the organised manufacturing varies across the states, but significantly improves in those having greater labour market flexibility. The study has provided useful insights into rigidities in labour laws across states despite criticism on account of the methodology to classify states as pro-worker or pro-employer based on amendments made to Chapter V-B of the Industrial Disputes Act.Footnote 4 In a similar vein, Basu (2005) argued that the labour laws in India, which are designed to protect the interests of workers, may in fact hurt them, particularly the ones that have strict firing provisions. Using a theoretical model, he showed that in case a firm requires specialised skills and talents, the laws are such that it is either not allowed to do so, or the laws make it too costly to do so. The firm is left with no choice but to operate either on a small scale or close down. In the latter case, both skilled and unskilled workers lose their jobs, and perhaps join the unskilled market, which further increases competition in the informal labour market. In contrast to these, literature following the Institutionalist approach maintains that regulations are not necessarily an impediment to economic development. To quote, Freeman (1993), Campbell and Sengenberger (1994) and Streeck (2004) pointed out that the basic labour standards pertaining to pay and working conditions, encapsulated in labour laws, may in fact encourage firms and workers to co-invest in firm-specific skills and complementary productive assets, which in turn enhance aggregate efficiency and welfare of the enterprise. Baker et al. (2004) found no strong evidence which could suggest that the regulating institutions are the major impediments to employment growth across the OECD member countries. In the Indian case, Deakin and Sarkar (2011) analysed a leximetric dataset on labour laws from 1970 to 2006 to estimate their impact on unemployment and industrial output in the organised sector. The study did not find evidence of pro-worker legislations leading to unemployment or industrial stagnation. Goldar and Ghosh (2015) studied employment growth in 10,000 manufacturing plants between 2002 and 2007 and found an increase in the share of contract workers in total workers to have raised employment growth. The findings are somewhat mixed and inconclusive. Moreover, there is hardly any study that has looked into the industry-specific effects of labour market inflexibilities, particularly at the state level. Bardhan (2014) suspects that the binding constraints behind expansion of an industry across states may have to do more with inadequate credit and marketing opportunity, erratic power supply, inadequate infrastructure and logistics, bureaucratic regulations, etc., rather than the labour laws. Several states have done away with stringent regulations, yet employment and productivity growth have been tardy. In the context of processed food industry, Mitra et al. (2002) and Bathla (2014) highlighted a greater contribution of finance, agglomeration economies and infrastructure compared to investment climate (captured through number of strikes and lockouts) to productivity growth. We have taken the case of textile and clothing (apparel) industry (National Industrial Classification (2008) codes—13 and 14) to understand the dynamics behind employment growth in it in the context of domestic labour regulations, particularly of the IDA, 1947. The textile and apparel (T&C) industry is the second largest employer after agriculture, providing direct employment to nearly 51 million people and 68 million people indirectly in the organised and unorganised segments (DIPP 2017). It contributes 14% to total industrial production, which is close to 4% of national income. The industry also significantly contributes to country’s export basket. The annual rate of growth in employment in the organised sector has been modest at 4.21% since 2000–2001, with signs of stagnation from 2007 onwards. Nevertheless, an increase in employment is accompanied by a growing share of contractual workers from 8.48% during 2000–2001 to 15% during 2013–2014. The industry has also been facing a slowdown for quite some time which is evident from a negative rate of growth in GVA and labour productivity in several states (“Appendix Table 4”). Goldar (2017) has found a decrease in total factor productivity growth in textiles from 1.45 to 0.64 and an increase in it in wearing apparel and dressing segment from − 0.42 to 2.92 during 1981–2002 to 2003–2014. This may possibly explain closure of a large number of mills and displacement of workers. Moreover, this period coincides with the phasing out of Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) that governed world trade in textiles and garments. The WTO members agreed to phase out MFA quotas on exports of textiles and clothing from the developed countries to the developing ones, progressively, but not later than 1 January 2005 at the Uruguay Round of trade talks held in 1995. Rising imports to India may constrain the employment-creating potential. In recent years, most of the state governments have brought amendments in the existing labour regulations. To provide stimulus to T&C industry, the government under the National Textile Policy 2016 has offered Rs. 60 billion special package to create 10 million new jobs in the next three years, attract investments of $11 billion and generate an additional $30 billion in exports. The policy has mentioned in passing to bring reforms in the archaic labour laws that affect the industry. The National Textile Policy 2017 which has been placed on the table aims to achieve $300 billion exports by 2024–2025 and create around 35 million employment opportunities. Undoubtedly, the ‘textile package’ has set the ball rolling for a much needed reform agenda, but its impact is yet to be seen. 
In what follows, Sect. 2 provides an overview of key labour regulations and amendments undertaken by the Centre and the states and briefly discusses India’s domestic policies in T&C industry. This is followed by state-wise trends in the number of workers, contractual workers and gross value added from 2000/01 to 2013/14 and an empirical analysis of the impact of regulations on labour demand in Sect. 3. The last section concludes and draws implications. The analysis is based on 19 major states. Data on key indicators in T&C are extracted from the Annual Survey of Industries, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, CSO at NIC 2 digit level for the period 2000–2001 to 2013–2014. The data given in nominal prices are converted into real prices at 2004–2005 base using Wholesale Price Indices (WPI) obtained from the DIPP, Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The information on labour regulations and amendments is extracted from secondary literature.",2

Estimates of the returns to education in wage employment in India by gender and location (rural–urban) are provided in this study. The most recent data collected by the NSSO on rural and urban work participation for women reveal a decline. In the economics of education literature, an important explanation of the gender gap in education is that the labour market rewards women’s education less well than men’s, especially in developing countries (Kingdon 1998). Our paper examines this argument to explain the declining work participation of women in the year 2011–2012. Our aim is to study female work participation through the interlinkages between education and employment. A look at the literacy levels (definition of literacy in the Indian census: ‘the total percentage of the population of an area at a particular time aged seven years or above who can read and write with understanding’) in India over last three decades shows us that rural literacy rate is much lower than the urban one (Fig. 1). Apart from this gender disparity, the urban female literacy rate is almost higher by 20% than the rural one. Source: CensusInfo India 2011 Literacy levels in India according to census (1991, 2001 and 2011). India’s GDP has rapidly increased over the past two decades (Klasen and Pieters 2012). At the same time, the declining participation of women in work is also a well-known fact in India. Two unusual things were witnessed in the data from rounds of the NSSO–EUS since 1999–2000 (55th round). First, in 2004–2005 (61st round), the work participation of rural and urban women increased by 2–3% points over 1999–2000, which was contrary to the declining trend since 1983 (38th round). Second, there was a massive decrease (12% points) in work participation of rural women between the 2004–05 and 2009–10 surveys. Such a decline was unprecedented in history (Siddiqui et al. 2017). These stylised facts raise questions about the impact of education in the labour market participation of men and women and about the different returns to education by gender which may be the reason behind such a decline in female work participation. In this paper, we investigate if lower labour market returns to education in India are responsible for low female work participation in the year 2011–2012. To the best of our knowledge, a study using the most recent NSS EUS data has not been done till now. An earlier work by Kingdon and Unni (2001) uses NSS data for the 43rd Round, i.e. years 1987–1988. They have studied the urban districts of two states, viz, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu; our study uses the central sample for nationally representative data, covering the entire India. Our results suggest that the lower returns to education discourage women from participating, whereas literature states that an increase in educational enrolment has caused the decline (Rangarajan et al. 2011; Kannan and Raveendran 2012; Hirway 2012; Neff et al. 2012; Mehrotra et al. 2012). As women become better educated, their participation in the labour force is likely to increase but many constraints keep them out of paid employment, lower returns in terms of earnings being one of them. The decline in women’s economic activity is a cause for concern as women are valuable resources and as it implies a decline in their well-being. According to Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5, access to quality education and employment is a critical factor in women’s progression towards economic independence and is also considered as an indicator of their overall status in society (Mammen and Paxson 2008). The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 mentions the motivation of this study, Sect. 3 provides a succinct review of literature, Sect. 4 presents the method, Sect. 5 outlines the data, Sect. 6 discusses the results and some concluding remarks follow in Sect. 7.",14

The Plantation Labour Act, 1951 defines plantation as a piece of land, twenty-five acres or more which is used for growing tea, coffee, rubber, cinchona or cardamom where fifteen or more persons were employed on any day of the preceding year. Plantations are located in the backward and rural regions the country thus providing livelihood and employment to the rural population of regional economies (Joseph and George 2010). Most of the plantation workers are unskilled, and the plantation industry directly employs more than 2 million workers in the country of which women form 50% of the total workforce (Labour Bureau 2010). Plantation is a part of the agricultural sector but has many features in common with the industry. The plantation industry differs from other industries due to its socio-economic formation characterised by heavy dependence on manual labour and low levels of technology. The tea industry is one of the oldest organised industries in India having a long history of more than 160 years. Employment in the tea plantations is family based which facilitates two purposes: first, cheap labour increases the profits of the entrepreneurs and second, it ensures the reproduction of labour through provisions like subsidised ration, health services, accommodation, schooling. The workers and their families are accommodated within the gardens. Plantation sector is the largest organised employer of women workers and is most likely responsible for increasing the national average sex ratio in organised employment (Joshi 1976). Planters have special need for women workers for both productive and reproductive work, especially due to the notion of feminine skill associated with plucking work. The productive work in which women are engaged is usually monotonous and physically taxing. In 2010, women workers formed the bulk of labour force recorded at 55.86% of the total employment in various plantations. Women workers have outnumbered men workers in the coffee plantations and tea plantations. However, women’s employment in the tea plantations of West Bengal has decreased from 103894 in 1995 to 73043 in 2010 (Labour Bureau 2014). Against this backdrop, the paper shall address these four questions: Does higher employment of women lead to higher productivity? Does the participation of women in the workforce lead to their economic emancipation? How is work experience related to work status and wages? This paper has been organised as follows. Section 2 gives a brief review of the literature on employment of women in export-oriented labour-intensive industry. Section 3 provides details of the survey study area, methods and data collection. The findings of the survey are discussed in Sect. 4 followed by summary and conclusion in Sect. 5.",3

Mishra,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Domestic work in India is not recognised as labour in the full sense of the term as it lacks cover under the labour laws in the same way as other forms of wage labour, despite a thriving market for domestic service in India.Footnote 1 The share of domestic service in total service sector employment of women increased from 12% in 1999–2000 to 27% in 2004–2005 (Neetha 2008). The number of women employed in the broad category of domestic work shows more than fourfold increase over the 10-year period from 1999–2000 to 2009–2010 (Neetha 2013).Footnote 2 An upsurge has been identified in ‘part-time’ work especially in urban middle class households. The number of domestic workers in urban areas increased by 68% during the decade between 1999 and 2009 in India, according to a news report, there are 2.52 million domestic workers as per NSSO (2009–2010), seven million as per NGO sources and 4.2 million as per ILO (DNA 2013). It is also important to note that two-thirds of this domestic workforce lives in urban areas. The uncertainties that mark estimates of domestic work have been highlighted. ‘No society can survive without the massive contribution that domestic work makes to the national income. Yet it remains largely invisible and undervalued, a reflection of the low value India places on social reproduction’ (Ghosh 2014). In India, paid domestic work was a cultural practice and part of the reproduction of class difference within a society marked by inequality. However, employing domestics is no longer a symbol of wealth and aristocracy and neither associated with middle class women’s labour force participation. But there can be few instances where domestic workers depict status of employers. Economic growth, modernisation and change in lifestyle have contributed to an increase in the demand for domestic workers, particularly for ‘part-time’ workers. Ageing and lack of state provisioning of care too have contributed to their growing demand (Neetha 2004, 2009; Ray and Qayum 2009; Vasanthi 2011). Migration and domestic work in cities is closely related, owing to the ease with which migrants can enter this occupation, and gendered nature of this occupation. Migration has considerably increased supply of domestic workers in cities like Delhi and Kolkata. Movement of female domestics to cities represents a classic case of migration and employment facilitated through social networks. New city-based employment opportunities have been identified as pull factors leading to migration to the cities. These combined with push factors from rural areas characterised by agricultural unrest, etc. have induced the rise in demand for domestic work in urban space. The success stories of kinsmen also attract migration (Karlekar 1995; Raghuram 1999; Neetha 2004, 2009; Wadhawan 2013).
 This paper is an attempt towards analysing the demand for domestic workers specifically in urban India, wherein we intend to verify a range of hypotheses pertaining to demand for domestic workers in urban households. The analysis exploits the information obtained in Unemployment and Employment Survey (National Sample Survey Organisation, NSSO), hereafter to assess the significance of domestic work across Indian states. The characteristic aspect of the demand for domestic work in urban India is elaborated based on the reporting made in household consumption expenditure surveys provided by the NSSO. We supplement the discussion with insights from a micro-level enquiry. Based on the narratives of the employers, we offer an understanding on the demand for domestic workers in the National Capital Region.",3

Muraleedharan,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The role of social capital in job market search can be traced back to as early as 1960s. Heterogeneity of workers and jobs complicates the acquisition and evaluation of information that both buyers and sellers must have before an exchange takes place (Stigler 1962; Granovetter 2005). Individuals use connections with others, such as social and professional acquaintances to maintain information networks (Stigler 1962). There are differences among workers in their use of the variety of available informational outlets (Rees 1966). Similarly, employers use different channels to fill positions. In this context, formal sources of information include state and private employment agencies, news advertisements, school and college placement services and, more recently, the Internet (Kuhn and Mikal 2000). Informal sources include employee referrals that make use of the social connections of the employees. Hiring through employee referrals reduces the information problem since existing employees have already undergone a prior screening process indicating a certain level of productivity. When such employees refer their other friends or relatives, they are careful enough not to tarnish their reputation and hence ensure that they recommend candidates with good credentials (Ioannides and Loury 2004). Secondly, prior knowledge about the prospective candidate through an existing employee helps to reduce chances of imperfect matches. Social networks can be considered as a powerful means to foster the diffusion of information and knowledge, reducing transaction costs and lowering the uncertainty of employment (Hoye et al. 2009). This paper, however, focuses on the supply side of the labour market, i.e. the job seekers’ side of the labour market. Hence, a detailed literature review is undertaken to situate the role of social networks in job finding particularly, the differences in types and features of networks that may be associated with job finding.",

Mahapatro,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Does labour migration entail social cost or benefit for left-behind women in Bihar? This research question is examined in this paper by assessing the impact of male labour migration on empowerment of left-behind women, measured in terms of intra-household decision-making and participation in employment. Migration of labour from rural areas is a pervasive feature of economic growth in many developing countries, including India, and has increased rapidly over the years. Census estimates show that the migration rate increased from 29 % in 2001 to 37 % in 2011. Driven by forces of globalisation, the widening gap between the agricultural and non-agricultural sector, changes in the structure of the labour market and the economic transformation that has taken place in the country have affected the livelihoods of the rural poor, leading to labour migration to developed regions (de Haan 1997; Kundu 1997; Srivastava and Bhattacharyya 2002; Mitra and Murayama 2008; Mahapatro 2013). At the destination, these migrants are engaged in short-term casual work, and their marginalised status makes it impossible for family members to accompany them. This migration process thus results in split families, leaving some family members at the origin (Ye et al. 2016); the left-behind family mainly relies on remittances for their subsistence. While the transformative impact of migrant remittances on household economic welfare is well established, the social impact of migration, especially on gender relations, has not been adequately explored in the Indian context. Understanding the impact of migration on gender relations is significant, as the absence of males may reinforce gender inequality by strengthening patriarchal norms and also increase the double burden of work (Razavi 2012), or may empower women by expanding their role in decision-making. While considering the migration decision in a household economy context, migration models emphasise that the household welfare brought about through remittances is shared equally, as the preferences and interest are the same among family members. However, migration models are criticised on the grounds that the causes and impact of migration are unlikely to operate in a gender-neutral way (Haas and Rooij 2010; Mahapatro 2015). Due to the conflicting interests among household members owing to their different social positions, viz. intra-household power inequalities, migration also has different influences on various household members. The social position of women, as determined by their bargaining power, is generally low (Agarwal 1997) in families governed by traditional patriarchal norms. The migration of males may alter the social context in which women live and bring about changes in gender roles (Davis 1984), by either strengthening or bringing flexibility into patriarchal norms. Empirical evidence on the impact of migration on gender relations demonstrates that the migration of males results in transfer of power and responsibilities to women within the family, accompanied by an increase in women’s autonomy (Hadi 2001; Parrenas 2005; Yabiku et al. 2010). This unidirectional association, however, may not hold equally in all social contexts; rather, prevailing social institutions that operate in the family and community may further reinforce gender inequality. Becker (1974) suggested that relocation of a family member creates a conflict of interest within the family due to the changing family roles and negatively affects familial relationships. In contrast, studies have also shown that traditional gender ideologies are strengthened and the absence of the husband may subjugate women more than ever before, because women have to depend on and be cared for by other male relatives in the absence of their husband (Hoodfar 1996). The emergence of patriarchal extended families thus limits the bargaining power of women with a limited role in decision-making in the household. Along with this, the often lower and irregular remittance flow pushes women to take up waged employment to provide economic support to the family, increasing their double burden of work. Thus, it can be argued that labour migration of males may have a negative consequence for left-behind women by reinforcing gender inequality and increasing economic vulnerability. By emphasising the role of remittances, the growing literature on migration (De and Ratha 2012; Dey 2014; Mohanty et al. 2014, 2016; Mahapatro et al. 2017) and household well-being disregards the relevance of the social effect of migration on left-behind families. Although migration seems to raise the economic condition of the family, left-behind members, specifically women, face many additional challenges and difficulties in social adjustment in the absence of their husband. Only a limited number of studies have examined the impact of male migration on left-behind women, revealing mixed evidence. Studies have shown that migration of males alters intra-household power relations, with women having more independent decision-making power than ever before migration (Gulati 1987; Sekher 1997). In contrast, many studies have also shown that, in spite of their long absence, the power base of males remains in the family and women take only minor decisions (Shaheed 1981; Jetley 1987), and that their position in the family depends on the household structure, indicating that patriarchal relations still pervade in the absence of males (Desai and Banerji 2008). A village study by Datta and Mishra (2011) in Bihar examined the impact of migration on women’s participation in employment and found a positive impact of migration on the lives of women. However, the findings of the various above-mentioned studies remain inconclusive, and they also suffer from methodological limitations, thus their relevance to the present changing socioeconomic context should be re-examined. Firstly, when examining the social impact of migration, studies have focussed on migrant families, neglecting the significance of non-migrant families as a control group. Inclusion of non-migrant families is essential not only to form a control group to assess the impact of migration, but also the gender role in non-migrant households is likely to be affected by the socioeconomic changes brought about through migration (Haas and Rooij 2010). Secondly, studies in the Indian context have mainly analysed the impact of international migration but have ignored how internal migration influences women’s life at origin. Instead, studies on internal migration have focussed largely on migrants and their living and working conditions at the destination. Thirdly, whatever evidence is available on this aspect has emerged from village-level studies based on small sample sizes, hindering generalisation. Taking these limitations into account and using large-scale survey data, the present study analysed the impact of labour migration on the life of women in Bihar (the dominant labor out-migrating state with low status of women in the household and community). This study is motivated by two research questions related to the position of women in a patriarchal setting: Does migration of males empower left-behind women by enhancing their intra-household decision-making power? What explains women’s work participation in migrant families?",4

From 2008, when the subprime mortgage crisis hit the US economy, and the Lehman collapse occurred, one economic crisis after another, often seemingly disparate, has cropped up in different parts of the world. By 2011, the European economies were in the throes of a sovereign debt crisis, which caused slowdowns and stagnation in several Eurozone economies. A little later, the end of the commodity price cycle caused emerging economies around the world to slow down, and this along with other long-run triggers, such as the slow drift of climate change, resulted in mass migrations. These economic troubles inevitably spilled over to politics and society, causing the Middle East to erupt, creating an unhealthy polarization in US politics and generating enormous tensions within the European Union, as evidenced by Brexit and now, even as I write this, with France erupting in a way not seen at least since 1968. A concurrent problem feeding into this, is economic inequality, which is at an unconscionable level. Unlike in olden times, the worst excesses of inequality cannot be kept hidden from prying eyes. With the rise in digital technology and the greater availability of data, these great injustices are becoming more and more visible. Here is a simple 3-by-3 fact of global inequality as reminder. A simple calculation showsFootnote 1 that the aggregate wealth of the three richest persons, 1, 2 and 3, on earth is equal to the total wealth owned by all the people in three nations, A, B and C, for Angola, Burkina Faso and (Democratic Republic of) Congo. For an economy to function efficiently, and for people to invest and innovate, we need some inequality. But surely we do not need it at levels where some 130 million people together (the population of A, B and C) have the same wealth as 3. Furthermore, inequality within nations from the USA and China to India is rising. Compared to much of the world, India’s economy has been relatively stable since the Lehman crisis. Growth dipped following the crisis but picked up quickly after that. Right now, if we go by the ranking of major economies listed in the Economist magazine (December 1–7, 2018), India’s expected GDP growth of 7.4% is higher than that of China (6.6%), Philippines (6.2%), Indonesia (5.2%) and all other nations in that list. While that in itself is comforting, there are important underlying strains. The main problem is that over the last three or four years, India’s growth rate of growth rate has been negative. That is, India’s GDP growth rate has come down, from the outstanding performance of 2005–2008, for sure, but also compared to the last few years. All this is captured in Fig. 1. Source: Ministry of Finance data, 2017, Government of India Further, the bulk of the overall growth is happening because the rich are doing much better, with the middle and lower middle classes being relatively neglected. As one dissects the data, it becomes clear that many of the world’s problems are mirrored in India. Some of the problems are fallouts of the global situation and, as I will argue later, inevitable results of the march of technology. But there are also domestic policy mistakes for which the economy, especially the farmers and the poor, are paying a big price. After growing very well from 2003 to 2008 and again for a few years after a one-year slowdown in 2008, the nation’s GDP growth rate slowed down. It was beginning to pick up by 2016, but the disastrous demonetization on November 8, 2016, caused a major setback. What ordinary people did not realize then but do now, is that this policy was particularly bad for the middle classes, the poor and the farmers, who did not have the wherewithal that the rich had to cover the risks. There is now a lot of evidence that farmers were particularly badly hit because the buying power of ordinary people fell in the months following the demonetization, and this meant a slump in demand for agricultural goods. Since farmers had already grown the crops by the time the demonetization began to bite, they were stranded with supplies in their hand, facing a market with aborted demand. This was devastating for the agricultural sector and the lower middle classes. Further, the first reason given for the demonetization, namely to capture fake Indian currency notes in circulation, was a completely pointless intervention. This is because fake currency does damage at the point of entry. Someone injects paper into the economy and goes away with goods and services. However, once the fake currency is in the system, there is no reason to try to find it and replace it with real currency. Nothing is gained by that. And if it is felt that because of the injection of fake currency there is too much money in circulation, all we have to do is to destroy some of the cash in circulation. There is absolutely no reason to try to find the actual fake notes and to destroy them. For all these reasons, that the policy of demonetization would fail and hurt the less well-off was evident to all professional economists at the outset. Two years later, this is now recognized more widely in the population.Footnote 2 There is another underlying problem that does not get enough attention but can create long-run strains in growth. One remarkable achievement of India was its savings and investment rates breaching the 30% mark in 2003. They continued to rise after that and by 2010 had crossed 35%, with India beginning to look, for the first time, like a successful East Asian economy. There has been a steady decline in this important parameter in recent times with the savings and investment rates sliding back to below 30%. All this has fed into a malaise that India shares with many other nations—that of rising inequality. Popular attention to this at the global level was drawn by the celebrated book by Piketty 2014, but similar extreme trends are also being reported for India (see Jayaraj and Subramanin 2016; Himanshu 2018). In India and elsewhere, including in advanced economies, ordinary people’s anger has taken perverse forms, resulting in a form of hyper-nationalism rarely witnessed outside of war. Some commentators have argued that the world is better-off today than almost any time in history, and so to talk about our current troubles is uncalled for pessimism. I believe that these commentators are both right and wrong. They are right about us being better-off today than our predecessors. From 1500 to 1820, according to data collected by the late Angus Maddison (2007), the world’s annual growth rate was just 0.32%, with large sections of the world experiencing no growth at all. In China, annual per capita income stood at $600 throughout this period. For someone living at that time, today’s disappointing 3.5% global growth rate would have been inconceivable. They could not anticipate the Industrial Revolution’s impact. This lifted average annual global growth to 2.25%, from 1820 to 2003. But the commentators are wrong in not being cognizant of the fact that the ground beneath our feet is shifting, which could result in turmoil and collapse. Even as the world becomes more productive, the slow change of the strategic environment can spell eventual doom. After all, we have seen flourishing societies collapse even after they grew. This happened in Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indus Valley in South Asia, the Qin dynasty in China and also the Mayan and Inca civilizations in the Americas. Luckily, we are the first inhabitants on earth to have the capacity for self-analysis. Dinosaurs flourished for many years and then went extinct, with no foreboding of what was ahead of them and no capacity to analyze and change course. In an ongoing research project with Jorgen Weibull (Basu and Weibull 2018), we are analyzing theoretically our own ‘dinosaur risk,’ and how we can dissect our own problem and design corrective policies. There have been times in history, when we have succeeded in analyzing and understanding our own predicament, and bringing in innovative policies which have steadied the ship and put the world back on track for peace and growth. Arguably we owe the birth of economics to such an intellectual venture. The most important turmoil and eventual policy success was the product of the Industrial Revolution that started in Europe, mainly Britain. This powered our economies but also caused massive political strain and challenge. This was also a time when history saw an extraordinary spark of creativity in Europe. Economics as a discipline was born some time at the end of the eighteenth century. The profession came into its own soon after that; philosophers in Europe were doing pioneering work, breaking new grounds. This innovation in ideas steadied the ship and enabled the Industrial Revolution to turn into a blessing with the spread of prosperity. We may be at a similar stage of history once again. The turmoil and disquiet we are witnessing across the world emphasize the need for novel thinking and innovative policies once again. Asian may have a responsibility this time the way Europe had for navigating the Industrial Revolution. The last decades have seen extraordinary growth in Asia. It began with Japan, followed by Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong. By the early 1980s, China was growing at a rapid speed unrivaled in history. A bit later, by the mid-1990s, Vietnam and India joined the band of rapidly growing nations, with India crossing the 9% mark in 2005. China is a global force second only to the USA. India stands out, among developing countries for innovative research in economics. But there is still a great distance to go. Economics needs another round of fundamental research of the kind witnessed in Europe at the end of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. We have learned to gather and analyze large data sets, and this is invaluable to science. But there is, at the same time, a need to go back to creative fundamental work in economics, the kind of breakthroughs that gave us general equilibrium theory, game theory, the capacity to analyze voting and collective choice, in short, the breakthroughs that gave our discipline the stature it has today. Thanks to the digital technological revolution, the nature of economics is changing. It is time to take stock of the current challenge and think of novel solutions. This is a big project and likely to be a protracted enterprise. In the remainder of the address, I want to argue that the several crises we have witnessed from 2008 may not be as disparate as they appear. They have certain common underlying causes, rooted in the rise of new technology. Our challenge is to devise new kinds of interventions to make sure that the technological advance turns into a force for widespread prosperity and not a source of conflict and self-destruction. This is an imperative today if we are to avoid our own dinosaur risk.",
62,1,The Indian Journal of Labour Economics,20 February 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41027-019-00154-z,Against Thresholds: Raising Capacity and Formalizing the Economy,March 2019,Dipankar Gupta,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Industrial relations in India have suffered primarily because the laws around them are premised on an abiding mistrust between labour and management. This prompts a particular strand of opinion that views big enterprises with suspicion and sees little advantage in their prosperity or growth. Instead, small units, even cottage-like ones, are preferred where workers are hired on an irregular and casual basis. The Industrial Disputes Act (IDA), the central pillar of all labour-related issues, encourages this trend given the way it centralizes thresholds. The key ones are in Sections 25K, 25FFF, 25 (2)(a)(ii), 25(2)(b), which collectively relate to size of firm and related obligations. This, in my view, hurts the growth of a dynamic industrial sector and divides the working class. If a unit is above a certain size, only then are workers given security in terms of due process before being fired and compensation when dismissed. The fate of workers in smaller units does not concern the IDA as much. This results in workers getting stratified for there are now the privileged and the less privileged in this class. Workers who are employed in companies who have more than a hundred workers on their rolls are certainly better off than those in smaller companies. The IDA gives them greater economic security and political rights than those in smaller organizations. That is why when the term “labour aristocrats” is employed to designate those who are employed in enterprises with a 100 workers or more, there is a certain ring of truth in it. They are envied by the ones who toil in smaller enterprises and have none of the advantages that those in large organizations enjoy. This creates a gulf between them and inhibits a common front. Most significantly, the IDA protects workers on strike only when they are fortunate enough to be employed in large establishments. No such cover exists for labour in smaller units. Not surprising then that the management should pay close attention to thresholds in order to escape obligations towards the workers. On the other hand, privileged workers have vested interest in keeping these thresholds firm and unrelenting as they gain from it. This encourages the birthing of small firms, for then the sternest provisions in the IDA can be sidestepped, leaving workers both vulnerable and pliant. Let us take a quick look at these thresholds. The first concerns the size of the unit. If it employs a hundred workers, or more, the government has to be notified before any labour dismissal takes place. Compensation after dismissal becomes an active concern only if the worker has completed 240 days of continuous employment. If a unit employs less than 20 workers, then it gets an additional benefit as it does not have to worry itself about paying out provident funds and bonuses. The IDA mandates dispute resolution mechanisms only in companies that employ 100 workers or more. Against this background, it is tempting for entrepreneurs to make sure that, as far as possible, their companies do not transgress these thresholds. This inhibits moves towards expansion because laws are tilted against large enterprises. Get big and you invite a slew of legal requirements which, by staying small and keeping impermanent workers, you can easily circumvent. As a consequence, not only do units strive to employ below 100 workers, but they also promote the growth of informal labour. As there are great advantages in staying small, particularly in terms of discipline and control, company promoters see this as their first choice. While such a strategy may suit some kind of enterprises, this discourages others that demand size and scale for full efficiency. The latitude given to units employing less than 100 workers is not just in terms of managerial control, but has other advantages too. For example, if small enough, they are also exempt from environmental norms which can be quite stiff. Their insignificant size also helps them escape audit scrutiny as they are difficult to trace and track down. Moreover, the National Sample Survey also informs us that 79% of workers do not have secure contracts and are ineligible for social security and benefits (Rustagi 2015: 19). As this primarily afflicts small units, the fate of workers in them is almost entirely shrouded. In this atmosphere of wariness towards large enterprise, two issues are overlooked and these are actually quite vital. The first is that it is not just financial capital, but intellectual capital too multiplies more rapidly in larger units than in smaller ones. Second, both management and labour can benefit from the advantages large units provide, but the presence of thresholds obscures this from view.",2

Regardless of measurement methodologies, the majority of firms is classified as micro and small in most countries and is essential for the economic growth and development of any nation due to their contribution to total production as well as their employment rate. Small-size firms comprise about 60% of the total of firms and are responsible for hiring over half the employed population, in Brazil. In the USA, for instance, approximately 78.8% of firms have fewer than 10 employees (Heneman et al. 2000). That is why, in the past few decades, this segment has received growing attention academically (Audretsch and Keilbach 2004; Van Stel et al. 2005; Sarfati 2013) and from the government in the form of financial and tax incentive policies, generally to reduce legal and bureaucrat bottlenecks. Besides differences in size, measured either by the number of employees or revenue, firms are also classified in accordance with technology and employee performance management. Smaller firms, in general, find it easier to test innovative technologies and are more agile in hiring new employees, as they usually are the initial step of one’s professional career in labor market (Zenger and Lazzarini 2004). On the other hand, the lack of information systems for human resources and management processes is frequent to the point of creating an additional obstacle for assessing organizational development and confirming administrative-management theories. Larger companies have the resources and people available to implement and perform state-of-the-art HR (Human Resource) policies and practices and are thus more exciting research playgrounds. They usually have more and more sophisticated HR in place. This paper hopes to offer insights from the Brazilian labor market, offering originality in the investigation of switches between firms as probable causes for changes in behavior (effort level). To do so, a data panel was built (from 2005 to 2015) and two distinct econometric methods (random effect probit model and Mundlak/Chamberlain probit model) were used to infer whether possible changes in effort are related to moral hazard or adverse selection. Two proxies were used to measure effort levels: sub-remuneration (the ones whose salary is inferior to the average salary the category of similar workers used to earn) and absence (missing work). Despite its limitations and the possibility of flaws, these proxies are the most convenient and are used in the literature to signal workers’ effort (Jimeno and Cortes 1996; Barmby and Stephan 2000; Booth et al. 2002; Engellandt and Riphahn 2005; Ichino and Riphahn 2005; Ghignoni 2009). It is important to clarify that this paper does not seek to determine the causes and effects of possible choices regarding the size of the firm to which one wishes to work. However, in assuming that workers can act strategically performing distinct levels of effort depending on the organizational structure and the type of contract (employment protection), the hypothesis that workers in small firms put more effort into work than workers of larger firms will be investigated based on Jimeno and Cortes (1996), Bryson (1999), Riphahn and Thalmaier (2001), Booth et al. (2002), Ichino and Riphahn (2005) and Ghignoni (2009). According to Alex Bryson (1999), the involvement of workers in small firms greatly differs from workers of large firms and with respect to their preference of providing effort. In addition, methods that are less bureaucratic and costly of small firms, such as monitoring of activities, tend to generate greater discretionary effort for workers, increasing their intrinsic rewards and organizational commitment. However, it is important to emphasize that there is no consensus in the literature since that many factors such as type of contract and employment procection could influence worker productivity. Agel (2004) highlights that in larger establishments it is more difficult to judge work performance and that worker effort is more responsive to external pay.
 Beyond this introduction, this paper is composed of four sections. Section 2 presents a review of the literature related to firms’ size and worker productivity. Section 3 describes the methodological approach and dataset. Section 3 focuses on descriptive and econometric results. Finally, Sect. 4 contains the concluding remarks.",

The report goes on to argue that over 600 million jobs will be needed in the next 15 years to absorb the increase in the working-age population, mainly in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. The issue is not only one of unemployment, but is exacerbated by the large proportion of individuals working in the informal economy. Indeed, half of all workers in developing countries are engaged in small-scale agriculture or self-employment, jobs that don’t provide steady pay-checks and benefits. One of the challenges in addressing youth unemployment is the low level of formal schooling compounded by the skills gap—that is, the gap between the skills needed by employers and the existing skill set of job seekers. India is an example of a developing country facing a pressing need to devise strategies to provide regular employment to its youthful population.Footnote 1 India is among the youngest nations in the world, and the expected ‘bulge’ in the 15–59 age group over the next decade offers an opportunity but also a challenge. The opportunity stems from the expected global shortage of 56 million young people (15–35 years), and India could potentially serve as a worldwide sourcing hub for skilled manpower (Ministry of Labour and Employment 2014). On the other hand, a failure to provide opportunities to the youth population as they enter the labor market may translate into a ‘demographic disaster’ rather than a dividend (Mitra and Verick 2013). The twin challenges of creating jobs while at the same time bridging the skills gap are well recognized by the Indian Government. Consistent with this policy priority, on September 25, 2014, the Government launched the ‘Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushal Yojana’ (DDUGKY), a program for training, skill building and job placement intended for rural youth from poor families. The vision of the program is to: Transform rural poor youth into an economically independent and globally relevant workforce (Ministry of Rural Development 2016). The scheme implements skill development through a public–private partnership mode, whereby registered private sector partners or project implementation agencies (PIA) plan and implement skills training and place program participants. The DDUGKY is not an entitlement program but rather eligible candidates decide whether to participate or not, in government-sponsored training programs. Candidates in the age group 15–35 are eligible to participate if they belong to the below-poverty-line (BPL) category or if any member from their family is a member of a self-help group (SHG).Footnote 2 If neither of these conditions are met, then an applicant needs to provide a letter of recommendation from the Gram Panchayat (Ministry of Rural Development 2016).Footnote 3 The intention of the DDUGKY and other similar programs is to attenuate unemployment and poverty, but this is possible only if social structures do not hinder voluntary participation in the program. If there are differences in program access based on caste, gender or other social markers, either in program participation or in job placement after training, then increasing government spending and augmenting the supply of trained individuals may achieve little toward the final goal of enhancing welfare and equity. Hence, from a policy perspective, it is important to examine both the factors promoting or hindering scheme participation and to identify the impact of the scheme on employment prospects and earnings. Despite the large number of skills training and employment programs operating in India, and the considerable resources expended on such schemes, systematic evaluations of their impact on creating employment as well as assessing whether such schemes reach the intended population, are limited. This paper offers such an analysis. Based on both, survey and qualitative data, collected in a district in North Bihar, this paper examines the role of socio-economic and demographic characteristics in determining scheme participation. Subsequently, we evaluate the effect of scheme participation on employment and earnings. Although the study focuses on one course offered through a government-sponsored program, that is, the DDUGKY, it has much wider applicability as similar programs are being implemented in various parts of the country. For instance, another important skill-building program is the ‘Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana’ (PMKVY) which is almost similar to DDUGKY and is also being implemented by the central government. In addition, various state-specific programs such as ‘Himayat’ (for rural youth in Jammu & Kashmir), ‘Roshni’ (rural youth in 27 left-wing extremist districts across 9 states) and ‘Star’ (Standard training assessment and reward scheme) are also being implemented. The rest of the paper unfolds by providing in Sect. 2 a review of the existing literature on youth training programs with a focus on schemes operating in developing countries. Section 3 provides an overview of the DDUGKY. Section 4 discusses the sampling strategy and data collection, while Sect. 5 outlines an analytical framework, presents results and explores the financial returns from the program. Section 6 contains concluding remarks.",5

An understanding of the basic fertility decisions is therefore important, given their effects on the rate of growth of population, the composition of labour force, systems of social security, as well as economic outcomes (Siegel 2017). A number of economies have experienced a considerable rise in female participation in paid employment in recent years, which goes along with a continuous fall in fertility rates. Nonetheless, a striking attribute of these stylised facts rests in the large cross-country discrepancy in the link between the two variables. In the traditional view, there exists a negative correlation between female labour participation and fertility in the cross-country analysis, such that a country with low labour participation has a tendency for high fertility, and vice versa (Azmat and González 2010). The households’ fertility decisions are largely dependent on childrearing, which is considered in households’ consumption expenditures. This means parents are not just considering the number of children but also their quality such that the quality of children is related to both their consumption possibilities and human capital accumulation (Becker and Lewis 1973; Becker et al. 1990). In the studies put forward by Idris et al. (2017), they demonstrate that notwithstanding a country is low-, middle- or high-income economy, fertility depicts a downward trend which is a cause for concern due to possible declining population faced by both developed and developing countries. Available records from the World Development Indicators (WDI) show that the level of female participation in paid employment in Southeast Asia has recorded a considerable increase over the years. However, while Singapore and Malaysia largely take the lead, in economic terms, among the countries, the level of female employment in these countries is not the highest as one may have expected. The proportion of female unemployment in Malaysia, in 2016, was one of the highest in Southeast Asia, just below the like of Indonesia and Philippines and above many other countries in the region. While that of Singapore is relatively lower, it falls below the like of Thailand and Myanmar even though the latter countries have lesser economic fortunes than the former. Specifically, the female labour participation in Singapore rose from 40.58 to 60.40% between 2000 and 2015, followed by a fall in the fertility rate from 1.60 to 1.24% within the same period. Similarly, data on Malaysia reveal that, within the same period, the female participation rose from 47.20 to 54.10%, with a corresponding fall in fertility from 2.83 to 1.93% (WDI 2016). Zhang (2017) identifies that several economists, including demographers, have proposed a set of models with a view to linking labour market conditions to fertility. These authors propose a strong negative correlation between these variables, given that a married woman likely pays more attention to domestic chores and child care. Mincer (1962) and Becker (1985) explain that the care for young children (by a mother) is less an easy task when compared to other basic domestic functions and leisure, thus hindering the efficiency of women in the labour force. In addition, persistent maternal employment tends to be difficult due to some employment practices, such as long working hours, where women may have to choose either to have a family or good employment; hence, they tend to be demoted to part-time employment upon child birth. This is because human capital under utilisation and maternal employment concentration on part-time jobs entail low-social status, due to low wages, thereby widening the gender wage gap (Palley and Usui 2008 citing Usui 2005). This relationship is further demonstrated by Fig. 1 in the case of Malaysia and Singapore. Relationship between fertility (TFR) and labour participation (FLPR) in Singapore and Malaysia Corresponding to a decreasing fertility rate is the female labour participation which has experienced a high growth rate in both Singapore and Malaysia, their (strong) negative correlation leads to a policy dilemma regarding whether having more children reduces the prospect of labour market participation among married women. In practical terms, a simultaneous increase in fertility rate and female labour supply tends to be difficult. This is in view of the fact that a fertility-induced policy may result in an increase in fertility rate, but hinders the level of female labour supply (Dudel 2009; Rosenbluth et al. 2002), cited in Zhang (2017). Lee and Lee (2014) contend that appropriate policy would be to raise fertility so as to reduce the level of unemployment and increase output, given a persistent decline in fertility as well as ageing population. The objective of the study is to examine the interlink between fertility and female labour participation, as a comparative analysis between Malaysia and Singapore. This is the first of such comparatives which explains the pattern of impacts of fertility on female labour participation in the countries largely regarded as ‘powerhouse countries’ in Southeast Asia. While some researchers have argued that the relationship between the two variables is simultaneously determined (see Alam and Mamun 2016; Pastore 2012), others hold the view that the relationship is sequential (see Lee and Lee 2014; Siah and Lee 2015; Mishra and Smyth 2010). For a balanced and convincing estimate, therefore, this research tests the relationship from both perspectives. To address the endogeneity of fertility, the study employs the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) and Two-Stage Least Square (2SLS) techniques in order to estimate both the magnitude and direction of the relationship between the variables in the two countries. Alam and Mamun (2016) improved upon previous studies by employing the simultaneous equations model (SEM) in order to avoid possible biased estimates, by controlling for the reverse effects. This study, however, compares the relationship in two countries, as against Alam and Mamun (2016) whose research focus is on Australia. As such, this research is premised on the proposition that the realisation of a higher rate of labour participation and fertility does not occur in isolation, but determined jointly. The remains of the study are structured in the following order: Sect. 2 details the review of related and relevant literature; Sect. 3 explains the methodology employed in the study; Sect. 4 presents the empirical results; and Sect. 5 presents the conclusion and recommendation.",

62,2,The Indian Journal of Labour Economics,12 July 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41027-019-00171-y,Are Technology Transfers Skill Biased?,June 2019,Swati Virmani,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Human capital plays a twofold role in the process of economic growth: (1) as a stock of skills it is a factor of production that coordinates with physical capital and with raw (unskilled) labour and (2) as a stock of knowledge it is a source of innovation that is the basic source of economic growth. Human capital comprises of the knowledge, education, skills and characteristics of the members of an organization. It incorporates the abilities of the organizational performers to undertake skilful action and thereby produce value for the industry (Kianto et al. 2010). Therefore, an increase in skill intensity essentially means or implies an increased acquisition of human capital. In other words, skilled workers are bearers of human capital. The essential idea of this study is to look at the human capital adjustments to the pace of technological change and search for evidences for the same. Does a more rapid technical change bring about a greater utilization of human capital? This is because more educated or skilled labour can deal effectively with a rapid changing environment or with a temporary disequilibrium resulting from technology change. Further, skilled people or workers make good innovators, so that an increase in skill intensity speeds up the process of technological diffusion. A more rapid pace of technological progress should induce increased inputs of human capital by making their acquisition more profitable. Relation between technological change and human capital is therefore complementary. Also, technical change is more complementary with human capital than with raw (unskilled) labour. There is evidence that the absorption of new technologies into production process is skill intensive; it creates skill-biased labour demand and increases the relative wage of skilled to unskilled labour (Mincer 1989; Nelson and Phelps 1966; Eicher 1996; Bartel and Lichtenberg 1987). Therefore, there is an interaction between technological change and incentives to accumulate human capital, or growth of human capital is a consequence of exogenous accumulation of physical capital. A growing consensus among economists is that the lead factor in increasing the demand for education, in the USA for example, is the bias of technological change towards more educated workforce, in other words skill-biased technology change (SBTC) (Berman et al. 2005). SBTC implies that new technologies drive employers’ increased demand for skilled workers relative to less skilled. Under standard assumptions, skill-biased technology change results in decline in demand for less skilled workers from industries and depresses their relative wages by lowering the relative prices of goods intensive in less skilled labour. This is consistent with increased wage premium for skilled workers. To put it differently, skilled workers can easily adopt to a new technology as it is less costly for them to learn additional knowledge (Violante 2008). How does SBTC affect relative wages of skilled labour in open economies such as India? Berman et al. (1998) argue that at recent levels of international trade and openness, it is difficult to imagine that major technological changes could occur in one country without rapid adoption by similar industries in other countries, given that one believes technology transfers across borders. This is called pervasiveness of SBTC. And the more pervasive the SBTC, the greater is the potential to impact relative wages. The hypothesis or the central theme of our paper hence runs as a sequence looking at the following objectives: To identify a shift in skill demand across Indian manufacturing industries for the period between 2001–2002 and 2013–2014. To decompose the changes in proportion of skilled workers in order to identify what accounts for the shift—can the increase in demand for skills be attributed to technology changes, or is it mainly explained by higher capital-output ratio and increased capital-skill complementarity? To test whether India provides evidence for pervasive SBTC, i.e. (1) are the shifts concentrated in same industries as the USA, and (2) is skill intensity correlated with technology indicators of high-income countries?  Another important point to look at is whether the technology-biased skilled intensity is more visible in case of service-oriented industries. These industries are heavily reliant on knowledge work, individual skills and capabilities. The role of human capital as a part of the ‘Intellectual Capital’, comprising of managers/skilled workers/R&D personnel/non-wage-oriented labour, is likely to be especially important in case of services. The service-oriented industries require more attention to be paid to employee characteristics, such as knowledge, skills, etc., as these industries have a large impact on consumer’s perceived value (Kianto et al. 2010). The importance of human capital is more pronounced among service industries/firms as they rely on ‘personnel’ to generate and produce the output ‘services’. We therefore try to demark these industries expecting that they would observe relatively higher levels of technology diffusion, the reason being that services are more human capital intensive and technological change is driven by human capital embedded in labour. Also international mobility of factors is high in service-oriented industries, and increased specialization in services promotes diffusion of technology from where it originated to other markets. The motivation for our analysis comes from the recent trend observed for India’s economic growth that seems to have benefitted industries with more skilled workers and capital in contrast to those industries that rely on unskilled workforce (Kapoor 2015). This raises concerns as increasing skill and capital intensity of manufacturing sector could result in fewer workers being employed. Further, substantial empirical evidence has supported a simultaneous increase in globalization and wage inequality in developing countries, with international flow of capital as a factor behind (Goldberg and Pavcnik 2007). Hence, as a starting point, it is important to understand what mainly accounts for the increase in skill demand. Also the paper draws attention from similar studies done in the past, for instance Berman et al. (2005), that look at the case of Indian manufacturing in the 1990s and test whether SBTC arrived in India during 1990s and how much was contributed by international transfer of technology. The paper is original in several respects and contributes by (1) extending the period of study to 2000s, (2) carrying out a series of tests to analyse the linkage between skill composition and technology process for Indian manufacturing at industry level, (3) analysing whether Indian manufacturing industries showed signs of pervasive SBTC in 2000s and (4) giving a greater focus on service-oriented industries. Our conclusions are best stated at the outset: we find that Indian manufacturing observed a shift in favour of higher skill composition in the 2000s, and there appears to be a cross-industry correlation, particularly in case of skilled wages. The trend also suggests a rise in capital-labour and capital-skill ratios. Decomposing the increase in skill demand, we find that majority of these changes can be attributed to shift within industries. However, testing what results in such a movement towards greater skill demand, the outcomes suggest that, during 2000s, capital-skill complementarity and a higher capital-output ratio are good predictors of skill upgrading within Indian manufacturing rather than changes or transfers in technology. In other words, not enough evidence can be found in favour of SBTC. This paper consists of five sections, of which this is the first. In Sect. 2 we briefly summarize the trend and stylized facts for 26 Indian manufacturing industries over the period between 2001–2002 and 2013–2014 to build our discussion for the changing skill composition. Section 3 decomposes what accounts for the changes in skill demand. Section 4 discusses whether there is a common pattern between India’s increasing skill intensity and that of USA and whether there is a correlation between India’s rising skill composition and technology indicators of high-income countries. Conclusions and implications are drawn in Sect. 5.",

They intersperse productive work with reproductive work, unpaid work with paid work and all kinds of activities with leisure and self-care. Workplaces vary widely depending on the needs of her family. She plans, manages and implements her work, often being responsible for all the three domains. She may seem to be making a “choice” in deciding the continuum, and the “choice” seems to be “hers” as the dynamics and structures of institutions remain invisible to her. Delving deep, we find that it is more often a coping mechanism in managing poverty of all forms—income, time and opportunity. Through her work, women interact with three dominant spheres, namely the State, the market and the family and its layers. These three domains do not operate as mutually exclusive domains and interact with each other in organising women’s work. The economy is mainly the sphere of the market, which is working on the principle of “profit making”. The State operates “by exercising its power in rule making and regulating”. It regulates the market and defines the norms within which different sectors interact. The domestic sphere works under the structures of kinship and community governed by the principles of cultural norms. The boundaries of spaces enjoyed by the State, household and the market are often blurred, especially when workplace becomes home or is situated near home. This paper studies how women who are home-based workers or are self-employed ones working from or near home organise their work and how the continuum gets influenced by institutional interplay. The intent is to read gender in the organisation of work continuum and understand the interplay of institutions.,",2

This is because it cannot be bought or acquired like other factors but can be hired at a price. The act of hiring labour is rigorous as it is determined by the skills and experiences of the labourer, minimum wage rate for labour, etc. These factors inform the decision to hire labour. The significance of the work environment (factors affecting labour and its productivity) on labour cannot be overemphasized. If the environment is conducive, the workers are happy and produce more with a given level of other inputs (labour productivity increases), otherwise labour productivity decreases. Wages and incentives are vital parts of the work environment of labour. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to determine the optimal levels of wage rates and incentives for the productivity of homogeneous labour. For the purpose of this paper, incentives are other monetary benefits labour receive aside their basic wage rates while improvement in labour productivity is measured by producing higher quantities with a quality level, no less than the standard quality level using a fixed level of inputs at a point in time. Every firm ought to seek and establish the conducive environment that is suitable to maximize the productivity of labour. This has raised concerns globally, and researchers have set out to establish the optimal wage rate structure that would maximize the productivity of labour. Edward and Robert (1984) modelled the utility of workers in terms of earnings and cost-efficiency differences and deduced that piece wage rate improves the productivity of labour. Shearer (2004) and Raymond and Kelsey (2015) provided empirical supports to the claim of Edward and Robert (1984). They stated that piece rate structure relative to a fixed wage rate structure, which is dependent on a worker’s output level, increases labour productivity using field experiment analysis. This contribution as initiated by Edward and Robert (1984) was successfully applied by many industries and firms in order to improve the productivity of labour. In addition to this, Barton et al. (2003) and Oriana et al. (2013) added that team participation aside the piece rate structure also improves labour productivity by 14% on average. Eliav and Leif (2015) disputes the fact that piece rate is robust in improving productivity, instead they introduced a pareto-improving minimum wage as a graduated minimum wage structure which requires high-productivity workers to earn the same income with low-productivity workers even though the former works more while the later benefits from the second-degree price discrimination. Bishnupriya (2011), however, explains that low wage rate is as a result of surplus labour mostly in the agricultural sector which did not affect labour productivity adversely. At this stage, it is important to make it clear that the optimal wage rate and the optimal incentive levels are not static but changes with time due to the dynamic and non-satiation nature of labour (human). Empirically, it is evident in the labour market that labour would often demand for higher wage rate and incentive over time to balance out changes even in the economy as a whole such as inflation, improvement in standard of living, income and substitution effects, etc. Thus, labour productivity is largely dependent on the wage and incentive levels at a particular time. Researchers often modelled the optimal wage rate through the household or labourer’s utility which seeks to optimize the utility level of the workers by choosing the optimal wage rate. This paper focuses on the firm’s viewpoint, thereby choosing the optimal wage rate and incentives that would maximize the output level (productivity) of the workers over time. This is believed to be a novel contribution to the existing theoretical and empirical facts on maximizing workers’ productivity. Thus, firms would be able to choose the right combinations of incentive and wage rates suitable for improving labour productivity and the output levels as a whole at each point in time. Therefore, labour productivity is separated from capital productivity and not assumed exogenously as it has always been the case while using the Cobb–Douglas production function where the first parameter A is said to be the productivity of factor inputs. This paper therefore models labour productivity, and it is endogenously determined in the model. By doing so, firms can adjust their working environment policies to achieve a certain level of labour productivity. This paper is the first of its kind, which followed a different route from that of existing studies to model explicitly, the labour productivity, while determining the level of wage rate and incentive level to maximize the labour productivity. By modelling labour productivity, it is therefore easier for a firm to adjust workers’ productivity with respect to the objectives of the firm. Concisely, this paper will establish the levels of wage rates and incentives that maximize labour productivity at a given point in time and conduct comparative statics to establish how the optimal levels of wage rates and incentives respond to the working environment parameters of labour productivity. The rest of this paper is organized as follows; in Sect. 2, the model structure, assumptions, competitive equilibrium, general equilibrium, analytical solutions, etc., are discussed in detail. In Sect. 3, the model’s results and predictions, comparative statics are discussed. Finally, in Sect. 4, the conclusion is presented strategically.",

An Empirical Examination Using Okun’s Law",June 2019,Jamaladeen Abubakar,Ibrahim Nurudeen,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"One of the cardinal objectives of macroeconomic policy is to achieve economic growth. That is, why are all government policies are designed in such a way that they will be consistent with the growth objective of the government? But the question is why is the government so concerned about economic growth? The answer to this question is multi-dimensional, but the most important one is to get political popularity. This is how the trend is: when there is an output expansion, the level of employment will rise, and the reduction in unemployment makes the government popular and this leads to winning in elections. Therefore, the government will always seek for output expansion even at the cost of inflation to get re-election by the public. The leading question to this episode is that, does output expansion always lead to increase employment? There are three answers to the above question: when output expands rapidly, unemployment will reduce. Secondly, when output grows slowly, unemployment will rise, and finally, when output growth is equalled to the potential output, unemployment will be constant. At a theoretical level, Okun’s law was the first effort made to describe the relationship that exists between output and unemployment. The whole idea started with the Keynes notion that at any time the economy is operating below full employment equilibrium, so that whenever there is an increase in aggregate demand above the present level of output, firms will hire more workers to increase the supply of output that will match the existing demand. In the process of doing so, aggregate employment will increase. This will continue until when output reaches its optimal level. Therefore, to Keynes, the government can stimulate the economy through either an increase in spending or reduction in tax to boost aggregate demand which will imply output expansion and employment. At the empirical level, a lot of efforts exist trying to verify empirically the existence of Okun’s law to different economies. See, for example, the works of Lancaster and Tulip (2015), Higgis (2011), Wen and Chen (2012), Cazes et al. (2011) and Alamro and Al-deli’ien (2016), Blinov (2014), Ball et al. (2012), and Lal (2010) among others. These researches were conducted with the aim of determining whether the deviation of output from its potential level leads to unemployment. In other words, does an increase in output always lead to economic growth? The findings of these researchers vary across countries as some studies provide evidence that an increase in economic growth is followed by an increase in employment, whereas to others, an increase in output must be reasonable enough before it can lead to an increase in employment. The general conclusion in the literature is that an economic growth does not in all the time imply a reduction in unemployment. The main objective of this work is to analyse the relationship between economic growth and unemployment in India using Okun’s law. Although the law has existed for a long period of time, the literature on its application to examine the relationship between employment and economic growth is very scanty; to the limited search of the literature, we only found the work of An et al. (2016) which fits the Okun’s law for the low- and lower-middle-income countries India inclusive. Therefore, the study intends to investigate whether economic growth in India always leads to a reduction in the level of unemployment’ this will include the use of both linear and nonlinear econometric models so that the robustness of the estimates with several these approaches can be ascertained. The rest of the work is organized as follows. In section two, the theoretical model is discussed, and the estimation technique is also presented in the section. Section three presents and discusses the result, and finally, section four concludes the work.",7

Basically, for many authors, the main reasons for unemployment are the following: the deficiency of labour demand, generous social welfare benefits, progresses in skill-oriented technology and globalisation. Also, economic crises create devastating consequences for households as a result of increases in unemployment and poverty. This is compatible with empirical estimates of the famous Okun’s law (1962), arguing that approximately a 2% decline in economic growth leads to a 1% increase in unemployment. Admittedly, unemployment has become an important problem; nevertheless, with the prolongation of unemployment duration, the lack of income for job seekers exacerbates the phenomenon far more, depending on a steady decrease in household income (Fuchs and Weber 2015). Thus, it brings with it harder life conditions for unemployed people and their families (Nichols et al. 2013), and long-term unemployed people have far more challenges to get a job because they have been stigmatised in the eyes of employers (Jackman and Layard 1991). In the international literature, there is considerable amount of empirical and theoretical research on unemployment; however, there are a few number of studies that separately examine unemployment between youth and adults on the basis of short and long terms. Actually, long-term unemployment and youth unemployment emerging as a result of deeper dynamics in the labour market vary substantially by the determinants of labour demand and supply (Hornstein and Lubik 2010). From the labour supply side, a series of features specific to the personality, such as age, education, gender, incapability and family responsibilities (Begum 2004; McQuaid and Lindsay 2002), as well as work-related factors such as the lack of basic skills or work experience and low skill (ILO 2015a), have several influences on unemployment. For example, Aaronson et al. (2010) explored the characteristics of long-term unemployment on the basis of the differences varying by gender, age, marital status, race, education, industry and occupational compositions to examine the factors behind the unprecedented increase in long-term unemployment. In regard to youth unemployment, Nganwa et al. (2015) in their study examined the relationship between urban youth unemployment and a set of explanatory variables from the labour supply side (age, gender, marital status, education, work experience, household income, family background/father’s education, social network density, job preference, family characteristics and regions), by applying a logistic regression model to the micro-data from Ethiopian Urban Employment Unemployment Survey conducted between 2006 and 2011. As for Turkey, although its average gross domestic product (GDP) has grown at almost 5% in the period of 2009–2016, unfortunately, the same achievement could not be made in unemployment rates, particularly in youth unemployment. Admittedly, these consequences make youth unemployment issues worth exploring and discussing. In this line, we aim to contribute to the literature by addressing the following research questions: how do long-term unemployed prospects differ between young people and adults with similar demographic profiles and work-related characteristics? Are employment incentives to increase youth employment really effective? Does long-term unemployment leave a permanent scar on young people in future? To answer these questions, we carry out logistic regression models to data from Turkey’s Household Labour Force Survey of 2016 in order to predict the differences between youth and adults in the associations between long-term unemployment and demographic and work-related factors. The study mainly argues that long-term youth unemployment is significantly associated with demographic profiles (gender, marital status, education and regions) and work-related factors (the lack of job experience, flexibility of job sought, status before seeking a job and job seeker’s occupations). The rest of the paper is organised into four main sections. Section 2 contains theories on long-term unemployment and the literature on long-term youth unemployment. An overview related to labour market trends for youth is given in Sect. 3. Section 4 focuses on descriptive and logistic regression analyses of the study. Finally, conclusion and recommendations are presented in Sect. 5.",1

Mishra,Urmi Pattanayak,Unknown,Female,Female,Female,"Unequal pay between sexes is a universal problem across the globe. Women’s entry into the labour market begins with a lower wage for them as against their male counterparts (ILO, 2013). Further, it is observed that women in different parts of the world with the same level of endowments are denied of equal opportunities as men in terms of both employment and earnings (Gregory 2009). While the wage gap between sexes does exist in both developed and developing countries, it varies by its size and kind. This kind of discrimination is highlighted frequently in the literature, and the gender-based wage discrimination has been emphasized from time to time by economists and sociologists alike. In recognition of this concern, preservation of minimum wage gaps remains as one of the foremost objectives of the sustainable development goals and the International Labour Organization (ILO). This is highlighted in various reports such as The ILO (2013) Pay Equal report and The Global Wage Report (ILO 2015). As per the ILO’s Global Wage Report 2014/15, women’s average wages are between 4 and 36% less than the men’s average. Even the Human Development Report 2000 clearly mentioned this phenomenon that women, whose share touches approximately 50% of the world’s total populace, stand to perform only a two-third of the work hours but receive merely one-tenth of the world’s income and are entitled to one-hundredth of the world’s property (HDI 2000; Manchanda and Chaudhary (2015)). The ILO (2009) studies also elucidate that “Throughout most regions and many occupations, women are paid less money than men for the same job. In a majority of countries, women’s wages represent between 70 and 90% of men’s wages, with even lower ratios in some Asian and Latin American countries” (ILO 2009). Given the significance of the topic, the SDG 5 documented the reduction in the gender wage differentials across the globe. Further, the recent pink economic survey of India (2017–2018) visualizes the importance of and concern on the topic related to gender regarding both employment and earning front. Recently, India Wage Report of ILO (2018) also visualized this phenomenon. These wages and earning differentials in the labour market basically lead to impoverishment in a multidimensional fashion, which can occur through a number of dimensions such as caste, gender and age which tends to reduce the opportunity of such groups to access basic social services and limits their participation in the labour market (Majumder 2007). Given the importance of this topic, a study of ADB (2017) analysed that “…the wage gap may discourage women from investing in human capital or participating in the labor market essentially creating a vicious cycle that hinders women’s future progress toward equality understanding its root cause is important”. The existing literature gives a broad view on the gender wage differentials such as search theory and human capital theory. This present study tends to analyse the pattern of gender wage differentials across broad economic groups in the urban labour market of India. The study is organized as follows. In the next section, we briefly summarize the major existing literature on gender-based earning discrimination. We present data and methodology in Sect. 2. We describe our results of changing the structure of employment and earnings in Sects. 3–5. Section 5 explores the changing structure of wages in the urban labour market and examines the major determinants of gender-based wage differentials. Further, the quintile decomposition procedure is applied to decompose the wage gaps to understand the gender-based labour market discrimination in the urban labour market of India. Section 6 gives the summary and findings of this study. Various national and international studies have examined the gender wage differentials for decades. Significant among them is Becker (1971) documenting the discrimination in the labour market with varying prospectives. The seminal work of Mincer (1974) adopting a model of investment in human capital documented that the wage gap is predominantly driven by the gender productivity gaps. Scholars engaged in gender-related studies specifically focusing on women’s studies have been emphasizing the marginalization of women in the labour force in the workplace (see Hirway 2012). The study of Sharif (1991) shows the inverted-S shape of women’s labour supply curve in respect of the wage rate and income, while some studies have documented an inverse relationship between labour supply and wage rate at a low level of wage. Various theoretical and empirical studies documented this phenomenon on gender-based wage differentials in both developed countries and developing countries such as India. In the Indian context, there are only a few systematic studies relating labour supply with wage rates (Dasgupta and Goldar 2006). The gender-based wage differentials are an observed reality in India since long. Jose (1988) documented the agricultural wage differentials between genders across all states. The persistent gender wage gap is attributed to the discrimination in the labour market itself towards the female. By using the Blinder–Oaxaca methodology, few Indian studies documented the persistence of gender wage differentials through the explained or endowment component and unexplained or discrimination component. Various studies explained these wage gaps across caste and religion groups (Khan 2016; Deshpande et al. 2015; Banerjee and Knight 1985; Madheswaran and Attewell 2007; Deshpande and Ramachandran 2014; Bhaumik and Chakrabarty 2009; Mukherjee 2007; Srivastava and Singh 2006). Another study by Duraisamy and Duraisamy (2005) also showed the earning differentials across genders due to discrimination components. Kingdon and Unni (2001) studied gender wage differentials using the data from the NSS 43rd round for the districts of Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, showcasing that females suffer a very lofty level of discrimination and the level of education contributes very little to this discrimination in the urban labour market of India. Madheswaran and Khasnobis (2007) by using NSSO 38th, 50th and 55th employment and unemployment round documented the gender wage differentials across the regular and casual workers (based on B–O methodology) and found the endowment and discrimination components to have narrowed down across the study periods. Another attempt at verifying gender wage discrimination by Deshpande et al. (2015) offers evidence to the persistence of the gender wage gap for the regular workers in the Indian labour market. By using the Machado-Mata-Melly (MMM) decomposition method, this study documented the gender wage differentials across quintiles that find women at the lower end of the wage distribution facing higher discriminatory gaps compared to women at the upper end of the wage distribution. Similar inspection has been made using the IHDS data sets by Agrawal (2014) using the Blinder-Oaxaca (B-O) methodology. The study of Mahajan and Ramaswami (2012) examined the perceptible paradox of a higher gender wage gaps in South India compared to North India in agricultural wages in their study. Duraisamy and Duraisamy (2005) by using the least squares and quantile regressions methodology for the 50th round NSSO EUS examined gender differences in wage premia has associated with various educational categories across states. Another study of Khanna (2012) also analysed the phenomenon of “glass ceiling” or a “sticky floor” effect, i.e. to broadly understand whether the gender wage gaps are higher at the upper or lower ends of the wage distribution. This study inspects the wage gaps across different quantiles of the wage distribution. The paper summarized with a discussion on the possible reasons for observing a sticky floor effect phenomenon in India. The study of Khan (2016) by using the NSSO 55th and 64th rounds highlighted the wage differentials among migrants and non-migrants in the Indian labour market. This study also found that with similar characteristics, migrant workers belonging to ST/SC, and female migrants, have a higher wage disadvantage compared to non-migrant workers. In recent periods with the decline of female labour force participation rates, the persistence of the wage gap is one of the important and serious concerns in both the rural and urban labour markets of India. During the last two decades, there are two discernible trends emerging in the Indian economy, these includes, “high accelerating economic growth and decelerating rate of growth in the labour force” (Motkuri 2016; Ghose 2013). All these studies reflect that a significant gender wage gap has been persisted with varying magnitudes across time and space. Given the dual structure of the market of the Indian economy, the regular wage earners are considered being more secured as compared to the casual workers, because as per the definition of NSSO the casual workers never get wages at par with the regular workers. The casual labour or workers considered to be a subset of the informal labour market. They are also generally engaged in economic activities with low wages and unstable employment structure (Dutta 2005, Das and Dutta 2007). While examining the wage differentials, few studies follow the wage differentials for a particular group of workers; given this context, the present study has provided a broad framework for analysis of the gender wage differentials across both the regular and casual workers since the last two decades and tries to examine the main determinants and reasons behind this observed trend. Given the changing structure of the urban labour market in recent periods, it is imperative to examine both employment and earning differences between sexes and to examine the determinants of the observed trend. Further, this study tries to understand the pattern of wage differentials across casual and regular wage earners in the urban labour market of India. Given this continuous and persistent engagement in understanding the gender differences in employment and wages, this study complements an analysis of issues on gender parity in wages by focusing on the evolution of gender wage gaps in the urban labour market since the last two decades, given the dynamic changes followed in the urban India along with various policy changes.",8

Mishra,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"Over the last few years, higher education has become more affordable and preferred choice among the youth. India has thereby witnessed an increase in the number of graduates in the past few years. However, there is a rising concern as to whether the labour market can provide enough job opportunities matching their educational level and specialisation. Looking at the persistent issue of educated unemployment,Footnote 1 providing quality jobs is a challenging task for both the public and private sectors. Therefore, many graduates have taken up jobs which require lower educational attainment; in other words, they are over-qualified for that job and their skills are underutilised. They are often underpaid as they are stuck in less productive jobs. This study involves a verification of wage response to varying educational levels across different occupations, using the 68th round of NSS Employment and Unemployment Survey (2011–2012). In the process, it discovers the extent to which mismatch in education and occupation leads to lowering of wages, especially for the over-educated. Further, this paper provides empirical evidence to address the contention in the existing literature, where some studies claim a lower return to education for the over-educated workers, contrary to studies supporting the human capital theory. This study aims to investigate whether there is a decreasing return to over-education or the validity of the human capital theory prevails in India across occupations. The next section is a brief review of the existing literature which provides evidence of education–occupation mismatch on returns to education and justifies the need for this study. The third section discusses the data sources, classification of education levels and occupational groups. It is followed by the descriptive analysis, the empirical framework and the regressions results, in section four and followed by the conclusion.",1

Ninety-two publications are in the first category of topics: Modern Business Enterprises, Corporate Organisation; Finance and Governance in Advanced and in Emerging Markets; The Theory of the Firm; Takeovers and Stock Market. In the second category, he had 89 publications on topics: Deindustrialisation and Long Term Structural Changes in the United Kingdom and other Advanced Economics; North-South Competition and Issues of Employment and Unemployment in North and South; Liberalisation and Globalisation of Financial, Labour and Product Markets. There are 77 papers in the third category on topics: Industrialisation, Economic Development and Economic Policy in Emerging Markets. In addition, four publications have come out posthumously as one of the authors on topics of Climate Change and Premises for a New Society; Cambridge and Development Economics; and Corporate Governance, Legal Origin and Persistence of Profits; and Consummate Dirigiste on Latecomer Economic Catch Up. The biographer holds the view that for Ajit Singh, there was no separation between economics and politics; indeed, inverting Lenin’s aphorism, his “economics was concentrated politics” (P. 176). Politics was necessary for change, but it has to be based on sound understanding of economic realities, rigorously empirically tested and with alternative policy framework. This guided his approach to both research and teaching. In this colossal accomplishment, his training, education and upbring played a crucial role. His birth took place at Lahore the centre of a multicultural Punjab comprising Muslim, Hindu and Sikh. His family bringing up took place in the Indian Punjab with composite Hindu–Sikh secular culture. He studied in common schools at various places in Punjab following transfer of his father as sub-judge at lower courts. At Chandigarh, he came in contact with progressive nationalist student movement with anti-imperialist ideology and also attempted a student union election which he had won, but the result was declared in favour of the nephew of the Chief Minister. Along with training and quality education, upbringing of Ajit Singh was multicultural. His father was born Sikh, while his mother was from Hindu background leading to fusion of Sikh and Hindu upper caste ethics of secular progressive modern and aspirational culture with fighting spirit of Sikhism. His family was three-generation-educated and had two generations of professionals in police and judiciary service. This made him hardworking, fearless (Nirbhao) and without malice (Nirvair). This was reflected in his both personal life and professional life. The early affliction with Parkinson disease in 1982 at the age of 42 did not deter him in life, and 85 per cent of his total publications are after this. This speaks of the never-die spirit (Chardikala) of composite Punjabi background of a proud Sikh scholar. Ajit Singh produced a large body of research published in books and journals individually and in collaboration with other scholars. His research covered a vast geographical area such as Europe and advanced market economies and also developing countries such as Mexico, Tanzania, South Korea, China and India. The exhaustive details of his works and themes have been included in Chapter 7 titled “Economics as Concentrated Politics”. This chapter provides the content of his research, method of analysis and context in which he conducted research. Starting with a paper “A Measure of a firm’s average share price” jointly with Robin Marris published in Journal of the Royal Statistical Society in 1966, he wrote several papers in the area of modern enterprises, corporate organisation, finance and governance, theory of the firm, takeovers and stock market. These papers brought out empirical findings and developed theoretical critiques of orthodox neoclassical characterisation of capitalist institution, the profit-maximising firm. It was demonstrated that managers of firms acted more in their own interests than those of owners of the capital, the share holders. They prioritise an expansion in the size of the firm to enhance their personal earnings and benefits over the goal of profit maximisation. On the issue of merger and takeovers, he discovered (1975) that they lead to improvement in the profitability of an amalgamated company if a more skilful management takes over a less skilful management and if it permits realisation of economies of scale; otherwise, it may raise profitability by restricting competition. The research evidence of Ajit Singh did not provide any support to neoclassical theory and doctrine of natural selection. Again in his paper on deindustrialisation of the British Economy (1977), he found that there was a potential conflict between the interests of footloose capital and immobile labour. Footloose capital would take a flight to wherever it felt it could get better profits and would not bother in which country it created related employment. These findings provided his deep theoretical and statistical critique of neoclassical theory of the firm. Ajit Singh examined the second vital institution of advanced capitalist economy, the stock market. He concluded (2000) that evidence suggests that the selection in the market for corporate control takes place to a limited extent on the basis of profitability and stock market evaluation but mainly on the basis of size. A large but relatively unprofitable firm has greater chance of survival than a small profitable company on the basis of comparison of functioning of stock markets in advanced and developing countries. Ajit Singh had found that stock market prices fluctuate more than prices of other economic variables even in advanced markets, but this volatility is far greater in developing countries. Share prices, therefore, are much less useful as a single guide to the allocation of resources. He concluded that the developing countries have to choose between attempt to foster bank-based financial system and that to encourage and establish stock market. But his research cautioned these countries to beware of irony of capitalism due to industry–finance linkages leading to monopolistic conditions and weaknesses of government regulatory framework. As opposed to Washington Consensus, Ajit Singh was opposed to capital account liberalisation. He supported in 2007 RBI Governor’s refusal to liberalise the capital account in India. On deindustrialisation in the North, especially in the UK, he argued that the decline of manufacturing was a downward spiral of cumulative causation leading to slower growth. On this basis, he expressed desirability and feasibility of reindustrialisation of UK and developing ex-colonial countries. Transformative industrialisation became a core concern of Ajit Singh’s thinking. On industrialisation, he learnt from Nicholas Kaldor three things: first, the only way for a country to develop is to industrialise; second, the only way to industrialise is to protect its industry; and third, anyone who says otherwise is being dishonest. Ajit Singh regarded that central ideas of Kaldor, particularly in relation to increasing return, dynamics of economies of scale, cumulative causation, technical change and equilibrium, are much more powerful than that of his contemporaries like Joan Robinson in undermining orthodox neoclassical theory. He tried to put his ideas as an alternative economic policy programme in Mexico and Tanzania. This had two fundamental requirements: first to harness powerful productive potentials of capital and second to control its inherent predatory instinct of the runway from the real economy. This could be accomplished by the strong state action. Ajit Singh not only took over the paradigm of Kaldor but further analysed it, using economic theory and empirics at more disaggregated and contextually specific levels. On these issues, Ajit Singh differed with IMF and the World Bank line of thinking on economic policy. He along with his co-authors had brought out that the global institutions of economic coordination, particularly IMF, are more a part of the problem than its solution. They backed original Keynesian agenda for a viable global financial architecture oriented towards shared goals of world community of countries. In a paper with Ann Zammit, they had brought out that the export of manufactured goods to the advanced countries by developing countries no way contributed the race to bottom of labour standards in the advanced countries. He supported globalisation and free trade, but he believed that its benefits can be realised only in specific world economic conjecture accompanied by appropriate set of domestic policies which transcend limits of commercial policy. He held the opinion that there was no unique optimum degree of openness of the economy which holds true for all the countries. This is determined by the world configuration, the past history of the economy and its state of development. At the same times, the timing and sequence of opening up are also critical for success of integration of the economy with the rest of the world. On the basis of experience of India and China in integration with the world, the role of domestically owned firm in industrialisation was important. The path to the future of the third world regardless of label of any “ism” lies along with highway of industrialisation. Ajit Singh had a recognised that large firms have crucial role in developing countries’ progress. In order to draft them in the right direction, it was necessary to make them productive, innovative and competitive. This requires a state with embodied autonomy to guide this process and stand up to inevitable pressures from neoliberalists on the private industrialists who see their long-term interests best served by pathway of industrialisation of the country. On under performance of Indian economy before 1990, Ajit Singh identifies the absence of any proactive policy to stimulate manufacturing due to anti-colonial hangover of the intellectual elite which made it suspicious of foreign trade and investment. He rejected the notion that Indian state lacked autonomy throughout the period. In the post-reform period in India after 1991, Ajit Singh along with Sukti Dasgupta recalibrated Kaldorian template to service sector to specific structural realities of India in three specific aspects. First, there was a move away from services as simply a derived demand to explicit recognition that exportable IT services might have overtaken manufacturing and agriculture with respect to balance of payment. Second, there was recognition of low job creation capacity of manufacturing and livelihood becoming a secular feature. Third, there is inclusion of informal economy into the policy frame. Thus, in the Kaldorian framework of manufacturing as a driver of growth, the services (IT) and informal economy were included. Ajit Singh placed primacy on industrialisation as a pre-condition for human resource development in a country. But in the prevailing conditions of contemporary reality, there is need for greening of the technology, assertion of labour rights, strategies for making informal economy more productive and fiscal redistribution for meeting basic needs of people. These alternatives and reforms could be accommodated within a flexible Kaldorian template with effective autonomous state backed by dynamic nationalist capitalist class in developing countries.",

We now restrict our attention to the aspect of contracting in the casual informal labour market which results in the wage and the duration of employment.Footnote 17 In most instances, this type of labour contract is oral and is struck as a bargain in a central market place that serves as a focal point where potential employers meet with potential employees. Sometimes, there is a middleman or labour contractor or jobber or mukadam who acts as the go-between the persons who offer their labour service and employers who are looking to fill up a vacancy. The type of labour service undertaken is mostly unskilled and often involves manual labour. Some other characteristics of this phenomenon are that earnings are low and the hours worked per day are usually longer than the standard 8 h work day, and this type of employment is irregular and provides for uncertain incomes. Many of these workers are often referred to as the working poor. The paucity of research on the employer–employee match in the daily urban casual labour market has been commented on by Iversen and Torsvik (2010) who review the role of social networks and intermediaries in the recruitment and control of workers in such types of employment. They claim that networks (usually relatives and co-villagers) are a cheap source of information provision about job openings, indicating that labour market information that flows through such networks is akin to a local public good. In addition, they claim that recruiting through networks provides a screening mechanism whereby information is provided ex ante on skills or qualities such as discipline and work ethic that are otherwise hard to obtain. Workers here are presumed to have superior information about relevant work qualities of individuals who belong to a social network. Finally, recruiting through networks reduces behavioural risks as surveillance and peer pressure is likely to be stronger in networks. Such workers are less likely to be absent from work and are more likely to be loyal to the workplace. This literature overlooks an important characteristic of such labour contracts—that they are characterized by search costs where potential employers and workers must incur a fixed search cum negotiation cost when they bargain and agree on an informal contract over the wage and the hours of work that is to be undertaken. For migrants, the costs of taking a loan to facilitate the travel and relocation costs as well as the on the ground costs of subsistence are sunk costs that may be taken to constitute a part of the search costs. In many urban contexts, workers gather at some focal point such as a busy market place or crossroad in the morning and meet with potential employers who negotiate the type of work to be performed, the wage, and the number of hours that the worker has to work. Working days are usually long—between 12 and 14 h in many instances—and the wage and working conditions are usually negotiated.Footnote 18 The market wherein the bargain takes place is a flexible labour market where workers can be replaced by the employer at a minimal cost to the employer. In most of such contracts, workers report that they have been cheated and face harassment. Guérin et al. (2015) who survey migrant workers into the sugar cane and brick-making sectors find that more than half of such workers (55.8 per cent in 2014) report they have been cheated and all workers report that they have been harassed. A useful framework to understand these issues is provided by the transactions costs literature (Williamson, 1979). This literature maintains that all contracts are unavoidably incomplete. In our context, two factors are important when considering informal sector employment contracts—one is that the contract must be able to specify what constitutes satisfactory performance of the terms of the contract and the other is that the contract must be enforceable. These requirements for complete contracting are severe and rarely satisfied in this context. Though the type of work required to be performed (say head loading) is discussed in the employment bargain, there is no stipulation of the conditions that would be taken into account to arrive at an understanding of whether the work had been performed satisfactorily and the associated rights and responsibilities of the two parties involved in the bargain. As a result, a third party cannot verify whether the terms of the contract have been adhered to and whether the parties have acted according to the particular courses of action that were negotiated. In the head loading instance, there is no measurement system that records whether the worker has transferred the requisite number of parcels without damage and within a given time frame. This inability to verify whether the terms of a contract have been fulfilled in turn makes it difficult to enforce a contract via an impartial arms-length third-party inspection. The employer then has an incentive to hold up the worker by requiring that she works for longer hours or requires her to take up other responsibilities that were not negotiated in the first instance. The worker who has already committed her day towards working for that employer is forced into undertaking these additional responsibilities so as to enable her to obtain the agreed to wage which she would have to otherwise forgo at a significant personal cost. It is not surprising then that workers report they have been harassed or cheated. As Williamson has famously argued, once a party is in a relationship-specific situation where it is unable to recover any dues stemming from its investment of time or other assets if it does not continue to do business with the contracted party, there is the distinct possibility of a hold-up. The trading partner that causes the hold-up attempts to renegotiate the terms of the contract in order to extract some more of the surplus produced in that relationship so as to improve its returns from the relationship. Formally, we consider a static situation where potential employers and workers enter the market and negotiate an informal contract over the wage to be paid for the labour services per day and the number of hours per day during which work is to be performed by the worker. For simplicity, we focus on daily wage casual workers. Workers who work for n hours in the day produce an output given by the production function F(n), where the other factors of production that are complementary with labour have been suppressed as they are not central to what we want to focus on.Footnote 19 The employer also has to bear a fixed exogenous search cost \(\theta_{e}\) of bargaining and attempting to match workers with the job vacancy he currently has. These costs are the time costs of search for a worker and the negotiation and contracting costs that cannot be recovered and constitute a sunk cost. The profit to the employer from finalizing a work contract with the worker where he agrees to pay a wage of w is given by With \(\theta_{w}\) the sunk costs of the worker before she engages with the employer in the work bargain, the value to the worker of engaging in the work contract may be written as Here, \(c\left( n \right)\) is the cost to the worker of providing labour for n hours. We assume that \(c\left( n \right)\) is convex and that \(c^{\prime } \left( n \right) > 0\) and \(c^{{\prime \prime }} \left( n \right) > 0\). The employer and the worker determine the wage and the number of hours of work through bargaining. The solution to these is given by finding out the Nash bargaining solution which is written as In the above Nash bargain, the threat points have been set as zero to indicate that if the employer and worker do not agree to a contract then there is no employment relationship that is entered into. Also since \(\theta_{e}\) and \(\theta_{w}\) are sunk before the contract is finalized, they are not part of the bargain with respect to the wage and hours of work. The solution to the bargain is given by and From (3), it turns out that if workers have high bargaining power (\(\alpha = 0\)), then \(wn = F\left( n \right)\). From (1), this situation would result in a loss to the employer given by \(- \theta_{e}\). Analogously, the value to the worker of the employment contract is \(- \theta_{w}\) if employers have high bargaining power (\(\alpha = 1\)), and the worker will be better off being excluded from the labour market. The bargain results in a negotiated wage and hours of work that does not ensure the employer and/or worker will be recompensed for the ex ante search costs. The wage bargain in the casual labour market then may result in no trade taking place and this market is therefore ex ante not efficient. With regard to hours of work, both employers and workers are interested in maximizing the social surplus of the economy given by \(F\left( n \right) - c\left( n \right) - \theta_{e} - \theta_{w}\) as that expands the economic pie that can then be shared between them. Both employers and workers realize that without a positive n there will be no output and this in turn would mean no profit or wages. The value of n that maximizes the amount of output that can be shared between them through a bargain is given by Eq. (4), or, \(F^{\prime } \left( n \right) = c^{\prime } \left( n \right)\).",2

(Radwan 2002). This problem became even more serious since the cease of migration to the Gulf countries in 1991. The stabilization program adopted in the 1990s—in spite of being successful in macroeconomic terms—was not adequate in terms of job creation (Fergany 1998). Skilled people were trapped in low-wage jobs or were unemployed due to the low capacity of the economy to create jobs (Pissaridaes 1993). In recent years, the problem persisted: Even during periods (2007–2010) of high growth rates, the unemployment rate remained high (8.6 and 9%). Throughout the 1990s and until 2005, the Egyptian economy went through economic cycles, major structural changes, various shocks and several employment promotion plans. However, the unemployment rate persisted at excessive levels hovering between 8% and 11%. During the first half of the 1990s, economic reforms implemented by the government raised growth rates. However, the effect of that increased growth on employment was weak, and youth started facing high unemployment rates. In the early 2000s, unemployment deteriorated as economic growth stagnated (Hassan and Sassanpour 2008). From 2005 and as a result of the economic reform program implemented in 2004, investment and growth improved significantly. Meanwhile, the international economy offered additional help. The improvement in growth rates was reflected in higher overall employment. Between the end of 2004 and March 2008, new jobs increased by about 2.5 million and the unemployment rate—although still high—fell from 10.5% to around 8.7% (CAPMAS). Still, the problem of youth unemployment persisted. With the financial crises in 2008, the unemployment rate started to increase again and reached 9.4% in 2009. Starting from 2011 and after the 25 January revolution, an overall unemployment rate increased massively to reach 13.4% in 2014, while an unemployment rate among the youth reached 29%. This persistence of unemployment for a long period has caused many problems at both the economic and political fronts. Job creation is considered to be one of the key challenges facing Egypt in this concern (Ibrahim 2013). On the one side, this could be attributed to demography or to the supply side of labor. As the majority of Egypt’s population is youth, each year a big number of young individuals enter the labor market seeking first jobs. On the other side, it could be explained by insufficient labor demand. During the past period, the performance of the economy was imbalanced, but even when there was a high growth rate, it was not reflected in high job creation that can absorb those entering the labor market (Hassan and Sassanpour 2008). In this context, a major concern of the Egyptian economic policy in fighting unemployment is the factors that effect demand for labor and its growth (Ibrahim 2013). However, the review of the empirical literature for Egypt reveals that labor demand was an understudied subject, mainly due to the absence of required micro-data at the establishment level. Considering the importance of the unemployment problem in Egypt on the one hand and the scarcity of studies covering the subject in Egypt on the other hand, this paper attempts to investigate crucial questions of labor demand related to how do firms respond to changes in wages? And how does this respond to changes according to skill levels? This is reached through estimating the own-wage elasticities of demand for labor, and elasticities of substitution among different labor inputs disaggregated according to skill level in Egypt. Based on micro-establishment-level data obtained from Egypt Enterprise Survey 2008 conducted by the World Bank, though skill can be described by education level, the present study uses occupation to define skills. As such, it identifies four occupations: professionals, skilled production workers, unskilled production workers and non-production workers.Footnote 1 This paper is considered to be the first attempt to estimate labor demand functions for the Egyptian case at that level of disaggregation. Accordingly, it adds to the literature on Egypt in many ways. First, it looks at static labor demand, which provides significant intuitions into the labor market and serves quite well the objective of the study. Static labor demand theory permits studying long-run equilibrium in the labor market where the economy has fully responded to exogenous shocks (Hamermesh 1993; Lichter et al. 2012). Thus, it provides an appropriate framework to examine how the relative and absolute quantities of labor inputs and its types respond to exogenous changes in labor prices (Hamermesh 1993). Moreover, static labor demand theory enables studying the determinants of elasticities and provides insights into how different inputs can substitute others in the long run (Lichter et al. 2012). Second, another value added of the study to the available labor demand literature in Egypt is the use of firm-level data, hence analyzing labor demand at a micro-level. This is a point that is missing in the previous studies. Micro-data are advantageous in various aspects. It provides more accurate estimations for demand functions, enables considering factor as exogenous and allows accounting for unobserved heterogeneity (Fajnzylber and Maloney 2001). Hence, this study by making use of the Egypt Enterprise Survey conducted by the World Bank–which is an establishment-level data—offers the most possible reliable estimations. Third, a review of the international literature on static labor demand shows vast heterogeneity concerning the choice of the cost function used in the estimation and most importantly its specification. This study utilizes the translog cost function and constructs a framework that permits relatively robust results regarding the empirical specification. Moreover, results obtained by this paper can be useful for policies targeting labor demand as well as elevating poverty and reducing inequality. For instance, if the own-wage elasticity of unskilled labor is proved to be high, policies aiming at decreasing unemployment of that type of labor by increasing their real wage can instead decrease their demand and hence do not accomplish its objective. Similarly, if it is evident that demand for skilled workers is more inelastic, probable rises in skilled workers supply might be accompanied by severe drops in their wages.",3

During the years 2006 and 2012, the average expenditure of governments in Latin American countries on civil servants was 34%, while that in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries was 24% (World Bank 2016). In the Brazilian case, according to the National Treasury Department (2017a, b), combined spending on personnel has been increasing in recent years. With regard to employment, the public sector has greater weight in Nordic countries, since 30% of the workers are civil servants. Meanwhile, in Asia and Latin America, this percentage is only 10% (OECD 2013). In Brazil, according to data from the RAIS, on average, in the years 2008–2016, the public sector was composed of about 15% of formal workers. However, what attracts most attention from researchers is the significant and persistent wage difference between the sectors, where literature evidences salary advantages favorable to the public sector, although there is no consensus regarding the reasons for their existence. In this field, the main characteristics are related to institutional and social issues (Leontaridi 1998), as the functional logic and constraints of each sector; for example, the private sector seeks to maximize profits, while the public sector, social welfare (Ehrenberg and Schwarz 1986; Gregory and Borland 1999; Bender 1998). This wage dichotomy between the public and private sectors has also been confirmed in Brazil, and is associated with the segmentation of the market, positions with no counterpart in the private sector, and the way in which the salaries of public servants are adjusted (Brasil 2016; Barbosa and Barbosa Filho 2012, Vaz and Hoffmann 2007). This segmentation in the Brazilian labor market can be observed from the constitutional point of view, in that workers in both sectors are governed by different institutional norms. Public servants, in general, enjoy stable employment and full retirement provided for by the statutory regime.Footnote 1 Private-sector workers, on the other hand, do not enjoy such benefits. Moreover, private-sector workers are more vulnerable to macroeconomic volatility, given the instability of companies in the face of constant external shocks and the legislation that governs the labor law in this sector (Brasil 2016). This paper addresses the evolution of the public–private wage gap in the Brazilian formal labor market from 2008 to 2016. Given that there is a distinction among public servants themselves, we focus on the difference according to governmental spheres and powers. In addition, the public–private wage gap is analyzed from a sex, educational level, and municipal size perspective, but there is still no evidence for the country. Although the public–private wage gap is not the only or main cause to explain socioeconomic inequality in Brazil, studies on this subject are relevant from the point of view of efficiency and economic equity, as well as to understand the state’s capacity to generate socioeconomic inequalities. In addition, such studies contribute to the debate about the efficiency of services rendered by the state, since a significant portion of net current expenditure is dedicated to the payment of civil servants (Hartog and Oosterbeek 1993; Vaz and Hoffmann 2007; Silva and Rocha 2016; Brazil 2016; Tenoury and Menezes-Filho 2017). This study is divided into four sections, including the introduction above. The next section describes the methodology and data source used; the third section presents and discusses the results obtained by the regressions and the decomposition; and finally, the fourth section presents the final considerations.",2

Human capital formation is often considered as one of the ways through which there can be an interconnection between employment and development. For the purpose of translating an outmoded economy into a knowledge-driven one, investment in education is a must. An inclusive education system can be achieved when all the students from different socio-economic backgrounds have access to quality education which could diversify their talents and creativity. Moreover, equal access to education is increasingly viewed as a basic duty of a progressive government and mature society (George 2011). India is one of the world’s fastest growing economies, but one of the biggest hurdles in its development process is unemployment, which is largely attributed to the present education system. Against this background, this paper tries to examine the interlinkage between human development, economic growth and employment in India with special reference to females in Kerala. Kerala makes an interesting case study through its extraordinary performance in socio-economic indicators along with a very high rate of unemployment. This paper has been developed with the purpose of analysing the reasons behind such a high rate of unemployment, especially among females in the state. “Kerala model of development,” on the basis of its impressive historical accomplishment in social and human development indicators, is generally regarded as the pathway model for other developing economies (UN-DESA 1975). Human capital and employment are closely linked, which directly or indirectly relates to high economic growth. The demand and supply of education is highly influenced by the growth of the economy. The nature and extent of demand for higher education is directly related to the nature and extent of employment opportunity, which again depends on the overall health of the economy. During periods of unemployment, individuals show strong preferences for those courses which offer better employment prospects. Hence, an important question arises as to how does the labour market respond to education. This paper is prepared by placing an important emphasis on this linkage. The foremost objective of the paper is to establish a linkage between education, employment and economic growth. Secondly, the objective was to identify the gaps in the demand and supply in employment, especially with reference to Kerala. Thirdly, we have tried to explore the reasons behind such a high rate of unemployment among females in Kerala despite the fact that it has outnumbered each state in India in terms of education.",3
62,4,The Indian Journal of Labour Economics,22 November 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41027-019-00198-1,Short-Term Migration and Children’s School Attendance: Evidence from Rural India,December 2019,Leena Bhattacharya,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"A conservative global estimate on internal migration suggests that about 762 million people move internally within their respective countries, with a large proportion of them being classified as circular, seasonal or short-term migrants (Global Migration Group 2017). Taking into consideration the heterogeneity in migration, circular or short-term migration poses the biggest challenge for educating children (UNESCO 2019). China and India, the two most populous countries in the world, have the highest share of internal migrants. While national policies in China are not conducive to internal mobility of migrants and their family members, the Constitution of India permits free mobility within the country.Footnote 1 Restricted mobility in respective countries affects internal migrants and their household members, especially the children from these families. In China, children who migrate with their parents have been found facing difficulty in attaining education at the destination. Hence, it is common for the migrants to leave their children behind with alternate caregivers. The left-behind children in China are found to have a lesser educational attainment (Chang et al. 2011; Li et al. 2017). In India too, field-based studies and qualitative evidence have shown that children from households with seasonal migrants face educational disadvantages (Coffey 2013; Mosse et al. 2005; Rogaly 1998; Rogaly et al. 2001). There are various channels through which parental migration can affect educational attainment of children. The left-behind children might need to take up additional work to substitute for their parents’ absence, leaving them with lesser time to devote to education (Chang et al. 2011; Hanson and Woodruff 2003). Moreover, their schooling outcomes might suffer due to the lack of parental supervision. In case children migrate with their parents, their chances of getting admitted to a school at the destination area can be difficult (Coffey 2013; Liang and Chen 2007; Smita 2008; Srivastava and Sutradhar 2016). There is also a branch of literature which suggests that remittances earned from migration can ease liquidity constraints and improve schooling years of children (Hanson and Woodruff 2003). The remittance channel, however, is more likely to hold in the case of international migration. Since it differs from the context of internal short-term migration in India by a large extent, this channel will not be considered in this paper. This study uses data from Situation Assessment Survey (SAS) conducted in India by National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) in 2013. The data are used to examine whether or not children from families with short-term migrants have lower school attendance in rural India. The existing literature in this context is field based and provides qualitative evidence for certain geographical areas. This study covers a broader sample for analysis and provides a quantifiable relationship between migration and education. SAS data were collected in 2013, which correspond to 3 years after the implementation of Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (henceforth RTE) Act.Footnote 2 RTE made elementary education free and compulsory for all children in the age group of 6–14 years and specifically recognised the difficulty in educating the hard-to-reach children. The Act mentions that it is the duty of the local government to ensure that children from migrant families are admitted to school. Among the recent studies on national policies in India, Chatterjee et al. (2018) find an improvement in enrolment of children in primary classes over the years 2005–2011 using an alternate data source.Footnote 3 An increase in enrolment might miss out on the phenomenon of high enrolment yet low attendance in schools, a common occurrence in the case of internal circular migration in India (Srivastava and Dasgupta 2010). Hence, in this study, we focus on the current attendance of children in primary schools rather than their enrolment status. This study uses data at a point where states in India had already formed their respective state rules to implement RTE (Government of India 2014a). Hence, one could hypothesise an insignificant impact of short-term migration on school attendance of children. Contrary to the expectations, results show that the presence of a short-term migrant in the family has a significant negative effect on educational attainment of children in primary classes. An estimate from logit regression suggests that controlling for individual and family characteristics, village, district and NSSO state-region fixed effects, having a migrant member in the family reduces the probability that a child aged 6–10 years attends school by 15%. A couple of robustness checks are done to ascertain the reliability of the main findings of this paper. First, we assess the threat to results caused by potential bias from unobservable factors by using the methodology developed by Oster (2019). Second, we check the reliability of the finding by using the instrumental variable approach. The presence of a short-term migrant in the family is instrumented by lagged proportion of short-term migrants in the district and lagged proportion of construction workers in the district. We use different methods of district concordance to test the reliability of our results. The results remain unchanged. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses in the rationale of this study in the context of the existing literature, and Sect. 3 provides the factual background in terms of relevant descriptive statistics. Section 4 describes the data and empirical methodology. Section 5 presents the results and robustness checks. The conclusions are presented in Sect. 6.",3
62,4,The Indian Journal of Labour Economics,30 October 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41027-019-00185-6,Contribution of the Unpaid Family Labour in the Handloom Sector of Textile Industry in West Bengal,December 2019,Sonali Chakraborty,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"There exists a strict division between work, paid work and unpaid work, where paid work strictly falls within the market realm of production, while unpaid work can be of both natures within the market and within the household domain (Mazumdar 2008). The under/un-remunerative works are not included in the national income, and workers performing such works are not included in the labour force. The information or data on labour force and national income are mainly collected from the issues which are productive, marketable and welfare enjoyed by the people. According to System of National Account (SNA) 1993 and National Income Account 1998, the unpaid services are defined for those who are excluded from SNA boundary but included in other general production boundary. Usually, a person who works without pay in an economic enterprise operated by a related person living in the same household is defined as an unpaid family worker. He holds a self-employed status in a market-oriented establishment operated by a related person living in the same household, who cannot be regarded as a partner, because his degree of commitment to the operation of the establishment, in terms of ‘time’ and other factors to be determined by national circumstances, is done at level comparable to that of the head of the establishment (International Classification of Status in Employment, 15th International Conference on Labour Statistics 1993). 
Very recently, there is a growing realization that valuation of unpaid works are equally important for human welfare (Indira 2007). Her approaches towards time use survey are one such method that could be captured to Estimate the time spent on unpaid work of men and women and Estimate the time and value of the domestic work. Unpaid work is to some extent related to countries’ development level. The time data can provide how the time spent by the women/men within the household and how the women is overburdened. The regular collection of time use data gives a tremendous value to the government agencies to monitor and design public policies and give a more balanced view of well-being across different societies (Indira 2007). OECD countries took the time use surveys as a technique to provide such information. After investigating the detailed study of time use surveys conducted by 26 OECD countries, Veerle Miranda (2011) suggested that between one-third and half of all valuable economic activities in the countries is not accounted for the traditional measure of well-being, such as GDP or per-capita income. In our country, very little emphasis has been given to such types of surveys. Some micro-level investigation has been performed in this context. The study by Jain and Chand in Rajasthan and West Bengal (1982) showed that the time spent by the women in economic activities is more as shown by the Census or NSSO. Beena Gorge (2009) did a survey in Nagpur as urban components and Jhalap village in Chhattisgarh in objective to measure the average time spent on paid, unpaid works by the females, gender difference in terms of leisure time. They shed light on the economic activities through their unpaid works. Women typically work 16 h per day on both paid and unpaid labour; most women have no leisure time; Women bear the greatest responsibility for household chores, including many tasks related to income generation; Most women, even if they have a servant, do their own cooking; Women generally assume full responsibility for tutoring and helping children with school work; Rural women perform a wider variety of tasks than urban women do; While both men and women recognize that women’s household activities constitute important work, they fail to grasp the extent of its economic value; The value of unpaid household work performed by women throughout India is upwards of 612.8 billion US dollars per year, depending on the economic value assigned to the tasks women perform daily. In India, once ever conducted a pilot study on ‘Time use survey’ by Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) in the year 1998–1999 covered 18,591 households in six selected major states, of which 68% is rural household and 32% urban household. From the time use survey, it is noted that 57.11% men and women are engaged in unpaid SNA activities and they spent 38.29% of their time on unpaid SNA works. Thus, unpaid works are significant in our country also. Comparing the estimated Workforce Participation Rates (WPRs) (Table 2) calculated from the time use survey and the labour force survey of the National Sample Survey Organization, it is observed that the WPRs based on the time use data are higher than the WPRs based on the NSSO data for both rural and urban areas and for men and women. The male WPRs based on time use survey are 63.26 and 59.29 for rural and urban areas, respectively, as against 51.00 and 50.90 WPRs as per the NSSO data. In the case of women, the gaps between the two sets of rates are much bigger. The WPRs for women as per the time use data are 58.20 and 30.90 for rural and urban areas, respectively, as against 25.30 and 12.80 WPRs as per the NSSO data (Indira 2007). It is clear that the time use survey has been able to capture better estimates of the workforce in the country. The major findings pointed out that there exists a high level of participation of both male and female in extended SNA activities, which leads to support the existence of high level of unpaid family workers and own-account workers in the country. The gross underestimation of WPR also signals the unpaid workforce holding a sizeable share of the economy. The main feature of the Indian economy is characterized by very-low-level work participation of female and has always shown a disappointing result since the early 1970s. Still female labour force participation in India is typically low (around 22.5%, NSS 2011 and 25% according to Census 2011) than that of other OECD countries as well as developing countries. The female LFPR is 40.8% in world and 40.3% in developing countries (Sundaram 2007, streeshakti@hotmail.com). The LFPR (labour force participation rate) for female had been drastically lowered down from 2005 to 2010. It had declined 25% to 20.8% for rural females and from 14.9 to 12.8% for urban females from 2004–2005 to 2009–2010 (NSS 66th round). Not only the LFPR for women is low and constant, most of the jobs that the women are performing are marginal or unpaid family jobs. They contribute a significant economic share within the household but remain unrecognized. Lack of data on all types of female work also makes a significant share of them invisible in the labour force. Women’s participation in the paid economy is influenced by the interplay of some cultural or societal norms also. Female participation is often regulated by those norms in the labour market. It is factual that all the women welfare policies emphasize on greater participation of women in the labour force, higher earnings and education, without paying sufficient heed to the restraint imposed by unpaid work or the benefits rendered by such work. The idea of domesticity and values deemed appropriate for women have made a substantial contribution by women in the form of her unpaid work as underestimated, unrecognized and unvalued, placing women in a position with very limited bargaining capacity within the democracies of domestic power relations. In terms of total unpaid work which includes the unpaid contribution as family help along with domestic and extra domestic activities, women shared 85.99% of total unpaid work, while men contributed only 14.01% in 2019–2010, while in terms of paid work sharing men contributed 80% and women 20% (On Work Without Pay 2013, file:///I:/unpaid%20worker/On%20work%20without%20pay.pdf). Even when working within the system of market activities for which she is hardly paid or understood as an unpaid family contributor (Olsen and Mehta 2006; Mazumdar 2008; Mazumdar and Neetha 2011), not only the majority of her labour within the household realm is unpaid, but also a considerable fraction of her productive contribution is in addition not esteemed. Her unpaid work acts as partial and ignored in the economic growth path. Thus, labour market segmentation, unemployment, wage differentials and labour force participation all are well-investigated subjects, but the unpaid family work has received less attention in the labour force study. The per cent of the female work force that works as unpaid labour is a matter of some debate. The unpaid female workers accounted for 72% during the year 2004–2005 and 68% in the year 2009–2010 (Ray and Mukherjee 2013). The rural self-employment consists of three-fourth of female unpaid workers, while in urban the percentage is about 43 in the 2007–2008 as obtained from NSS data (Mazumdar and Neetha 2011). Nevertheless, NSS has marked the unpaid family labour under the subgroup of self-employed (SE) category. In the case of a family farm, or firm, it is the case that more often than not, the male gets classified as an own-account worker and the female as ‘unpaid family worker’. A large section of workers concealed within the aggregate figures of self-employment are unpaid family workers/helpers that are mostly female. They do not receive any independent payment/income but contribute their labour to the production. They are overwhelmingly concentrated in household-based manufacturing, where they often serve as unpaid family labour, such as dairying, fisheries, small animal husbandry, handlooms, handicrafts and sericulture. Particularly, handloom industry is largely depending on the unpaid family workers who are mainly female. As an economic activity, handloom industry is the largest cottage industry in West Bengal and it provides employments in a large number (7.8 lakhs, handloom Census 2009–2010) next to agriculture (Directorate of Textile, Government of West Bengal, 2009–2010). The existence and role of unpaid family workers, especially the active participation of female in pre-loom and post-loom activities, are undoubtedly prevalent, and they are the economic assets of weaver households (Reddy 2010). The whole industry is sustaining with the support of female members of the family. Hence, female earnings are included in the net income of the family which are often not marked as their individual income. This situation undermines their role as an earner in the family, curbing economic independence and social status, limiting their mobility physically and in all economic aspects. As a result, they suffer from gender discrimination in the allocation of resources within the household, in spite of their considerable labour and often cash contributions. This certainly goes against the government issues and policies for the development of women’s economic independence and empowerment. It is therefore essential to have an understanding of the situation of unpaid family workers. Here is an attempt to access the women’s unpaid work within the production realm, where the works they perform remain unnoticed. It is also important to assess the extent of their contribution in the productivity sector although not affecting the family income directly. In this understanding, it is very much relevant to get the share of income of these unpaid female workers to the aggregate income of their respective families. The economic participation does not necessarily improve women’s status; it may do so but only under specific circumstances where they have control over earnings and feel the right to greater consumption. Hence, it is important to evaluate the full extent of their contribution in the productivity sector in terms of time and share of income to the aggregate income of their respective families. The main objectives of this analysis were To find out the proportion of unpaid workers among total workers in weaving and allied works. To find out the share of income of the unpaid workers in the total income of the household from weaving and allied works. To find out the time spent on different unpaid activities, viz. handloom-related works. To find out the association, if any, between unpaid work and factors like household size, number of children, number of female, amount of debt and some other socio-economic factors. The secondary source of data regarding unpaid workers is available from various rounds of employment and unemployment surveys conducted by NSSO. But these surveys do not provide any information about an individual’s earning and time spent by those who are falling under the activity status of self-employment. Neither the handloom census (2009–2010) conducted by the Ministry of Textile, GOI, nor the Directorate of Textile of the state government provides data on unpaid family workers. In this backdrop, a pilot survey was done to study the above-said objectives. The pre-loom and post-loom activities of the main weaving process are mainly done by unpaid female, children and aged family members. The study had been carried out in the main handloom hubs like Shantipur and Fulia in Nadia District of West Bengal. Shantipur, the oldest Handloom Hub in West Bengal and having the largest handloom hubs in the country (a cluster having more than 5000 handlooms concentrated has been selected in Handloom Cluster Development project) of more than 70,000 handlooms in one concentric geographical region, generates employment for more than 0.1 million people. About 80% of local population is directly or indirectly dependent on handloom industry. It is the only reputed hub in the country working on finer variety of sarees and dress materials of 100s, 80s, (A measurement of concentration of weaving) etc. The Shantipur Handloom cluster’s total turnover is 250 crores. This is one of the highest turnovers of existing Indian Handloom Cluster. Among them, 65 crores are export turnover (Mapdar 2012). Shantipur handloom hubs include municipal area of Shantipur and Gram Panchayat of Fulia. Fulia geographically consists of Sukpukuria—58, Belgoria—57, Fulia Township and Buincha—70 mouzas of Shantipur block of Nadia District. At present, according to Census 2011, Sukpukuria—58, Belgoria—57, Fulia Township and Buincha—70 mouzas—are joined together and named ‘Phulia’ as a Census Town. This area is located in the south-eastern part of the Shantipur block. List of handloom activities covered Sizing Pirn winding Spool winding Warping and beaming Drafting and denting Setting up of Jacquard Weaving Post-loom activities: calendaring and wrapping. Unpaid family workers may be grouped into the following groups: Children (of age ≤ 14 years)—some amount of child labour is involved in handloom industry in the form of unpaid work. Elderly members (aged ≥ 60 years)—it is also a matter of socio-economic interest to study the extent of involvement of aged persons in economic activity, what proportion of their engagement is as unpaid household workers, the share they contribute in family earning, etc. Household members mainly involved in other activities other than domestic works, doing nominal unpaid works. Housewives and other members doing a substantial amount of unpaid works of handloom industry—it is important to estimate the (imputed) earning of these unpaid household workers. Income data were collected in the following ways. In the identification block, two questions were set up. What was the monthly income of the household from all sources? What was the monthly income from handloom and its allied works? Data of income were separately collected from the individuals who are paid workers and who are unpaid workers in each family, engaged in weaving and allied activities. The terminology ‘paid worker’ includes both self-employed persons and weaving labourers in this survey. Income data for unpaid workers were collected by the imputation of payment for the volume of work done per week by each individual of a household. The imputed income was computed taking the local market price of each work (yarning/pirn winding/wrapping and beaming/weaving/calendaring/drafting and denting, etc.) during the survey week. Suppose a person performs yarning and his/her volume of work is 70 mora (unit of yarning as per local market) per week, then his/her weekly earning was Rs. 350 (taking the market price of yarning of per mora as Rs. 5). In this way, income of all the activities was calculated. Then, a cross-check had been done with the income stated in the identification block. Classification of unpaid workers: The paid and unpaid workers were differentiated through putting the question whether the individual has control over the money or not. Those who did not have control over the money earned at household level for their work are marked as unpaid workers. On the other hand, who had control over the money against their labour are considered as paid workers. The population for this study was the people who were engaged in weaving and allied work in some selected pockets of Shantipur and Fulia with concentration of weaving establishment as observed from 5th Economic Census. Data of Economic Census had been used to locate the area with high concentration of weaving establishments. The unit-level data of Economic Census (EC) provides 4-digit NIC (National Industrial Classification): Following codes were considered here: Preparation and spinning of textile fibre including weaving of textile (khadi/handloom) Finishing of textile. A sample of 378 weaver households was selected from these populations by multistage sampling. It was a multistage stratified sampling procedure. In this survey, weaver households mean the households who were carrying out any of the activities mentioned above. In the urban sector, UFS (Urban Frame Survey) blocks and, in the rural sector, villages were considered as first-stage units (FSUs). FSUs were selected by PPS, size being the number of weaver households. Weaver households, who were carrying out any of the weaving activities, were considered as second-stage units. Allocation of the samples. The sample size in each of the locations was proportionately allocated according to the number of weaver households of that locality. Listing of the weaver households was done in selected UFS blocks to prepare the frame for selection of weaver households. Weaver households of each selected UFS block were divided into two second-stage strata: (1) Households having handloom and (2) Households not having any handloom. In the second stage, from each stratum proportionate households were selected. In the village, listing of the households was done in the whole village. The total number of parts or the sample parts was depending on the number of weaver households size and the number of sample households covered in that village. From unit-level data of Economic Census, it was found that there are 8775 rural households in Shantipur panchayat who were engaged in handloom work or handloom-related works. In Shantipur township, there were 6271 numbers of households and 2079 numbers of households in Fulia township. There were 33 UFS blocks in Fulia township. From among 33 UFS blocks, 5 UFS blocks were chosen. The maps of the UFS were purchased from FOD (Field Organization Division) regional office, Burdwan. In the urban section of Shantipur, similar way was adopted and 8 UFS blocks were chosen from 35 UFS blocks. From each selected UFS block, the number of households was selected by PPS. Listing of the weaver households was made in selected UFS blocks to prepare the frame for the selection of weaver households. Forty households from Fulia and 60 from Shantipur municipal area were selected by circular systematic sampling procedure. Five rural villages, namely Ghoralia, Belghoria, Haripur, Nrisinghapur and Chatkatala, were selected by PPS from the total list of villages according to the size of the weaver households. Listing of the total number of households in each selected village had been done. From this list of households, each household was selected by circular systematic sampling procedure. Preliminary observation focused from Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. Households surveyed are mainly from Hindu household (90%). By social group classification, it is seen that a majority of the households are SC (40%) and general class (38%). Above 95% households are residing in their own house, which is mainly ‘mixed type’ or kachha. About 55% households declared to bear a burden of loan. Banks and self-help group are the main sources of providing loan. Household size of 4 to 5, i.e. nuclear family pattern, is observed among surveyed weaver household. A sharp distinction of job segmentation has been focused among the male and female members of the households. Males are mainly engaged in weaving, while females are doing the pre-loom activities like pirn winding and spool winding and sometimes ‘Guti pakano’ which are termed as allied works, of the finished products. The females are doing these jobs, which are brought to them by the male members or the head of the household of their family. The male members take these job contracts from local ‘Mahajan’ or cooperatives and engage the female hands of the family who do the jobs and are not paid individually. The payment is received mainly by the male members. Though maximum workers are in the age group of 26 to 59 years, a good-sized old-age people also engage in the handloom and allied works. The unpaid workers constitute 91% of female and only 9% male, while in the paid works, 78% are male and 22% are female. From among unpaid female workers, 82% are from Hindu communities, 8% from Islam and the rest from others (Table 14). The lion share of the unpaid female workers has education up to primary or secondary level. Thus, educational backwardness is one main reason to involve themselves in the unpaid works, to support the family otherwise.
 Among the unpaid female labour, 39% are from general caste and the rest are from SC and OBC. In paid work, female labour are mainly from SC, while males are mainly from general caste (Table 13). Most of the allied handloom works are done by the female workers. A very small number of weavers do possess their own looms. Only 27% workers doing handloom works, receiving wages, have their own loom, and around 59% do not have a loom and they are working on other’s loom (Table 16). The emergence of power looms and rising cost of cotton threads bring great threats in the handloom industries. It becomes a challenge to cope up with the present situation and to stay with handloom products. As a result, shifting of occupation and gradual decrease in number of looms are an obvious phenomenon. Maximum (70%) female workers of age group 26–59 are engaged as unpaid family workers (Table 17). In the paid works, it is also noticed that maximum workers (80%) are in this age group (Table 18). This is a welcome feature that female children are not used here as cheap hands. Unpaid female workers are mostly married, having family, and only 8% females are widow (Table 19). Widow/separated female workers represent a moderate share in a paid job (Table 20). Age-specific distribution of both paid and unpaid workers shows that maximum proportion of labour involved are in the age of 25–59. The share of unpaid female is higher than male who are contributing more than 50% income to the total income generated from the handloom sector (Table 21). Within sex distribution shows that female share is lower than male who are contributing less than 10% to the total income from the handloom sector (Table 22). 33% of unpaid workers contribute 11–25% share to the total income from the handloom sector (Table 21), and 26% of unpaid female contribute more than 50% to the total income generated from the handloom sector, while the percentage point of male for this is 16 (Table 22). So unpaid female labour are contributing a commendable share to the total income generated from the handloom sector in the family. Her valuation as a productive worker remains hidden. Our society does not allow the ‘time’ resource to be distributed equally among the people due to its structural difference, social relations, taboos and many interrelated associated factors and thus becomes a key issue in gender study. From the above two graphs, it is clear that time spent on paid and unpaid works by male and female workers differs highly. The females are spending 77% of total working time in performing unpaid job, while it is only 7% point for the males. To observe the inequalities in the distribution of time allocation at individual level (women and men separately), the Lorenz curve of concentration had been computed. Though it is obvious that women and men spent quite different time in paid and unpaid work, by using the Lorenz curve, we can capture the relative inequality present within each group. From the above two graphs, it is observed that women form a more heterogeneous group than men when time spent in paid jobs is concerned and Gini coefficient of this group is 0.6, while Gini coefficient for men is 0.12. The Lorenz curve for paid work shows that 50% of women spent 10% of their total time for paid work, whereas the share for unpaid work is about 35%. In the unpaid work, the relative difference is small and Gini coefficient for the female and male is 0.2 and 0.3, respectively. An individual to be paid or unpaid as a family labour depends on some socio-economic variables; using logistic regression analysis, this effect has been detected. The dependent variable is the occupational status of an individual, i.e. he/she is paid or unpaid while working as a family labour. The independent variables are household size, sex, marital status, educational attainment, having bank account, relation to the head of the family, religion, social group, occupation age, dwellings, etc. From Table 23 the following results are noted.",1

It is well known that migration takes place on account of social, economic and political factors involving the lives of individuals and their families and their complex socio-economic backgrounds. When viewed in the context of rural–urban migration, this movement has far-reaching social implications in transforming the nature and character of urbanization. The migrants not only move into the city but also bring along with them their culture, style of life, values, and so on and so forth. It is essential to analyse migration not just quantitatively but comprehensively in order to alleviate crucial human development, social, economic and spatial problems (Goswami 2013). The study in discussion traces the reasons for migration from Barpeta in Lower Assam to Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh. It is important to mention that the Assam economy is predominantly based on rural life with 70 per cent of the population dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. Out of the 78,438 km2 of the geographical area of Assam, 98.4 per cent area is rural with 86 per cent of the total population living in the rural areas. Assam is situated in the high rainfall zone with an average annual rainfall of 2297.4 mm (Economic Survey, Assam 2016–2017). Brahmaputra, the main river along with its tributaries, creates havoc in the state every year. Flood and erosion are two main natural disasters being faced by the state, and the Barpeta district is no exception to these twin characteristics of being an agrarian land and prone to river erosion. In addition to these climatic impediments, the poor illiterate people in district Barpeta face another hardship. Due to similarity in culture and language with their border counterparts, most of them are usually perceived as illegal immigrants entering Assam from bordering Bangladesh and are called Bangladeshis in and outside Assam. This adds to their struggle of proving their identity, establishing citizenship and eventually the tussle for livelihood. Along with this struggle due to their illiteracy and being unskilled, the avenues for employment in the source and destination areas get restricted, and in most of the cases, these people choose other modes of livelihood. These difficulties in their homeland many a time compel them to migrate in search of better opportunities for survival elsewhere, leading them to settle in many parts of northern India, Lucknow being one of them. In Lucknow ever since their migration, these migrants have indulged in waste picking as one of the modes of earning their livelihood, which they refer to as working in the ‘plastic industry’ back home. They live in deplorable slums in various parts of Lucknow in the absence of facilities for housing and also struggle with the new language, culture and environment. Given this backdrop, the purpose of this paper is to know the reasons and background of migration of approximately more than 90,000 people (Vigyan FoundationFootnote 1 2017–2018) who have been migrating from Barpeta to Lucknow for more than last two decades. The unique feature of this migration is that all the migrants claim to have hailed from only one place: the Barpeta road which is the railway station of the Barpeta district. All are Bengali Muslims (of East Bengal origin) coming from Lower Assam who are called Miya Muslims (Misra 2018). Since not much academic research has been conducted on this type of interstate migration, our study in discussion is a pioneer attempt to find out the reasons for long-distance rural–urban migration about this marginalized community who had been agriculturalists by occupation but, due to their problems in native villages, are forced to shift from their ancestral occupation, landing into an informal system of waste picking. This paper is organized in the following manner. The first section is the Introduction followed by Data and Methods in the second section. In the third section, Hypotheses Formulation is given. The fourth and fifth sections of the paper, respectively, deal with Observations from the Field and Analysis and Discussion related to the findings. The sixth and the last section of the paper is the Conclusion.",2

First, it is important to make a conceptual distinction between labour force participation/employment and sustainable livelihoods. Second, we need to distinguish between participating in decision-making within family enterprises and autonomously managing non-family enterprises. Third, it is necessary to distinguish between workers as atomised individuals competing in labour markets for the benefit of a few, and workers as people who can potentially cooperate in collectives for the benefit of the many. The three aspects are interconnected, as is illustrated here for the agricultural sector. Employment versus livelihoods  Today, most debates on the working population tend to focus on jobs and labour force participation rates rather than on viable livelihoods. This is true even of feminist economics research on India where few issues have received more attention in recent years than women’s falling labour force participation rate.Footnote 1 This overwhelming attention to labour force participation makes invisible the raison d’être for which most people work, namely achieving decent livelihoods. For this purpose, rural informal sector workers—male and female—often have mixed portfolios, working not just on their own farms but also doing agricultural wage work seasonally, or taking up non-farm jobs. This is even more true of households which survive on multiple income sources, some members farming, others migrating to cities for jobs, yet others working on government projects, or being self-employed. A focus only on labour force participation cannot capture a household’s vulnerability to poverty nor its livelihood potential and diversity. Second, labour force participation alone does not capture labour productivity issues which are important and linked to efficiency, skill development, access to new technology, and so on. Third, a preoccupation with labour force participation rates limits the nature of data gathered and the analysis undertaken. There is perhaps too much dependence on the National Sample Survey (NSS) and other labour force data. Each new round of the NSS, for example, is followed by criticism of the data’s inability to fully capture women’s work. In fact, I wrote about the undercounting of women workers in the census and NSS some 35 years ago (Agarwal 1985). Yet we are still talking about many of the same issues! At the same time, India lacks the kind of Living Standards and Measurement Surveys conducted by the World Bank in many countries. The Indian Human Development Survey (IHDS), conducted by the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) and the University of Maryland, comes close, but has its own limitations. Is it lack of data which prevents more focus on livelihoods, or is it a neglect of a livelihood perspective which explains the limited data available? Autonomy  The second complex issue is that of women’s autonomy. Within rural family enterprises, women are typically embedded as unpaid workers with little autonomy. Efforts to capture their participation in household decision-making barely scrape the surface in terms of measuring this dimension. What matters is not simply women’s ability to have a say in decisions relating to a family enterprise (be it a farm or a shop), but also their ability to work, to earn and to control their earnings independent of the family enterprise. It is outside-family options which tend to have the most impact on intra-household bargaining power (Agarwal 1997). This is not very different from the way labour markets operate, where an alternative job offer can significantly increase a person’s bargaining power with a current employer. Collectivity  The third issue is the continued focus on workers as individuals and not enough on the institutions within which they work, as Gerry Rodgers also pointed out in his Presidential address (Rodgers 2020, this volume). And a key institutional form is the collective, which (as noted earlier) Dr. V.V. Giri was also keenly interested in. Of course collectives can take many forms, trade unions are only one. Associations, group enterprises and micro-credit groups are all collectives. The Self-Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) in India is an important example, as are Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and their federations. There is a widespread belief in civil society that collectives are essential for women’s social empowerment—yet, with some exceptions such as SEWA, this belief rarely extends to economic empowerment. Hence, in our discussions on work in India today, we hear rather little about workers’ collectives. This needs to change. In fact, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) website contains information of many collectives under the rubric of the Social and Solidarity Economy (SSE), which recognises the role of collectives in creating decent work. While the idea of an SSE is still evolving, there is agreement that it covers various forms of citizens’ associations (social movements, SHGs, etc.) which cooperate for production and exchange in inclusive ways and interact with the State and markets through or on behalf of citizens. So how do we bring these three ideas—livelihoods, autonomy and collectivity—together, in relation to women’s work and their economic empowerment? In fact, they come together beautifully and effectively in women farmers’ collectives which I have been researching for several years.",1
63,1,The Indian Journal of Labour Economics,21 March 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41027-020-00208-7,Is Rising Inequality Unavoidable in a Globalizing Economy Characterized by Rapid Technical Change?,March 2020,Giovanni Andrea Cornia,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"After several decades of decline and relative stability in the advanced economies, income inequality started rising in many countries following the oil shocks of 1973–1978 and the 1982–1984 world recession. To respond to such shocks, many countries adopted restrictive stabilization policies inspired by the Washington Consensus (WC). Given the intensity of the recession triggered by these measures and by the accompanying structural adjustment programs (SAP), there was a strong impact on the real economy and income distribution. As a result, since the late 1970s, inequality rose for two decades (Table 1) due to the inability of WC and Augmented Washington Consensus (AWC) to promote an equitable growth, or any kind of growth. A renewed interest for inequality emerged in the mid–late 1990s (Atkinson 1997). Several factors led to this change in attitude. To start with, a number of evermore frequent and reliable household surveys documented for the first time in history the levels and trends in income inequality in many countries. This permitted to assess in detail the distributional effects of the crises mentioned above and the spread of globalization. Third, the emphasis placed by international initiatives, such as the MDGs and SDGs, on poverty eradication and the reduction in inequality to tolerable levels further stimulated data collection and policy analysis in this area. Finally, advances in economic theory (see, for instance, Klasen et al. 2018) emphasized the deleterious effects of high and rising inequality on growth, social well-being, national cohesion, and political stability. These new studies showed that inequality often rose during the decades of the 1980s and 1990s. As a result, as noted by Atkinson (2004), there has been also a spread of the perception that ‘There is [now]a widespread belief held that rising inequality in inevitable [as it is]……the results of forces [such as technical change and globalization] over which we have no control …. Policy can make little difference.’ In the daily debate, it has thus become common to argue that ‘the poor are getting poorer and the rich are getting richer). The OECD (2008) study ‘Growing unequal?’ and Piketty (2014) book—both focusing on the advanced countries—likely contributed to the spread of this perception.
 Yet, the empirical evidence for the last four decades points to a more articulated picture than suggested by the view of a universal and unavoidable rise in inequality. True, inequality rose over 1980–2000 in over two-thirds of the countries with time series data of the Gini coefficient (Table 1). But this inequality jump occurred during the years of the 1982–1984 world recession, of the global debt crisis, spread of globalization and transition to the market economy of the former communist countries of Europe and Asia. Inequality increased also on occasion of the financial crises recorded in financially globalized Argentina, Turkey, and Thailand. Yet, the widespread increase in inequality recorded in the 1980s and 1990s was followed by a divergence in trends between the early 2000s and 2017. Since the 2000s Latin America, parts of sub-Saharan Africa and a few countries in Southeast Asia experienced a drop in inequality. Indeed, of the 107 countries for which it was possible to compile time series of the Gini index of the distribution of disposable income or private consumption, 47% recorded a decline in inequality and 41% an increase (Table 1).
 Given this divergence in trends, this paper intends to analyze the political and policy changes that have led to an unprecedented decline of income inequality in 15 out of 18 countries in Latin America (LA) over 2002–2015 and in 17 countries out of 29 in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Before doing so, Part 2 reviews the inequality changes that have occurred over the last three decades in all main regions (LA and SSA that are discussed in detail in Part 3). Such section shows that the within-country inequality dynamics is quite heterogeneous, and that inequality can decline even during the period of globalization and rapid technical change, if the right policies are introduced.",

The intergroup inequality arises due to many factors, but the most prevalent reason among them is caste segregation. Historically, the caste system was designed on the basis of occupational abilities. With time, however, this system became hereditary and emerged to be discriminatory and a tool of not just segregation but also physical and mental subjugation of Dalits and native Tribes. The lowest castes (the Harijans) occupied the lowliest jobs such as sweepers and manual scavengers. The religious notion of untouchability separated the Harijans from the main body of the Hindus. ‘The Harijans normally could not use the public well in the village nor enter the shops and houses of higher castes, nor attend school, nor take part in religious services, nor attend village festivals; they lived separately from other castes’ (Banerjee and Knight 1985). This segregation has affected the lower caste both socially and economically. Even in modern India, this discrimination persists unabated in the form of wage discrimination, unequal opportunities to the lower castes and differential treatment at the workplace. Reservation policy was implemented for the social, economic and educational upliftment of the socially excluded backward classes by providing equal opportunities. However, even after decades of its implementation, there still remains a significant gap between the reserved and unreserved populations with respect to not only their standard of living but also their access to equal opportunities. The historically privileged classes still prosper in all the spheres of life, but the same thing does not apply for backward classes despite the affirmative action. In the labour market, the reservation policy has been able to reduce the gap by some extent. A majority of the population, however, works in private sector, and the perception that private sector does not discriminate and recruits only on the basis of merit is not even remotely reflected in the ground realities. In an attempt to unpack some of these misconceptions, this paper shows the disparity in wages among different social groups using the Blinder–Oaxaca decomposition to prove that the wage differences are because of discrimination. The data used for the paper would be the unit-level data from the 68th round of National Sample Survey, 10th Schedule, 2011–2012.",5

Hauk,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"As more and more countries open up to trade, researchers are getting increasingly interested on the economic impacts of growing international integration on the countries around the world. One of the economic impacts that have attracted considerable attention of researchers over the past few decades is the effects of international trade on the labour market. The chief objective behind such studies is the determination of relative gainers and losers from liberalization and ultimately discerning the evolution of earnings inequality in the liberalized nations. Some of this literature examines how international trade has been contributing to the wage movements of skilled and unskilled labour in countries, and how interactions between North (including all ‘high income OECD members’ as defined by World Bank, or ‘developed market economies’ as defined by United Nations) and South (including ‘developing market economies’ as defined by United Nations) have contributed to the observed phenomena.Footnote 1 Assessing the movement in wages of skilled vs unskilled labour is important from several perspectives. Firstly, it helps in determining how beneficial international trade is for a country’s relatively abundant factor, in terms of factor earnings. Secondly, it helps a country to develop suitable policies to address any growing inequality in the labour market arising out of international trade. The other existing literature explores the effects of international trade on wages of male and female workers. Opening up the economy through trade is expected to create better job opportunities for women, thereby putting an end towards gender discrimination in terms of lower employment and wages paid to female workers relative to the male workers. Addressing gender discrimination in the labour market and thereby ensuring women’s better access to resources is the channel towards establishing a more egalitarian society and promotion of all around growth and development in a country. This paper therefore examines the impact of trade on the labour market from two perspectives: first by considering the wage movements of skilled vs unskilled labour and second by considering the wage movements of female vs male workers. The country of analysis is India, given its growing significance in the world market and its significantly large working population.Footnote 2 However, instead of considering India’s trade with the rest of the world, we restrict ourselves to a specific country. China is the largest trading partner of India, and its growing importance in India’s import basket is evident from Fig. 1.Footnote 3 Imports from China as a percentage of GDP, 1999–2012 During the first decade of the 2000s, the surge in Chinese imports into the USA (an increase in volume of 159% in log terms, and from 0.90 to 2.63% as a share of GDP) attracted a lot of attention for its effect on the US economy (see, for example, Autor et al. 2013a, b, 2014, 2016). At the same time, the volume of imports from China into India increased by 374% in log terms and from 0.27 to 2.87% as a share of GDP. Hence, the effect of these imports on the Indian economy is also likely to be substantial and worthy of study. Focusing on trade between India and China essentially implies that we are not delving into the consequences of trade between ‘North’ and ‘South’, but between ‘South’ and ‘South’. Along with the growing import surge from China, India has experienced a diverging wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers over the considered period, as shown in Fig. 2. The wage gap between male and female workers in India in Fig. 3 also does not show any signs of convergence over the period considered. In this scenario, our objective in this paper is to determine to what extent the import surge from China has contributed to the Indian labour market outcomes. Lack of sufficient literature in this respect has been a motivation for us. Divergence between average real wages of skilled and unskilled workers. Note Skilled workers are those with at least 12th grade education (aged 18 years and above). The rest are categorized as unskilled workers. The individual-level weekly wage data (in rupees) for workers employed in the formal urban sector from the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), India, have been transformed into constant prices by considering the consumer price index data (with base year at 2010) from International Financial Statistics (IFS) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Wage gap between male and female workers. Note: Individual-level weekly wage data (in rupees) are from NSSO, India. They have been transformed into constant prices with consumer price index data (base year 2010) from IFS, IMF Our analysis reveals that the contribution of import surge from China towards the growing wage difference between skilled and unskilled workers is insignificant. However, the effect of the Chinese import surge on wage divergence between male and female workers is significant. Section 2 presents a brief review of the literature on the impact of trade on wages of skilled vs unskilled workers and on the wages of male vs female workers. In Sect. 3, we elaborate on the methodology and data. In Sect. 4, we present the results, and finally in Sect. 5 we conclude.",1

Mishra,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"Generally, inequalities of any kind are undesirable and the often mentioned income inequality is a manifestation of inequality in varied capability domains. Given the adverse influence of income inequality on the general economic and political environments, an effort at moderating inequality remains the most ideal engagement. It is argued that other things being constant, a higher degree of inequality must correspond to a lower level of social welfare (Dalton 1920). A common view is that education can play an important role in reducing income inequality. If the pool of the workers with better educational achievement increases, it helps in reducing the inequality in the distribution of income in an economy. This proposition needs verification in Indian context given the substantial progress in the educational expansion in India over the years.Footnote 1 The said educational expansion has undoubtedly helped in bridging the inequality in educational opportunities (Desai and Kulkarni 2008). However, it is not yet clear as to whether expansion of educational opportunities in India has impacted the inequality in income distribution. Higher level of educational attainment ensures better earning opportunities in India (Duraisamy 2002; Dutta 2006). But its impact on overall distribution of income remains unknown. The studies on wage inequality suggest that increasing returns to tertiary education results in increasing wage inequality in urban India (Kijima 2006; Azam 2012). The increase in urban wage inequality is attributable to the increase in the skill premium that is largely linked with the increase in demand for tertiary educated workers. Since the wage workers form a very small fraction of the entire work force of the country, this observation may not be adequate to explain observed income inequalities. In this background, the paper is an attempt to analyse the impact of educational expansion on income inequality in India based on information obtained in the National Sample Survey Organisation’s 66th round employment–unemployment survey. The study is based on cross-sectional data set of 20 major states which further comprise of 63 economic regions considered for the analysis. It is one of the first studies of its kind where impact of educational expansion on income inequality is examined in an intra-country perspective. Given the wide rural–urban differences, the entire analysis has been carried out independently for rural and urban sectors. As a prelude to the empirical exercise, the paper begins with a comprehensive review of existing literature on the issue of concern. The third section of the paper discusses the proposed framework for analysis. Fourth section of the paper informs on the data source and variables used. The empirical investigation is presented in the fifth section. Finally, the sixth section concludes the findings.",3

At the same time, the Indian economy’s ability to absorb its incremental working age population into the workforce has been declining (Kannan and Raveendran 2019). While men’s labour force participation rates remained relatively high, averaging 83.6% in 1999–2000 and 75.8% in 2017–2018,Footnote 1 women’s labour force participation has been low and fell from 38.9 to 23.3% in the same period. The Indian economy has undergone broad structural change: there has been a clear shift in employment from the agricultural sector towards the services sector, largely bypassing the manufacturing sector. However, this structural change has been different for men and women, and in rural and urban areas. From 1999–2000 to 2017–2018, of the 67.6 million additional jobs created, women gained jobs only in urban areas (12.5 million) and lost substantially in rural areas (28.8 million). Overall, in the rural areas, as men’s employment increased by 38.3 million, women’s employment declined by 28.8 million. This period was marked by the withdrawal of more than 10.9 million female workers from agricultural and allied activities in rural areas. There has been a marked decline in female workforce participation in rural India that has contributed to the overall decline in female WPR (Kannan and Raveendran 2019; Basole 2018; Afridi et al. 2017; Andres et al. 2017; Rustagi 2013). Some studies have attributed this decline to supply side factors such as women’s increased participation in education (Rangarajan et al. 2011; Neff et al. 2012; Kannan and Raveendran 2012; Abraham 2013; Thomas 2012), rising male education and income (Klasen and Pieters 2015) and stability in family income, captured by an increasing share of regular wage earners and declining share of casual labour in family labour supply (Andres et al. 2017). Other studies underscore the importance of demand side factors, particularly lack of appropriate economic opportunities for women (Chowdhury 2011; Mazumdar and Neetha 2011; Kapsos et al. 2014). Changes in female WPR and sectoral shifts in employment have been more balanced in urban areas. Female workforce participation rates (15 + years) in India are substantially lower in urban areas (20.4%) compared to rural areas (24.6%).Footnote 2 Overall, in the urban areas, between 1999–2000 and 2017–2018, of the 58.1 million additional jobs, 12.5 million jobs went to women, largely in the services sector (8.8 million), followed by manufacturing (4.1 million), while 0.5 million females lost their jobs in agriculture during the same period. Despite these gains in employment, female workforce participation rates (15 years and above) in urban areas have remained nearly stable at 20.9% in 1999–2000 and 20.4% in 2017–2018. The low and near stagnant female urban WPR is attributed to a combination of demand and supply side factors: rising household incomes and husband’s education, the falling selectivity of highly educated women, as well as the sectoral structure of female employment (Klasen and Pieters 2015). That said, there has been a marked shift towards regular employment, away from self-employed and casual work for women in urban areas; our estimates from the Periodic Labour Force Survey data of 2017–2018 show that more than half of all female UPS workers in urban areas are regular employed workers. It is in this context that this paper explores women’s labour market participation and employment patterns mediated by education and caste using unit level data from the Periodic Labour Force Survey undertaken in 2017–2018. Many recent studies for India have noted a U-shaped relationship of women’s education with their labor force participation (Das and Desai 2003; Kingdon and Unni 2001; Das 2006; Klasen and Pieters 2015; Ghai 2018). Women’s labour force participation declines with rising levels of education and undergoes a reversal only after relatively higher levels of education are attained. Against this backdrop, the work participation of highly educated women forms a focus for the present paper and the interplay of caste is also observed parallelly. As the next section will discuss, the share of regular workers among the women has been increasing in India and as such regular/salaried jobs for women will also be a focal point for the study. The paper is organised as follows. In the next section, we undertake a select review of the literature on women's work with a focus on education, caste and social norms, the focus being highly educated women. Thereafter, we present bi-variate tabulations of workforce participation rates across education categories by caste in rural and urban areas. Next, we present caste and education patterns in work status, and employment by industry and occupation of female workers. Last, we explore a multivariate regression model to examine the effect of caste, education and other contextual variables in explaining female workforce participation. Since the focus of the paper is highly educated women, we use usual principal (activity) status (UPS) in our analysis. In doing so, we are able to circumvent the issue of under-reporting—a particularly serious problem with NSS data in the context of female labour force participation (Hirway 2012; Sudarshan and Bhattacharya 2009; Rodgers 2012). At the same time, a drawback of using UPS is that we are not able to capture part-time female workers in the labour force.Footnote 3 However, the share of part-time female workers has declined significantly over time, even in the rural areas, where it was considerable. Based on the 2011–2012 NSS data, part-time female workers in urban areas comprised 2.8% of the total female workers in urban areas, compared to 10.3% in rural areas. Using the 2017–2018 data, our results show that while part-time workers comprise just 0.4% of the male workers and 1.7% of the female workforce, the incidence of part-time female workers in urban areas is just 0.8% compared to 2.0% in rural areas.",4

Equal participation in opportunities and growth is not only desirable from normative perspective, but also important to sustain growth in the long term. In the last two decades, India has seen improvements in both economic and social indicators (Economic Survey 2017). It has experienced high growthFootnote 1 and reduction in poverty ratioFootnote 2 (Planning Commission 2013), lowered fertility rate and improved life expectancy (Economic Survey 2017) and improvement in access and retention in schools (ASER 2014), for instance. However, it lags behind many countries in the development indicators. One-fifth of its population who are still not able to afford the basic needs (as identified by poverty line), low employment generation and ascriptive characteristics important in determining life opportunities are some of the issues presenting major development challenges. This paper primarily focuses on social group inequities in rural income (and employment) in the face of changing employment scenario in the rural economy. Rural economy in India has undergone important structural changes during this period. Agriculture sector’s share in net domestic product (NDP) has declined to half, from 72% in 1970 to 36% by 2009–2010, while around two-third of rural NDP is being contributed by non-agricultural sector.Footnote 3 There is a declining trend in employment in the agriculture sector, with only half of rural employment in agriculture by 2011. The growth in non-farm sector rural employment has been underway since 1970s and continued through 1980s (Visaria and Basant 1993). After a slowdown during 1990s (Acharya and Mitra 2000), it grew at a high rate during 2000s (National Sample Survey Organisation 2014). Indian society is segmented along caste and religious axes. Historically and even today, caste has been an important basis of social segregationFootnote 4 (Deshpande 2011; Desai and Dubey 2012). This has been primarily a characteristic of Hinduism, but exists in other religions as well. As practiced in the past, caste system is hierarchical,Footnote 5 perpetual and non-transient or permanent in nature. It restricts one’s freedom to education, social associations and choice of occupation and thereby forces the lower castes to low-end work. This perpetuates conditions of ‘unfavourable inclusionFootnote 6’ and ‘vicious cycle of misery’. In the present times, apart from Brahmins, Other Forward Castes and Scheduled Castes (SCs) several castes identified as socio-economically disadvantageous are grouped under Other Backward Classes (OBCs). Another group, Scheduled Tribes (STs) are primarily ethnic forest dwelling communities dependent on subsistence agriculture and natural resources with very little or late development interventions in the regions inhabited by them. Religious minorities (e.g. Muslims) also often face discrimination from other groups, and their disadvantageous position has been documented in Sachar Committee Report (Government of India 2006). In contradiction to the argument for ascriptive identity to be less relevant with market oriented growth, and studies finding weakening of such un-freedom (Jodhka and Newman 2007) due to social transformation, migration opportunities, labour market tightening and legislative amendments, its prevalence in pre-market and market discrimination has also been documented (Thorat and Newman 2010), supporting the argument of its reproduction and existence in modern forms (Mosse 2018). In this backdrop, this paper examines the following two questions: First, given the increasing importance of market-led non-farm sector in rural economy, do caste inequities of the rural economy continue to exist in non-agricultural economy? Second, does caste identity independently affect the non-farm sector inequities (or because of the nature of its association with non-caste determinants?) Discrimination and social exclusion in the labour market have been the focus of a number of studies. It may take the form of entry barriers to high productive occupations, restricted participation in the market, low wages or delayed payment, resulting in inequality in the economic outcomes like consumption expenditure, income and poverty. Inequality in outcome may also be due to other forms of discrimination like unequal access to education, health facilities and inputs like land, labour, credit and other equipment. A brief review of the related literature is presented below. In the last few decades, there have been many augmenting and constraining forces that have shaped the rural labour market (Papola 2014). There is an important linkage between the primary occupation of the households and poverty (Das 2010). ‘Fundamental change’ from primary to secondary activities and diversification of income sources through non-farm expansion of employment and migration is found to have pro-poor distributional incidence (Himanshu et al. 2011; Balcaźar et al. 2016). However, participation in this sector is selective as high-return non-farm activities present barriers for the poor and marginalised sections (Scharf and Rahut 2014). Caste practices remain a major characteristic till date (Desai and Dubey 2012), and its effects are observed in various spheres including labour market opportunities. Thorat et al. (2010) finds that SCs get less number of days of employment in both agricultural and non-agricultural activities and face delayed and lower wage payments for similar manual skills. Discriminatory practices are observed in the market for land, agricultural inputs, market for produce and non-farm work as well. Market and non-market discrimination based on group identity has important implication for economic growth, income distribution and poverty (Thorat and Newman 2010). Differences in education, location (Kijima 2006) and endowments (Aggarwal 2014) are found to be factors underlying disparity in living standards among social groups. Also, relative economic and political power of the groups that live and work in close vicinity influences their economic performance (Iversen et al. 2014). A set of studies using different analytical methods find convergence among the social groups. Dubey and Thorat (2012) find improvement in consumption level for marginalised social groups, particularly for SCs. Iversen et al. (2014) finds well-being of SCs is more likely to be improved in SC-dominated villages. Also, improvement is observed in the intergenerational mobility in education across social groups (Jalan and Murgai 2008; Azam and Bhatt 2015). Hnatkovska et al. (2013) report intergenerational occupational convergence between SC/STs and non-SC/STs and the sharpest changes in intergenerational income mobility for middle-income households. Reddy and Swaminathan (2014) find higher intergenerational occupational mobility among manual workers from Scheduled Castes and low among big farmers and rural manual workers. Other studies report stickiness at the lower end. Persistence of lower caste groups at the lowest quintiles and low status occupations and upper castes at the highest quintiles and high status occupations (Ranganathan et al. 2016; Motiram and Singh 2012; Majumder 2010) indicate low mobility. Motiram and Singh (2012) and Iversen et al. (2017) find low mobility in rural areas and greater risk of downward mobility for disadvantage castes. Thorat et al. (2017) find a higher risk for disadvantageous communities of remaining poor and falling into poverty. High inequality in educational achievement across caste groups for graduate and above (Desai and Kulkarni 2008) and strong intergenerational stickiness in educational achievement (Majumder 2010) show low educational mobility. The literature suggests important welfare consequences of the emergence of non-farm sector, but convergence in outcomes and associated factors seem to be sensitive to data and methods used. However, fewer studies have looked at the group inequality in the non-farm rural sector. This paper adds to the existing studies in the following respects: First, it uses household panel data and hence results are based on the data for the same set of households tracked overtime. Second, it uses model specification to ensure that the explanatory variables are exogenous (i.e. observed at previous time point). Third, it uses the information on household income from different sources, often unavailable in other data sets, and at all India level. Fourth, six-group disaggregation is used here including Brahmins and Muslims as separate categories. The paper is organised in the following order: Section 2 describes the data sources and methodological issues. Section 3 discusses the size and distribution of income and employment in rural India looking at the pattern of shift, both overall and for the caste groups. Section 4 analyses the determinants of access to and earnings from rural non-farm opportunities and discusses the role of social group identity. Section 5 summarises and concludes.",1

Women’s participation in the South Asia region is reported to be the lowest, below 30 percentage points, compared to the global average of 49% (ILO 2017). Within the South Asian context, India has witnessed a decline in the female labour market participation from 34.1% in 1999–2000 to 27.2% in 2011–2012 as per the National Sample Survey Organization. While on the one hand, the employment trends for women in India have been discouraging, on the other hand, women’s participation in domestic duties has increased, which is an important concern from a policy perspective. It is equally disturbing to note that women’s participation in wage employment has been considerably low in comparison with men in both rural and urban areas. According to a recent report of the National Sample Survey Organization on ‘Participation of Women in Specified Activities Alongwith Domestic Duties’ 2014, the domestic duties participation for women in rural areas has increased from 53.4% in 2004–2005 to 61.6 in 2011–2012 (GoI 2014). Further, time use surveys of 26 OECD countries and three OECD-enhanced engagement countries (China, India and South Africa) show that women devote, on average, more than twice as much time to household work as men (OECD 2012). More jobs and quality jobs for women, universal social protection and measures to recognize, reduce and redistribute unpaid care and household work are indispensable to delivering on the new transformative sustainable development agenda, which aims to reduce poverty and inequalities to achieve gender equality and promote inclusive and sustainable growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all (ILO 2016). On the one hand, at the global level the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals remain at the heart of policy discourses where gender equality and empowerment of women remain one of the central goals to be achieved. On the other hand, the country is undergoing many challenges to counter the declining female employment. Women perform a large number of economic activities but most of their contributions remain underestimated with massive underreporting of women’s work. Further, the non-market economic activities performed within households are usually not recorded and the contribution of women within the household is undercounted in National Accounting Statistics. A recent report of the ILO titled ‘Care Work and Care Jobs : For The Future of Decent Work’ has reported that women perform 76.2% of the total amount of unpaid care work, 3.2 times more than men and 647 million persons of working age are outside the labour force due to family responsibilities (ILO 2018). Lack of recognition of women’s work in statistical sources, additional burdens of women’s unpaid responsibilities and social and cultural practices constraint them from accessing social protection and social security provisions available in the country. The over-representation of women as unpaid workers engaged in domestic duties makes them vulnerable in terms of their socio-economic status, depriving them of many rights. There is enough evidence in the literature on the reasons for a declining female labour force participation in India. Some of these studies have highlighted on increasing levels of education in rural India (Chowdhury 2011; Rangarajan et al. 2011; Thomas 2012; Neff et al. 2012). The new manufacturing jobs available, unlike farm work, are incompatible with domestic duties and existing social stigmas about women moving out for paid employment. Combined with a negative effect of rising income of male family members, female participation declines (Pieters and Klasen 2011). However, it is also evident that women are often constrained to participate in paid employment due to the burden of household responsibilities and the combining of paid work with household work within the informal economy. A large majority of Indian women who spend most of their time in unpaid work within the household (that falls outside the market economy) are compelled by economic necessity, particularly in urban areas to combine domestic work with remunerative jobs in the informal sector (Mitra 2005). However, a broader theoretical understanding of this premise rests on various debates on unpaid work and the transforming influences on unpaid work. The detraditionalization of nuclear family as Beck had perceived had freed men from the societal constraints imposed due to their social location in family, class and community and enabled them to participate in paid employment (Beck 1992). However, women’s lack of freedom from domestic work allowed men to achieve independence (Wajeman 1996 in Edgel 2012). Though it is also perceived that with globalization and flexibility of the labour markets, women tend to participate in paid employment in increasing numbers but men have not increased their participation in unpaid work. In Beck’s understanding, it is important to reflect on a highly gendered pattern of unpaid domestic work and understand on how to resolve the conflicting demands of paid and unpaid work and the persisting gender inequalities (Edgel 2012). The feminist Marxist perspective has clearly argued that household structure and familial ideology play an indirect part in the limitation of women’s participation in wage labour. Also, an analysis of role of housework under capitalism, it was revealed that women’s unpaid work in the household and the process of housewifization as Mies defined it, remained invisible, unrecorded in GDP, treated as ‘free good’, and her waged work was considered to be supplementary to that of her husband (Barret 1980; Mies 1998). The feminist understanding has clearly brought out the issue of recognition of this significant share of non-remunerated work in which women get engaged for a considerable amount of their time and such work often constraints them to take up paid employment. However, a broader theoretical premise on the intersections of feminist and labour process theories are critical to understand the conceptualization of work in relation to gender. Since labour process theories have played a prominent role in maintaining a critical sociology of work, they have also paved way to uncover the hidden and informal realms of industrial relations with its emphasis on the dynamics of control, consent and resistance (Thompson and Smith 2010). Further, the recognition of women’s work through National Accounting Statistics assumes paramount importance for improving women’s participation in the labour market. The 19th International Conference on Labour Statisticians 2013 clearly stated the need to shift focus from purely economic production to measuring also livelihoods, social cohesion and well-being to measure economic performance and social progress and also emphasized on the comprehensive measurement of participation in all work activities, including paid and unpaid work, among other dimensions of well-being (ILO 2013). The amount of unpaid work done and the way the burden is distributed across different actors and the proportion and kinds of such work have important implications for the well-being of the individuals and households, as well as economic growth and well-being of nations (Budelender 2010). The best tool for capturing unpaid work is the time use surveys (TUS)Footnote 1 which can provide better workforce estimates and a comprehensive picture of social reality and human life. The theories on emotional labour and intersectionality also have a significant impact on the gendered labour process analysis wherein concentration of women in certain jobs and the tendency to focus on the undervaluation of women’s work in relation of men’s work are important for an understanding of the gendered labour process (Durbin and Conley 2010). The present paper is contextualized within the emerging labour process theories and tries to analyse women’s unpaid work with specific emphasis on their participation in household and related activities (domestic duties)Footnote 2 thereby exploring intra-household dynamics and role of socio-cultural norms in interpreting gender roles in the household. The intersections of domestic work with marital status and social group are analysed to understand the gendered labour processes. The paper also aims to address the invisible dimensions of women’s work through indicators like nature of work acceptable and willingness to work in household premises and highlights on the importance of capturing household and related work adequately in National Accounting Statistics. At the end, the paper tries to engage with the larger labour process debates in order to situate the role of state in addressing issues related to women’s household work and participation in paid employment. The paper is largely based on the reports of the National Sample Surveys (NSS) and Report on Participation of Women in Specified Activities along with Domestic Duties 2014 of the NSS. NSS data for employment estimates of the 15–59 age group are taken for all kinds of analysis from various years. The concept of usual activity statusFootnote 3 has been taken into consideration, and unit level data are also used to generate information on a more disaggregated level. Other published governmental reports and reports of international organizations are also analysed. The following sections in the paper provide an insight into the employment trends for women and an indepth understanding on women’s participation in domestic duties.",1

This phenomenon involves the movement of female members from underprivileged families to join the domestic workforce; that eventually transforms their strictly private life into becoming an earning member. Poverty affects women more forcefully, and they face obstacles that are extremely difficult to overcome. The economic activities of women play a potential role in improving household food security. The present study is on female participation in the informal sector as domestic workers. The discussion is supplemented with insights from micro-level data in the context of South 24 Parganas district of West Bengal for the time period January 2016 to June 2016. These women workers lack skills as well as means of skill enhancement. As a consequence, they are virtual without any choice as regards obtaining worthwhile jobs. They are engaged in household-oriented services like cooking, cleaning and mopping, washing utensils and clothes, and as elderly and child caretakers. The number of women employed in the broad category of domestic work shows more than fourfold increase over the 10-year period from 1999–2000 to 2009–2010 (Neetha 2013). There are several empirical studies highlighting the vulnerabilities of low-paid domestic workers in India, but micro-studies in the context of West Bengal are rare. This study was planned with an objective of examining the determinants of income and the level of empowerment of female domestic workers (FDWs) and specifies that women’s earnings do not always ensure empowerment, especially when the wages are low.",3

As of 2018, this made it the world’s most valuable private tech company. Alongside competitors like Didi Chuxing, Grab, Lyft and Ola, Uber serves as a brilliant illustrative example of a firm embedded within the rapidly mushrooming gig economy.Footnote 2 Typically, gig firms distinguish themselves from their traditional rivals as firms that utilize technological platforms to connect multiple sets of distinct consumer groups and facilitate the provision of a service. While the ride-hailing and food delivery markets have proven to be fertile ground for the growth of such gig platforms, there are well-established platforms that presently serve as markets for a diverse variety of short- to medium-term services, commissioned both locally and internationally. When viewed through a historical lens, this revolution can be located within a larger material and cultural transformation triggered by rapid technological advances, both in terms of speed and in terms of programmability. This transformation, which began with the consumerization of the digital sphere that started in the 1960s, saw an exponential acceleration with the arrival of the Internet in the 1980s. In the decade that immediately followed, the world witnessed the rise of its first popular software platformsFootnote 3 as well as the rise of the first Internet marketplaces. The spread of the Internet, radical improvements in processing speeds and the development of the smart phone set the stage for the next transition in digital consumerization heralded by the arrival of the mobile application. It is in this context Uber appears in 2009 as an app named UberCab, with the goal of connecting prospective riders to private drivers with excess seating capacity in their vehicles, and the willingness to drop off riders for a fee. This distinctive feature of this platform is the ability of its core algorithms to efficiently and immediately connect a prospective rider to a willing driver, based on a set of carefully predetermined variables. Included within this service is the computation of an appropriate fee for the ride based on “base fare, booking fee, surcharges, tolls, and other relevant factors such as dynamic pricing when demand for rides is high in the area” (Uber 2017). With the passing of time, this algorithm has increased in complexity and in terms of the variables it accounts for, but at its heart, the core purpose of the company remains the same, providing a platform for suppliers and consumers to seamlessly interact, embodying what Brishen Rogers perceives as a “free market for car-hire services” (Rogers 2015). However, of late, this idea of “uberization” and what is now being called the “sharing economy” has been scrutinized by several economists who look to evaluate whether it truly lives up to its “revolutionary” reputation. In this regard, there has been a nascent bulge in the literature critiquing this trend and challenging the degree to which it varies from modern-day capitalism as well as the costs attached to such a large-scale transition. This literature, however, has primarily been rooted in the experiences of the global north and is hence limited in scope and applicability in other socio-economic contexts. Within India, questions about the nature and impact of the sharing economy have the added dimension of taking place in the context of a developing nation, still navigating between “tradition” and “modernity”, while also coping with significant and increasing levels of wealth inequality. This poses an interesting challenge to the existing literature on the subject, questioning the relevance of the existing literature on the subject and challenging some of the assumptions that such literature may have been built on. This paper will attempt to add to the existing body of the literature a perspective from a developing county as it looks to understand the complex relationships within the so-called sharing economy, through the lens of Uber. This paper will look to first document the various types of drivers that exist in Indian cities and then, more specifically, enquire into the phenomenon of non-owner Uber drivers, within the framework of a Tier 1 city (Hyderabad) in a developing country.",6

The focus of this study is on gender-specific labor force and workforce participation, first within the context of Asia Pacific and then for India. The authors identify the determinants of labor force participation rates (LFPRs) and workforce participation rates (WPRs), disaggregated by gender and region at the state, city and district levels using data from Population Census and Labor Bureau (2009–2010 to 2014–2015). Three sets of factors emerge as explanations, namely creating cluster of employment opportunities (demand for labor), adding to the skill set and education levels of individuals and creating accessibility to locations where the jobs are located. The introductory section of the book draws from the previous work (2015) of the author on female labor supply in India using primary data. The authors highlight that India is experiencing a demographic dividend, but its effective utilization requires skilled workforce and adequate demand for their labor. Besides, participation is also aided by improvement in physical, social and financial infrastructure in an economy. Urbanization (physical infrastructure) envisages upward mobility by creating nonfarm opportunities for people in the cities. Cities do not follow the traditional caste-based occupation pattern, which is generally more prevalent in rural areas, thus benefitting all. However, the dualistic pattern is visible wherein the advantaged classes benefit more (with higher skills and training), while the disadvantaged counterparts engage in low and petty employment. Particularly for females, urbanization reduces the home-based domestic production and domestic work is commercialized, thereby helping women participate in the labor market. Economic growth is a factor in determining female employment, but it is not a sufficient condition. Higher Human Development Index of a country does not translate to a higher Gender Development Index as visible in Japan and Korea. Before focusing on the Indian labor market, a section on the Asia Pacific region is outlined via indicators such as LFPR, employment elasticity, unemployment rates and employment structure and status. Nations in this region have progressed in reducing gender disparities, but they nonetheless remain present. Country-level differences are present with regard to female LFPR which further cause variation in human capital formation. Using KILM dataset of ILO, they report India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka to have a participation rate of about 35%, while Cambodia, China, Papua New Guinea, Thailand and Vietnam have female LFPR close to 70%. These cross-country variations are explained by sociocultural backgrounds, rather than the development level of nations. Within Northeast Asia, North Korea has female LFPR of 48%, while Cambodia has the figure at 75%. Higher education has contributed to the rise in employment among women and provided inter-generational benefits. It is also to be noted that these differences within countries are less stark for males. Unemployment rates are also higher among females in the South Asia region, pointing toward lower demand for labor. To understand the role of economic growth on employment, Employment Elasticity Index is prepared gender wise for different countries for three time periods. In most countries, female employment elasticity is lower than that for males, pointing toward the growth pattern of nations being favorable to men. Females are more concentrated in labor-intensive sectors, while growth has been capital intensive, and often have lower skills due to lower investments in human capital. The limitation of the indicator is also highlighted, since a high elasticity could also be an indicator of static labor productivity growth. The employment structure among females is more toward agriculture in countries with low income levels. Countries such as Hong Kong, China and Macau have experienced rapid industrialization, and that has led to higher share of females in manufacturing than males. In Bangladesh, Pakistan, Mongolia and Philippines, industrialization has been low and so is the female engagement in the sector. Service sector is preferred among females, and tertiarization (a term coined by authors for growth in service sector) has benefitted them, though unequal outcomes remain due to variations in human capital endowments. The third and fourth sections of the book focus on India, delineating the broad patterns and conducting factor analysis of male and female LFP. Males have higher participation rates, more than 50%, than females. Interstate variations are high for female LFPR and rural urban differentials are more pronounced, while such variations do not exist for males. Using the latest data, the authors debate the popular belief that rural areas are more restrictive in terms of social norms, but urban areas have lower FLFPR despite higher educational levels and income levels, pointing toward stringent social norms in urban areas. This, however, needs further investigation in light of household and childcare duties, nuclear family structures and lack of demand for female labor. Using factor analysis and panel data regression, the determinants of WPR and LFPR are drawn disaggregated by gender and region. The major results that emerge are variation in participation by social group with higher levels among scheduled tribe women, urbanization or infrastructure development decreasing rural male WPR while raising participation among females and urban males, rural diversification adding to female WPR and industrialization assisting rural diversification. Urbanization is a variable which has varying relations at the various spatial levels; it has positive association with rural male WPR at the district level since within a district workers may not have to migrate and can reap the benefits of opportunities, while it has negative impact at the state level for rural males. Demonstration effect of advanced households in cities adds positively to female labor supply. In the last section, explaining the linkages of productivity and employment, it is highlighted that there is a belief that females are less productive (as their wages are often lower). However, capability is an individual characteristic and cannot be judged by gender. The neoclassical marginal productivity-based pricing does not work for female workers because of their lower bargaining powers, poor information about job market opportunities, limited commuting access, engagement in poorly paid activities and lack of flexible work opportunities. Feminization is an arrangement by the market to reduce the labor costs, which is often interpreted as lower productivity for females. The study concludes with the mention of benefits associated with utilization of demographic dividend for the economy, termed as “age structure shift” in the book. Reduction in gender inequality in the labor market is important since it reduces inequality in other segments of the economy as well. Growth process has still been inadequate to raise employment among females, though for males the pattern is identifiable. The lower rates of employment among females are established by Mitra and Okada throughout the book, and they quote, “…the rates are indeed low and the gender differences are glaring irrespective of which source of data we use.” The study highlights the research questions which can be further investigated in this area, while also providing an international context. It enables researchers to further explore the practices being followed in countries with higher female participation rates. The book offers meaningful insights on female employment levels in India. It makes use of exploratory research methods, ratios and factor analysis to draw out the empirical evidence. It is rich in data and adds to the existing scholarship in labor economics. The theme the book engages with is important in the current scenario of rising education levels among women, but poor growth in employment. A rearrangement of the figures in section 3 of the book could have made it easier for the reader to link it with the text. A description of the model used in panel data analysis is also missing. That being said, the main strength of the book is the rigorous data analysis. The simplicity of language makes it a pleasure to read. It has value for researchers and faculty in the field of labor studies.",

Devadason,Female,Unknown,Female,Female,"The use of non-tariff measures (NTMs)Footnote 1 to regulate trade has been increasing since the 1990s (Gourdon 2014; WTO 2012). Governments have imposed NTMs for a variety of legitimate non-trade objectives, such as to protect human, animal and plant health, the environment, and for national security purposes. NTMs, though legitimate, can also act as barriers to trade when their implementation increases compliance costs to firms (Peterson et al. 2013; Disdier and Van Tongeren 2010; Chen et al. 2008; Peterson and Orden 2008; Fontagné et al. 2005; Moenius 2004; Otsuki et al. 2001). Alternatively, NTMs can also enhance trade when they reduce the problems arising from asymmetric information between buyers and sellers (Schuster and Maertens 2015; Athukorala and Jayasuriya 2003). Through trade, NTMs can also affect the labour market. According to the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP 2016), the implementation of NTMs will have a direct effect on trade and prices and an indirect effect on the labour market. Changes in these factors will then alter the labour market in terms of employment and wages. Several studies have analysed the impact of NTMs on the labour market (Leonardi and Meschi 2016; Stone and Cepeda 2012; Bustos 2011; Francois et al. 2009; Verhoogen 2008; Haskel and Slaughter 2003). They describe the way in which NTMs can affect the labour market positively or negatively. Much ambiguity therefore surrounds the labour market effects relative to the trade effects of NTMs, as conditions of the labour market are somewhat contextual. Though Malaysia is increasingly reliant on NTMs, there is a limited quantitative assessment of the implications of NTMs for the labour market. Previous studies were largely focused on the trade aspects of NTMs (Devadason et al. 2018; Sithamparam et al. 2017; Hanif 2013; Hanif and Alavi 2011; Aini 2011; Hanif et al. 2011; Rabiul et al. 2010; Kee et al. 2008). This paper, therefore, employs a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to assess the employment and wage effects of a reduction in NTMs in Malaysia. It focuses on the food sector, which is highly regulated with technical measures, comprising sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures and technical barriers to trade (TBTs) (ERIA-UNCTAD 2017). Though these measures are used for health and safety reasons, NTMs generally, apart from increasing compliance costs, could also embody protectionist elements. It has been acknowledged that countries resort to using NTMs for political reasons, which is to serve protectionist purposes (Aisbett and Pearson 2012; WTO 2012; Fischer and Serra 2000). Such (over) regulation is trade restrictive, and therefore, the compliance costs and protectionist effect of those NTMs need to be reduced. Modelling the labour market impacts of NTMs on the food sector of Malaysia, this paper contributes to the existing empirical literature in the following manner. First, it provides a disaggregated sub-sectoral analysis of the food processing sector in Malaysia, which is highly heterogenous. Second, it not only disaggregates employment by skills, but distinguishes local labour from foreign labour given the overwhelming presence of unskilled foreigners in the Malaysian manufacturing sector (World Bank 2013; DOS 2014). With these extensions, this paper seeks to provide answers to the following questions: How does a reduction in NTMs affect employment and wages across the food processing sub-sectors? Does a reduction in NTMs influence the composition of labour in the food processing sector? Does the local labour benefit from a NTM reduction policy change compared to foreign labour?",

K. Srivastava,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"India has experienced rapid economic growth in the past few decades, but the pace of its growth has been biased towards urban areas. Over-dependence in rural areas on the low-productivity agriculture sector has brought about a high and persistent disparity between rural and urban incomes (Chand et al. 2017). In the historical pattern of structural transformation, the income and employment shares of agriculture in total gross domestic product (GDP) and workforce decline unequivocally, but the high income disparity in India has bucked this trend. Increasing, the non-farm employment and diversification can boost the process of structural transformation and help India achieve its objectives of equitable and inclusive economic development (Binswanger-Mkhize 2012). Occupational diversification in rural India is increasing, as is its contribution to income and employment (Lanjouw and Lanjouw 2001; Lanjouw and Shariff 2002; Lanjouw and Murgai 2009; Haggblade et al. 2010). The non-farm sector contributes 55.9% of the output in rural areas and 34.8% of the employment (Chand et al. 2017). Within the narratives and counter-narratives of diversification of rural non-farm employment (RNFE), the key issue is to understand whether the ongoing structural transformation is reducing the economic deprivation of rural households. Several pull and push factors determine the movement of rural workers towards non-agricultural activities. One view holds that the non-farm sector plays a major role in the present developmental process: it has considerable potential to increase income and reduce poverty, overcome land constraints and other shocks in agriculture, and increase the capacity to invest (Lanjouw 1999; Reardon et al. 1998; Adams 2001; Barrett et al. 2001; de Janvry et al. 2005; Reardon et al. 2007; Himanshu et al. 2013; Reardon and Taylor 1996; Collier et al. 1986). Another view is that an increase in the numbers of non-farm workers in rural areas does not necessarily result in positive economic development (Srivastav and Dubey 2002; Abraham 2009; Himanshu et al. 2013; Nagler and Naudé 2017; Kundu et al. 2003). The RNFE is pro-poor but inequality-driven; this duality requires policymakers to understand this structural transformation and its implications on inclusive development policies (Himanshu et al. 2013). In India, the tendency towards employment diversification is significant and has sustained over time. However, employment diversification varies by region in both degree and extent. During 1977–1978, about 20% of rural male workers and 12% of rural female workers were employed in non-agricultural activities. Examining the regional characteristics of non-agricultural employment from 1972–1973 to 1983, Dev (1990) finds that the growth was around 1.5% per annum in the agricultural workforce and 4.7% per annum in the non-agricultural workforce. The share of agriculture and allied activities in GDP dropped from 41.1% in 1972–1973 to 14.1% in 2011–2012 and its share in employment (usual principal and subsidiary status) decreased from 73.9% in 1972–1973 to 48.9% in 2011–2012 (Reddy et al. 2014). This structural gap has significant implications for poverty and inequality. Is rural employment driven by distress or by poor earning capacity (Abraham 2009)? Employment opportunities in the organised sectors (industry and services) are so scarce that labour is exiting agriculture and entering casual employment in the informal sector. Rural India has been experiencing this “stunted” structural transformation since the early 1970s (Binswanger-Mkhize 2013). Increased foodgrain production has linkages with growth in other sectors of the economy (Mellor and Lele 1973); for structural transformation and economic development, the agricultural sector must develop. Examining the determinants of non-agricultural employment in rural India, Vaidyanathan (1986) hypothesised that non-farm employment has a high correlation with unemployment and that agriculture has a limited potential for absorbing labour. Providing evidence on several dimensions of rural non-agricultural employment, Dev (1990) estimated that in many states in India the incidence of poverty is lower among non-agricultural households than in agricultural households. Among non-agricultural households, the incidence of poverty is lower among households engaged in the services sector than in the manufacturing sector. The RNFE is closely associated with income and employment in rural and peri-urban areas (Hazell and Haggblade 1990). Using state- and district-level data, the authors examine the influence of the agricultural income multiplier in the non-farm sector and conclude that ₹1 of value addition in agriculture leads to an additional ₹0.64 value addition in non-farm activities in rural and peri-urban areas. They emphasise the need for public policy to enhance the multiplier by increasing road, electricity, and banking services. It is presumed that non-farm income accrues mostly to the richer segments of society, and therefore, it is inequality-increasing, but the poorer sections do benefit (Lanjouw and Lanjouw 2001). Employment in the RNFE is income-stabilising; income was more stable in rural areas that had public works programmes than in areas that did not. However, the role of the RNFE in reducing poverty depends on the type of non-farm occupations and wage in these occupations (Srivastav and Dubey 2002). A certain level of agricultural and industrial development could generate demand for non-farm goods and services which, in turn, would spur development. The study also emphasised on the development of human and physical capital for the poor as an outcome from the welfare-induced development in non-farm activities. The non-farm sector can contribute to growth and reduce poverty (Deininger et al. 2007). In Sri Lanka, pro-poor policies have aimed to remove constraints in the expansion of small firms. Highlighting the economic importance of the rural non-farm sector, the study concluded that poverty is reduced faster by the non-farm economy than the indirect effect of wages. Using the Vietnamese Household Living Standards Survey, Hoang et al. (2014) find that an increase of 25–75% in an hour of non-farm work increases the probability of reducing poverty by 8–14% in a two-year period. Similarly, if one additional household member works in the non-farm sector, household expenditure increases by 14% in two years and 50% in 6 years. In India, rural transformation after the 1980s has contributed to an increase in household incomes and a decline in rural poverty (Himanshu et al. 2011, 2013). There is an alternative view. The informal employment generated by structural transformation does not provide health or unemployment insurance; therefore, workers remain insecure (Binswanger-Mkhize 2013). Economic growth has been rapid, but structural transformation has not solved the unemployment problem. Restrictive labour legislation and poor power, water, and transport infrastructure slow down manufacturing growth. Further, non-farm opportunities in rural areas are accessible mostly to males as females in rural areas have limited access to education, which indirectly supports the views of Srivastav and Dubey (2002). Eastern India has a high population growth rate and incidence of poverty; small landholding size; underdeveloped rural infrastructure; and the highest population pressure in India (Kumar et al. 2012). To be inclusive, economic development in the country must focus on eastern India. Empirical studies discuss and debate the narrative of non-farm sector development, but most existing studies, which are at the national level, exclude regional dimensions. This article aims to characterise the structural transformation in rural eastern India. Considering that diversification towards the RNFE has developmental benefits that reduce deprivation, this article attempts to identify when the benefits percolate in eastern India. It tries to understand whether the RNFE is reducing the economic deprivations of people in the eastern region.",2

Thus, lack of key capabilities like income, education, health, security and rights causes poverty. Hence, poverty is a “multi-dimensional” phenomenon. According to Sen (1985), poverty needs to be tackled by “providing opportunities, creating entitlements and building capabilities.” In this context, labor market is crucial for poverty reduction and pro-poor growth because the poor mainly have only labor as their main asset (World Bank 1990). Goldberg (2010) claims that creating day labor jobs is a prominent policy tool for governments seeking to simultaneously reduce poverty and promote infrastructure development. The focus of this paper is on female labor supply and its contribution toward household poverty reduction. Many studies have highlighted the contribution of Female Labor force participation (FLFP) to economic development (Esteve-Volart 2004; Klasen and Lamanna 2009; Durand 1975; Mathur 1994; Goldin 1994). Further, Klasen (1999, 2002) find that gender inequality in education and employment reduces economic growth. The problem here is that India has the second lowestFootnote 1 female Work Participation Rates (WPRs) in South Asia (Saha 2017). At the same time, it is the fastest growing economy in the world as of December 2017 (Stacey and Kynge 2018). ILO (2016) claims that India’s growth rate of GDP has increased from 5.6% in 2013 to 7.6% in 2016. Besides an increase in growth rate, studies show that in recent years, India has witnessed a fertility decline, an increase in education and returns to education, and a decline in educational gender-gap (as cited in Klasen and Pieters 2013). Amidst all these positive economic developments, FLFP in India continues to decline. This puzzling decline in FLFP, in the phase of high economic growth, has called upon the need to investigate the female labor supply behavior at the household level with newer datasets. Desai (2010) argue that the so-called “demographic dividend” is likely to be small if FLFP remains low. Hence, significant efforts should be made to increase employment opportunities and reduce labor market disadvantages (ibid). The “realization of their full economic potential can boost the growth rate and make it more inclusive” (Mehrotra and Sinha 2017, p. 54). It has been observed that women’s access to education and economic participation reduces the probability of a household being poor (Kabeer 2012); their employment is a crucial driver of economic growth in India (Klasen and Pieters 2012) and enhances the economic well-being of the household (Martin and Roberts 1984). The effect is significant in poor households where women are the sole providers or when the earnings of other household members are very low (Morris 1990). However, because of their traditional “care duties,” women opt for part-time jobs. This further reduces their contribution to family income due to their lower earnings (Smith et al. 1998). The potential contribution of women’s employment to their household’s economic well-being depends on three main factors: “the availability of employment, women’s wage rate, and the number of hours they allocate to market activity” (Stier and Lewin 2002). Further, having employment in certain industry groups does not help the poor in reducing their poverty risks. This has been observed to be true for poor rural women who are compelled to work in hazardous jobs with low pay (Khera and Nayak 2009). It has been also observed that rural women (compared to rural men) are relatively less educated and have limited job opportunities. Low educational levels of the workforce hinder poverty reduction (Rani and Schmid 2006). Households undergoing financial duress may use female labor for additional earnings, who otherwise remain out of work. They may enter the labor market only to supplement the financial needs of the household. Hence, they have relatively less experience and low skill levels than men. Thereby, poor women may be trapped in a low-wage cycle, who keep moving in and out from one low paid job to another. Hence, poor women’s labor is less likely to have an impact on poverty reduction of the household. In this context, the role of Indian rural women’s labor supply toward changes in household poverty risk during 2005–12 has been examined in this paper. Studies have used cross-section level analysis either at the state, region, or district levels, hitherto. The unique panel dataset of IHDS has been used, thereby adding to the existing literature on rural poverty. The panel data tracks the same rural household over time and enables the analysis of determinants of poverty risks of rural households over time. Few of the existing studies on poverty transition are that of Thorat et al. (2017) which investigated the poverty risks among socio-religious groups for urban and rural areas, using IHDS panel data (2005–2012); Bhide and Mehta (1998) analyzed the poverty transitions from the year 1970 to 1988; Dhamija and Bhide (2010) explored poverty transition for India between years 1970 and 1998; and Balcazar et al. (2016) explored the role of structural transformation in poverty transition in India. This paper, therefore, is an addition to these transition studies with the objective of analyzing the role of female labor supply in influencing the poverty risks of rural households in India. The paper hypothesizes that rural female labor supply contributes toward reducing household poverty risks over time.",

Madheswaran,B. P. Vani,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"India’s National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme (NREGP) is acclaimed to be by far the largest poverty alleviation scheme of its kind in terms of its reach (50 million poor households) and the fiscal space (price tag of slightly less than half a percentage of GDP), in any developing country. Approaching any aspect of it, thus, is a daunting experience. In the years after 2005, when the programme was rolled out, this “rights-based, universal workfare programme” has been having admirers and critics in equal numbers. NREGP is far from perfect, but is widely recognised as a lot more effective scheme than any other existing ones in benefitting the poor (Mukherjee 2014). Also, NREGP is not a charity, it entails hard work under extreme conditions, and in spite of its weakness, it is a lifeline for millions of rural families (Karat 2016). The NREGP has exhibited wide variations in quality across states and districts in its implementation. Imbert and Papp (2015) coined the term “star states” to describe seven leading states where performance of the programme was better compared to other states in the period they studied. Figure 1 plots the number of households (HHs) participating in NREGP in India and Karnataka in comparison with the number of poor HHs in India and in Karnataka, respectively. This has been done since NREGP is recognised as a powerful Poverty Elimination Programme. It was interesting to note that the ratio of participating HHs to poor HHs in India ranges between 86.26 (2014–2015) and 114.00% (2011–2012). If the programme was well focussed on the poor and targeted appropriately, probably it would have reached every poor household in India by now. The proportion of HHs participating in MGNREGA in Karnataka to the total number of poor HHs in Karnataka ranges between 53.98% in 2014–2015 and 97.53% in 2018–2019. This shows that in Karnataka, a large number of non-poor HHs participate in the programme; however, if the programme were targeted well, it would have had a notable impact on poverty alleviation and livelihood promotion.

Examinations of the developments in economics suggest that the focus is on poverty gaps, an understanding that makes clear poverty is something to do with employment status that remains miles away from state-of-the-art employment status that comes with work technological choices embodied in advanced growth process. This understanding also says that narrowing the gap would add to growth that adds to profit augmentation—a powerful motive that guides market economies. Poverty gaps analysis belongs to the frontier that relates to economics of how to expand technological choices that can pace advanced growth processes. Therefore, the experimental approach to poverty that provides new methodological approaches concerning how poverty reduction relates to achieving advanced growth status should be welcomed. For the purpose of an assessment, the present note exclusively concerns the development economics perspective underlying the approach and would argue that since the reference point is employment status with reference to technology choices that comes with negligible or nonexistent capital and skills sets and defines the gap that exists, it is easy to translate the poverty gap onto the status of many small and marginal firms that in turn define the extent of poverty. This understanding of poverty gap comes with significant advantages. Let’s assume, as would be the Indian case, some sort of marginal or major employment for all, which in turn defines numerous types of firms. Possible mobility of the marginal, informal and small firms from lower, bad employment status to a better, more dynamic employment status would be the policy focus on poverty reduction. Since much depends on mobility of firms, the policy focus narrows down the nature of capital base, the existence of some specific skill components of the firms. What exactly is the nature of this base, and does it permit mobility or impedes it, are the key questions and analyses of them belong to understandings of macroeconomic development processes. Here, the experimental approach to poverty solution is embedded in macroeconomic development processes that underline (i) how onetime policy intervention permits mobility to the firms and (ii) how the mobility is part of a growth process that adds to the pace of innovation, overall growth and profit augmentation. The perspective aims at long run solution to poverty. However, the present note would argue that the solution’s underlying neo-classical endogenous growth macro-perspective and the understanding of mobility of firms that it provides have serious issues. First, there are serious theoretical challenges to the neo-classical endogenous growth perspectives in which the participation of many in an advanced growth that in turn adds force to growth is taken for granted—there is no theoretical explanation of how to achieve this macro-participation underlying the advanced growth, and in the present context, the theory would remain silent on the possible explanation of as to why the gap in employment status, to start with, exists. Keynesian macro theory-based demand-led growth perspective inasmuch as provides this challenge would go on to provide a richer understanding of the factors that explain the initial poverty/employment gaps that also explains lack of proper growth processes. Second, relatedly, the neo-classical “savings-led investment” understanding takes any initial savings-led transition to participation in possible advanced growth—the issue of mobility for granted. It does not take into numerous empirical issues pertaining to market and non-market constraints facing small firms that hamper their effective mobility. The Keynesian demand-led perspective, on the other hand, since they focus more on the macro-constraints facing participants in advanced growth, would provide the crucial understanding of the constraints facing the smaller firms that negate their mobility—this understanding otherwise is crucial for understanding the conditions that facilitate effective mobility that in turn reduces poverty/employment gaps and reinforces advanced growth. Third, and therefore, since Keynesian theoretical and empirical inquiries concern how to achieve meaningful participation in many in advanced growth (and therefore would incorporate the issue of mobility), they would provide a richer policy perspective on the issue of reduction of employment gaps. The present note would argue that by zeroing on demand-led framework of analyses, a broader policy perspective emerges in which a macro-demand support system can incorporate proper institutional understanding of mobility that would remove the market and non-market constraints facings poverty gaps. Specifically, the demand-led macro-development process would underpin alternative conjectures of how to achieve a capital base that permits effective mobility, a capital base embedded in dynamic organizational form of small firms that adds to innovation within alternative institutional frameworks. To discuss the above three issues, the present note is organized as follows. Since macro-perspectives matter, Sect. 2 would briefly discuss the macro-development theoretical underpinnings underlying the new experimental approach to poverty. Sections 3 and 4 provide the Keynesian theoretical challenges to the new macro-perspective on poverty gap that in turn illustrates a rich, meaningful theoretical and empirical discussions on growth process that can reduce poverty gaps and how the Keynesian macro-development perspective sheds important light on the empirical issues pertaining to mobility, respectively. The basic contention is that since these Keynesian theoretical and empirical positions relate more on how to achieve growth (with mobility), they can support a more meaningful, realistic policy perspective on reduction of poverty/employment gaps. Section 5, in lieu of a conclusion, provides the broader understandings of such policy issues.",

Economic inequalities are reinforced as the better-off are better able to protect themselves, either secure in their jobs, or by having the resources to support themselves during a downturn. Gender inequalities are reinforced as women tend to be in more vulnerable jobs and are exposed to health risks. Social and identity (race, caste, nationality) inequalities often intersect with socio-economic inequalities. Because of the nature of the measures governments around the world took in response to the health crisis, mobile populations have been placed in particularly vulnerable situations. Across the world, refugees are amongst the most vulnerable, their living conditions make containing the virus extra challenging, and stigmatisation likely increases. Labour migrants, similarly, often have poor living and working conditions, are exposed to health risks at work, have no social security or insurance to fall back on, and are often stigmatised. Labour migrants’ vulnerability manifested itself in extreme ways in India, when the government announced a lockdown, and big cities’ labour migrants found themselves in the void of having lost their job, sometimes their housing, and in large numbers of cases having lost their income, and therefore with no alternative but to return to their home villages. Their plight has been well described in the media, by civil society organizations filling the gaps government agencies should be playing, and the efforts of groups of researchers. This essay provides a comparative perspective of the conditions of migrant workers.Footnote 1 I will summarise international experience—documented through investigative journalism and rapid research—that shows the vulnerability of migrants and gaps in policy frameworks globally. Further, it is important to understand how the conditions that migrants in India live in are not of recent origin, and the result of a structural condition of continued circulation between home villages that do not provide the necessary livelihoods and cities that need migrants but do not create the conditions for them to settle—they remain, as I slightly awkwardly called them in my publication on migrant workers in Calcutta ‘unsettled settlers’ (de Haan 1994). This essay illustrates this with a comparison with other crises, including the economic crisis following 1929 where migrant workers disappeared like ‘snow for the sun’ (but without the health consequences migrants now are facing). I will argue that both research and theories, and policies have had a deep tendency to ignore and neglect the existence of this mobile population (de Haan 1999): both, for different reasons, have a deep sedentary bias. Academic studies have continued to see migration as a transitory phenomenon, often in line with what is seen as a classic process of industrialisation that England experienced. For policymakers, migration has remained largely invisible: data capture circulatory migration very poorly, rural development policies often have the aim to reduce migration, and—perhaps most important—many of the public policies tend to be residence-based. This perspective is offered to contribute to consideration of policies, particularly post-pandemic. If indeed the neglect of migrants is of a systemic nature, policy reforms need to address the roots of these. It would require a rethink of the place migrants play in India’s society, to ensure data fully acknowledge the complex but sustained patterns of mobility that exist and to enquire how public policies need to be rebuilt on the basis of that reality.",15

Dispossessed from agrarian property sufficient for viable livelihood, the land-poor and landless classes, in particular, are in frantic search of employment outside of agriculture, which from generations used to be the prime sector of the economy. Agricultural production has declined to less than 15% of national income, but is still reckoned to employ about two-fifth of the economically active population. Market liberalization has brought robust growth, but, by replacing labour with capital, it has not created the multimillions of jobs to satisfy the searing need for them. The lockdown announced on 24 March 2020 gave people 4  hour to prepare for housebound life. In his televised address, the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi referred to the Hindu epic Ramayana, warning his audience, fearful of the virus, not to move out for the next 21 days since the ‘Lakshman rekha is at your doorstep’. The vast majority of the footloose proletariat, compelled to roam around in search of gainful work not available locally, was rendered unable to return to their faraway homes. What is the magnitude of this army of labour leaving their place of residence in the countryside where they are surplus to demand, but firmly prevented from settling down elsewhere? Counts vary from at least 50 million to more than double that number. Footloose workers and their erratic mode of employment defy formal registration, but, in my guesstimate, it accounts for at least one-fourth of the rural workforce and thus constitutes a major segment of the country’s economically active population estimated to be between 450 and 475 million. Migrant workers are torn loose from their rural place of origin for variable periods of time ranging from a couple of weeks, a season or a few years to working life duration. This category does not include people of working age who have managed within the last half century to leave and settle down more definitely wherever they have gone. These migrants who do not come back to the village other than for short visits enjoy higher and steadier incomes enabling them to establish a permanent foothold of sorts and often bringing along dependent members of their household to the home set up in the place of arrival. Usually originating from castes–classes higher up in the village hierarchy, they come already better equipped with physical and social capital. This differential outcome shows that labour migration should be analysed as an elastic and composite concept. Classifying people as either footloose or settled suggests a fixity that obscures a more complex fluidity between mobility and domicile (Srivastava 2020). Addressing them as seasonal labour is problematic as the timeline is not clear and it can vary between short sorties for a couple of weeks to an uneven rhythm of coming and going off again until the end of working life, when these people, worn out already from the age of 40 onwards, are no longer deemed fit for further employment. The distinction often made between the wet and dry season, however, makes sense because wage work carried out in the open air comes to standstill with the outbreak of the monsoon. But the labour process in factories and workshops has a different kind of seasonality. In my fieldwork stints in Gujarat, I found that labour employed, for example, in dyeing and printing mills and power-loom workshops tried to drop out in the heat of summer to recuperate in the village from their burdensome, stressful, noisy, ill-ventilated and hazardous worksites. Instead of seasonal labour migration, circular migration would be the better term for the workforce perpetually though erratically kept adrift. The sliding scale between temporary and permanent movement, coincidental with the unsettled versus the settled switch in the site of work and residence, can only be ex post facto determined. Already for more than two to three generations, India’s politics and policies have insisted that a sizable part of the labouring poor leave their rural abodes and the comfort of their family to earn a meagre livelihood for their household in rural or urban locations far away from home. This is a modern form of nomadism to ensure that the workforce at the bottom of the economy, shorn off social security and protection, can be bought at the lowest possible price and only hired for as long as their services are required. The day after the lockdown order was issued, economic life came to a standstill. An estimated 130 million people lost their jobs, irrespective of how short and precarious these may have been, often even without being paid. A survey by ActionAid towards the end of May 2020 reports that over three-fourths of respondents said that they had lost their livelihood since the imposition of the lockdown. Close to half of the respondents shared that they had not received any wages, while about 17% had received only partial wages. Approximately 53% responded that they had incurred additional debt during the lockdown. More than half of the respondents who had migrated for work were stranded for over a month (ActionAid 2020). A significant detail to add here is that women workers, already highly vulnerable in a saturated labour market, were worse hit than their male counterparts. Women are overrepresented in sectors such as domestic work, construction work, beauty and wellness industry, and sex work, which have seen massive losses of livelihood since the lockdown. Even in the formal sector, women are more likely to be hired on temporary or part-time positions, making it easier for firms to let them go if there is downsizing (ActionAid 2020). Also, the self-employed in the bottom tiers of the economy lost whatever they could do in lieu of a proper job. With no income to spend on their daily needs—food and cost of makeshift or rental accommodation—and fear from the mushrooming virus, the footloose among them, in particular, were eager to return to their places of origin. However, the ban imposed on all modes of transport and any kind of movement prevented them from returning to their native place. Fear of hunger, lack of shelter and fright of becoming infected, left many among them with no other option than to try and bridge the distance on foot. In the first few days after the instructions were issued to stay indoors, the newspapers were filled with pictures of groups of migrants seen walking and hitchhiking along highways in the hope of completing the journey of hundreds of kilometres or more to their homes. At state and district borders, they were stopped and often harassed by the police who refused passage and interred their catch in temporary camps. Most migrants wisely decided to stay put until long-distance transport would resume. When that did not happen, they gathered in hundreds and thousands at railway stations and bus depots or assembled outdoors in street protests. For instance, they gathered thrice between April and June in Surat city clamouring for vehicles or trains to fetch them back to their places of residence. The police responded to this growing unrest heavy-handedly. But the images of this restive and seething mass at least made the low-key presence of these footloose labourers visible to the urban citizenship, hitherto unaware of the sheer size and vulnerability of this alien workforce in their midst.",25

Abella,S. K. Sasikumar,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"It will be a while before the full impact of COVID-19 on incomes and livelihoods of people around the world becomes known and understood, but it is already obvious that those in manual, mostly low-wage, occupations are among the workers most adversely affected. They include not only those who, by the nature of their jobs, are more exposed to the virus than others, such as hospital and nursing home workers and public transport drivers, but also many others who are employed in industries that have suffered from the overall economic meltdown. These encompass a wide variety of occupations from itinerant vendors, store clerks and restaurant workers, to manufacturing workers, farmers and fishermen, traders and truckers, public sanitation workers and the like. In more economically advanced countries, a significant proportion of those employed in these occupations are foreign migrant workers who enjoy few rights, least of all to any job security, and are thus the most likely to have been the first to be laid off, to suffer pay cuts, or not to have been paid at all for previous work (Abella 2020; World Bank - KNOMAD 2020a). In the Gulf countries, these migrant workers make up most of those employed in the private sector and thus constitute the bulk of the total workforce. This paper proposes, by way of example, a method for quantitatively assessing the likely impact of the economic crisis on migrant workers who are on temporary employment in countries hit by the pandemic. It employs a simple estimation model using parameters derived from data collected from a survey by the Global Knowledge Partnership on Migration and Development (World Bank - KNOMAD) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) of 409 low-skilled Indian workers who worked in Saudi Arabia, or were still working there in September 2016.Footnote 1 The survey, one of 19 conducted in 2015 and 2016, was designed to measure migration costs incurred by the migrant workers. It obtained information on, among others, when they started working and for how much longer they expected to work abroad, how much in wages they were offered and how much they actually earned, how much they paid recruiters, brokers and others, and what they paid for fees and other expenses related to their migration, whether they borrowed money, mortgaged properties and how much they paid in interest, how much they remitted home to their families, and under what conditions they worked.Footnote 2",5

Without work or wages, migrant workers were unable to access basic sustenance during the lockdown. As a response, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) issued a circular on 29th March, demanding that employers must pay their wages in full during the period of the lockdown, while an advisory dated 20th March asked establishments to not terminate workers, particularly those employed on contractual or casual basis.Footnote 2 It implicitly recognised access to work and wages as a pre-requisite for the sustenance of workers and their households, and acknowledged the socio-economic value of protecting workers’ rights and wages. This order, however, was withdrawn after a Supreme Court ruling on 12th June 2020, that employers and workers must engage in negotiations to settle disputes around work and wages.Footnote 3 Subsequently, State and Central governments have also taken swift steps to dismantle India’s otherwise robust labour protective framework, arguing that it is an impediment for Indian businesses. Several states have issued ordinances suspending key provisions for government regulation of labour-capital relations, and the central government has promised expedited action to pass and implement proposed labour codes, which have been critiqued for being pro-employer (Sharma 2020). These are not unanticipated moves, they find their basis in decades’ long attempts by successive governments, in the post-liberalisation era, to usher in reforms which assume that the liability of employers to provide for workers has to be weakened for India’s economic growth and its competitiveness in the global market (Jenkins 2004). The policy response of the government to the migrant crisis during the lockdown has been largely limited to announcements on registration, portability through the One Nation One Ration Card and the Affordable Rental Housing Scheme (Koppikar 2020). While these can be potentially useful in addressing vulnerabilities, they have been viewed as an alternative, rather than complementary to labour rights as the employer’s liability to workers. At the same time, the dismantling of the labour protective frameworks largely undermines constitutional rights and central labour legislations which protect all workers, including migrants, and regulate their relationships with employers by placing liability on industry to ensure labour standards (Shyam Sundar and Sapkal 2020). This paper brings forth pre- and post-Covid evidence on labour rights violations facing migrant workers in three urban work sectors—construction, textiles and garments, and hotels and dhabas—in high in-migration cities of Ahmedabad and Surat. It focuses on both waged and non-waged migrant workers in these sectors, cutting across caste and gender intersectionalities. Its scope is limited to evidence gathered by Aajeevika Bureau,Footnote 4 through its legal aid work with migrant workers since 2009 complemented with cases reported to its labour helpline and surveys with migrant workers employed in these sectors, conducted during April–May 2020. The paper maps labour rights violations facing migrant workers against the gaps and inadequacies of labour governance institutions—legislative content, and regulatory bodies responsible for their enforcement such as labour and factories departments, labour courts, and the police, in order to highlight that the migrant crisis during the lockdown was a result of their exclusion from these institutions, forcing them to conduct employment relationships in the extra-legal terrain, governed by adverse norms and practices. It contextualises the migrant crisis within an urban economic model where growth is based largely on the exploitation of migrant workers. It uses this analysis to inform public debate, by highlighting the false dichotomy between responses to the migrant crisis and the labour reforms agenda of the state, which is generated by the logic that economic growth cannot be facilitated without the removal of labour regulations. It concludes by suggesting a policy pathway that facilitates inclusive and equitable economic growth, while attempting to address some of the contentious points in the labour reforms process.",10

As of 12 September 2020, India had recorded 958,316 active cases, with 77,472 deaths (Ministry of Health and Family Welfare 2020a). The rapid spread of this highly contagious disease prompted the Government of India to implement a nationwide lockdown on the 24 March, with strict restrictions on mobility and transportation links summarily cut off overnight. The commencement of the lockdown generated widespread panic among migrants across India’s major cities and states of destination, kicking off concerted attempts to return predominantly to rural hometowns in the states of origin. From the scale of the attempted exodus, it is evident that the government did not account for India’s enormous magnitude of internal migrants, with the four-hour notice preceding the first lockdown taking migrant workers by surprise. The shutdown of commercial activities effectively cut off the primary source of income for many of these labour migrants, leaving them with little or no resources to ride out a twenty-one-day lockdown period which was likely to be the first among a number of consecutive nationwide lockdowns. This paper is divided into five sections. First, the paper gives an overview of the characteristics of internal migration in India in terms of numbers, streams and gender through documentation on existing data. This section lays the foundation of the paper by highlighting how the COVID-19 pandemic affected migrants through an analysis of various strands. Secondly, the paper examines the gendered aspects of COVID-19 on migrant workers, since most of the narratives, albeit limited, were male-centred. The third section gives an account of mental health issues of migrants, and the fourth section highlights the limitations of social security provisions that failed to address the multidimensional vulnerabilities faced by migrants. This section presents an overview of laws and policies related to migration, known vulnerabilities and mobility-related issues, and the larger ‘invisibility’ of the migrants as a key contributor to the unprecedented scale of the crisis during the lockdown. The fifth section examines the roadmap for inclusive migrant policies.",75

Chandrasekhar,Ajay Sharma,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Male,"Three key factors, viz. distribution of economic activity and availability of jobs over space, distance between residence and job location, and the wage differential between source and destination, together determine the decision of workers to either migrate or commute. In addition to these factors, access to transportation, time and monetary cost of transport are important correlates of the decision to commute to work. While the theoretical models on place of residence and job location are fairly standard,Footnote 1 the empirical literature on commuting, in context of developing countries is fairly limited, especially between rural and urban areas. In fact, to this date, much of the literature on worker mobility continues to be migration centric. This is despite the fact that there has been an increase in the number of workers commuting between rural and urban areas. It is also true that the number of daily commuters is as large if not larger than either seasonal or permanent migrants in any year (Chandrasekhar et al. 2017). Additionally with the dependence on non-farm employment and earnings among rural households, commuting has become far more important channel to be understood and facilitated. This paper is a contribution to the literature on two-way rural–urban commuting by workers. We analyse data from Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) 2018–2019 which was conducted by India’s National Statistical Office. In 2018–2019, we estimate that 18.8 million individuals living in rural areas were working in urban India, for 2.3 million urban workers the place of work was rural, and 9.7 and 7.8 million rural and urban workers, respectively, had no fixed place of work. These estimates of commuting are lower bound estimates since they do not include workers commuting within rural areas or inter-city commuters. The importance of rural–urban commuting is evident from the fact that the share of earnings from urban areas in total non-farm rural earnings is 19.3% in 2018–2019. The phenomenon of rural–urban commuting is evident in a diverse group of developing countries.Footnote 2 Various studies have highlighted the importance of proximity to the city for the mobility patterns of rural workers. A recent study in North East Thailand revealed that individuals are willing to travel up to 20 km from the villages in order to work in the factory clusters (Shirai et al. 2019). In Indonesia, rural–urban commuting has been observed within 60-km periphery of industrialized cities (Douglass 2007). A study of two villages from Bihar in India clearly brought out the importance of distance to the city and connectivity (Datta et al. 2014). They find that in Chandkura, a village near Patna, the capital of Bihar, workers were commuting up to 30 km every day while migration was observed in Mahisham, a village which was not near a large city. Apart from proximity to cities, an important determinant of commuting is the wage gradient, i.e. the extent to which wages decline as distance to the city increases. The wage gradient is also a function of the distribution of jobs by industry and occupations along the rural–urban continuum. Based on analysis of data from India Human Development Survey 2004–2005, Sharma (2016) identifies the following patterns in the context of India. First, in locations closer to the city, one is more likely to observer regular wage or salaried individuals or self-employed rather than workers being engaged in agricultural activities. A stylized fact is that income from non-farm activities decreases as distance from urban settlements increase. This pattern is also observed in other countries. Proximity to urban centres is associated with an increase in non-farm employment in Ghana (Diao et al. 2019). Sharma and Chandrasekhar (2016) find that the average wages of rural–urban commuters is the highest followed by workers living and working in rural areas, with rural workers with no fixed place of work having the lowest average wages. Similar results are evident in China. Duvivier et al. (2013) find wages to be higher by 15% in the vicinity of the city as compared to remote hinterland workers. The wage differential and unemployment rate are related. Sharma and Chandrasekhar (2014) find that regional rural and urban unemployment rates and rural–urbanwage differentials are important push and pull factors in the decision to commute. Another consistent finding across developed and developing countries is the relevance of nature of jobs to commuting decisions. Needless to say, the labour market in developed countries greatly varies from that in developing countries. Workers in developed countries have the flexibility in time and place of work which in turn may influence their commuting patterns (Green et al. 1999, Andersson et al. 2018). Commuting has been associated with high skilled workers (Artis et al. 2000; Andersson et al. 2018; Rowe and Bell 2020). Concentration of certain sectors or occupations can influence the commuting behaviour in a region. Rowe and Bell (2020) find that in Chile the most important driver of long-distance commuting is the location and characteristics of mining and construction sector. In the last three decades, India has seen relocation of investments across the rural and the urban (Chakravorty and Lall 2007) resulting in a redistribution of economic activity. These changes can be traced to the process of economic reform ushered in 1991 and in particular relaxation of policies on industrial location. Based on analysis of data from Annual Survey of Industries and Surveys of Unorganized Sector, Ghani et al. (2012) find that formal manufacturing has shifted from urban to rural areas and the converse holds for informal manufacturing. Another study finds dispersal of manufacturing activity with some evidence of higher growth in low-density manufacturing districts (Desmet et al. 2015). This churning has led to delocalization of jobs, emergence of new centres of activity and a myriad of commuting patterns at the sub-national level in India. While data from cross sectional surveys are useful in establishing patterns in commuting, they lack the richness offered by Census data or panel data. While limited information was collected on commuting as part of Census of India 2011, the developed countries have collected detailed data on commuting as part of successive Censuses. Green and Meyer (1997) who analyse data from Canadian Census 1991 found that rural population had remained constant, job opportunities had declined, and this led to workers commuting to urban areas. They refer to the work by Everitt and Gill (1993) who document the emergence of rural “dormitory towns” where the urban workers lived. While such rich descriptions are not possible in the Indian context with either survey or census data, there are insights available from small area panel studies. Heyer (2013) documents that during the course of development of Tiruppur, in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, as a textile hub, there was a change in land use patterns, villages closer to cities underwent transformations, real estate sector grew, and there was an improvement in transport and communications. She characterizes these villages as “important commuter bases for relatively unskilled labour” (p. 311). Rural labour comprising first-generation non-agricultural workers provided cheap unskilled labour to the textile units since the wages were higher than earnings provided by agriculture. The above discussion on commuting patterns of workers, especially between rural and urban areas, highlights that rural labour market conditions, distribution of economic activities, access to urban areas play an important role in the decision to commute. In this paper, we focus on understanding the patterns and determinants of commuting between rural and urban areas to contribute to the existing literature on mobility of workers in developing counties and to complement the studies on migration patterns in the context of India. For our analysis, we use nationally representative survey data from PLFS for the year 2018–2019. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the data set, and in Section 3, we provide key estimates and regional patterns of commuting. In Section 4, we describe the empirical model for determinants of commuting and the main results. Section 5 discusses the policy implications and concludes.",3

The subsequent pictures of these migrants—of men, women, and children—determinedly walking hundreds of kilometres were hauntingly reminiscent of images from the Partition of 1947, the largest mass migration in history of the Indian subcontinent. How do we make sense of this crisis of migration—the mass exodus of workers from India’s cities? Why did migrant workers defy the national lockdown to undertake arduous journeys ‘home’? An analysis of the nature and pattern of this migration can shed some light to these questions. This paper, based on a primary study, focuses on migration from rural Bihar, an important source region of long-distance labour migration in the country. The spatial and structural elements of this migration stream, emphasised in the paper, are important in a context where migration from Bihar is known to be significant, but remains underestimated and understudied, with little being known about its magnitude, patterns, and processes. Migrants are part of India’s invisible workforce. One of the reasons they remain invisible, particularly to policymakers, is that there are no accurate estimates of the extent of migration in India. This is also, one of the reasons, why literally no-one in the corridors of power anticipated the migration crisis that ensued from the lockdown. The two main data sources of migration in India—the National Sample Survey Office and the Census—underestimate the extent of migration in India as they are biased towards long-term migration and unable to properly capture short-term, seasonal, and circular streams. The Census is primarily designed to capture the distribution of population, and the NSSO focuses on labour market attributes. As a result, worker mobility is not a primary area of enquiry for either agency, both of which define migration differently. The Census uses the criteria of change in place of birth and ‘a change in the usual place of residence…with reference to his/ her previous usual residence’ (Census of India 2001). According to the NSS, ‘a household member whose last usual place of residence (UPR) was different from the present place of enumeration was considered as a migrant member in a household’, the UPR of a person being the place where the person had stayed continuously for a period of six months or more (GOI 2010, p. 11). It is pertinent to note that the Census does not collect data on temporary and short-term migration, and the NSS uses a cut-off point of 6 months to define short-term migration. This may not adequately capture circular movements which are longer than six months. It is against the aforementioned policy context of underestimation and in turn, invisibility of migration, that this paper presents patterns of migration from rural Bihar, with an emphasis on precarity of migrant workers. The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 reviews select literature to discuss the embeddedness of circular migration in capitalist development in contemporary India, the role of the household, and the particular contexts of source and destination regions. It then unpacks the concept of circular migration, using empirical studies from the Global South and India. Section 3 details the data and methods used in the study. Section 4 presents key characteristics of migration from rural Bihar from the primary study, emphasising on who migrates from the source region, and Sect. 5 focuses on migrant workers’ location, work, employment, income, and other attributes at destination to show and how precarity is reproduced in destination regions. In view of the findings from the primary study, Sect. 6 concludes, with policy implications that may help better understand the current migration crisis.",6

Woman is dealt with subordinated part of family unit. Thus migration is looked at as migration of a male worker. Women are invisible and subsumed within broader migrant family Lewis (2003). Exodus of migrant workers from different cities in India had suddenly brought the so far invisible issues of migrant workers into light. However, there had been little focus on the crisis faced by women workers as always. Migrant workers, especially women, who work in the lowest tiers of the informal sector, had been living invisible lives in the cities for decades. It was thus no surprise that migrant women were portrayed as mothers by the media and not as workers. The workers’ issues discussed in the public domain portrayed workers as male breadwinners of the families. Women, as Lewis (2003) wrote, were “subsumed within the broader families”. Gender Studies scholars had always raised concerns on the overemphasis of the social angle of women’s migration (Mazumdar et al. 2013). This paper brings forth the work lives of women workers who came to the National Capital Region (NCR)Footnote 1 in search of livelihoods. Their accounts on worklives were captured before the lockdown. The objective of the paper is to understand the structures that influenced organisation of productive-reproductive continuum of migrant informal sector women workers and also to demonstrate the processes of multiple marginalisation. The qualitative data used in this paper are from the dataset of an ongoing research.Footnote 2 It comprises narratives of thirty women workers of whom twenty-eight migrated from villages, and two migrated from small towns. Nineteen of them were Scheduled Caste and four of them were Muslims, which underlined the overwhelming presence of the socially marginalised in the least paid informal sector occupations. Lerche and Shah (2018, 2020) had argued that the spatial geopolitics of uneven development had led to temporary migration of socially marginalised groups who are being exploited in the informal sector. For most women, the first migration was marriage migration, from natal villages to marital villages, only six women came to the city as marriage migrants. This paper only focusses on migration to National Capital Region (NCR), where they were interviewed as informal sector workers. The workers all lived with their families and had reproductive responsibilities.",

63,4,The Indian Journal of Labour Economics,24 October 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41027-020-00238-1,Effect of Remittance on Intergenerational Mobility in Case of Occupation,December 2020,Indra Kant Bharti,Tulika Tripathi,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Recently, it has been a quite popular news that India is the highest remittance-receiving country globally. Remittance is the most important migrant’s resource for intergenerational mobility and causes declines in the social rigidity. Since India is historically stratified into different caste-based occupations (Deshpande 2000), what sociologists call intergenerational occupational mobility as social mobility tied up with inequality of opportunity. A higher movement of intergenerational mobility (IGM) of occupation leads to structural transformation either from individual efforts (parents transfer more human capital endowment to their son by generating more income or receiving remittance) or governmental efforts (more briefly, reservation policy, providing multi-sectoral employment and different welfare policies). It destroys the rigidity of caste-based occupational hierarchy. Empirical evidences have shown that remittances have had mixed results on human capital investment, one which leads to heterogeneous effects on occupational mobility. Remittance and migration shape structural transformation of remained individuals as reallocation of occupation in local labour markets take place. The more pronounced features of remittance arise after the new economic labour migration era (NELM). In this regard, NELM hypothesis asserts that labour migration has two contradictory effects on the labour market of origin. First, remittance reduces the capital/credit and liquidity constraint (Illahi 1999; Dustmann and Kirchkamp 2002; Funkhouser 1992) and reallocates the labour by more investment of remittance on risky and new entrepreneurial activities, generally off-farm activities (Mahe and Naude 2016; Yang 2008; Mesnard 2004; Lucas and Stark 1985). Second, remittance increases the new micro-enterprises, petty business (Woodruff and Zenteno 2007; Cordova and Olmedo 2006) and self-employment in remittance-receiving household (RRH) (Adams 1998; Mansuri 2007; Giulietti et al. 2013). In other words, remittance decreases the probability of wage employment (Piracha et al. 2013). However, there is not a homogeneous association of occupational choice between the flow of remittance and self-employment (Vasco 2013). On the contrary of positive impact of remittance on labour market, remittance increases the dependency ratio of remaining households and creates moral hazard problem like a rise in leisure preference (Chami et al. 2005; Piracha et al. 2013), particularly more in women (Acosta 2007; Lokshin and Glinskaya 2008; Binzel and Assad 2011), decline in the supply of female paid labour and increase in unpaid works (Mendola and Carletto 2006). Similarly, unemployment increases due to higher expected status of the job in RRH; as a result, lower rate of participation in the local labour market (Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo 2006; Justino and Shemyakina 2012; Rodriguez and Tiongson 2001; Funkhouser 1992) or, more precisely, labour loss is due to declines in rural activities (Wouterse and Taylor 2008). However, labour loss is also a subject of conflict because remittance increases the reservation wage, but if the market wage is below reservation wage, the probability of entering in labour market declines for members at the place of origin (Taylor 1999; Killingsworth 1983). On the contrary, opportunities' cost of leisure decreases (therefore the supply of labour increases) due to a rise in reservation wage at par with remittance flow. For example, Chinese migration experience shows that remittances partially compensate the negative loss of labour supply and provide the incentive for farming and self-employment (Taylor et al. 2003; Demurger and Li 2012) or remittance increases the likelihood of working informally from the formal sector if RRH considers more on job security and social guarantee (Abdulloev et al. 2012; Ivleves 2016). There is a wide spectrum of literature focusing on the linkage between remittances and occupational choice, labour market of origin and social relationship. However, all the studies show varying outcomes depending upon the social context, labour market structure, wage rate, etc. Therefore, this study attempts to understand the differential status of IGM of occupation observed between RRH and non-remittance-receiving households (NRRH), across the social group in India, as here social identities are interlinked with any transformation. In this background, the present study highlights the linkage between remittance and occupational choice. Second, it attempts to find out the degree of association between the son's and the father’s occupation and the amount of IGM of occupation (irrespective of the direction of occupational movement) between RRH and NRRH across the social group with the help of Altham Statistics. Third, this study focuses on the depth of IGM of occupation by estimating the upward movement of son’s occupational status. Fourth, it compares the equalisation effect of IGM of occupation through the Theil index. Further, this study explores the equalisation effect of IGM in remittance differential framework which reveals the beneficiary of new occupation opportunity either RRH or NRRH at the lower tail and higher tail of parental occupational background across the social group. Lastly, this study explores the absolute IGM of occupation by a joint amount of structural and exchange mobility of occupation between RRH and NRRH. The earliest study on IGM of occupation by Driver (1962) on Nagpur district shows a negligible effect on the traditional association between position in the castes and occupational hierarchies. However, after the implementation of the Mandal report, there is a new political and academic debate on occupational diversification across different social strata. In this regard, Kumar et al. (2002 pp: 2983) conclude that “there has been no systematic weakening of the links between father’s and son’s class positions. The dominant picture is one of continuity rather than change”. However, they also noticed that Dalits have improved their chances of getting into the salaried class. This finding is also consistent with the study of IGM of occupation on Pune city by Deshpande and Palshikar (2008). According to them, caste does not matter for intergenerational occupational mobility in general and, however, important for upward mobility and extent of mobility has differed across different castes. Intergenerational occupational mobility trend of India shows a considerable amount of inequality of opportunities between SC/ST and non-SC/ST (Motiram and Singh 2012). Similarly, Mazumder (2013) using NSSO (1997 and 2006) data showed a large amount of intergenerational mobility of occupation is lateral and not vertical, and disadvantaged castes have more intergenerational persistence of occupation than advanced castes. In the context of structural and exchange occupational mobility, Ray and Mazumder (2014) find that structural and exchange occupational mobility of advanced class is higher than lagging class, but in the case of male this result is just opposite. On the contrary, Chakravarty (2013) finds an upward occupational mobility in the tribal community. Despite the high economic growth, IGM of occupation is not increasing with the same pace. Reddy (2015) finds that intergenerational occupational mobility of males decreased over three decades (1983–2012) and this declining trend of IGM of occupation was more in SC and ST as compared to non-SC/ST. On the contrary, Hnatkovska et al. (2013) examine the IGM of occupation from 1983 to 2004–2005 and find an increasing trend of occupational mobility and convergence of occupation between non-SC/ST and SC/ST group. Mazumder (2013) analyses IGM of occupation by cohort analysis and finds that the old cohort have more IGM of occupation than the younger cohort. It means increased fluidity among the lagging classes is a recent phenomenon—a possible fall-out of expanded job reservation policies since 1990s. On the contrary, Motiram and Singh (2012) find that the old cohort have lesser IGM of occupation than the younger cohort. Azam and Bhatt (2015) extend this debate across the social group and find that IGM of occupation of a birth cohort of 1965–1984 is more than cohort of 1945–1964. They point out that among the social group, SC/ST group have more IGM of occupation than non-SC/ST in the cohort of 1965–1984, while reverse results from the cohort of 1945–1964 are obtained. This may be interpreted as suggesting a general improvement in occupational and other (e.g. credit) opportunities over time. The IGM of occupation and incidence of the poverty level of households are significantly correlated. In this regard, Ray and Mazumder (2014) find that a higher incidence of poverty is correlated with lower occupational mobility and more upward IGM of occupation from poor households. It means that upward mobility in absolute terms has decreased for both STs and SCs and increased for upper castes. Intergenerational occupational mobility also differs from rural–urban location. For example, results of IHDS 2005–2006 and 2011–2012 suggest that occupational mobility of households from the urban area is more than rural location and higher among non-SC/ST than other social groups (Iversen et al. 2017; Motiram and Singh 2012). Across the different occupational groups, IGM differed in different studies. For example, Hnatkovska et al. (2013) find more intergenerational persistence in the lower occupational group like agriculture. On the upper end, children are moving from white-collar occupations of their father to blue-collar occupations because of an increase in the share of service sectors after reforms. On the contrary, Iversen et al. (2017) find that upward IGM of occupation from individuals engaged in lower-ranked occupation which is increasing from 2004–2005 to 2011–2012. However, they highlighted that less IGM of occupation in the second lowest rank occupation and even it declined from 2004–2005 to 2011–2012. Finally, it is noticed that outcomes of occupational mobility are inconsistent from different studies across social groups or rural–urban or occupational composition. This is mainly due to methodological variation, different databases and non-uniformity of occupation categorisation. India is one of the top remittance-receiving countries in the world. Therefore, economic growth and labour market condition are certainly influenced by the inflow of remittance from both domestic and international channels. At the aggregate level, there is a lack of study on the impact of remittance on occupational mobility in India. However, there is an enormous study on interlinkage between migration, remittance and occupational mobility at micro- or regional level. Deshingkar and Farrington (2006) examine the role of migration and remittance on livelihood promotion from six districts of Bihar and find that migration and remittance are enhancing livelihoods and occupational mobility as remittance is utilised more in agriculture inputs, leasing in agro-land and petty business. Mitra and Pradhan (2016) highlight that the remaining household utilised remittance for more productive investment. They confirm that remaining members are in better paying secondary activities. However, Kerala’s international migration experience shows that remittance promotes new enterprises or existing business and remaining members shift from wage to non-wage work (Khan and Chinnakkannu 2016). They also find gender differential impact on the occupational choice of remittance receiver as remaining male members shift from wage/salary worker to self-employed and females are participating more in household’s duties. Zachariah and Rajan (2005) find that emigration and inward remittance increased the unemployment rate in Kerala due to higher aspiration of occupation which needs more years of education. Keralites are more dependent on remittance leading to an increase in unemployment, a decline in agriculture growth and industrial output (Kannan 2004). Zachariah and Rajan (2016) argues that emigration generally reduces the unemployment rate but the available job is capturing by outsider. Therefore, there is no significant positive correlation between job creations within the state (Kerala) for local residents and emigration/remittance. However, Zachariah and Rajan (2016) highlight that intergenerational upward social mobility of emigrant or remittance-receiving households is more than non-emigrant or non-remittance-receiving households. In short, Indian evidences of migration and remittance show that at micro- and macro-level it determines individual position in the local labour market and their occupational choice. This study is based on secondary data source IHDS 2004–2005 and 2011–2012 which is conducted by NCEAR and University of Maryland. IHDS survey is a longitudinal study, meaning the same households are revisited after seven  years. This helps to observe the intergenerational mobility more closely from households which have a migrant member in the first survey to better examine the change in the occupational pattern of those households in the next survey. In this way, we can capture at least two generational effects of remittance in terms of occupation. However, there are lots of difficulties to trace out the same migrant member in both rounds of the survey; therefore, we are unable to draw a complete set of household’s panels. Our final sample used in the analysis for IGM of occupation of father–son pair in a household is 43362 and 43906, respectively, in 2004–2005 and 2011–2012. Occupational classifications in micro-studies are generally differentiated with convincing and available jobs in a specific location. However, at the aggregate level, there are four most popular categorisations of occupation. Mazumder (2013), Mazumder and Ray (2016) classified occupation into Grade-I (white-collar technical and scientific personnel, professionals and administrative workers), Grade-II (pink-collar clerical, sales and service workers) and Grade-III (blue-collar farmers, production-related workers, transport workers and labourers not elsewhere classified) as in NCO-1968. Similarly, Hnatkovska et al. (2013) classified it into three groups as Mazumder (2013) but included the clerical job in white collar and rest two groups are almost same. Another classification of occupation is formed by Azam and Bhatt (2015) as white collar, skilled/semi-skilled worker, unskilled and farmer on the basis of NCO-68. Iversen et al. (2017) point out some drawbacks in Azam and Bhatt (2015) as granting higher weight on occupational rank for construction workers than manual workers makes it unrealistic. The most acceptable classification of occupation is given by Iversen et al. (2017), which is based on skills as well as social hierarchy. They make six classes of occupation as given in Table 1: This study uses the above-mentioned six occupational groups of Iversen et al. (2017) with some modification. At first for mapping out the occupational hierarchy, we replace the Category-3 by Category-4 because the mean income level of households from higher-status vocational occupations is higher than households engaged in the farm activities as shown by IHDS-2004–2005 and IHDS-2011–2012. Second, we replace some occupation (like goldsmith) from Category-2 to Category-3, because IHDS data do not support the distribution of caste-based occupation. We have used the following equation of IGM; it is based on Euclidean distance “d” that is represented as  where d represents the distance function, h and k are transformation function. Intergenerational mobility is differing with a choice of h and k. This study adopted the standardisation (equal marginal distribution) for the computation of IGM by Altham Statistics (Altham and Ferrie 2007; Long and Ferrie 2007, 2013) as a measure of the distance between row and column association in two contingency tables and also checked the significant pattern of IGM. In the context of IGM of occupations, we report only the quasi-Altham Statistics, i.e. excluding the diagonal element or similar occupation status of both son and father, and then find out the degree of association between son and father’s occupation from identity matrix. Here, we also reported the degree of association between RRH and NRRH, across social groups (Table 2).  The quasi-Altham Statistics shows that there is a significant association between father’s occupation and their son’s occupation in both the groups of RRH and NRRH across all social groups at both points of time, i.e. 2004–2005 and 2011–2012. On the perspective of total intergenerational mobility of occupation, all social groups of RRH are relatively higher than NRRH at both points of time 2004–2005 and 2011–2012 except in the case of minorities (in 2005) and OBC (in 2011). At the aggregate level, in 2004–2005, the total IGM of occupation from RRH is higher than NRRH. However, this pattern vanishes in 2011–2012. The association between father and son’s occupation in remittance-receiving matrix does not significantly differ from the association between father’s and son’s occupation from non-remittance-receiving matrix across all social groups at both points. Therefore, it cannot reject the association between remittance receiving and not receiving across the social group. It means that there is a similar pattern of intergenerational mobility of occupation on the remittance differential. The Quasi-Altham Statistics gives only the amount of IGM and does not tell us a pattern of movement. Therefore, we need to explore the upward direction of IGM of occupation. Upward IGM shows the movement of true status from observed status by shifting in their rank by lower to upper or upper to lower quintile, decile or percentile. In this regard, perfect positive (+ 1) correlation (Spearman) shows that a higher level in the status of son’s occupation is highly associated with a corresponding higher level of father’s occupation as well. On the contrary, a perfect negative (− 1) correlation shows a lower level of son’s occupation status is highly associated with a corresponding low level of father’s occupation. If there is a perfect correlation (+ 1, − 1), then there will not be a case of intergenerational mobility but stickiness. In this case, IGM is measured by Spearman correlation (1 − ρ), where 0 < ρ<1 implies upward positional mobility (IGM varying from 0 to 1) and ρ < 0 indicates downward positional mobility (IGM more than 1). Upward IGM is measured as It is evident from Fig. 1 that remittance has played an important role in the improvement of son’s occupational status across all social groups as shown by the black bar between RRH and NRRH at both points of the year: 2004–2005 and 2011–2012. During this period, upward IGM of occupation is almost similar along with a little increase in their range across social groups. Upward occupational IGM in 2011–2012 varies from 0.56 to 0.75, which remained in the range of 0.58 to 0.72 across the social group (2004–2005). Source: Constructed by author, from IHDS 2004–2005 and 2011–2012 Upward intergenerational occupational mobility among the social group. Note (1) Black bar shows the IGM from RRH is bigger than NRRH and vice versa in the case of empty bar In the 2004–2005, utilisation of remittance for the improvement of occupation status was highest for general caste, followed by SC/ST, minority and OBC. But in 2011–2012, this was highest for OBC followed by general caste, SC/ST and minority. It is also noticed that a positive role of remittance significantly increased from 2004–2005 to 2011–2012, highest in the OBC and least effective for minority. Upward IGM of occupation does not have a unique pattern of social order in either 2004–2005 or 2011–2012 in the context of remittance differential. Among the remittance receiver in 2004–2005, the general caste has the highest upward IGM of occupation followed by SC/ST, OBC and minority. But in the 2011–2012, positional IGM of occupation is highest among the OBC followed by SC/ST, general caste and then minority. Again, here it is noticed that in both periods, the remittance receiver of minority has the lowest positional IGM among social groups, while by the percentage methods it is seen only in the case of minority, RRH have more upward IGM of occupation than NRRH. This mismatch result is mainly due to the fact that upward IGM (percentage method) originated from a relatively less upward rank of occupation. However, if the actual position of occupation has been not changed, then some person feels that they are upwardly or downwardly mobile to their counterpart. Therefore, we need a relative measure of convergence of IGM of occupation. An equalisation approach method of IGM reveals the overall improvement or welfare in society. It shows whether the distribution of average father–son occupational status is more or less equitable or not, rather than focusing solely on the father’s occupation. According to Krugman (1992) if mobility is very high, then degree of inequality is unimportant because income (occupation) in the longer term becomes more evenly distributed, which in turn tends to increase in income (occupation) mobility of people, further leading to greater equitability in the distribution of lifetime. Fields (2004) measured the extent of equalisation in the following way:  where Ia = average of inequality index of average father–son occupation status, If = inequality in the occupation status of the father. The insight of an equalisation approach is that, in the case of upward mobility (ϵ > 1), inequality in the average father–son’s occupation (long term) will be smaller than inequality in only the father’s occupational status (short term). On the other hand, in such types of cases of equalisation if ϵ > 1, then the pattern of intergenerational occupational mobility shows the direction of di-equalisation. Further, the equalisation pattern of occupation has also been examined under generalised entropy-based indices like Theil (a = 0) and Theil (a = 1). A large positive change in “a” is sensitive to occupational distribution of the upper tail of father; a lower negative change in “a” is sensitive to the lower tail of father’s occupation. It is evident from Fig. 2 that overall social welfare in the context of IGM of occupation has increased at both points (2004–2005 and 2011–2012) in either RRH or NRRH, at both lower and upper ends largely for SC–ST. In the context of remittance differential, it has been found that the RRH of general caste and SC/ST have a more equalisation effect than NRRH at both lower and upper parental occupations, and opposite is the case in OBC (no difference at upper parental occupation strata) and minority in 2004–2005. While in 2011–2012, except minority, other remittance receiver social groups have a more equalisation effect than NRRH at both lower and upper parental occupations, between 2004–2005 and 2011–2012, the more interesting change of equalisation effect has occurred in OBC; they have highest positive distance between RRH and NRRH than other social groups at both lower and upper parental occupations.

Note (1) GE (0), RRH: IGM of the remittance-receiving households from the lower parental occupational background and GE (0), NRRH shows the same pattern but from non-remittance-receiving households. (2) GE (1), RRH: IGM of the remittance-receiving households from the higher parental occupational background and GE (1), NRH: same pattern for non-remittance-receiving households Further, the equalisation effect of IGM of occupation suggests that remittance has played a positive role in the reduction of inequality for the current generation than the previous generation. However, as compared to time movement (2004–2005 to 2011–2012), it is found that at the lower strata of parental occupation, the same amount of equalisation effect is occurring among RRH (0.24 points) and slightly increasing at upper strata of parental background for RRH (019 to 0.20 points) and NRRH (0.14 to 0.16 points), respectively. It also shows the desirable outcome as equalisation effect of RRH from lower parental occupation background is more than higher parental occupation background in both the points. Hence, in this way we can say that remittance plays an important role in the IGM of occupation. These results are consistent with Haan (2006) argument that remittance removes the disparities and equalisation of development particularly from the well-integrated labour market. Previous three methods of IGM only captured the differential amount of change in occupational status of son among different social groups with remittance differential but does not highlight reasons behind IGM of occupation. Therefore, we need to explore the structural (infrastructure opportunities) and exchange (policy initiates) mobility which one is most suitable for the role of remittance and casual mechanism of IGM of occupation. Structural mobility shows that IGM of occupation increases due to social and economic developments with the establishment of infrastructure; this provides an equal amount of opportunity to all. Such quantitative and qualitative alteration in socio-economic structure is also the result of changing demand for various kinds of jobs and skills or qualifications required. In this context, Mazumdar (2013) argues that structural enhancement provides more opportunity to the future generation than the past generation. Therefore, differences of distributions between father’s and son’s occupation express a certain amount of occupational mobility and mobility patterns, but it is not indicative of openness of society and such mobility is treated as structural mobility (Boudon 1973; Matras 1975). However, structural mobility between two different societies may be expressed to be the same amount from the purview of equal marginal distribution; however, it could still be different if we take into account how the families interchange their relative positions in terms of the amount of exchange mobility (Checchi and Dardanoni 2002). In other words, exchange mobility occurs from the difference between individual skills, talents and desires (McClendon 1977) and not due to equality of structural opportunity but reflected by social fluidity or openness of society. Therefore, exchange mobility highlights the change of individual’s position through substitutions resulting from filling up of the positions left vacant by the sons who do not inherit their father’s occupation. This substitution occurs even independent of structural change (Ray and Mazumdar 2014). In these circumstances, geographical location or territorial boundary and migration restriction also influence son’s occupation status without dependency on their father’s occupation status. The aggregate amounts of structural and exchange mobility are represented by absolute mobility. Therefore, at first the absolute mobility is presented and then the structural and the exchange component are discussed. Similar to structural and exchange mobility, absolute mobility is also measured with the McClendon (1977) methods as follows: If there is a perfect association between father’s and son’s occupation (zero exchange mobility), then absolute mobility represents only growth in educational infrastructure in different societies. However, at the individual level, absolute IGM will simply be the sum of exchange and structural mobility, but at the societal level it depends on both the sum of exchange and structural mobility with twice the covariance between exchange mobility and structural mobility. In this context, we see that if inequality of the father is greater than inequality of the son (σs < σf), there is positive covariance between exchange and structural mobility; the opposite case would warrant negative covariance. Therefore, absolute mobility may be more than the sum of exchange and structural mobility, or absolute mobility may be less than exchange mobility. Further, absolute mobility simply suggests that if there is a positive trade-off between structural and exchange mobility, then the occupational status of the son in the labour market is increasing. But in the case of a negative trade-off between them, absolute mobility is lower than exchange mobility and son’s aspiration or skills are mismatched with structural opportunity. By the decomposition of absolute IGM of occupation into structural and exchange mobility (Table 3), we can understand that in both the year 2004–2005 and 2011–2012, absolute intergenerational mobility of occupation has been less than exchange mobility across all social groups for RRH or NRRH. It’s also seen that structural mobility of occupation is negligible and lower than the exchange occupational mobility as inequality within son’s occupational status is more than father occupational status. In other words, more or less supply of training institutions and aspirations of higher occupation are not matching with structural reform in the labour market for all social groups whether RRH or NRRH. Similarly, in all groups, upward structural mobility is more than upward exchange mobility of occupation, i.e. there is a lack of skilled labour or self-effort to fill the higher occupational status demand after globalisation. Most importantly, it is seen that insignificant structural mobility is due to almost equal amount of structural upward and downward mobility for both RRH and NRRH (though RRH have relatively less structural mobility than NRRH). Therefore, one needs to further investigate the impact of remittance on upward structural and upward exchange mobility in the context of IGM of occupation.  Here, structural and exchange mobility as measured (at the societal level, not individual level) from McClendon (1977) methods is given below: Exchange immobility occurs if Zy = Zx, since exchange mobility is associated with relative mobility such as Σ(Zx − Zy) = 0 and (Zx − Zy) is free from structural mobility. Then, At the societal level, structural and exchange mobility is derived from the second moment of distribution of exchange and structural distribution. where \(\bar{X}\) is the mean score of occupation of son, \(\bar{Y}\) is the mean score of occupation of father, σs stands for standard deviations of son’s occupation, σf means the standard deviations of father’s occupation and ρ represents the correlation between the son’s and the father’s occupation. Structural movement or structural mobility is obtained by deducting the sum of matched pair from total mobility. For obvious reasons, exchange mobility has an equal amount of upward and downward mobility. (Son from above average father’s occupation would have downward exchange mobility, and son from lower-level father’s occupation would have upward exchange mobility.) So, exchange upward mobility (EUM) is half of the total exchange mobility, while structural upward mobility (SUM) is measured by upward mobility (OUM) minus EUM (Mazumder and Ray 2016). Several empirical works (Checchi et al. 2008; Mazumder 2013; Azam and Bhatt 2014 and Mazumder and Ray 2016) on IGM show that the importance of exchange mobility is more than structural mobility because of its relevance on equality of opportunity among the social group. However, structural mobility is biased to the uppermost social section and trickle-down generally takes a lot of time. Therefore, upward structural mobility is important for the transformation of society’s growth, whereas upward exchange mobility holds relevance for policy interventions. Across all the social groups, upward structural mobility is more than upward exchange mobility of occupation, i.e. there is a lack of skilling or self-effort to fill the higher occupational demand after globalisation. However, earlier we see that overall structural mobility of occupation is insignificant as compared to exchange mobility. Now, it is evident from Fig. 3 that there is a meagre amount of remittance differential of upward exchange mobility of occupational change across the social group at both points of time 2004–2005 and 2011–2012. It means remittances have not influenced significantly the upward exchange mobility (i.e. lower aspiration of higher-status occupation by workers from remittance households). On the contrary, positive remittance differential of structural upward mobility of occupation has been seen in the minority (11.53%) and SC/ST (1.45%) at an earlier point (2004–2005). Later in 2011–2012, not a single social group has positive remittance differential of structural upward mobility of occupation. Further at the aggregate level, the structural upward mobility of occupation of remittance receiver is lower than non-remittance receiver at both points of time 2004–2005 and 2011–2012; and this negative amount of remittance differential is increasing from − 1.45 to − 1.65%. However, this cross-sectional remittance of differential exchange and structural upward mobility of occupation is not explaining the real amount of change from 2004–2005 to 2011–2012. Therefore, we need to explore the temporal effect of remittance on upward structural and exchange mobility of occupation across social groups.

At the aggregate level, there is no significant difference between RRH and NRRH. On the other side, remittance increases the structural upward mobility of occupation from 2004–2005 to 2011–2012 in RRH of the minority. However, during the same period, the structural upward mobility of occupation of NRRH has been also increased but lower than RRH except in SC/ST. It means utilisation of structural opportunities remittance is very effective by OBC followed by general caste and SC/ST individuals.

Migration is considered a response to better returns to human capital and can lead to an improvement in the occupational status of the worker. Return migrationFootnote 1 is viewed as an integral part of temporary labour migration when people migrate to take up contract employment in the receiving country (Zhao 2002) or when they migrate with an intention to return to the home country. On the one hand, there is evidence to suggest that work experience and skills gained abroad can improve the occupational choices available for the individual post-return in the home country. Assuming return migration entails the accumulation of physical capital and skill augmentation, and if the proportion of those who return is large enough, aggregate output and even output per capita may increase in the source economy (Dustmann et al. 2011; Arif 1998). The literature posits that this dual flow of physical and human capital potentially gives the push to economic growth and development in the receiving economy.Footnote 2 However, there is empirical evidence to suggest that most of the jobs available to temporary labour migrants in the receiving countries are at the lower rungs of the occupational ladder. Since these jobs pay five to eight times higher than the earnings of these workers at home (Addleton 1991), they willingly occupy lower-skill jobs, thereby possibly ‘deskilling’ themselves; a process whereby overseas workers lose previously held skills (Stahl 1983; Smart et al. 1984). This could make it difficult to re-integrate, let alone move upward, into the domestic labour market post-return. Hence, the effect of migration on occupational mobility of workers is diverse and continues to be an empirical question that needs further examination. In this context, this paper attempt to analyse the occupational transitions of temporary emigrant workers from Kerala over the three phases of their migration cycle—pre-emigration, while abroad and post-return—taking the case of workers from the highly migrating state of Kerala in India. The study hopes to add evidence to the impact of migration on workers’ occupational mobility.

In neoclassical economics, regulation is perceived as intervention in the free market mechanism, which hurts investment, efficiency and productivity (Deakin 2014). In mainstream economics, labour market is assumed to be a self-adjusting market with a natural tendency to bounce back to equilibrium if uninterrupted. Labour regulation is perceived as state intervention, which interrupts the functioning of an otherwise free market. This view has encouraged different countries to go for deregulation policies, which result in a worldwide decline of collective bargaining and enforce a flexible employment protection law (Deakin 2014). Does labour regulation benefit or hurt workers? This question was extensively discussed in the literature, especially to address the issue of unemployment. A large body of empirical literature has blamed stringent labour regulation for the existence of massive unemployment in Europe (e.g. Saint-paul 2004; Nickell and Leyard 1999). Labour market institution comprises a multidimensional aspect of employment relation. It includes minimum wage, unemployment benefit, employment protection legislation (EPL) and other firm and union contracts. Holmund (2014) provided an account of the development both in the empirical as well as in the theoretical literature regarding labour market institutions, particularly with respect to minimum wage (MW), unemployment insurance (UI) and employment protection legislation (EPL) from 1960 till 2012. The pervasive consequence of minimum wage on unemployment was advocated in several studies (e.g. Manning 2003; Burdett and Mortensen 1998; Neumark and Wascher 1992). But according to Holmund (2014), this pervasive result is the consequence of neoclassical assumption of a downward-sloping labour demand curve. Alternatively, a rise in minimum wage was found to increase the employment in some studies; notably, among them was by Card and Krueger (1994). The employment protection legislation (or EPL in short) provides social security for the worker for any unfair dismissal. The nature and rules regarding employment protection legislation vary between permanent jobs, temporary works to collective dismissal (Skedinger 2010). The OECD Job Study (1994) encouraged its member to increase the flexibility of the labour market by reducing the employment protection legislation but failed to provide any rigor econometric justification for the pervasive impact of the employment protection legislation (Pissarides 2001). What are the economic consequences of the employment protection legislation? In the standard theoretical model of the labour demand function, employment protection legislation increases the adjustment costs, hiring and firing costs of labour (Oi 1962; Nickell 1978, 1986; Hamermesh and Pfann 1996; Bertola 1990, 1992). High bargaining power through employment protection legislation might increase the wage and hence decline the employment (Lazear 1990; Lindbeck and Snower 1988). The pioneering work by Lazear (1990) used 22 different countries for the period 1956–1984 and found that unemployment is higher for the countries with stringent employment protection legislation. There are several studies that blamed stringent labour regulation for the poor performance of employment in Indian manufacturing industries. During 1999–2010 and especially in the latter half of the decades, Kapoor (2014) found an increasing trend of capital intensity in most of the three-digit manufacturing sectors. Increasing labour regulation and employment protection legislation are blamed to be responsible behind firm’s decision of moving towards capital intensive mode of production. Another pitfall of the stringent labour regulation highlighted in the paper is an increasing trend of contractualization of the workforce. Hasan and Jhandoc (2014) categorized states as flexible and inflexible states and found that labour-intensive industries residing in inflexible states are found to operate with small size, whereas big size firms are found to operate in flexible states. One of the major trends found in employment in the Indian industry is the increase in contractualization and temporary works in the labour market (Ramswamy 2015; Sharma 2006). Ramaswamy (2015) found an increase in the incidence of contractualization with the increase in the flexibility of the labour regulation. On a similar note, Goldar (2012) found an increase in contract labour with more labour market reforms. Goldar used the labour market regulation index constructed by Dougherty (2009). Hasan et al. (2003) reported that labour demand elasticity increases with the reduction in protection but conditioned to the labour market institution. States with more flexible labour regulation experience a larger increase in labour demand elasticity as compared to states with inflexible labour regulation. For an excellent survey of the existing literature, see Bhattacharjea (2019). The existing literature observes two important reactions from the firm to evade the stringent labour regulations; one, to operate in the unorganized sector below a particular threshold level to avoid labour regulation; two, hiring contract labour who does not get covered under labour regulation. The current paper tries to analyse the impact of labour regulation on employment in three-digit organized manufacturing industries in India. Rigidity in labour law is captured with reference to the state-level labour amendments. Using a modified Besley and Burgess’s (2004) index, states are classified as pro-worker, pro-employer and neutral states. Modification of the existing Besley and Burgess’s (2004) index is done with reference to Bhattacharjea’s (2006, 2009) criticisms. The paper is organized as follows; Section 1 provides the introduction with the background of some relevant studies. This section also motivates the current research work. Section 2 and 3 explore the employment dimensions for the three-digit manufacturing sector across Indian states. Section 4 discusses the background of the issues of labour marke regualtion in India and suggest labour market regulation index (LMR) for 12 major states in India using a modified Besley and Burgess’s (2004) index. Section 5 explores the data and methodology for our empirical strategy. The estimation of the employment function after stationary chack is done in Sect. 6. Fisher's type of unit root test is discussed in Sect. 7 and 7.3 discusses the result of our epirical estimation. The issue of dyamic panel is brought in Sect. 8 and 9 concludes our paper.",

Of the hierarchically ordered caste system in India, Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) find themselves at the bottom. On the other hand, Muslims, India’s largest religious minority, are one of the socially deprived and economically backward communities (GOI, 2006). There is evidence of persistence—in fact increasing correspondence between economic deprivation and social identities, with disadvantaged identities STs, SCs, and Muslims at the lower end of the hierarchy as compared to Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and Hindu upper castes (Kannan, 2019). These identities affect the labor market outcomes as well. The effects may be seen both at the entry level and at post-entry level in the labor market. For example, Deshpande and Newman (2007) find Dalit candidates during job interviews are asked unnecessary questions about their family background, while a non-Dalit is never asked. Thorat and Attewell (2007) found that Muslims and Dalits have lower odds of being called for interviews than an equivalently qualified Hindu upper caste. Similarly, evidence pertains to wage disparity being explained by social identities (Madheswaran and Attewell, 2007). Given the pervasiveness of caste and religious identities on labor market outcomes, we attempt to study the occupational segregation in the context of these identities. We consider occupational segregation worth discussing because an individual’s occupation is an important and better indicator of long-term economic status than annual earnings (Spriggs and Williams, 1996). Also, segregation can explain differences in working conditions, workplace benefits, types of job contract and other social security benefits. What is the extent of occupational segregation and what implications does it have in terms of socio-economic status for socio-religious groups in India? This is the question that the paper tries to understand. Our paper contributes to the existing literature from India on segregation in many ways. First, to our knowledge, our paper is the first attempt to measure occupational segregation among socio-religious groups not considered hitherto. We consider Hindu and Muslim, Hindu others and Muslim others, Hindu OBC and Muslim OBC, Muslim OBC and Muslim others, and lastly Hindu ST/SC and Muslim OBC, as five pairs of socio-religious categories for the analysis. We present the analysis for four segments: rural male, rural female, urban male, and urban female. Secondly, we introduce status of employment and levels of education as two differentiators and then measure the segregation. Thirdly, we give a preliminary analysis of state-wise segregation by religious status. Fourthly, we study the characteristics of occupations into which socio-religious groups are segregated. This allows us to understand the long-term implications of segregation on socio-economic status of the groups. The paper is organized under the following sections: the next section reviews the existing literature on occupational segregation, Sect. 3 offers an overview of the employment situation of different socio-religious communities with special focus on Muslims, Sect. 4 describes our data source and methods of analysis, Sect. 5 presents results, and the last section concludes the paper.",

After the recession in 2008, merchandise trade recorded its strongest growth in 2017, with trade growth to GDP growth averaging to a high 1.5 (WTO, 2018). The world has witnessed growing trade liberalisation and globalisation with trade accounting for sixty per cent of world’s GDP (ILO/WTO 2009), implying a strong connection with trade and employment generation. It is generally agreed that trade strengthens the economies leading to greater integration with the world, generating employment opportunities and propelling growth. On the other hand, there is some evidence that informality may lead to inequality and inefficiency, preventing the countries to move up the global value chains (ILO/WTO 2009). Since the informal sector in most of the developing countries involves a significant proportion (one half to three quarters) of the non-agricultural population (Chen 2012), consequences of trade reforms for this sector become an important area of research for policy formulations and implementation. Before analysing the theoretical and empirical nature of the relationship between trade and informality, it is important to define informality. The term informality has been defined and redefined over the years. The earliest informal definition of the informal sector was given by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in 1972, which included small unregistered enterprises. It has then been formalised to create a more universally acceptable definition by the Fifteenth International Conference of Labour Statisticians, 15th ICLS, in 1993, to regard the informal sector as a group of production units which according to the definitions and classifications provided in the United Nations system of national accounts form part of unincorporated enterprises owned by the households. The more recent ILO (2009) definition of informal economy refers to “all remunerative work—both self-employment and wage employment—that is not recognised, regulated or protected by existing legal or regulatory frameworks and non-remunerative work undertaken in an income-producing enterprise”. Broadly, informality measures that share of a country’s production of goods and services, that does not comply with any government regulation. Due to data constraints, it is difficult to measure the size of the informal economy, which acts as a limitation to get an accurate estimate of the same. This paper makes use of two alternative approachesFootnote 1 to measure informality for the BRICS nations. The first is the macro-eclectic approach of Kauffmann and Kaliberda (1996), who attribute any changes in the size of the informal economy to any discrepancy between an indicator of overall economic activity (such as electricity consumption) and official gross domestic product. Growth rate of electricity consumption indicates the evolution of total gross domestic product as it is highly correlated with economic activity. Any difference between the growth rate of electricity consumption and growth rate of official domestic product reflects the changes in the size of the informal economy. The second is Medina and Schneider’s (2018) shadow economy estimates (henceforth referred to as Schneider’s estimates), derived as measures of informal production based on the Currency Demand Approach (CDA) and Multiple Indicator Multiple Cause (MIMC) models using excess currency demand and latent variable methodologies. Both the measures of informality are subject to limitations: (a) they may not capture those activities that use little or no energy and use other energy sources. Hence, a part of the informal activity may not be covered; (b) the elasticity of money demand to GDP or electricity to GDP may not remain stable over time across countries. However, despite these limitations, these measures have been found to correlate well (Fugazza and Fiess 2010). This paper attempts to explore the pertinent issue of the impact of trade liberalisation on informality of the BRICS nations, by employing both the informality measures in parallel. Though, there have been several attempts to study this relationship for a set of developing countries (Fugazza and Fiess, 2010; ILO/WTO 2009) and for individual countries (Kucera et al. 2010; Sinha and Adam 2006; Goldberg and Pavenik 2003), but not for a specific study for the BRICS nations. This study uses three indicators of trade liberalisation to test the impact on two measures of informality. Overall, the empirical results suggest a rise in informality due to higher trade volumes and a decreasing incidence of informality with higher government efficiency. The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 reviews the main theoretical and empirical links between trade and informality. Section 3 briefly describes the trade policies of the BRICS nations and the individual empirical studies. Section 4 describes the data, variables and econometric methodology. Results are presented in Section 5. Conclusion is given in Section 6. Two main theoretical models provide useful insights through which trade openings can impact the informal sector, namely the Heckscher–Ohlin model and the Harris–Todaro framework. The Heckscher–Ohlin model suggests that a country will have a comparative advantage in the production of the commodity which makes intensive use of the country’s abundant factor of production. A country with abundant low-skilled labour will therefore, have a comparative advantage in the production of labour-intensive commodities. Further, on average, a rise in the relative price of a good will lead to an increase in the return to the factor that is used more intensively in the production of that good” (Stolper–Samuelson theorem). Thus, if low-skilled labour is the abundant factor, low-skilled wages should rise. Since many developing countries are abundant in low-skilled labour, these countries will have a comparative advantage in low-skilled labour-intensive goods. In theory, the Heckscher–Ohlin model can be applied to the economies which produce two goods, informal (labour intensive) and formal goods. As low-skilled workers produce the informal commodity, they should benefit with trade. Empirical results, however, have not been able to validate the theoretical links between trade and actual informal sector dynamics as predicted by the Heckscher–Ohlin model. An alternative application of the Heckscher–Ohlin model is provided by Marjit, Kar and Beladi (2007), who show that trade liberalisation will be followed by an increase in informal sector wages and employment only if formal and informal labour market segments exist for both import competing and export-oriented goods and capital is mobile across the formal and informal sector. In this setting, if trade liberalisation leads to a decrease in capital prices, it may lead to a contraction of the formal sector and aggregate informal employment may witness an increase. Under the Harris–Todaro framework, there exists a dual economy consisting of a formal sector and an inferior agrarian/rural/informal sector. Under this conventional view, trade liberalisation is expected to lead to a rise in informality. Trade liberalisation, perceived as a source of greater competition for domestic producers, leads to a rise in informality as workers from the formal market are laid off to cut costs, to be replaced by informal workers. Though, this view has been challenged, indicating that informality is neither a residual (Hart 1972), nor is it solely, a result of a negative shock to the economy (Fiess 2002; 2008). In addition to the above theoretical models, the literature highlights numerous mechanisms through which trade liberalisation can impact informality. Supporting the conventional view, Goldberg and Pavenik (2003) show that trade reforms can lead to higher competition, leading to uncertainty in product demand, causing the formal sector to contract and informal employment to increase. However, this impact depends on the degree of labour market flexibility: the less the flexible labour markets, the greater the reallocation from the formal to the informal sector. However, some studies predict a negative relationship between trade and informality. Firms could move from the informal sector to the formal sector as trade costs decline with trade liberalisation. The least productive informal firms will exit the industry, whereas the productive firms would export to international markets. Trade reforms could therefore, lead to a fall in the incidence of informality and an improvement in productivity levels (Aleman and Castella 2006). On the other hand, there may not be a link between trade and informality. If the formal and informal sectors are disconnected, there may not be any change at all in the informal wages post-trade reforms (ILO/WTO 2009). Clearly, the relationship between trade and informality is complicated and there is no direct or uniform mechanism through which trade reforms can impact the informal sector, which makes it an empirical issue. Recently, the relationship between trade and informality has generated a lot of attention particularly for developing economies. The cross-country empirical investigations provide a mixed picture of the relationship between trade and informality: Investigations of Asian, African and Latin American countries give varied and country-specific results with only a few countries showing an increase in informality (informal employment) with trade reforms such as reduction in tariffs (ILO–WTO 2009). Similarly, the implications for the informal sector following trade liberalisation are not so straightforward when tests are done at the micro- and macro-level separately for a set of 32 countries. The results are different for both levels. The investigations on micro-level data reveal that informal employment and output fall following trade liberalisation, whereas tests on macro-data show a positive impact on informal output. Trade openings are more generally associated with an increase in the productivity of informal workers (Fugazza and Fiess 2010). Micro-level, country-specific analysis by most of the studies reveals that the relationship between trade and informality is country specific and depends on a lot of issues within the countries such as labour markets flexibility, degree of capital movement between formal and informal sectors and the level of economic development (Goldberg and Pavenik 2003; Sinha and Adam 2006; Kucera et al. 2010; Marjit, Kar and Sarkar 2003; Marjit and Maiti 2005; Temkin and Vizaga 2010; Banga and Bathla 2012). Given the heterogeneity in empirical results, there is a significant scope to further test this relationship.",

Governments continuously monitor differences that may be found in the labor market and that are not due to significant variations in the underlying characteristics that are relevant to the labor market, i.e., education or professional experience. Where such practices exist, there is evidence of discriminatory practices and ineffective policies that seek to reduce those (Cunningham and Jacobsen 2004). Discrimination in the labor economy occurs when one group is treated differently from another, despite presenting the same characteristics that reflect their productivity (Arrow 1971; Botello and Guerrero-Rincón 2017; Grandner and Gstach 2015). Consequently, employers with discriminatory preferences will want to hire relatively more locals and relatively fewer immigrants. They will also pay wages that are higher than the productivity of locals and lower than those of immigrants are. For Becker (1957), these labor preferences are not optimal because they cause cost overruns and diminish the benefits of discriminatory employers. These phenomena are important when discussing the economic integration of immigrants into the host country’s labor market. In Ecuador, this debate has resumed with the massive influx of close to one million Venezuelan immigrants in the last 3 years. In Venezuela, there has been a progressive deterioration of social indicators; therefore, hundreds of thousands of people have migrated mostly by land to different countries. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR 2018), 3.9 million Venezuelans have left their country since 2015, and 3.1 million of them have remained in Latin America. The net movements reported by INE show that between 2016 and 2018, 244,000 Venezuelans have entered, including 114,000 women and 130,000 men. These net entries were 80% of the total movements that Ecuador received during the same period of time (UNHCR 2018). Given that the labor market is a determining factor in the generation of income, studies on wage gaps are part of the above-mentioned discussion. According to the Chiswick model (1978), the human capital that immigrants bring to the destination country is often not fully transferable because of differences in labor markets, as they demand different skills or require different qualifications (Cepeda Emiliani and Barón 2012). Consequently, it is a fact that immigrants experience disadvantages in terms of wages or participation in the destination country (Ludsteck 2010). However, research shows convergence of immigrant wages towards the income of the national population. This is mainly due to the accumulation of endowments that fit the local labor market (Borjas and Cassidy 2020; Kushnirovich 2015). For short-term effects, the model considers human capital, and not discrimination, as a fundamental ingredient in understanding wage differentials. In this sense, productivity determines workers’ wages. Since Mincer (1974), human capital, understood as the set of skills and abilities, has been linked to a worker’s productivity levels. Nevertheless, this knowledge must be proven through formal institutions. Then, it should be that immigrants with greater human capital receive higher wages; however, employers may consider as invalid the degrees obtained in their country of origin (Semyonov et al. 2015). Thus, for employers in the destination country, the nullity or low transferability of these titles is synonymous with low human capital and therefore, they are paid less (Domínguez et al. 2019) Empirically, when adjusting education levels, the difference in income between the groups should be statistically slight or zero. However, if it remains, it will be an indication of discrimination (Nielsen et al. 2004). Similarly, employers may not have enough information about immigrants’ skills, which leads them to underestimate their productivity (Nielsen et al. 2004; Fang and Moro 2011). This same lack of information may lead to immigrants being assigned low-skill, low-paid jobs (Stier and Levanon 2003). This situation leads to limited possibilities of accumulating human capital. Then, there is a feedback of events where low qualification and lack of information can cause immigrants to be treated differently from locals, which in turn prevents them from improving their human capital (Titelbach et al. 2013). Turning to the issue of discrimination, within the parametric approach, it is calculated as the effect derived from differences in performance shows the difference between the actual and potential salary that an immigrant would earn when he or she had the same characteristics as native-born persons or members of other advantaged groups (Botello 2015; Peña and Wills 2010). This effect is often referred to as “unexplained” and is used to assess the degree of integration into the labor market (Light and Rosenstein 1995). According to Berson (2016) and Calderón and Marshall (2005), the degree of competition for labor in the market also plays a role in the existence or otherwise of discriminatory practices. Discrimination is low where the demand for immigrant labor is elastic. This may be due to high competition for workers. On the demand side, immigrants may have difficulty in accessing job offers and therefore, fewer potential employers (Ohlert et al. 2016). Results have been shown to support this theory, where more intense competition reduces wage differences by race (Peoples and Talley 2001; Bergmann 1974) and by gender (Heinze and Wolf 2010; Machin and Puhani 2003). Trade unions and collective agreements also play an important role in wage setting. Therefore, inequality is generally lower among workers covered by collective agreements (Fitzenberger and Kohn 2006; Madden 2000), but it is unlikely that migrants have had the opportunity to join such associations in the short term (Ohlert et al. 2016). On the other hand, according to Heilbrunn and Kushnirovich (2015), while differences in endowments may not be allocated to discrimination, access to opportunities to acquire them may be due to this. Different treatment implies wage discrimination, but also different promotion possibilities and different access to management positions (Grandner and Gstach 2015). As right now, there is no empirical research that estimates the wage gap among migrants in Ecuador. It is also estimated how this differential evolves as migrants are incorporated into society. This research aims to contribute to the literature by calculating both parametric and nonparametric estimators of hourly wage inequality between Venezuelan and native migrants who have entered the labor market between 2016 and 2019. To achieve this, two approaches were used, one parametric and one nonparametric. In the first, the methodology of Blinder (1973) is used, where the components of discrimination are obtained on the parameters of Mincer’s wage equation. In the second, the decomposition of Ñopo (2008) does not assume functional forms of the equation defined by what considers the group variable as a type of treatment and uses pairings on a common support to calculate the impact of the “treatment” on the variable of the hourly wage. Based on the decompositions, a gap between 14 and 42% was found for newly arrived immigrants; however, for those who have been here for 3 years, the gap is either reduced or not significant. The reduction of this gap is due to an improvement in the workers’ endowments, since the unexplained component (associated with discrimination) is reduced, but not in the same proportion. The study has four sections. The first part of this article contains a review of the literature associated with wage gaps between immigrants and locals by briefly describing how the methods of decomposition were developed. In addition, those exercises developed in Ecuador on other groups are included. These are given over time and have been applied to measure the wage gap. The second section presents the methodological design and description of the data. The third part applies decomposition techniques to measure the explained and unexplained components of the wage gap for Venezuelan migrants and its evolution in the period analyzed. The last section concludes and presents public policy recommendations.",1

In 1991, 60% of workers were employed in the agriculture sector and 26% of workers were employed in the services sector. By 2017, the economy had undergone substantial structural change, and both agriculture and services sectors employed 40% of workers (World Bank, 2017). Such rapid changes mean that there is often a mismatch between the skills possessed by workers and the skills demanded by employers. Such a skills gap is the hallmark of structural unemployment, which is now set to become the next big development challenge for Bangladesh. Bangladesh has made great strides in the attainment of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) number 4, education for all. In 2016–2017, 90.6% of the rural population and 93.1% of the urban population aged between 15 and 29 years old were literate (BBS, 2018). However, literacy is merely the ability to read, write, and do arithmetic, which is by no means adequate to secure a job in the contemporary labour market. Only 2.3% of the rural and 8.6% of the urban population in Bangladesh had completed tertiary education in 2016–2017 (BBS, 2018). Thus, there still remains a long way to go before the nation can truly reap the dividends of higher education. In the meantime, a spectre of impending pervasive structural unemployment is haunting the country. The labour market is changing at an incredible pace, and the employers are becoming increasingly demanding. In this backdrop, there are fears that many workers may be unable to catch up to the prevailing standards, especially because the education and training that they have received have crippled them with obsolete skills. According to the latest survey by the government, 14% of university graduates from rural areas, and 9% of university graduates from urban areas were found to be unemployed in 2016–2017 (BBS, 2018). In this context, it is clear that the small proportion of workers who possess the right skills will be able to extract considerable rewards from the labour market. One fundamental skill that yields substantial returns is computer skill. Data from the Bangladesh ICT Use and Access Survey 2013 (BBS, 2015b) shows that only 4% of individuals who do not have computers in their household can use computers (Appendix Fig. 5). This means that access to computers is still limited to individuals whose families can afford to buy a computer. It also implies that educational institutions in the country are not adequately equipped with computers, and some students may graduate from school without developing computer skills. Additionally, the data also show that even in households that own a computer, only 33% of individuals can use a computer. Consequently, computer literacy is still very low in Bangladesh. The hitherto research and existing literature has not addressed the returns to computer skills in Bangladesh. This paper intends to fill in this knowledge gap by calculating the returns to computer use in the context of Bangladesh. This overarching research question is answered using Heckman’s two-step estimation technique, whose efficacy has not been fully utilised by other authors in the past. The findings of this research will provide hard evidence of the importance of computer skills and elucidate the fact that education alone cannot bridge the gaps in the labour market. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 establishes the theoretical framework of the study, Section 3 contains a brief review of some of the relevant literature on the topic, Section 4 describes the data and sampling strategy, Section 5 explains the methodology behind the econometric estimation technique, Section 6 showcases the results of the study, and Section 7 ends the paper with some concluding remarks.",1

The growth and profit motive of private sector firms creates incentives to set wages proportionate to workers’ relative productivity. This motive is usually absent in the public sector, but there exists a difference in pay rewards—in terms of pensions, on the job training, facilities, perks and job security. The existence of inter-sectoral wage differentials can create a number of problems for the disadvantaged sector. For instance, ceteris paribus, large wage differentials in favor of the private sector, may restrict the public sector’s ability to attract and retain highly skilled workers, which in turn, will affect the very productivity and efficiency of the public sector. Even an attempt to maintain a degree of wage comparability with private sector employee would rather be difficult due to fiscal, budgetary allocations and other constraints. On the other side, the existence of a positive wage differential in favor of the public sector—a common issue in developing countries—may increase the job ‘queues’ and in ‘wait unemployment’, given the risk-averse agent’s preferences for long-term, stable and well-paid public sector jobs. The issue of public–private wage differentials has been addressed in numerous studies over time. Historically, the initial studies on developing countries carried out by Fogel and Lewin (1974), Blank (1985), and Gyourko and Tracy (1988) confirmed the existence of wage differentials between the public and private sectors, even after controlling for observable characteristics. Lately, studies that have used the quantile regression framework to estimate differentials by Lucifora and Meurs (2004) show that public–private wage differential is sensitive to the choice of quantile. In France, Great Britain and Italy, low-skilled public sector workers are paid higher wages in comparison with their private sector counterparts, while the reverse is true for high-skilled workers. Mueller (1998) provides a decomposition of wage differentials at several quantiles of the densities, applied to workers in the public and private sectors in Canada. There have been a number of such studies for developed countries by Adamchik and Bedi (2000) for Poland, Jürges (2002) and Dustmann and van Soest (1998) for Germany, and Christofides and Pashardes (2002) for Cyprus. The existence of public–private wage differentials in Pakistan have also been assessed by Alderman and Kozel (1989), Nasir (2000), Hyder and Reilly (2005), Hyder (2007) and Aslam and Kingdon (2009). All these studies have estimated public and private wage differentials in Pakistan using different cross-section datasets. These studies are very valuable as they examined the development of wage differentials in a single point of time. This study has been designed to compare the wage differentials over time in a systematic manner, in particular, tracking the changes in wage differentials in a context of broader labor market dynamics. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section two presents the literature review on the issue of public–private employment choice and wage differentials. Section three contains the details of the methodological framework. Data requirements, sources and limitations are discussed in Section four. Sections five and six are dedicated to the presentation and discussion of our empirical findings alongside the main conclusions of the study.",2

Hirway (2012: 65) considers growth performance inclusive if it includes poor and marginalised socio-economic groups as partners and beneficiaries in the growth process. M.H. Khan’s (2012a, b) narrower definition of inclusive growth focuses on the growth-employment nexus. According to M.H. Khan (2012a, b: 16), inclusive growth is ‘[…] growth that is both sustainable and broad-based in terms of employment opportunities’. South Asian countries have seen a trend of declining employment intensity of economic growth over the past decades (Islam 2019). Most detailed investigations of the inclusiveness of growth in the region have focused on India.Footnote 1 While Abubakar and Nurudeen’s (2019) analysis establishes a negative relationship between Gross Domestic Product (GDP) changes and unemployment, authors focusing on formal employment, in contrast, find jobless and unequalising growth in India, especially in the post-reform period after 1990 (e.g. Tejani 2016; Kannan and Raveendran 2009). Employment elasticity of growth in India’s informal sector almost doubling that in the formal sector reflect the ongoing trend towards informalisation (Hill 2014: 227).
 Gender dimensions have, by and large, been a footnote to the literature on inclusive growth.Footnote 2 This is despite the fact that research underscores that economic growth is not gender-neutral (Seguino 2020). In India, the strong growth performance during the past three decades, alongside improvements in girls’ access to education and better infrastructure, could be assumed to increase women’s opportunities for paid work. Yet, female labour force participation has actually declined, especially in rural areas. Desai and Joshi (2019: 70) explain this with ‘the crowding out of women in agriculture where land fragmentation has led to a reduction in both the size of farms and the demand for labour’. In urban India, the rapid growth of information and technology-enabled services and business process outsourcing since the 1990s translated into formal jobs for educated female workers. While the small size of the sector implies that this form of gender-inclusive growth ‘is only a reality for very few women’ (Hill 2014: 233), the post-reform increase in the wealth of urban households and the emergence of dual-earner family structures have simultaneously led to an expansion of poorly paid and precarious domestic work in private households (Hill 2014: 234). This article explores the connection between economic growth performance and gender inequalities in Pakistan, a country largely ignored in the scholarly literature on inclusive growth. Pakistan’s macro-economic performance has been characterised as a case of ‘growth without development’ (Easterly 2001). More specifically, severe gender inequalities in international comparison have persisted even in phases of high GDP growth. This paradoxical situation offers a fertile context for the analysis of how empowering macro-economic growth has been and can be for women. Pakistan’s Vision 2025 connects a policy commitment to greater gender equality with inclusive growth. It prioritises a ‘good quality of life and high living standard for all citizens across regions, gender’ and to ‘achieve an annual average growth rate of seven to eight per cent that is inclusive’ as its first two objectives (Planning Commission 2014). These commitments respond to the multiple inequalities and the increasing polarisation that characterise the South Asian country. Rather than indicating its economic strength, Pakistan’s relatively high average income of current USD 1461 in 2017 (World Bank 2020) reflects these inequalities. This is illustrated by the high incidence of poverty of a quarter of the population at the national poverty line in 2015 (World Bank 2020) that persisted even during periods of high growth since the turn of the millennium. Similarly, despite international and national commitments (for example, as a signatory to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), and with a National Policy for Development and Empowerment of Women in place since 2002), Pakistan is characterised by wide gender gaps and marginalisation of women in the areas of health, education and labour market opportunities. This is reflected in Pakistan’s extremely low ranking in the Global Gender Gap Index 2020, as the world’s third-worst country in terms of equitable division of resources and opportunities among men and women (World Economic Forum 2019: 9). For Kabeer (2005: 13–15), women’s access to resources represents one of three pillars of their empowerment. She underlines that gender equality and women’s empowerment are intrinsic goals, explicitly valued as ends in themselves rather than as instrumental for the achievement of other policy goals (Kabeer 2005: 13). Kabeer (2005: 13) understands empowerment as ‘[…] the processes by which those who have been denied the ability to make choices acquire such an ability’. In order to exercise strategic choices, the agency to challenge power relations, resources that can serve as the medium through which agency is exercised as well as the actual achievement of the types of lives that people want are required (Kabeer 2005: 13–15). Thus, in order to study whether macro-economic growth has been associated with empowerment for women in Pakistan, we examine the nexus between growth and gendered employment. We consider the latter as a potential resource to strengthen people’s agency (Kabeer 2005: 18). We conduct an exploratory data analysis (Smith-Miles 2011) of published data from 1990 to 2017. The gendered sectoral employment figures are derived from the Pakistan Labour Force Survey of the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), while the sectoral growth statistics have been provided by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).Footnote 3 The results of our exploration show that while positive economic growth rates are often assumed to go hand in hand with rising employment levels and income earning opportunities for women (World Bank 2011: 152), growth and gender equality in Pakistan are not systematically correlated. A first glance at related indicators suggests that while female labour force participation (FLFP) has increased steadily until 2014, women’s wage employment has been volatile, while female self-employment often shows counter-rotating trends in relation to GDP growth (Fig. 1). Sources: Ministry of Finance (2018), PBS (2018), SBP (2018), World Bank (2020). Note: real GDP growth is measured on the vertical axis represented on the right of the figure, while the employment shares are measured on the vertical axis on the left. Years in this and other figures and tables refer to the start of the fiscal year (FY) (e.g. 1990 refers to FY 1990–91) GDP growth and female employment in Pakistan, 1990–2017 This volatility in female wage employment as well as the counter-rotating trends of female self-employment reflect that women in Pakistan are largely viewed as secondary earners engaging in distress sale of labour. We explore this hypothesis further by examining trends in growth and employment at the sectoral level. In the following section, we outline theoretical predictions and empirical findings on the link between economic growth performance, gendered employment and women’s empowerment. Informed by these perspectives, we discuss empirical trends in the growth-gendered employment nexus in Pakistan since the economy was liberalised substantially during the 1990s. Based on this, in the concluding section, we formulate tentative implications for policies aimed at ‘empowering growth’ in Pakistan.",2

For the last four decades, rapid industrialization has caused a vast labour shortage in Malaysia. It has led various sectors to import foreign workers from different countries and socio-cultural backgrounds (Dannecker 2005). Bangladesh with surplus labour started to export a considerable number of workers in 1973 to different countries when oil price was hiked in the Middle East (Dannecker 2005; Castels and Miller 2003; Zamir 2006). Recent studies revealed about 3.85 to 5.3 million (including undocumented workers) migrant workers in Malaysia as of 2018. These workers come from 15 countries with the majority from Indonesia (39%), Nepal (24%), Bangladesh (13%) and Myanmar (7%) (Lee and Khor 2018; Loganathan et al. 2019). The unstable economic conditions of the Middle East led workers to change their destination to a new South Asian country, Malaysia, due to its economic growth. However, groups of male workers from Bangladesh have started to come to Malaysia since the mid-1980s (Dannecker 2005) which has gradually increased. Other authors (Joseph Trawicki Anderson 2020) estimated 1.8–3 million documented foreign workers in Malaysia (Loh et al. 2019), anywhere from 1.46 million (Loh et al. 2019) to 4.6 million (Chin 2017) are estimated to be ‘illegal’. Again, different government sources also provide a wide range of figures such as 1.8 million as of December 2017 estimated by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA), 2.26 million by the Labour Force Survey (2017), and 3.3 million by the Population and Demography Department of DOSM (2018) (Loh et al. 2019). Bangladeshi workers started flowing to Malaysia in 1986 when 500 labours came to work in plantations on a trial basis (Abdul-Aziz 2001). Later on, Malaysia entered into an agreement with Bangladesh for systematic labour transfer. Another agreement was made between Malaysia and Bangladesh in 1994. Accordingly, annual importation of 50,000 workers specifically in the construction sector was allowed. The agreement was halted due to the Asian financial crisis in 1997. However, according to official records, the figure of Bangladeshi migrant workers increased to 385,496 in 1999 (IOM 2002). As cited in Loganathan et al. (2019), workers from Bangladesh as of 2018 constituted about 13% (about 689,000) of the estimated 3.85 to 5.3 million (including undocumented workers) in Malaysia. During 2007 and 2008, Malaysia witnessed the arrival of about 200,000 Bangladeshi workers (Bangladesh Online News Daily 2007). Studies have shown that Malaysia is a popular destination for migrants in the region given its strong economic growth and its wealth relative to its neighbours the Philippines, Indonesia, Pakistan and Bangladesh (Garcés-Mascareñas 2012; Anderson 2020). About 100,000 more were expected to arrive in the country as their intake had been approved earlier. However, in 2008 the situation became complex and uncertain, because Malaysia stopped migration of workers from Bangladesh but later allowed it. The financial crisis in Bangladesh forced the youth to look for countries that were relatively stable; hence, the Bangladeshi authority rekindled the migration agreement with Malaysia. Malaysia allowed the migration and, as such, received thousands of Bangladeshi as part of a larger project of economic development and growth (Kaur 2014). The government of Malaysia in 2009 rejected 70,000 visas which had already been approved (New Straits Times 2009, March 20) and more recently halted a planned admission of up to 1.5 million Bangladeshi workers (The Sun Daily 2016). Now there are some changes in the Malaysian policy of migration. The authorities pursued a number of policies to control the population of foreign workers (particularly undocumented) present in the country (Adamson and Tsourapas 2020). This includes various policies around health and housing, their legal status and the terms of their employment (Czaika and De Haas 2013; Joseph 2020). The earlier observations of Bangladeshi migration are that the workers were welcomed to work in Malaysia because of Muslim brotherhood (Dannecker 2005). However, thousands of Bangladeshi workers are working and living in Malaysia at present. According to Loganathan et al. (2019), about 689,000 (including undocumented workers) Bangladeshis live and work in Malaysia. It is interesting yet a problematic phenomenon to study their social life, their adjustment to the new socio-cultural milieu and work environment. The significant aspect of the migration process is the adjustment to the socio-cultural as well as work conditions of the host country. In relation to work condition, Norredam and Agyemang (2019) found challenges faced by migrant workers to include modern slavery, discrimination, contract violations, abuse and exploitation, and unsafe working conditions, which are often dirty, demeaning and dangerous. Migrants by and large come from quite different socio-cultural backgrounds and different work conditions. They are acquainted with different norms and used to different work ethics which have shaped their performance and relations with persons at work. They have to work in a new situation with new personnel and have to adjust to the entire new socio-cultural and working scenario. If they cope with the problems which they face and adjust to the situation, they may perform their job well and complete their assignment; otherwise, their stay in the host country will adversely be affected. According to Reza et al. (2019), racism, xenophobia and discrimination are frequent features of migrants’ everyday experiences which exacerbate their already fragile situation. Thus, adjustment is an important phenomenon that affects migrants’ stay in the host country, their performance at work and relation with co-workers. Therefore, the present study examines the socio-cultural adjustment of Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia and explores its impact on work performance.",2
64,2,The Indian Journal of Labour Economics,12 June 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41027-021-00315-z,Amendment 110/2001 and the Dynamics of Brazilian Labour Market,June 2021,Allyne de Almeida Ferreira Ramos,Paulo Aguiar do Monte,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The high turnover rate (admissions and dismissals) in the Brazilian labour market can be seen as a direct result for better employment of resources (Gonzaga and Pinto 2014). However, there are two significant aspects related to turnover: (i) elevated turnover rates affects productivity and reduces social welfare, which results in poor balance with low quality jobs and wages; (ii) low turnover rates can make the labour market less dynamic, which prevents gains from allocative efficiency, thus limiting market productivity and efficiency (see Barros et al. 2001; Gonzaga 2003). In general, in a context of intense movement of workers and imbalance between supply and demand for labour, the Government, being the formulator of public employment policies, starts to intervene directly in the labour market. The Government's direct action, whether through passive policies and / or active employment policies, has been occurring more intensely since the 1960s (IPEA 2006). The Brazilian Government Severance Indemnity Fund for Employees (henceforth FGTS–Fundo de Garantia por Tempo de Serviço) was created through the Act 5.107 of 1966 and is considered one of the most significant passive employment policies that, contrary to active policies, does not aim at increasing employment/wages, rather it ensures good level of consumption and welfare among employees who are momentarily deprived of economic activity. The FGTS is formed by the accounts opened by employers on behalf of their employees.Footnote 1 Due to FGTS, employees are given the right to access 8 per cent of their wage from the month prior to the dismissal, as well as commissions, tips and bonuses,Footnote 2 including Christmas bonus,Footnote 3 for the accumulated time of employment. In case of dismissal without just cause, the employee has immediate access to the full amount in the FGTS account plus the severance fine and the benefit from unemployment insurance, being one of the few countries that simultaneously has the three unemployment protection instruments (individual fund, fine for dismissal and unemployment insurance), according to Robalino and Weber (2013). Holzmann et al. (2011), in a comparative analysis in several countries that have indemnity fines programmes, indicate that in developed countries they adopt less restricted indemnity fines programmes, with lower fines, the administration of this less expensive fine and that are not imposed on employers compared to emerging countries. The perception of the effects of these unemployment insurance programmes in the literature is ambiguous. Hopenhayn and Rogerson (1993) and Addison and Texeira (2001) point out that the increase in dismissal costs reduces employment. For Haffner et al. (2001) and Ahsan and Pages (2009), dismissal costs can strengthen the employment of those who are already employed and decrease the chances of occupational insertion of those who are looking for a job. There is also empirical evidence, as in Kugler (1999, 2004) and Autor et al. (2007), who indicate that higher dismissal costs are associated with lower turnover in the labour market and thus contribute to slow down economic growth. The national empiric literature that reports the impact of FGTS on dismissal of employees usually shows that the Indemnity Fund made the market more dynamic by stimulating turnover and, at times, creating a vicious circle in which employees would rather be dismissed to access the near immediate benefit (Macedo and Chahad, 1985; Gonzaga 1998; Barros et al., 2001; Gonzaga 2003; Gonzaga and Pinto 2014). On the other hand, Carneiro and Ramos (1997) argue that turnover rates have decreased with FGTS benefits from January 1985 to March 1997, in spite of the increase in the termination fine from 10 per cent to 40 per centFootnote 4 and in the coverage of unemployment insurance. The period from 1999 to 2003 was a time of adjustment for public accounts in Brazil, with the consolidation of the new macroeconomic policy regime defined by the “macroeconomic tripod”, which consisted of (i) targets for fiscal surplus, (ii) floating exchange rate, and (iii) inflation targets. Like any adjustment, this ended up being costly for economic activity, which, in the five-year period, had an average real GDP growth of 1.9%. Specifically, in the years 2001 and 2002, the Brazilian economy grew 1.3% and 2.7%, respectively (IPEA, 2015). In 2002, the amendment 110/2001 was passed, coming into effect on 1 January 2002, and the amount of the termination fine deposited for the FGTS increased from 40 per cent according to the 1988 Constitution to 50 per cent. This percentage paid by companies in cases of dismissal without just cause implicates that 40 per cent is paid directly to the dismissed employee and 10 per cent (the additional value) to the Government, whereas before the legislation companies only paid the 40 per cent destined to the dismissed employee. The formal labour market tends to follow the behaviour of the national economy. In 2001, 55.4% of workers were not employed in the formal labour market, in Brazilian metropolitan regions (Ramos and Ferreira 2005). However, this result could have been even worse if the public sector did not play an important role in generating jobs (Costanzi 2004). In 2002, with the approval of Law No. 110/2001 (LC 110/2001), which came into force as from 1 January 2002, the amount of the termination penalty on deposits made in the FGTS account passed 40%—as indicated the Federal Constitution of 1988—to 50%. This fine amount is paid by companies in the case of unfair dismissal, 40% of which is assistance to the dismissed employee and 10% (additional value) to the Government previously only 40% of the employee's operations were counted. The aim of the amendment 110/2001 was to refund the FGTS accounts regarding the losses from the inflationary purges of the economic plans Verão (1989) and Collor I (1990). However, even after the reposition of losses from the plans, in 2012, according to communication 038 of 2012 on 8 February 2012 by the Federal Economic Bank [Caixa Econômica Federal], the law is still in effect. One of the arguments in favour of the legislation is that it might have affected (in theory) the turnover rate, thus making dismissals without just cause more costly and hindering “deals” made outside the legal sphere, in which employees and employers agree on the termination of contracts in order to facilitate access to the FGTS and to the unemployment insurance, in addition to contributing to the governmental collection, naturally. Even after the increase in FGTS fines, according to Gonzaga and Pinto (2014), the fact that the FGTS restatement is low as well as the financial scarcity, “fake dismissal” deals—dismissal without just cause that are actually with just cause or voluntarily termination—have become even more frequent. For Macedo and Chahad (1985), Gonzaga (2003) and Pinto (2015), the FGTS resources are an incentive for the agreement (fake dismissal) between employers and employees who were dismissed without just cause. Thus, these agreements for misappropriation of FGTS resources cause an increase in the labour turnover rate, reducing the investment in human capital and worker’s productivity. One possible way to analyse the Governmental interference in turnover involves labour market policies. Therefore, the article aims to investigate whether the alteration proposed by the government in the FGTS termination fine, from 40 per cent to 50 per cent, has influenced turnover rates, given that the additional 10 per cent is paid to the Government itself to inhibit the fake dismissal “deals” between employers and employees. In case the amendment has influenced labour market dynamics, it is possible to claim it as a public policy of effective results on turnover. Hence, the article discusses the likely evidences that the amendment 110/2001 has influenced the Brazilian labour market. The national literature lacks empiric investigations on the impact of the additional 10 per cent in the FGTS termination fine (amendment 110/ 2001) concerning dismissal without just cause, which reinforces the innovative nature (and the difficulties) of the present work.Footnote 5 Regarding the contemporary nature of the subject, it must be noted that the previous Government, through the amendment 340/2017, has announced the proposal of extinguishing the additional 10 per cent in the FGTS. Indeed, deposits for the 10 per cent will be gradually reduced (1 per cent per year) until its complete extinction in ten years. Notwithstanding, it must be highlighted that the difficulty in providing an empirical answer concerns the fact that amendment 110/2001 is universal, that is, it covers all work relations in the formal labour market—a feature that makes difficult to delineate a control and a treatment group for analysis. Given this limitation, a diagnostic on the reduced volume of dismissal without just cause will be performed by monitoring companies in the year prior to the passing of the amendment and the year after, first through descriptive analysis, then, through econometric studies with several techniques to obtain indicative—if any of the relation between the governmental policy and turnover rates. Data base was set up with microdata from the Social Information Annual List [Relação Anual de Informações Sociais—RAIS, henceforth] from 2000Footnote 6 to 2002 regarding the industrial sector in Brazilian Metropolitan Regions. Given that Brazil is a predominantly urban country (81% of the total population lives in urban centres), the analysis was carried out for metropolitan regions. It is important to state that Brazil is located among the most populous countries and with the highest rate of urbanisation in the world, surpassing the USA, Russia and Japan (Gonzaga and Pinto 2014). Regarding the choice of the sector, the analysis was directed to the industrial sector due to its: (i) Homogeneity in relation to the types of activity; (ii) production dynamics that influence other economic sectors; and (iii) importance in the country's economic development (Gershunny 1987; Oliveira and Souza 2011). Apart from Introduction, the article is divided into six sections. The second section gives a short description on the FGTS and the theoretical framework. The third section exposes the empiric strategy. The fourth section presents the sample selection. The fifth section is reserved to descriptive and econometric results. Finally, the last section is destined to our considerations.",

Further, one of the central characteristics of the poor in developing countries, including India, is that they are significantly rural, and the agro-rural sector is the predominant provider of employment for the rural poor. The agricultural growth that raises agricultural labour productivity is likely to have a significant impact on poverty and can play ‘multiple foundational roles in wider development processes’ in these economies (Christiaensen et al. 2011; Dorward 2013; Christiaensen and Martin 2018). India’s tryst with structural transformation, however, has been characterised as ‘stunted’ (Datt and Ravallion 2011; Binswanger-Mkhize 2013); despite a continuous decline in country’s GDP contribution, the existing labour moving primarily into the rural nonfarm and informal sector is disproportionately slow and becoming increasingly ‘casualised’ (Lanjouw and Murgai 2009; Himanshu et al. 2013). The sluggish growth in agricultural labour productivity and insufficient rate of expansion of employment opportunities in industry and services relative to population growth has been often cited as immediate reason (Bosworth and Collins 2008; Gollin et al. 2014). The other potential reason could be the prevalence of distorted monopsonistic labour market in large part of Indian agriculture, which may be due to the presence of a relatively small number of large-sized farms and ‘overcrowded’ landless labourers (Rosenzweig and Foster 2010; Joshi 2015; Belser and Rani 2015; Muralidharan et al. 2020). The former employ some wage labour, permanently or seasonally, which is supplied mainly by the latter small and marginal landholders or peasant households, further seeking wage employment to supplement their income. The big difference in farm size, wealth and social status gives the big farms a dominant position over the small and marginal landholders in terms of wage determination, who are primarily lower in the social status as well as lacking alternative employment opportunities. In the context of Indian agriculture, the decade of 2000s has been unprecedented on four counts. Firstly, agricultural credit growth picked up significantly in the 2000s with the adaptation of a Comprehensive Credit Policy in 2004–2005 (Ramakumar and Chavan, 2014; Misra et al. 2016). Secondly, since February 2006, Indian Government implemented a universal demand-driven minimum wage guarantee social protection scheme, namely Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) in the rural India,Footnote 1 which may have corrected the pre-existing market failures and increase both wages and employment (Rani 2017; Muralidharan et al. 2020). The price discovery in the rural labour market by revealing and providing a minimum wage, for some sectors for the rural economy dominated by monopsonistic labour markets of the agricultural sector, led to a spillover effect of increased agricultural real wage pushing up the cost of production and reduced profitability in the agriculture production system (Rangarajan et al. 2011; Gulati et al. 2014; FICCI 2015; Nagraj et al. 2016). Thirdly, for the first time in the history of Indian agriculture that the absolute number of cultivators and agricultural labour has observed a significant dip in labour force participation as 34 million workers left the sector between 2004–2005 and 2011–2012 (National Sample Survey Office’s (NSSO’S) periodic surveys). As Indian agriculture is characterised by low capital–output ratio, the very act of capital deepening (giving each worker a little more capital to work with) may make a substantial difference to output growth, and both partial and total factor productivity. And, fourthly, the agriculture sector recorded 3.8% annual growth in value added in the decade since 2004–2005, which is the highest in any decade since India got independence in 1947 (Deokar and Shetty 2014). This presents a compelling case to understand the consequences of such labour market interventions and the sources of outputs growth, mainly TFP, labour productivity and capital deepening in Indian agriculture. A number of studies have looked at agricultural productivity change in India (see, e.g. Kumar 2001; Bhushan 2005; Kumar and Mittal 2006; Nin-Pratt and Fan 2010; Bhushan 2016), but few of them pay attention to the determinants of regional disparities in agricultural labour productivity growth in recent times of significant labour shortage. In this context, this paper concerns the patterns and sources of agricultural labour productivity in India over the period 2000–2016 by decomposing total factor productivity (TFP) growth rate into technical changes, efficiency changes and the accumulation of inputs per worker by means of a frontier approach, namely the data envelopment analysis (DEA)-based linear programmes and Malmquist TFP index (Färe et al. 1994). The Malmquist index approach does not require the maintained hypothesis of technical and allocative efficiency and does not use price information which is often of questionable quality in a subsidy-laden economy, like India (Gulati and Sharma 1995). Also by using this approach, we avoid the need to assume that these states maximise revenue and minimise costs, which would be a bold and lofty assumption indeed. Moreover, the DEA method does not impose any functional restrictions on production technology. However, the superlative Törnqvist–Theil index (TTI) method is also used as a check to see whether our results are robust to alternative methodologies. Overall, this paper is an attempt to address a number of important questions, such as: What actually happened to agricultural labour productivity during 2000–2016? What were the sources of agricultural labour productivity growth during the above period across various states? We believe that questions such as these must be addressed, so that economists and policy makers can try to identify the sources of agricultural growth in developing economies, especially in the context of major rural employment programme intervention. The empirical analysis in this paper is designed to provide us with a small piece of empirical evidence on the sources of TFP growth. The remainder of this paper is organised into sections. Section 2 describes the intuitive exposition of the effect of minimum wage in the rural labour markets, followed by preliminary investigation on the agricultural labour productivity evolution across the Indian states. Section 3 introduces the decomposition approach and data and reports the results. Section 4 analyses the sources of agricultural productivity, while Section 5 concludes brief policy implications.",

This is the prime reason the gender equality has received considerable attention among policy makers, and various goals have been identified to promote gender equality at most of the international policy fora recently. The sustainable development goals (SDGs) which aim at complete eradication of poverty, protecting the planet and ensuring equal opportunity to enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030, give paramount importance to gender equality. Out of 17 goals and 169 targets of SDGs, one separate goal (Goal 5) and 53 indicators of SDGs are gender specific. The goal 5 of the SDGs aims to achieve gender equality and empowering all women and girls by 2030. Moreover, target 8.5 of the SDGs is dedicated to bridge gender pay gap and calls for ‘equal pay for equal work’ as gender pay gap is glaring and persistent across all countries and sectors of the world. Globally, women’s work is under-valued and on an average they earn only 77 per cent of what their male counterpart receives (ILO 2016c). Such glaring gender wage inequality affects self-esteem and livelihood of women workers adversely and makes them more prone to fall into poverty trap compared to male workers. Moreover, gender pay gap has indirect bearing on quality of life, human development, social development and overall sustainable economic development of a nation. Given the impact of gender pay gap on growth outcomes and human development, multilateral fora like the ILO, G20 and BRICS, etc., have also called for effective sustainable wage policy which can ensure wages in tandem with productivity of workers and agreed to implement it to reduce gender wage inequality across world. As far as gender pay gap in India is concerned, there is scant availability of literature on wage differential in urban India. Handfuls of those that exist have either focused on specific industry or specific region or specific type of workers. However, most of the studies find that globalisation has aggravated the gender pay gap. These studies also find that wage employment for women has declined substantially in the post-reform period. Women on average earn substantially lower wage than those of a male workers in most of the sectors and occupations. The wages of women were already very low in India, and it has shown further deceleration in the recent decade. Between 2000–05, female wage has declined at an annual rate of 4.7 percent. During the same time period, the real wages of regular salaried women workers have declined by 32 per cent in rural areas and by 10 per cent in urban areas. Moreover, the real wages of these workers have also declined for every level of education in rural and urban areas (Rustagi 2005; Dutta 2005; Kijma 2006; Chambarbagwala 2006; Chandrashekhar et al. 2011). Declining female wages despite improvement in productivity and faster economic growth raises numerous questions. It will be of interest to know why wages for women have declined. What determines wage differential between male and female? Is it due to differences in human capital endowment or females are being paid less due to discrimination? India being the member of aforementioned multilateral fora and somewhat little contemporary literature on the issue, detailed analysis is required to identify inter- and intra-wage inequality across occupation and industry. Further exploration is also required to understand whether gender wage gap is attributed to human capital endowment difference or it is due to pure labour market discrimination. A finer analysis is also needed to understand gender pay gap at various points of the wage distribution. In view of this, Sect. 2 of the paper examines extent of gender pay gap across broader sectors and occupations in urban labour market in India. The next section tries to explore determinants of the gender pay gap by using Mincerian regression and quantile regression techniques. Section 4 of the paper attempts to explain wage gap in terms of human capital attribute and pure discriminatory process by using Oaxaca-Ransom decomposition technique. Finally, Sect. 5 provides findings of the paper and offers policy suggestion to promote decent, remunerative and productive work for female and employment-led inclusive growth in India.",1

One, that there are three types of rural households who practice pure labour work, those who combine self-employment with hiring out labour and others who are self-employed workers on their own farms. Two, there is feminisation of farm work, and three, there is gendering of farm work tasks, e.g. poultry sales mostly by women and other livestock and crop sale mostly by men (Garikipati 2009; Singh 2008 and Singh 2013) and gender gap in wages across all categories of work and workers to the extent of 30–60% as women have low bargaining power and low opportunity cost and no ownership/control on household assets compared with those of men. They don’t even fully control their own wage income though they have good say in household maintenance expenditure. This is despite the fact that women labourers spent higher hours at work (10.3) than those by men (8) and 4.5 h of work at home compared with only 0.6 h by men for that activity, besides the fact that they spent higher number of hours at farm work (5.2) compared with men (3.9) who spent equal amount in non-farm work in Andhra Pradesh. It was only access to productive assets which led to higher agency of women within and outside the household (in labour market) (Garikipati 2009). India was the world’s largest producer, second largest consumer (after China) as well as exporter of cotton in 2015, though its per capita fibre consumption remains one of the lowest at 3.5 kg. per annum compared with global average of 10 kg. India had the largest area under cotton (1/3rd of global), but only 1/5th of global production due to lower yields. Bt ((Genetically Modified (GM)) cotton accounted for 95% of cotton area in 2011–12. 78% cotton produced in India is used domestically. India has 30% of global cotton area with two-thirds under rainfed conditions, whereas globally, only 27% cotton acreage is rainfed. India grows all varieties (short, medium, long and x-long staple) across three zones of north, central and south India. Major cotton-producing states in India are: Gujarat (33% of total production), Maharashtra (26%) and Andhra Pradesh (17%), together accounting for 76% of total production in India. But, 70% of cotton is consumed in three states of Tamil Nadu (43% of all mills), Maharashtra (18%) and Punjab (8.5%) (Singh 2017). Average area under cotton per household was 1.325 hacs ranging from 2.4 in Gujarat to 0.4 hac in Tamil Nadu with marginal and small farmers growing 0.4 and 0.83 hacs each. The average cotton area per household was 1.59 hacs. But, the yield in India is only 70% of the global average (Joshi Rai 2011). Despite constant cotton crop failures in India during the 1990s, cotton remains a crucial crop for 4.9% of India’s farmers across 10 states due to its high value commodity nature, assured minimum price by the state and lower irrigation requirement compared with paddy. The significance of cotton could be seen in the estimate that a 10% increase in cotton prices reduced poverty ratio ((proportion of people Below Poverty Line (BPL)) to 4%, 20% increase to 3% and 30% increase to 2%. Given its significance in farmer and worker livelihoods in India, it is commonly called “White Gold” due to its high value in terms of gold price and also the profits for producers and traders due to use of slave labour in its production during the period of slavery in the USA. But, cotton farmers in India, in general, are not the poorest in their local communities though they may suffer from many market imperfections and exploitation and may not get much of the value chain surplus. Only 12% cotton farmers were BPL households as against 25% of all other farmers (ranging from 5% against 10% in north and 13–15% against 17–21% in central/west region). But, labour is a crucial input and wages an important cost in cotton production. Harvest costs often account for 50% of the total production costs of cotton crop. Further, cotton workers are from the most marginalised communities in India, economically and socially. Therefore, it is important to understand dynamics of labour use and its implications for workers as stakeholders in cotton crop (Singh 2017). In this context, this paper assesses the state of farm labour in cotton crop and the arrangements under which they are engaged in this work and their perceptions about their own condition as farm workers and role of cotton work in their livelihood besides the relations such workers have with the landowning cotton growers and the migrant workers. To understand labour processes and outcomes, it is important to examine local actors and factors like state-as regulator, class relations (including caste in countries like India) and labour unions (Selwyn 2012). The International Labour Organisation (ILO) defines decent work as being productive work for women and men in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity. The definition rests on four pillars, namely employment creation and enterprise development; social protection; standards and rights at work; and governance and social dialogue, though there are serious issues in decent work measurement in terms of variety of indicators (Oya 2015). The labour and work issues in cotton in India from decent work and wages perspective include labour rights and standards, worker health and safety, equity and gender dimensions of cotton farm work and organisation of farm workers. There are issues of not only decent wages and work conditions but also discrimination based on caste and tribe or other social differences locally like gender-based gap in wages and exploitation of women and young children especially girls (FAO and ICAC 2015). Even in cotton-farming households, men control the proceeds from cotton even though much of the labour work is done by women whether in Africa (Gillson et al. 2004) or in South Asia (Singh 2017). In India, cotton is mostly planted and picked by female workers accounting for 65% of the workforce and 70% in planting and 90% in picking (ITC 2011) which brings in the gender dimension as an important issue especially gender gap in wages and gender-sensitive conditions of work. Many Multi-Stakeholder Initiatives (MSIs) like BCIFootnote 1 and other global sustainability standards like organic cotton, fair trade cotton and ethical trade have labour aspects of production and trade as a part of the sustainability and fairness standards (Singh, 2019). These aspects of labour and work relate to minimum wages, living wages, decent working conditions, child labour, gender gap in wages and gender-based exploitation. There have been studies on these issues in some contexts (Salisali 2018). For example, the decent work aspect of BCI in India concerned mainly status of women, child labour, wages and incomes, health and safety and forced or bonded labour. There was gendering of tasks (occupational segregation), wage discrimination, women’s reproductive health risks associated with pesticide exposure, use of child labour, exposure of children to hazardous working conditions, low wages (even lower than legal minimum) and prevalence of forced and bonded labour. Many of the issues did not appear in the BCI system as the initiative relied on self-assessment for ensuring compliance and producers won’t report it for fear of being excluded from the program, though BCI did address it through assurance program and external assessment themselves and by implementing partners, and independent verifiers. The global compliance on decent work was reported to be 42% in 2010, which jumped to 74% in 2012 (Usher et al 2013). Hired workers received only Euro 1.8 per day in India which was only 41% of the living wage. Even family workers received on an average Euro 3.5 per day which was half of their living income. The average annual wage of workers was just above legal minimum wage, whereas the annual living wage of Indian worker under “true price” of cotton should have been at least double of that. In fact, 32% of the external costs of production were at the cultivation stage (Grosscurt et al 2016). Further, hired labour and wage issues were not addressed in smallholder category when assessing decent work conditions. Most of the time, the focus of interventions was on child labour and health and safety which led to higher awareness of these issues and other areas like non-discrimination and gender equality, forced/bonded labour, migrant workers and freedom of association are attended much less. In fact, very few implementing partners targeted workers and there was very little evidence of any kind of gender focus or forced/bonded labour focus in implementing partner approaches to decent work (Usher et al. 2013). In this context, this paper assesses the following major research questions in cotton sector in India from worker and decent work perspective: (a) the state of farm labour in cotton crop and the arrangements under which they are engaged in this work; (b) worker perceptions about their own condition as farm workers and role of cotton work in their livelihood; and (c) perceptions of such workers of their relations with the landowning cotton growers and the migrant workers. The paper relies on both primary and secondary information where primary information includes a farm worker survey and two focus groups in villages of Bathinda (Punjab) with one with male workers and one with women workers involving 8–12 workers in each group were conducted as part of a larger independent academic research project carried out in the states of Gujarat and Punjab in 2015 where 180 cotton workers across two study locations in the two states were also interviewed. But, this paper relies mostly on worker focus group discussion and insights to capture the dynamics of work and wages in cotton, including gender aspects. The focus groups explored significance of cotton farm work in worker livelihood and issues of gendering of tasks and gender gap in wages, besides the role of state interventions like Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Scheme (MGNREGS) under which the state (government) is mandated to provide to at least one member of a rural household 100 days of work on demand at a minimum wage for in a year as workers’ legal right under the MGNREG Act. The second section explores the labour issues in cotton in general and their dynamics. Section three examines the issues within specific context of Punjab. Section four examines the role of the state and absence of labour agency, while section five concludes the paper.",

In the case of migrant construction workers, work terms and conditions vary with the type of migration,Footnote 1 migrants’ destinations of work and work systems which they are engaged in. Thikadar(s)Footnote 2 also plays an important role; thus, the work terms and conditions also vary with the thikadars who hire these workers. Most of the work terms and conditions are informally regulated. The United Nations post-2015 development agenda promotes decent employment and livelihood to all migrants. Decent work is that which provides fair social, human and economic conditions for workers (ILO, 2014). Thus, it protects migrants’ rights and promotes employment by creating a sustainable institution and economic environment. In India, there are several acts that cover the employment regulation of inter-state migrant workers and construction workers which aim to protect the work rights of the migrant workers. The ‘Buildings and other construction workers (regulation of employment and conditions of services) Act 1996’ and ‘Interstate migrant workmen (regulation of employment and conditions of service) Act 1979’ and the ‘Contract Labour Regulation and Abolition Act 1970’ are the important labour laws that were amended by the Government of India long back. Although there are laws to improve workers’ social and work lives, the case studies of different informal sector workers depict nil or very low implementation of any labour laws. As Srivastava and Sutradhar (2016a, b, p.30) explain: Despite a plethora of labour legislation to protect the interest of the labour, most of the labour laws in India remain unimplemented or poorly implemented, partly attributed to the poor enforcement capacity of the state and the collusion of employers and recruiters.",1

Women workers from low-income households are primarily involved in beedi rolling to financially support to their families. Health risks associated with smoking and rolling of beedis are well-documented (e.g., Singh et al. 2014; Basu et al. 2018). Beedi workers are exposed to various harmful chemicals, tobacco dust and fumes, etc., during the manufacturing process. Besides, low wages, gender discrimination, lack of social and job protection schemes leave women beedi workers in a vulnerable position. Further, the migrant workers are more vulnerable in beedi farms which is well documented in Hema Kumari (1994) and Hema Kumari and Tataji (1996) for tobacco graders in the factory and the farm sector. The migration occurs at the intra-state and also inter-state levels. Particularly, the working conditions of the migrant workers in the farm sector who pluck tobacco leaves are harsh (Hema Kumari and Tataji 1996). Two types of beedis are produced in India, viz. (1) hand-rolled and (2) machine-made. While the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that more than 90% of the beedis produced are hand-rolled (WHO 2014), Sunley (2008) mentions the number to be over 98%. The majority of beedi rolling activities come under the unorganised sector in India, which is regulated by the Beedi and Cigar Workers (Conditions of Employment) Act, 1966. In the early 1970s, beedi rolling was primarily carried out in factories. However, with the gradual decline of beedi factories and the prevalence of wide-scale contractual arrangements, most of the workers turned to the unorganised home-based sector. This shift from a factory-based to a home-based system may be largely attributed to the avoidance of financial compliance by factory owners  of labour legislation and various welfare schemes meant for the beedi workers. Moreover, this shift might have resulted in increased involvement of women and child labour in beedi rolling. It may be noted that although women work as the primary beedi rollers, other family members, especially children, actively participate in beedi rolling to meet quotas (ILO 2003; Dube 2013). Since accurate information on beedi workers are not available in the public domain, most of the studies on the beedi industry are carried out through primary surveys. Due to the unavailability of reliable statistics, the informal sector in general and beedi industry, in particular, remains a poorly understood and grossly neglected field of research. The largely informal nature of employment creates difficulty to identify the beedi workers and properly assess their socio-economic conditions and understand the benefits and sufferings or exploitations while working in the beedi industry. Statistical data reported on the industry reported by different agencies including the Ministry of Labour and Employment (MOL&E), Government of India, contain significant discrepancies. The Campaign for Tobacco Free-Kids (2008) reports that a huge number of beedi workers (56% of respondents) of a southern state were not registered workers also. Against the above backdrops, the paper aims to: (1)  examine the trends of beedi workers across the states from the existing data, (2)  estimate the women beedi workers at the state and district levels, and (3)  examine the socio-economic conditions of the women beedi workers and various forms of their exploitations in the beedi industry. The study analyses data on beedi workers in India obtained from different sources and examines the discrepancies. It also estimates the numbers of beedi workers (including women beedi rollers) and analyses their spatio-temporal trends, and examines their socio-economic conditions (e.g., age, marital status, social status, religion, level of education, etc.). Also, it highlights the vulnerabilities and various forms of exploitation faced by the women beedi rollers in the unorganised and organised sectors. The rest of the study is organised as follows. Section 2 presents data sources and methods used in the study. Section 3 examines the trends of beedi workers across the states in India by using the existing data. Section 4 estimates the women beedi workers across the states and districts in India. Section 5 examines the socio-economic conditions of the women beedi workers and their various forms of vulnerabilities. Section 6 concludes the paper.",1

Women’s participation in the labor market is one mechanism for achieving this, and it can create significant improvements in primary development objectives including reduced poverty; access to health care, education, land, technology, and capital; environmental sustainability; institutional effectiveness; and democratic participation (White 2006). The literature demonstrates how the increase in women’s labor force participation rate, henceforth LFPR, can lead to aspects of successful development and gender equity including increased availability of jobs, access to education, and a greater degree of decision making in the home (Chi-Wei et al. 2019). Considerable evidence demonstrates that empowering women can correlate with a reduction in fertility rate, reduced maternal mortality, as well as an increase in the average age at first marriage (Dreze and Sen 2013; Arora 2012). Indeed, as noted by Verick (2014), “female labor supply is…both a driver and an outcome of development.” LFPR is defined as “a measure of the proportion of a country’s working-age population that engages actively in the labor market, either by working or by looking for work” (Verick 2014). The relationship between LFPR and economic growth has been suggested through a U-shaped relationship, meaning that as sectoral shifts occur during economic growth, female LFPR experiences a U-shaped trend as women exit and re-enter the workforce, denoting that the two components are mutually conditioned (Lechman 2014). The U-shaped hypothesis describes this correlation, positing that “female participation rates are highest in poor countries, where women are engaged in subsistence activities and fall in middle-income countries because of the transition of (mainly) men to industrial jobs” (Verick 2014). As economic demand then shifts from the agricultural sector to the service sector, women are expected to re-engage in the labor market (Verick 2014). As will be explored in this essay, women’s LFPR, while an important component of economic development, is not the key to ensuring gender equality. I suggest that what Kabeer identifies as women’s integration in development lying at the “bottom of an inherently hierarchical and contradictory structure” (Kabeer 1994) has been particularly detrimental to women’s quest for gender equality in India. India presents an anomaly in terms of the U-shaped hypothesis, demonstrating an increased decline in women’s LFPR as the economy continues to grow. Gender inequalities in India continue to persist despite women’s participation in the labor market. Recent decline of women’s participation in the labor market supports this notion. I argue that such an occurrence is a result of traditional and patriarchal views of women’s role in society. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the factors that contribute to India’s outlier position on the U-shaped curve. While the current literature denotes possibilities of India’s outlier positioning primarily related to the income effect, education effect, and lack of job opportunities, as will be explored in this writing, I will aim to challenge these arguments, and instead propose that women’s failure of re-entry into India’s labor force is a direct result of patriarchal and traditional norms that prevent women from garnering gender equality. I argue that addressing gender inequity in India would lead to an increase in female labor force participation (ibid).",4

Since its emergence in Wuhan at the end of 2019 and then declared as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020, COVID-19 has caused big chaos in the global economy, especially in transportation, tourism, and global supply chain (Ozili and Arun 2020). The World Bank (2020a) predicts that global gross domestic product (GDP) will contract by 5.2% in 2020, the biggest recession in decades. The economic growth will contract in all regions, such as East Asia and Pacific (0.5%), South Asia (2.7%), Sub-Saharan Africa (2.8%), Middle East and North Africa (4.2%), Europe and Central Asia (4.7%), and Latin America (7.2%) (World Bank 2020b). The impact of COVID-19 on the economic sector is badly felt, especially for those in the informal sector. The International Labour Organization (ILO) has predicted that 1.6 billion workers in informal sectors would be significantly affected by COVID-19, a decline in income is predicted to reach 60% globally (ILO 2020a). Furthermore, other consequences resulting from COVID-19 are an increase in unemployment and underemployment rate, as well as large-scale economic restructuring (ILO 2020b). There will be 436 million informal businesses estimated to be at high risk of being hit by the economy during the pandemic, such as 111 million in the manufacturing, 51 million in the accommodation and food, and 42 million in other businesses (ILO 2020a). The informal workers have a relatively high vulnerability because they do not have social safety nets like those who work in the formal sector (Tim Forbil Institute and IGPA 2020). Indonesia is one of the countries worst hit by this pandemic. Since the first case in March 2020, the number of positive cases did not show decline until September 2020. The total positive case as of September 3, 2020, was 184,268 cases across 34 provinces in Indonesia (Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia 2020). The absence of signs of the decline has put Indonesia in an uncertainty, which has a negative impact on the Indonesian economy. The Statistics Indonesia (BPS) data shows the economic growth in Indonesia in the second quarter to be in deep contraction, with the GDP growth according to the expenditure method down by − 5.32%. The contraction in economic growth was largely influenced by the decline in private consumption. The impact of the crisis will be felt, especially in the informal sector as it dominates employment conditions in Indonesia (with 57.27% of workers in the informal sector in 2019 based on BPS data). In the two previous crises in Indonesia, i.e., the Asian Financial Crisis 1997–1998 and the Global Financial Crisis 2008–2009, the informal sector was able to survive because it had high flexibility in business and employment (Pitoyo 1999, 2007; Tambunan 2010). The flexibility of this sector to absorb workers without specific criteria has made this sector important in a crisis. In general, a crisis will result in a layoff wave which then triggers unemployment. The informal sector, in this condition, acts as a buffer zone to absorb excessive labour. This has happened in many countries where there was an increase in the number of the informal sectors during the crisis due to downsizing of the public sector and the entry of the population to the informal sector to survive (Pitoyo 1999, 2007; Dimova et al. 2005; Looney 2006; Tambunan 2010; Rothenberg et al. 2016; Jaskova 2017; Colombo et al. 2019). Some scholars argue that the informal sector would not survive during this crisis. The absence of social protection and other benefits like what has been received by the formal workers causes workers in the informal sector to be included in the vulnerable group (Benjamin et al. 2014). Rothenberg et al. (2016) also explained that the informal sector, particularly in Indonesia, seems not eager to register its business to avoid taxes and does not have the intention to expand its business on a larger scale. Unclear legal status makes the informal sector often miss data collection on social protection assistance (Angelini and Hirose, 2014; Mehrotra, 2009; Huong et al., 2013). In terms of COVID-19 pandemic, Pitoyo et al. (2020) predicted that informal sector would not survive due to the slowdown of socioeconomic activities. Thus, a new study is needed to explain how the COVID-19 pandemic affects the informal sector. Another problem that is interesting to study is how the informal workers respond to the impact of pandemic. This issue is rarely studied since many scholars just focus on how to make policies to help workers survive. One of the instinctive ways for workers to meet their needs and survive in times of crisis is through adaptive strategies. For example, Mahani (1999) found that informal food traders’ strategies in dealing with crises include increasing selling prices, reducing production, eliminating or replacing certain products, reducing product size, laying off workers, and improving service to customers. Dahles and Prabawa (2013) investigated the income-generating strategies of pedicab drivers during the crisis ranging from changing market orientation, selling assets, seeking alternative income sources, and relying on help from relatives. COVID-19-induced economic crisis is a new experience, so it may show a different kind of livelihood strategies. An updated and comprehensive study is needed to discover it. This research topic has great urgency since it can elaborate on the socioeconomic perspective on the adaptation of workers in the informal sector during the crisis and analyze the gap in social protection policy interventions that are still needed. Understanding how an individual maintains their livelihood can help in formulating policies and intervening in their current adaptive strategies (Allison and Horemans 2006). Besides, it can evaluate the weaknesses of the existing intervention policies which only pay attention to quantitative parameters (such as their income rate) and tend to ignore workers’ social factors in dealing with problems caused by the crisis. Based on the cases noted above, this study has the main objectives of being able to capture the impacts of COVID-19 on working conditions in informal sector empirically and, at the same time, finding out the responses made by individuals through their livelihood strategy as well as external responses carried out by the government or parties other than workers in the informal sector.",7
64,3,The Indian Journal of Labour Economics,10 August 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41027-021-00335-9,The Crisis of Extreme Inequality in India,September 2021,Ishan Anand,Anjana Thampi,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"The dominant view of inequality in India in policy circles and among a section of influential economists has been to either deny its rise altogether or to dismiss the concerns of distribution citing increase in economic growth and fall in poverty levels. Studies have used household consumer expenditure survey data to argue that neither the levels of nor the trends in inequality are alarming (Ahluwalia 2011; Bhagwati and Panagariya 2013; Bhalla 2017). The Gini coefficient of monthly per capita consumer expenditure increased from 0.326 in 1993–1994 to 0.375 in 2011–2012.Footnote 1
 The argument that a Gini coefficient of 0.375, or that its rise by 4.9 percentage points between 1993–1994 and 2011–2012, is not high enough to be alarmed is misleading for several reasons. First, the distribution of consumption expenditure is usually more equitable than the distribution of income and wealth. Second, India is not a low-inequality country when compared to the rest of the world, even in the distribution of consumption expenditure. As per the Gini coefficient of consumption expenditure data compiled by the Global Consumption and Income Project, India ranked 83rd out of 161 countries in 2012.Footnote 2 The distribution of household wealth in India is far more unequal, with a Gini coefficient of 0.740 in 2012 (Anand and Thampi 2016). So is the income distribution, with a Gini of 0.543 in 2011–2012 as per the India Human Development Survey. As per the Situation Assessment Survey, the Gini coefficient of per capita income of agricultural households was 0.587 in 2013. Even these high levels of consumption, income and wealth inequality are likely to be underestimates. It is well-acknowledged that household sample surveys tend to underestimate inequality due to under-reporting and under-sampling of the very rich. The rise in inequality is also defended on the grounds that it is intrinsic to the growth process that has helped alleviate poverty. However, the official poverty lines in India have been criticised for being abysmally low. It has also been argued that the methodologies of poverty estimation are based on shaky conceptual foundations and do not allow verification of the trend, let alone the magnitude of changes in the poverty ratio (Subramanian 2019). Moreover, the most recent data show a rise in the poverty rate between 2011–2012 and 2017–2018 (Bhattacharya and Devulapalli 2019). Alternatively, inequality can be seen as leading to intrinsic as well as instrumental problems and the rise in inequality is an important concern even in a developing country like India. Economic equality is needed for the creation of a society where people are treated as fundamentally equal, to bridge the gap between identity groups, for greater representation of the historically marginalised, and for providing equality of opportunity to all (Weisskopf 2011). Inequality can lead to economic instability and crisis, and decline in critical public investment in sectors such as education, infrastructure and research (Stiglitz 2012). A recent study shows that the falling wage share in India negatively affected aggregate demand through its effects on the consumption and import propensity (Dasgupta 2020). Even if the concentration of income at the top end does not reduce the average income levels at the bottom, it is possible that a large segment of the population loses out in dimensions of well-being other than income (Deaton 2013). For instance, unequal distribution of incomes could be one of the explanations for the limited role of economic growth in improving child anthropometry in India over the past two decades (Thampi 2019). Extreme inequality in India arises not only from the skewed functional distribution, but also from the persistence of social disparities and hierarchies. The durability of caste inequalities—in land ownership (Anand 2016), in wealth (Tagade et al. 2018), through the continued practice of untouchability (Thorat and Joshi 2020) and through caste-based discrimination in the labour market—has been recorded. Gendered inequalities are also stark and are reflected in women’s low participation in the labour market and the disproportionate burden of unpaid work (Ghosh 2019), significant pay gaps and evidence of gender discrimination in the labour market (Deshpande et al. 2018). While the traditional forms of disparities persist, the rise in neoliberalism has superimposed an inequality-inducing regime on the existing stratified society. Studies have warned of the dangers of an uneven growth process, reflected in the high and rising levels of wealth inequality during the neoliberal period (Anand and Thampi 2016) and in the unprecedented rise in the income share of the top 1% of the population (Chancel and Piketty 2019). This has led to worsening class inequalities (Vakulabharanam 2010), and rise in urban inequality has been identified as one of the drivers of rising disparity (Vakulabharanam and Motiram 2019), along with uneven regional growth patterns and the rising rural–urban gap. A “unique cocktail of lethal divisions and disparities” (Drèze and Sen 2013, 213) characterises inequality in India. Although advances have been made in social life and in access to amenities over the years, wide disparities continue and have worsened the effects of the pandemic. Earlier studies have covered various dimensions of inequality in India (Himanshu 2018; Haque and Reddy (eds.) 2019). This paper contributes to the existing literature by presenting the latest estimates of inequalities across dimensions and analysing them in the context of the pandemic and the stringent lockdowns in India. Nationally representative household sample surveys relating to several aspects of well-being are used. To understand the labour market and household earnings, we use the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) data for 2018–2019. For other dimensions, we use the Household Social Consumption: Health and Education modules (2017–2018), and the Drinking Water, Sanitation, Hygiene and Housing Condition (2018) surveys conducted by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO).",5

Tracing back history, the Spanish flu of 1918 had hard hit the world which resulted in loss of lives of 50–100 million globally with India suffering the highest fatality of 18 million lives. To diminish the havoc that such a pandemic can inflict on the lives of people, the Indian Government imposed a nationwide lockdown effective 25 March 2020. The shortcoming of any lockdown is that economic activity comes to a complete standstill. Based on lack of economic activity, IMF in the World Economic Outlook (Kaur 2020) projected the growth numbers for India 2020–2021 to be at 1.9%. Due to disruptions in demand and supply chains, World Bank’s estimates show that Indian economic growth is likely to be in the range of 1.55% to 2.8% in 2020–2021. Growth projections forecasted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the global economy have been revised from 3.3% to a contraction of 3%. Along with this, health and well-being of millions of people have been at risk. Researches are being conducted in several parts of the world to discover a vaccine and possible treatment of the virus. However, the possibility and viability of this being successfully done is not very clear or visible in near future. The only possible means or option available to survive the pandemic infection and reduce the spread of the infection is to implement social distancing and live in a controlled environment. The virus has also been instrumental in sparking a huge economic crisis. It has simultaneously adversely impacted the supply, i.e. production of goods & services, and the demand, i.e. consumption, investment, exports and imports. The economic damage due to this health crisis is likely to affect more people in India than the disease. Q1 2020 has been negatively impacted by the lockdown. Q2 and Q3 are expected to be riddled with consumption levels being at an all-time low, business investments declining and exports gradually pointing downwards resulting in an adverse impact on the Indian economy. As the COVID-19 cases in India were seen to be rising, the lockdown was announced to flatten the curve of this infection and reduce the spread of this infectious disease by breaking important chains of transmission. “India chose to sacrifice its economy and save lives”—“जान हैं तो जहान हैं”. Therefore, it implied that all economic and social activities which require physical presence were either postponed or brought to a halt in its tracks. The recovery curve as being forecasted by analysts and economists is ranging from a best case scenario of “V”-shaped recovery curve to “U”, “W” or “L”. A “V”- or “U”-shaped curve is associated with the timing and extent of stimulus provided by the Government and how companies and market structures are able to cope with decreasing demand. With the number of coronavirus cases in India on the rise, the lockdown has been extended four times and is in force till 31 May 2020, as of date. Early lockdown announced by the Government of India helped slowdown the spread of the infection in the country. However, it has raised issues of escalating inequalities and susceptibilities of marginalized communities within the country. This lockdown and its subsequent extensions, has resulted in disrupting life of all. The lockdown caused confinement of millions of citizens in their homes. Businesses across the length and breadth of the country were shut, and nearly all economic activity was stopped, thereby negatively impacting workforce employed in both the formal and informal sectors. Construction sites were abandoned after the announcement of lockdown. At the same time, most of the residential societies and colonies shut their gates for all but the residents. The prominent sectors which employ migrant workers who are essentially members of the informal economy, are construction and building industry, manufacturing units, trade set-ups, transport, and hospitality. Also, some of these migrant workers might work as domestic helpers (maids, drivers or watchmen), street vendors, workers in tiny and roadside businesses (tea-shops, dhabas, etc.) or as help in salons and gyms. As per an estimate of Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), nearly 122 million people in India were jobless in April 2020 itself, of which a large majority are small traders and wage labourers. Thus, this precarious situation has resulted in serious crisis and dislocation for migrant workers. According to the Economic Survey of 2018–2019, the informal economy is constituted of 93% workers. Census 2011 suggests that there are 450 million internal migrants in India. The actual numbers currently are likely to be much higher than these figures. Primarily, two types of migrations are common in India: the first being long-term migration which is attributed to the resettlement of an individual or household; the second being essentially short-term or seasonal/circular migration, which implies to and fro movement between a source and destination. Approximately 175 million migrants in India are those who travel for work in the informal sector. They are the lifeline of many State economies. This pandemic and the subsequent lockdowns have forced several amongst these workers accompanied by their families, to seek shelters in government run relief camps for food and basic needs. Indian Central and State Governments have been setting up of additional relief camps for them to live. The migrant workers have been through enormous mental, financial and emotional agony in urban centres and industrial belts and are migrating back to their native villages in enormous numbers. The agony of these workers has been due to many fold reasons such as lack of jobs and livelihood, absence of social security and being stranded in an alien city and State. The absence of public transportation during the lockdown compelled these stranded migrant workers to try to travel by foot or on bicycle to cover hundreds of kilometres back to their native homes in villages. The imposing of lockdown by the Central Government has precipitated a huge “reverse migration” from the “destination” to “source” in large parts of India (Dandekar and Ghai 2020). As per some estimates, more than 120 to 140 million workers are on their way back to the villages.",11

Human migration expands the intensity and geographical boundary of COVID-19 transmission (Sirkeci and Yucesahin 2020). The governments across the globe have imposed restrictions on human migration and mobility (named COVID-19 lockdown) to break the chain of mass transmission of COVID-19. The worldwide COVID-19 lockdown enhanced the socio-economic vulnerability and health crisis, which has not been seen in the last seventy-five years (United Nations 2020). The lockdowns have pushed the economies into a depression, which has resulted in an abnormal fall in GDP globally (Unni 2020). The unstable economic situation has introduced unemployment, job trimming, lessening of wage rate and overall socio-economic crisis. The degree of socio-economic crisis and unemployment has been typically high in developing countries during the lockdown possibly due to the presence of high proportion of informal sector labourers and lack of programmes and policies related to social security for them (Walter 2020). In 2018, 81 per cent of the labourers were engaged in the informal sector in India, without social security and quality of living (Unni 2020). A large number of informal sector labourers are migrant labourers, who have migrated from rural to urban areas. Most of them are originated from socio-economically backward districts of West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh (Keshri and Bhagat 2013). In India, the lockdown took effect on 24 March 2020 without any prior notice and systematic basic arrangements for informal sector labourers and migrants, which is the main source of all difficulties among the migrants. Few migrant labourers could able to return to their native place, but large proportions of them were stuck at working place during the lockdown (SWAN 2020). Individuals  faced socio-economic and health crisis due to the unprecedented COVID-19 lockdowns (Buheji et al. 2020). The informal sectors labourers’ especially migrant labourers lost their job overnight and have faced  extreme socio-economic hardship. The government was  almost silent on the basic issues of migrant labourers (economic crisis, food shortage, unemployment, lack of transport facilities and financial and ration relief) during the initial phase of COVID-19 lockdown. Indian migrant labourers have encountered multiple hardships compared to general people during lockdown (Bhagat et al. 2020). After the initial stage of lockdown, the economic crisis, food shortage and insecure future have seen an unusual turn among migrant labourers (Adhikari et al. 2020). The anxiety of transmitting the COVID-19 disease and the absence of a caregiver or family have boosted the prevalence of mental illness among the migrant labourers during lockdown (Choudhari 2020). About one and half month after the lockdown, the government announced special trains (Shramik trains) for stranded migrant labourers. However, inadequate special train services have failed to return all migrants to their native places. As a result, millions of labourers were stuck in their workplaces without basic facilities. Therefore, a scientific study is needed to examine the risk of COVID-19 transmission among stranded migrant labourers and challenges to their livelihoods during lockdown.",5

SDG 5 and 8 together posit gender equality in the labor market as a precondition to have a viable future for all. In the SDG Index for India (NITI Ayog 2019), India’s score for SDG 5 was 42, while for SDG 8 it was 64, against a target of 100.0. India stands far away from achieving these dual goals. The significance of raising female participation in paid work is noted both at the micro- and macrolevel. At the microlevel, improving female labor force participation rate (LFPR) is linked to improving women’s agency and increasing empowerment (Anderson and Eswaran 2009). Within households, female incomes provide them the leverage in the decision-making process and increased bargaining power. Women earnings have long been associated with a positive impact on the children, their education and on their own health and nutrition levels. Moreover, it makes them financially independent and is associated with reduced fertility levels. The economic consequences of reducing gender discrimination in the labor market also include the potential intergenerational human capital increments. At the macrolevel, addition of females to the labor force adds to the GDP by tapping the latent demographic dividend. High levels of female employment have been associated with increased productivity growth for any nation (Klasen and Pieters 2015). There is a positive relationship between GDP per capita and gender equality. For India, addition of females to the labor force could add to the GDP by 27 percent (World Economic Forum 2018). Reduction of gender gaps in labor force participation could add 10 percent to per capita income by 2020 and 13.3 percent by 2030 for the country, based on estimations by Lawson (2008). It also helps a nation in reducing poverty, fertility and child labor (Mehrotra and Sinha 2019). Reduction in female labor force participation is an underutilization of the human capital resources of the country (Fig. 1).  Female WPR (ps + ss) for 15 years and above and GDP growth rates (CAGR). Economic growth and employment in a nation are intertwined. Addition of female LFPR adds to the economic growth of a nation, while economic growth is a significant determinant of employment levels India ranks 142 (a slip from 136 in 2016), among 149 countries, in the economic participation indicator of Global Gender Gap Index 2018. India’s female labor force participation rate (LFPR) stood at 20.5 percent in 2019 as per World Development Indicators (lowest in South Asia region). Female LFPR and employment levels have been consistently declining in India since the 1970s. It has been higher in rural areas vis-à-vis urban areas (26.4 and 20.4 percent in 2019), but the rate of decline has been higher in rural areas. Comparative figures for rural and urban males are 76.4 and 73.7 percent, respectively, presenting the wide gender gap in employment. With rising education levels and lower fertility levels, the declining female economic participation calls for a deeper understanding of the puzzling trend of female LFP. Given this background, this paper tries to understand the underlying anatomy and factors behind the falling female LFPR in India using descriptive analysis. Section 2 of the paper highlights the explanations provided by previous research in studying female employment in India. A review of previous empirical studies is provided. In Sect. 3 analysis using NSS-EUS and PLFS data is presented. It breaks down the falling female employment figures by region, industries, status of employment, etc. This enables us to interpret the fall in a more appropriate manner. Section 4 concludes the paper.",1

This is largely due to the nature of informal work in these countries that is frequently intermittent, scattered, temporary or short term and unstable. Again, women workers performing informal work frequently view their work as a part of their household work and tend to under-report it. Again, LFS is also not equipped to collect data on multiple jobs performed by workers, the time spent by them on work (i.e. intensity of work), the scattered nature of work, the subsistence work and work performed under simultaneous activities.Footnote 1 Both these limitations can be addressed effectively by a time-use survey. Time-use surveys, which collect comprehensive information on all human activities without any bias, are better in capturing all informal works on the one hand and they throw light on the important characteristics of the workforce on the other hand. That is, TUS can provide some critical information to add the richness of the EUS. To put it differently, a TUS can supplement a LFS. Another reason for the complementarity between the TUS and EUS is that the definitions of work in both complement each other. TUS collects data for only one day (or two days sometimes) per person in a week, while the ILO definition of a worker is “a person is a worker if she/he has spent at least one hour on work in the reference week”. When informal work is frequently intermittent, irregular and uncertain, one day’s work (of less than one hour) in a week cannot qualify the person to be a worker. It is quite likely that the person is not working on other days in the week. Similarly, if a person reports that she did not work on the selected day, she/he cannot be called unemployed or out of labour force, as it is possible that she/he has worked on the other days in the week for one or more hours. That is, TUS alone cannot provide information on the workforce/employment status in the economy. However, when a TUS sample is drawn from the same framework as that of the LFS and there are common units between LFS and TUS, the TUS can definitely complement the LFS information. In short, a TUS is likely to provide better estimates of the workforce/labour force and also likely to add to the rich information provided by the LFS. However, the status of time-use surveys in the global south today is poor in the sense that the surveys have not been able to provide always the quality data produced through rigorous concepts and methods. This paper discusses the problems and shows the way to move forward. In the first part of the paper, we discuss the major constraints and problems of these countries, while in the second part we discuss ways to address these problems effectively.",1

Effect of Technological Innovation and Financial Performance,December 2021,Kofi Mintah Oware,Thathaiah Mallikarjunappa,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The emergence of technological innovation has intensified the competition between technological innovation and employment as resource dependency for firms. Experts have made various arguments on technological innovations effects on new jobs creation and losses of old jobs and estimate some jobs will be meaningless due to technological innovation (Chelliah 2017; IANS 2019; G. Li et al. 2017). However, an editorial publication showed that the Indian economy is 45% to 50% formalised and will be 75% to 80% formalised by 2025 (Kumaraswamy 2019). The partial formalisation of the economy can affect increased technological innovation, especially when technological innovation is categorised as software-based, engineering-based, outsourcing or multinational corporations. Job employment is already low globally, and technological innovation disrupts job employment (Lucas and Goh 2009; WHO 2011). The study asks whether software-based or engineering-based innovation from in-house, outsourced or multinational corporations is complementary or in competition to  employment in the twenty-first century  industrial revolution. The study also examines the effect of engineering-based and software-based innovation and financial performance on  employment in an Indian context. Various authors have analysed the impact of technological innovation (i.e. process and products technology) on employment (Benavente and Lauterbach 2008; Greenan and Guellec 2000; Huo and Feng 2010; Ugur et al. 2018). Others have also analysed technological innovation using investment in research and development or research and development density (Aldieri et al. 2019; Francesco Bogliacino and Pianta 2010; Pellegrino and Piva 2020; Piva and Vivarelli 2005). However, with the disruption in technology in the twenty-first century of the industrial revolution, innovation speed sometimes renders process and product technology or research and development density inappropriate. Understanding of technological innovation in terms of software-based or engineering-based is practical to meet the current rapid innovation changes (Arora, Branstetter and Drev 2011; Brian et al. 1996; Rosenblum and Chodosh 2019; Sidhu and Engineering 2019). Also, various authors have looked at the association between technological innovation and firm performance (Davinder et al. 2017; Li, Zhao, & Liu 2006; Liao et al. 2018; Rezende, Bansi, Alves, & Galina 2019; Santos, Basso, Kimura, & Kayo 2014; Wang, Tsui, Zhang, & Ma 2003; Xie et al. 2019; Zhang et al. 2018). The present literature has established a link between technology, innovation and job employment and technological innovation and financial performance. No studies investigated whether software-based innovation  or engineering-based innovation are in competition or complementary to job employment. Furthermore, no studies have a combined effect of technological innovation in software and engineering and financial performance to determine an increase or decrease in job employment in the twenty-first century of an industrial revolution. Furthermore, there are gaps in a research study on a sector by sector of employment in an Indian context. Accordingly, the present study focused on investigating to see in the twenty-first century if software-based and engineering-based innovation competes or complements job employment in an emerging economy. Also, the study examines the combined effect of technological innovation in software or engineering and financial performance on job employment of listed firms. The study’s sample size covers 80 out of 131 listed firms on the Indian stock market from 2010 to 2017, which practises sustainability reporting and produces directors reports concurrently. Green Clean organisation and Sustainability outlook report on all firms in India that submit sustainability reports. Data analysis is done by canonical correlation analysis and panel regression with random effect assumptions. The study contributes to the existing knowledge in three ways. First, it reveals that in India, partial formalisation of the economy affects the type of technological innovation that causes an impact on jobs. The study also shows that investment in technological innovation in engineering supports employment in the current state of the Indian economy. Moreover,  few if any studies to the best of the authors’ search have used canonical correlation analysis to throw more light on the contribution from software-based, engineering-based, outsourced innovation, and innovation imported by multinational corporations to job employment in the industrial sectors of the economy. Second, different studies have examined the financial performance and employment and also, technological innovation and employment (Li et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2003; Xie et al. 2019). However,  few if any studies in an emerging economy have studied the interactive effect of financial performance and technological innovation on job employment. Our study contributes to the significance of strong financial performance on job employment in India. Third, previous studies have examined technological innovation and job employment (Aldieri et al. 2020; Huo and Feng 2010; Ugur et al. 2018). This study adds a new dimension by decoupling technological innovation in engineering and software.",1

In post-reform years, employment in organized manufacturing sector was much faster than pre-reforms years. Growth momentum of employment has been larger than growth momentum of output. Further, since year 2000 real wages of the workers increased much faster, while per cent share of income wages in value added of industry output showed a decline. Standard of living of workers employed in organized manufacturing sector is improving in absolute terms in India. Declining wage share, a global phenomenon, not confined to a specific economy is mainly due to (1) skill-oriented technological change and (2) declining bargaining power of workers. Due to low investment in skill building and training, labour is forced to be absorbed in low-level services in manufacturing sector leading to low productivity and low wages (Purohit 2014). In various segments of labour market whether be organized or unorganized markets, wages of workers vary a lot in India (Mukherjee 2007; Madheswaran 2010). Employment in organized industry declined to 7.9 million in 2004–2005 after reaching to 8.5 million in 1996–1997. There has been continuous substitution of capital for labour due to sustained increase in capital intensity (Kannan and Raveendran 2009). During 1994–1995, 2000–2001and 2005–2006, rising capital labour ratio may be the most important reason for this rising contribution of labour and falling contribution of capital (Kathuria et al. 2014). Marx analyses the increase in labour productivity and capital labour ratio with development, but capital labour ratio increases faster than labour productivity, while Kuznets views that though labour productivity and capital labour ratio both increase with development, but capital labour ratio increases slower than labour productivity (Kuznets 1966, 1971). It has been observed that bargaining power of organized sector labour tends to decline with an increase in the casualization of labour in post-reform period (Karan and Selvaraj 2008). Since 1990s, income inequalities also began to rise in labour market with a rise in the distribution of gains to the workers. Continuous rise in urban labour supply due to rural urban migration has worsened the situation (Kundu 2002). There was invariance in wages till 1995–1996 with coefficient of variance value less than 40%, but since 2000, it continues to rise (above 55%) with certain fluctuations till 2014–2015. It is also clear that (1) interstate wage disparities are maintained despite interstate labour migration in the past few decades (2) between 2000–2001 and 2014–2015, convergence of 12–15% points would have been possible due to rising interstate labour migration, information sharing, expansion of non-farm employment and MNREGA-type programmes. Also overall wage growth rate during 2000–2001 and 2014–2015 has been lower than the growth rates of GDP and per capita GDP in this period (Acharya 2017). Interstate labour market dynamics has been varying across different years.Footnote 1 Till date, interstate wage gaps are quite high with least similarity in growth rates of labour market. Rapid integration of India with rest of the world on the one hand and economic reforms on the other hand have caused structural paradigm shift in production structures of organized sector. Labour productivity has got a boost from the use of imported technology and capital. There is rising use of skilled non-production workers such as engineers, supervisory and managerial skill, quality control persons in organized manufacturing industries. Non-conventional skills of communication, presentation, networking, liasioning no doubt help to raise productivity (Heckman 2000). Mitra and Singh (2016) observe interindustry wage variation as a result of variation in labour productivity. High productivity entrepreneurs are able to pay higher wages. Complementarity between imported technology (capital) and skill is explored by Mitra and Singh (2016) in the sense that the use of capital and technology necessitates the rising demand for skilled workers. Further, rising gap between labour income and output has been observed by Ghose (2010), Das (2015) and others. Traditional wage theories consider wage as a function of labour productivity. Differential labour productivity causes differential wage rates. Strong world of competition has compelled the countries to adopt capital-intensive technologies and skilled non-production workers in a large manner. In market economies, concept of wage rate becomes more market and profit oriented, thus raising the issue of wage differentials in a more pertinent manner. Stiglitz (2002) recommends the deregulation of labour market to achieve the potential of economic growth. So in this light In the present paper, Section 1 highlights the background and objectives of the study followed by Section 2 providing a brief review of literature. Section 3 describes database and research methodology. Section 4 is empirical results and discussion. Section 5 concludes the study. Present study is an attempt to focus upon Interstate wage disparity in the Organized manufacturing industries in India. Objectives of the study are specified like this (1) To determine the factors responsible for wage disparities in Indian organized manufacturing industries (2) To study Interstate wage differentials in the organized manufacturing sector of India.",

There is no proper database on the in-migrant workers in Kerala. Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation (2013) estimated that there were more than 25 lakh in-migrant workers in Kerala in 2012 who were employed mostly in informal sectors. Interestingly, at the same time, there were as much as 21 lakhs out-migrants from Kerala to various parts of the world in 2014 (Rajan 2016). Kerala is reported to be facing a scarcity of manual labors, which might explain the reason for the in-migration to the state. There are several other pull factors that attract migrant workers to Kerala. They include availability of work and better wages and conditions of work and living. Lack of employment opportunities and lower wages at the place of origin have been the major push factors (Narayana et al. 2013). The history of migration of workers to Kerala from other states can be traced back to 1980s. The migrant workers during this period were mostly from the states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh. However, this trend has changed since the last 10 years and one of the most striking features of the labour market in Kerala in the past decade was the increasing presence of migrant workers from the states like West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Odissa, Gujarat, Assam, Rajasthan, and from the neighboring country of Nepal. They are usually engaged in manual labor such as earth work, road works, unskilled works in construction, and in services like ironing clothes, and as cooks and waiters in small hotels and eateries, brick kilns, jewellery work, bakeries, vegetable shops, and in manufacturing industries (Kumar 2011). The in-migrants who come to Kerala are socially, culturally and linguistically a heterogeneous group. Prasad (2016) noted that the in-migrant workers in Kerala are linguistically categorised as Hindi speaking people. But they are not a homogeneous group linguistically and culturally, and among them, there are people who speak Assamese, Bangla, Oriya, Bhojpuri, Nepali, Gujarati, and several other tribal languages. Also there are people who do not know Hindi language. Normally migrants use their local language to converse among themselves. Since Hindi is not known to all natives, it is often difficult to have interactions between the migrants and natives. Only those migrants who get a chance to mingle with the native people learn the local language of Malayalam. The image and label of in-migrants as “outsiders” who do not share the language and culture of the natives have led to their discrimination in various spheres of their life and work in Kerala. Studies have highlighted the discriminatory practices of natives and state authorities including the police against the in-migrants. For instance, Kumar and Pramod (2016) found that the native people and the police set eyes on them with suspicion. Non-proficiency of the regional language also sometimes makes it difficult for them to prove their innocence in front of police and legal system, if booked for any alleged violation of laws. The language barrier further leads to stress and strain as they are not able to communicate properly with health providers, merchants, bankers, and policemen. These make them feel alienated as well (Prasad 2016). Also, studies showed that they tend to ignore the living conditions, housing facilities, and sometimes even health to earn and save as much as money as possible during their stay in Kerala (Prasad 2016; Narayana et al. 2013). This attitude of the workers is often exploited by the contractors, employers and even house owners and it increases their precarity and informality at work and the hardship of living. There are also several factors that influence the work and wage of the in-migrant workers, namely nature of work, gender, and working hours in a day, skill level and willingness to do overtime work. Besides these, variables like age, marital status, education, caste, geography, working days in a week and bargaining power have significant influence on the wage rate and wage differences with regard to in-migrant laborers. For instance, studies have shown that the migrant workers concentrate largely in the lower-income labor market with higher risks of exposure to unsafe working condition (Chatterjee 2006). While higher wage rate in Kerala is one of the major pull factors of migration, it is not clear whether in-migrants in Kerala receive wages at par with the natives or above the minimum wages stipulated by the state government for various sectors. Available studies on wage differentials in Kerala focused on specific sectors, especially the construction sectors (Beju and Shamna 2019, Parida et al. 2020). Given this background, this paper attempts to examine whether there are differentials in the wages of in-migrant workers as compared to the natives. If so, what could this differential be attributed to? To be more specific, whether in-migrant workers in Kerala face wage discrimination based on the markers of region and whether there are further differences in wages within in-migrants based on their skill level, language, religion, ethnicity and caste.",

McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) report, 2015, pointed out that assuming a business-as-usual scenario, with an equal participation rate of men and women, global gross domestic product (GDP) would increase by 26% in 2025. Similarly, as per their 2018 estimates, by advancing gender equality, i.e. by enabling women to participate equally in the economy like men, India will be able to increase its GDP by 18% by 2025. But achieving gender equality necessitates substantiating initiatives to close the gender gaps at work, and it is also identified as one of the policy priorities by the Government of India. The Central Government has taken several initiatives to improve women’s employment opportunities like the National Mission for Empowerment of Women (NMEW), 2011–2012, to ensure economic empowerment of women, the enactment of the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017, to increase paid maternity leave from 12 to 26 weeks, mandatory crèche facilities in establishments with more than 50 employees and many more. The Government of India also set up the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship on 2014 ‘to create an ecosystem of empowerment by skilling on a large scale at speed with high standards and to promote a culture of innovation based entrepreneurship which can generate wealth and employment to ensure Sustainable Livelihoods for all citizens in the country’. Since its inception, the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship not only focuses on skilling but also aims to improve productivity through skill development to stimulate economic growth and employment opportunities. Women get a special focus under the Skill India Mission as it is committed to facilitate and promote women with market-relevant skills and direct them to a path of self-sufficiency through entrepreneurship. Despite all these, it is disheartening to note that India has recorded one of the lowest women labour force participation rates in the world and their share in entrepreneurship is even lower. According to the Census 2011, 48.5% of India’s population is women but the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) 2018–2019 indicates that women workforce participation rate is 17.6%, as compared to 52.3% for men and 35.3% for the entire country, on average. Further, according to the last available Economic Census, i.e. the Sixth Economic Census (2013) which enumerated all establishments engaged in various agricultural and non-agricultural activities, only 8.05 million out of the total 52.29 million proprietary establishments were run by women and they provided employment to around 13.45 million persons. Of these women-owned establishments, more than 80% were own account enterprises (OAE) (i.e. enterprises without any hired worker) and it not only implies their limited scope of employment generation capacity but also indicates that they are more likely to be necessity-driven entrepreneurs. It is also observed that out of these establishments under women entrepreneurs, about 34% belonged to agricultural activities, where livestock was the dominant one in 2013. In the same year, manufacturing and retail trade were the major ones where women entrepreneurs are engaged, among the non-agricultural activities. Furthermore, according to the Sixth Economic Census, a significant percentage (89%) of the women-owned establishments were perennial and most of the women establishments (79%) were self-financed in 2013. Such a picture raises many questions on the aim and scope of women entrepreneurs in India and indicates that the extent of opportunity-oriented entrepreneurship is very low among them in India. It also majorly reflects the possibility of a necessity-based early-stage entrepreneurial activity that is driven by limited choices for work to eke out living (Unni and Naik 2018). In other words, the choice for women is either they become employed and earn something or they remain unemployed and earn nothing. Since they cannot afford to be unemployed, it forced them to take whatever employment was available. Moreover, the transition from necessity-driven entrepreneurs to opportunity-driven entrepreneurs is quite low for women in India (Schoar 2009). Academicians working on drivers of women entrepreneurship believe that women prefer self-employment as a result of a ‘push’ out of the formal economy and the lack of employment opportunities is flinging a significant proportion of women workers into a downward spiral of more labour but less income world of work (Deshpande and Sharma 2013). Alternatively, another set of literature provides evidence that women prefer self-employment or entrepreneurship than salaried employment primarily due to unpaid domestic chores and child care responsibilities (Georgellis and Wall 2005; Kabeer 2012; Longstreth et al. 1987). Married women with young children are more likely to be self-employed, often in home-based work than unmarried women or women without children (Kabeer 2012; Parker 2009). The same is also validated from the survey results of the NSS 68th round (2011–2012) and the Periodic Labour Force Survey (2018–2019) which indicates a significant proportion (more than 80%) of the total working-age group (15–59 years) women who have children with less than 5 years of age in their household being into entrepreneurship. There are diverse perspectives on the relationship between gender and entrepreneurship opportunities. The necessity-driven entrepreneurship is important in enabling women to earn a living, but the opportunity-driven entrepreneurship is more important for the overall growth of an economy because of the latter’s greater potential impact on dimensions such as employment creation prospects. But in developing countries, the literature is limited to women entrepreneurship, and India is not an exception to this. Against the above background, the study attempts to analyse the condition of overall women’s employment, operational and economic characteristics of the women-owned enterprises, its access to credit and entrepreneurial activity across socio-religious groups and nature and drivers of women entrepreneurship in India by using the Economic Census, National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) data and Periodic Labour Force Survey Data. The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 provides a brief review of literature on women entrepreneurship in India, while Section 3 describes the data used for the study. Section 4 gives a brief idea of the overall women employment and entrepreneurship in India. Section 5 presents the characteristics of women-owned enterprises in India by using Economic Census and NSSO data, and Section 6 discusses the nature and operational characteristics of women-owned enterprises. Section 7 explores the drivers of the women entrepreneurship in India by using the logistic regression model. Finally, Section 8 summarises the findings of the study and offers some policy directions.",4

India is developing at a fast pace and it is positioned at an advantageous position with a promising demographic dividend. But with the rise in unemployment figure projected by International Labour Organisation (ILO) at 18.6 million for 2018, higher than 18.3 million in 2017 (ILO, 2017), this demographic dividend will not be able to reap the optimum benefits (Figs. 1, 2 and 3). According to the World Bank report, India must generate 8.1 million jobs to cater to 1.32 billion people to maintain its employment rate. It is also projected that IT technical specialist hires will decline by more than 5%, and by 2021, 40% of all IT staff will hold multiple roles, which would be business-related rather than technology-related. By 2020, 75% of the organisations will experience visible business disruptions owing to infrastructure and operational skill gaps (World Bank, 2016). This skill gap is the reason behind misalignment between industry requirements and available resources, which is a major concern for recruiters across sectors. With the job market wavering rapidly, the skills that were demanded a couple of years back may not hold much relevance today. Possessing skills is critical for staying employable in the industry and it needs to be imparted to the engineering graduates during their tenure of the study. In this background, the paper discusses the skill sets expected by IT industry from the engineering students and the skill sets colleges are developing. The first section provides the background of the study followed by the second section of paper that deals with the components of employability skills and discusses issues related to employability in higher education. Research methodology of the study has been dealt in the third section. Fourth and fifth sections discuss the employability skills that industry seeks from the fresh engineering graduates and the employability skills that private engineering institutions instil in their students. They also highlight the relationship between the employability skills and the placement of engineering graduates. The last section is preceded with conclusion.

Insights from Textile Industry in South India,December 2021,Nandini Ramamurthy,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"This article intends to explain precarity using economic and social upgrading, explore work organisations, reorganizing work, and apply workers’ socio-demographic features. It is important to note that the precariat discussion falls under the fast-fashion premise. The existing literature describes buyers’ as a homogeneous group (Gereffi, 1994; Schüßler et al., 2018; Anner, 2019). However, this paper identifies buyers based on their practices, which divide buyers as international and national. It can help us understand which buyer is aiding what type of precarity in the suppliers’ work organisation and how it permeates. Similarly, in suppliers’ work organisation the assessment of precarity is imperfect. Therefore, Table 1 highlights that ranking can explain varying shades of precariousness using the analytical framework of economic and social upgrading. Economic upgrading is intense, thus causing restructuring of work, dismantling trade unions, and changing the patterns of recruitment and employment. It also determines the power relations between buyers’ and suppliers’ work organisation. Consequently, economic upgrading empowers suppliers’ work organisation to establish control, intensify surveillance, and thus easy to monitor workers socio-demographic (age, gender, and migration) features.  Buyers seeks three distinctive approaches to understand precariousness. First, the buyers’ squeeze on FoB price and apply footloose sourcing practices to weaken workers’ rights (Taplin, 2014; Anner & Dutta, 2019). Second, governance and regulation mechanisms illustrate precarity through non-compliance with core labour standards or factory safety (Seidman, 2007; Barrientos & Smith, 2007; Amengual, 2010; Anner, 2019; Distelhorst & Locke, 2018; Anner, 2018). Finally, power imbalances, consolidation of buyers’ leverage, mergers, acquisitions, and market concentration have always been significant characteristics of global supply chain asymmetries (Gereffi, 1994; Gereffi & Memedovic, 2003; Dicken, 2015). Gereffi & Frederick (2010) argue that the combination of consolidated buyers and dispersed suppliers provides an insightful exploration into the study of precariousness. Thus, the study argues that buyers alone are not responsible for precariat conditions, but suppliers also play an equal role. And this is why the analysis of work organisations assumes importance in the literature of global supply chain. An emerging body of literature measures suppliers’ work organisation precariousness by exploring the relationship between buyers, first-tier and extended suppliers networks (Dyer & Singh, 1998; Mena et al., 2013; Grimm et al., 2014; Tachizawa & Wong, 2014; Gereffi and Lee, 2016; Alexander, 2019). Although the supplier structure is profound, there is a problem of traceability, which involves tracking the intermediary stages (Han, 2018; Barrie, 2014). This problem arises because of informality in trading relationships. Therefore, it is a challenge to assess precariousness at the suppliers’ work organisation level. Most South Asian countries, such as China, Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Sri Lanka, exhibit these characteristics. Such work organisation structures are flexible and fragmented, thus typical to many developing countries (Schüßler et al., 2018). Yet, there is hardly any information on how each supplier work organisation produces varying shades of precariousness (see Table 1). Therefore, the study argues that the knowledge on suppliers’ work organisations is incomplete, as their identities are masked between first-tier and lower-tier suppliers. Hence, by applying economic and social upgrading, the study can address the problems of traceability and provide an in-depth exploration precarity (see Table 1). Consequently, it is essential to unpack both forms of work organisations (buyer and supplier) to study the magnitude of precariousness. In this article, the analysis of precariousness unfolds in two manners. At the buyer level, the article hypothesises that the international buyer is the root cause of precariousness compared to the domestic buyer. At the supplier level, the paper hypothesises that the lower the supplier work organisation structure, the higher the precarity. Thereby, the research uses upgradation framework to substantiates these hypotheses. Based on this, the article’s flow is as follows: Section 2 describes the debates of fast-fashion, precariat spectrum, and suppliers’ work organisation, while Section 3 illustrates data, methods, and analytical framework. Sections 4 and 5 present the analysis on reorganization of work and workers socio-demographic factors to understand the process of precarisation in the textile industry. And Section 6 is on concluding remarks.",

This is recognised by the International Labour Organization (ILO), which emphasises the expectation of workers to receive emolument (wage) for their labour and work under acceptable conditions (ILO 1928; Kester and Adeyeye 2002). New Zealand and the Victoria State of Australia are widely credited with blazing the trail in minimum wage adoption and implementation in 1894 and 1896, respectively. The Victoria Wage Act of 1896 resulted in the amendment of the State Factory Act and informed the creation of a wage board that legislated for six specific industries (Nwude 2013, p. 480). In Britain, a Trade Board Act was enacted in 1909, which in turn led to the adoption of a national minimum wage in the UK in 1999, following the dissolution of the old minimum wage that operated at the industrial level from the 1980s (Nwude 2013, p. 480). Today, minimum wage fixing and regulation has become a popular industrial relations policy that over 90 per cent of ILO members practice it in various forms as a way of protecting workers and improving working conditions. In recent times, the minimum wage is increasingly perceived as a political economy problem of the developing countries probably because the advanced countries have effective minimum wage systems. For Nigeria, it is a long and intricate experience of minimum wage regulations, which makes an interesting historical study. Unlike most countries, a major political issue in government–labour relations over time has been how to achieve an acceptable minimum wage for the workers. The labour unions, namely the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) and Trade Union Congress (TUC), Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and others have in various times agitated for a wage increase and general welfare of Nigeria workers. Besides the wage increase, the income stability of the working class has a chain impact on the business community and society at large. Unfortunately, almost all the minimum wage increases in the past have resulted in national industrial strikes to compel the government to come to the table for negotiations. But why have all of these remained recurrent decimal in government–labour relations in Nigeria? How can this situation be reversed to create stability in the future? It is, therefore, germane to examine these in a historical context and proffer solutions to the lingering labour challenge. Many studies on minimum wage have come from economics focusing on the impacts of the minimum wage raise on employment and unemployment rates, the transition of workers across jobs and into and out of poverty, and in the general labour market (Marginean and Chenic 2013; Addison et al. 2013; Alaniz et al. 2011). Using the US economy as a case study, Addison et al. (2013), for instance, compare the level to which an increase in minimum wage can impact workers. According to the authors, increases affect a small number of low-wage earners, and it does not also immediately translate to a higher percentage of unemployment. Alaniz et al. (2011) adopted a broader approach in studying the effects of changes in legal minimum wages on host labour market outcomes. They concluded that changes will most likely affect only a set of workers with an initial wage close to (20%). Marginean and Chenic (2013) employed theory and empirical evidence using Rumania as a case study. They argue that studies on the effect of minimum wage raise on employment are not relevant anymore. Concluding, they insist that such studies must be conducted at the national or regional level given that the impact depends among other things on the share of minimum wage workers receive. Generally, their view is that studies on the effect of minimum wage on employment should focus on labour market outcomes in some specific sectors of the economy. They further drive home the arguments that increased minimum wage stabilise the workers, discourage inter-sectoral migration and potentially increase workers' purchasing power. Elsewhere, Gordon and Frankfurter (1928) studied the minimum wage system in the USA. The study shows that the practice of minimum wage is strictly on federating state level even though there exists a federal minimum wage law in the country. It reveals that the state of Massachusetts was the first to adopt minimum wage in the USA in 1912, followed by eight other states, namely California, Oregon, Colorado, Wisconsin, Washington District of Columbia (Federal Wage Law), Nebraska, Uta and Minnesota in 1913. However, Kester and Adeyeye (2002, p. 3) reveal that unlike America, there are countries with records of a collective national minimum wage for workers. These include France, Canada, Norway, Germany, Spain, India, Mexico, Brazil, China and Ireland which have all joined the minimum wage bandwagon in 1915, 1917, 1918, 1923, 1926, 1927, 1937, 1938, 1995 and 2000, respectively. In Nigeria, Onyeche and Edet (2017) trace the early attempt at introducing a national minimum wage to the former western regional government in 1954 born out of the consideration of giving good remuneration to the workers. It proposed to pay the workers more than fifty kobo per day for a four hour week of work and forwarded the proposal to the national government for approval which would have translated to the national minimum wage for Nigeria. However, the pay programme was rejected by the national government arguing that approving such a proposal will lead to a high rate of unemployment, inflation, which could together create a national industrial crisis in the form of a strike. Abada et al. (2019) wrote during negotiations for the 2019 national minimum wage. They considered the viability of states in Nigeria and the fragility of the national economy as a challenge to the payment of the proposed N56,000, arguing that some of them are yet to fully implement the N18,000 minimum wage of 2011. The study reveals that when the new national minimum wage is signed into law, the states will abdicate their roles and retreat to oblivion because of a lack of financial capacity to pay. Similarly, Oforle (2014) has argued that the extent of compliance by states with the payments of the minimum wage differs from one state to the other. He attributes the reason largely to the financial strength of individual states, recognised since 1991 as a major factor in public sector employers' compliance with any wage directive from the federal government in Nigeria. Both studies expressed worry that the fact some states government are struggling to pay N18, 000 minimum wage has cast doubt about the full implementation of the new minimum wage. A survey of the various commissions and committees set up between 1934 and 2011 to undertake the review of salaries and wages of workers in the public service in Nigeria has been carried out (Nwude 2013). Although he considers minimum wage as a living wage (which can fetch workers a decent living standard), the results of the survey show that the prevailing national minimum wages are grossly inadequate, making it difficult for public service workers to survive. This has been attributed to inflation characteristics which weaken workers purchasing power. He faulted the entire idea of the minimum wage increase, arguing that even if workers are paid higher than N18,000, it does not solve the problem because of hyperinflation that will set in owing to the price mechanism. He concludes, therefore, that rather than increase the minimum wage, the government should focus on strengthening the value of the Naira. However, there is nowhere in the world where workers’ wages are static because of the value of their national currency. Overtime wages are increased even in a recession as the case with Rumania (Marginean and Chenic 2013). The consensus is that wage increase is a global practice. But in Nigeria, no study has detailed the politics that characterised the 2019 minimum wage negotiations and implementation which has made it the most protracted and complicated so far in Nigerian history.",3

The wage differential between the farm sector and the industrial sector appeared substantially large which in turn drove the migrants to the urban localities. With over-crowding of labour in the agriculture sector resulting in declining productivity, the unionised industrial wages shot up during the seventies which provided a strong empirical support to these theoretical underpinnings. However, over time the illusion of the industrial wage has been widely evidenced and it is not seen to be functional in influencing the migration decision. The absence of the industries and the adoption of capital-intensive technology both are responsible for this. On the other hand, the services sector which has been prompting the overall growth of the economy seems to have emerged as a huge absorber of labour notwithstanding its tendency to generate low productivity employment on a large scale. In fact, the low-income activities within the urban informal services sector also work as a pull factor for urban in-migration in the face of rural unemployment, underemployment and poverty and in the absence of the rural non-farm activities offering vibrancy and dynamism. The services sector which is broadly characterised in terms of duality—a high and a low productivity segment with a bimodal distribution of income—bears linkages within these segments, resulting in spill-over effects. In other words, the expansion in the high productivity segment can generate labour demand through secondary effects in the lower rungs and wages may rise to provide respite to the job seekers. Whether poverty declines in response to this phenomenon depends on the extent of rise in wages in the informal services sector. On the other hand, the agglomeration literature argues in favour of concentration of activities which result in productivity gains, and the productivity benefits in terms of the increase in wages get transferred to the workers. Even the concentration of services—and not just manufacturing—can lead to these outcomes, as the literature on urbanisation economies, opposed to the localisation economies, would suggest. Hence, in the back drop of the deindustrialisation phenomenon occurring in the cities in the developing countries, the scope for agglomeration benefits still holds and the possibility of faster reduction in poverty can be perceived by bringing in the role of the services sector. Though the original ideas about agglomeration economies dealt much with the production sector, the new extensions are indeed interesting. The present paper proposes to examine the rural–urban migration phenomenon in relation to the growth in services sector on the one hand and the impact of migration on urban poverty on the other, given the agglomeration benefits associated with concentration and increased urbanisation. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: the next section revisits the literature on the services sector, migration and job search through networks in an attempt to offer an integrated framework. Section 3 reflects on broad patterns related to migration, composition of economic growth and poverty with its rural and urban constituents. An econometric approach is followed in Sect. 4 which develops a three-equation model with migration, consumption expenditure per capita and urban poverty as endogenous variables in a recursive system. Finally, Sect. 5 summarises the major findings.",1

Although the ultimate objective of any society is to reduce inequality of income, focus should be on reducing inequalities that arise from unequal opportunity (World Bank 2006). Unequal opportunity is a consequence of the differences in circumstances that are beyond the control of a person, and it is significant from the standpoint of social justice. Unequal access to quality education across social groups by their caste identity and also between gender classes transmits into unequal access to quality jobs and pay differences between them. People from less advantaged social groups are still at high risk of dropping out of school early (Shavit and Blossfeld 1993) and of having worse labour market outcomes (Hannan et al. 1995; Müller, and Shavit 1998; McCoy 2000). Parents’ social status, education, occupation and income affect directly and indirectly children’s education and ultimately their occupation and earnings. Gender is a critical determinant for the choice of profession. Women with equal endowment of human capital as of men have to face more constraints in selecting jobs. In many societies women have to perform additional efforts within the family and ultimately have to face many obstacles in entering into the labour market. Historically, the Indian society is segregated by different social groups in terms of castes, religions and ethnic identities with heterogeneous characters, and substantial economic disparities have been observed on the basis of caste, religion and ethnicity (Deshpande 2001; Government of India 2006; Kijima 2006; Gaiha et al. 2007; Gang et al. 2007; Desai and Kulkarni 2008). Thus, it is important to examine the role of these social variables in explaining earning discrimination among the working age people in India. Inequality persists in a society primarily because of the presence of unequal opportunity in access to education and employment (Arrow et al. 2000). The influence of circumstances violates the meritocratic criterion in determining individual’s employment and earnings. The success of policy interventions in alleviating inequalities and improving welfare depends upon their efficacy in compensating for the circumstance-based disadvantages and in expanding opportunities for the vulnerable part in the society (Peragine, 2004; Ferreira and Gignoux, 2011). Thus, correcting measures of unequal opportunity is necessary not only for egalitarian society, but also for improving economic efficiency and growth. This study analyses how earnings are affected by social identity, gender and parents’ background of the working age people in urban India controlled by their educational attainment. First, we analyse earning inequality among self-employed, regular salaried and casual wage workers in terms of circumstances and efforts (the terminologies used in the literature of inequality of opportunity) by using household- and personal-level information from periodic labour force survey (PFLS) in India for 2017–2018, 2018–2019 and 2019–2020. In measuring inequality of opportunity, we use ex ante approach in which there is equality of opportunity if all individuals face the same set of opportunities regardless of their circumstances. This paper is restricted to earning distribution among working age people (15–65 years) in urban locations in India. The rest of the study is structured in the following way. Section 2 describes the relevant literature on methodological issues and their application in empirical research in a very short manner. Section 3 deals with the methodological issues in measuring inequality of opportunity used in this study. A short description of data used in this study is provided in Section 4. Empirical findings are discussed in Section 5. Section 6 summarises and concludes.",1

While some groups appear resilient as the economy changes, others are more likely to face disadvantages as opportunities shift, and precarious employment situations become increasingly problematic. In recent periods, attention has been given to poor labour market outcomes, including unemployment and other forms of underutilisation. Statistics are now routinely provided on labour underemployment and general underutilisation levels, and commensurately, greater academic and policy research have gone towards understanding these broader states of labour market disadvantage. Research questions have focused on exploring the drivers of different aspects of underutilisation, understanding how long-term patterns have shifted and considering the individual and aggregate consequences of underutilisation (Baum et al. 2008; Campbell 2008; Mitchell and Carlson 2000; Rodríguez Hernández 2018). As with the narrow concept of unemployment, it is generally understood that an effective evidence-based suite of policy interventions should be possible by understanding the nature of underutilisation. Comparing the patterns of labour underutilisation for women and men is the focus of this paper. Its primary purpose is to consider the factors associated with underutilisation, including the characteristics of at-risk individuals and the features of the local labour markets, and the macroeconomy that individuals operate in. The analysis in the paper provides a unique opportunity to consider how these cross-cutting factors have impacted labour market outcomes by utilising panel data regarding labour market outcomes for women and men and linking individual data to other broader factors at the macro-level. The data cover the years 2008–2015 and are taken from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics Australia (HILDA) survey and are combined with regional labour market data obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This dataset allows the following questions to be addressed: What was the effect of supply-side characteristics on the risk of an individual’s labour being underutilised? What was the effect of aggregate/spatial demand-side characteristics on the risk of an individual’s labour being underutilised? What was the effect of macroeconomic forces in the post-GFC period on an individual’s underutilised labour? The Australian Bureau of Statistics regularly provides data regarding the extent and scope of labour underutilisation within Australia. Taking the period of 2007/2008, when the Global Financial Crisis began to bite until the most recent period, a general worsening of labour market outcomes can be noted. While there was a sharp increase in all measures in the immediate period of the GFC, the consequences for both men and women have continued to deteriorate until 2019 and have yet to return to pre-GFC levels. This is despite an improvement in aggregate labour market figures over the same time. Moreover, the post-GFC period has seen underemployment taking a larger share of the total underutilisation rate than had previously been the case. In terms of magnitudes, for women, the headline unemployment rate moved from 4.9% before the GFC to peak at 6.2% in June 2015, while underemployment moved from 8.2 to 10.7% over a similar period. The combined underutilisation rate moved from 13.0 per cent before the GFC to a high of 16.9 per cent at the end of 2014 before declining to the current (September 2019) level of 15.4 per cent (Fig. 1). For men, the headline unemployment rate moved from 4.0% before the GFC to peak at 6.3% in June 2015, while underemployment moved from 4.7 to 6.9% over a similar period. The combined underutilisation rate moved from 8.9 per cent before the GFC to a high of 12.4 per cent at the end of 2014 before declining to the current (September 2019) level of 12.2 per cent (Fig. 1). If hidden unemployment (those who are unemployed, not actively looking for work, but who would take a job) is added to these figures, conservative estimates might add an extra 5 per cent to the total underemployment rate suggesting a much more severe issue. Source: Australian Bureau of Statistics, Labour Force Australia, cat no. 6202.0 Unemployment, Underemployment and Underutilisation Men and Women, Australia, 2007–2019 (trend data). Reflecting the official statistics, empirical research based on survey data has often shown that women are more likely to find themselves underemployed or marginally attached to the labour force than men when a range of socio-demographic characteristics is controlled for. In contrast, men were more likely to face unemployment. Such differences clearly illustrate the gendered nature of segmented labour markets (Baum et al. 2008) and suggest that in contrast to some arguments (Flinn and Heckman 1983) for men and women, the different states of underutilisation are quite distinct. Given the distinct states of underutilisation experienced by males and females, it is useful, as this paper does, to consider how the determinants in labour market engagement might differ within gender-segmented outcomes. While conceptual frameworks differ, researchers have increasingly utilised a broad employability framework (Baum et al. 2008; Baum and Mitchell 2010b; Doran and Fingleton 2016, 2018; Wilkins 2006) that employs aspects of both labour supply and labour demand. This broad framework provides an understanding of a person’s ability to transition into and within labour markets and to realise their potential via accessible employment opportunities. For particular individuals, employability might depend on their skills level or the way that their personal characteristics are presented. Employability may also be associated with the broader social context within which employment is sought as well as the broader economic context (Department of Higher and Further Education 2002). These supply and demand (employability) characteristics include a person’s formal education, their health status, proficiency in English, the employment history of their family, their social networks and external factors such as the strength of the labour market they operate in and the condition of the broader macroeconomy (McQuaid and Lindsay 2005). In many cases, the existing research has identified that particular labour supply and demand characteristics such as education or age tend to have similar impacts regardless of gender. The Australian work by Baum and Mitchell (2010a) using a single wave of the Household Income and Labour Dynamics Australia (HILDA) survey identified that factors including age, ethnic background, English proficiency, family employment history and the presence of critical social networks were significant explanatory variables for both males and females when comparing the risk of unemployment and marginal attachment relative to being fully employed. Similar findings for the Australian context are also reported in the research by Wilkins (2006). In a similar vein, the more recent work by Rodríguez Hernández (2021) on underutilisation in Spain during the Global Financial Crisis identified that at the end of the economic crisis, factors such as age, education level and living with elderly parents or parents-in-law were significant in explaining the employment outcomes for both men and women. The authors also found that the strength of the local labour market was also important for both males and females, with those living in poorer performing regions being more likely to be disadvantaged in terms of employment. Focusing only on the rise of involuntary part-time work (underutilisation), the early research by Leppel and Clain (1988) found very little by way of differences in the drivers of involuntary part-time employment in their sample of males and females in the USA. In particular, they found that regardless of gender, economic slowdowns and service sector employment growth were significant factors in increasing the level of involuntary part-time work. In contrast, declining proportions of young children and a rising skill level of the employed had the opposite effect. The research by (Van Ham et al. 2001) also suggested that there may be only minor differences in factors contributing to the likelihood of labour market outcomes for males and females. Many of the labour supply and demand factors identified by researchers suggest little or no bias along gender lines. However, moving beyond these findings, there has also been analysis that has identified significant gender-specific effects, although often with no clear direction of the association. The circumstances where differences in gender outcomes are often considered associated with the types of occupation or industry an individual is employed in or the gendered stereotypes associated with the need to provide child care or similar caring functions. It is also argued that in line with potential differences in industry or occupational characteristics, males and females are impacted differently during economic downturns. This may also be an essential labour demand aspect accounting for differential outcomes. The Australian work by Baum and Mitchell (2010a) referred to above found that males tended to be impacted by the strength of local employment opportunities, which may have a particular industry or occupation characteristic, especially in terms of them being unemployed, while for females labour underutilisation (marginal labour market attachment) tended to be associated with a need or desire to provide childcare. This finding that the presence of children was associated with a reduced likelihood of women being adequately employed was also highlighted by Kjeldstad and Nymoen (2012) in their study of the Norwegian labour market. In their analysis, the authors found that the likelihood that a female would be underemployed rose as the age of children increased. The finding that the presence of children was associated with an increased probability of marginal attachment to the labour force by women is contested by the conclusions of others who argue that the presence of children does not necessarily result in increases in the likelihood of underemployment (Cam 2014; Rodríguez Hernández 2021; Wilkins 2006). For the Spanish sample utilised by Rodríguez Hernández (2021), the authors find that the presence of younger aged children reduces the likelihood that women would find themselves underemployed or a male would be unemployed. The Australian research by Wilkins (2006) also shows contested outcomes regarding the association between child care responsibilities and labour underutilisation. The difference between this analysis and other Australian work is explained by differences in samples and measurement of variables. Over and above the issue of childcare, research has also pointed to the impact that industry or occupation characteristics can have on gendered labour market outcomes. Here the problem is associated with the likelihood that some industry sectors or occupations are more likely to be related to part-time work and therefore more likely to be associated with underutilisation. The recent Spanish work by Acosta-Ballesteros, Osorno-del Rosal, and Rodríguez-Rodríguez (2021) illustrates this point, suggesting that being employed in female-dominated occupations and industries results in a higher likelihood of underemployment than in male-dominated ones. Similar arguments are made about the impact of economic downturns on the labour market outcomes of men and women. Researchers note that in some circumstances, male-dominated occupations have tended to be hardest hit by downturns resulting in males being more likely to find themselves unemployed or marginally attached to the labour market. For example, Hoynes et al. (2012), considering employment outcomes across several recessionary periods, found that men experienced more cyclical labour market outcomes when compared to women; an outcome they argue is the result of men being employed in more highly cyclical industries including construction and manufacturing. Similar findings have been discussed in Elsby, Hobijn, and Sahin (2010) and (Albanesi and Şahin 2018).",

McKenzie (2017). It posits that four global shocks necessitate the need for an employment policy concern; The first is  the global financial crisis of 2007–2008. This is followed by the rising demographic pressures in some part of the developing world, especially the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The third is the high rate of youth unemployment, particularly in developing countries. The fourth is the enormous progress in automation, leading to massive unemployment in many manufacturing jobs. Despite these, the impact of an economic structure on employment creation is very different and largely depends on whether the growth pattern experienced by a country is based on natural resources, rural-oriented agricultural production, exports, and manufacturing production. In many Sub-Saharan Africa countries, the overall perception of employment performance is rather negative and a long-standing debate as unemployment, especially youth unemployment, remains obstinately high despite improved macroeconomic fundamentals (Alagidede et al. 2013; McMillan and Rodrik 2011). The introduction of automation in many Sub-Saharan African countries have led to headlines like “Robots could eat all of Ethiopia’s jobs; South Africa, Nigeria and Angola not safe either” (Mwiti 2016), whereas employment creation has been dropped off in the agenda of most central banks (Epstein and Yeldan 2008) in many Sub-Saharan African countries. Though there is a consensus regarding the benefits of FDI on the receiving country’s wage levels and productivity (Hanousek et al. 2011; Radosevic et al. 2003), empirical research has failed to provide consistent results on the overall effect of FDI on employment (Bandick and Karpaty 2011; Jenkins 2006). In many cases, studies have shown that minimum wage increased by 10% in real terms leads to a 2.1% fall in employment (Kalenkoski and Lacombe 2013; Akçoraoğlu 2010). Concerning economic growth in Ghana, many questions have been raised among the general populace on the growth figures published by governments over the years. Published empirical articles have indicated that Ghana’s employment growth has not kept pace with economic growth (Aryeetey and Baah-Boateng 2016; Alagidede et al. 2013). Worst still in Ghana, the quantity and quality of remuneration from employment generally falls far short of its potential (Epstein and Heintz 2006), hence, there is agitation to governments to foster an environment to improve employment outcomes. An important worry is the rising cost of borrowing because of increases in interest rates which initially raise the rate of inflation. The usually high inflation rates, together with other macroeconomic variables, have made it not only difficult for the country to meet the convergence criteria for the West African monetary zone but have resulted in high-interest rate which has threatened the survival of many private businesses and their ability to create employment (Alagidede et al. 2013). Furthermore, the past two decades have witnessed a shift of employment from agriculture to services due to structural and productive transformation. Though, many private and public industries with large wage employment, notably the manufacturing and textile industry, have been on the decline for several years and have shed workforce. Evidence from the empirical research in Ghana has passively suggested that increases in minimum wage negatively affect employment as a result of the high cost of labour (Aryeetey et al. 2014), but studies that analyse the impact of daily minimum wage and economic growth on sectoral employment are rarely fruitful, which provides an indication of research space for this paper. Sectoral employment in Ghana is focussed on five main sectors, that is, the agriculture, service, transport, commerce, and the manufacturing, due to data limitations though, this study focusses on three out of the four main sectors, namely agriculture, manufacturing, and the service sectors in Ghana. To this end, the study aims at examining the effect of economic growth and the minimum wage regulation on total and sectoral employment in Ghana. From this objective, this paper answers important unanswered questions on the effects of economic growth and minimum wage regulation on employment in Ghana by asking the following questions: Does economic growth lead to higher levels of total and sectoral employment in Ghana? Do increases in the daily minimum wage lead to decreasing total and sectoral employment growth in Ghana? 
In this respect, to achieving the objective and answering the research questions, the study provides a comprehensive time series analysis of the Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) production function of the long-term and short-term analyses of the impact of economic growth and daily minimum wage regulation on key sectoral employment by using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) on a database spanning 1991 to 2018. This paper is organised into five main sections. Following the introductory section is Section 2, which provides a literature review of the relationship between growth, minimum daily wage, population growth, interest and inflation rates and employment. Section 3 derives an empirical model of employment demand in Ghana using a production function approach and the related econometric estimation of the demand model. Section 4 presents and analyses the empirical results while Section 5 concludes the paper.",3

In India, while international migration of workers has shown a steady rise, the size and scale of internal migrants far outweigh the number of international migrants. According to the Economic Survey, 2016, the number of internal migrants in India stood at 140 million in 2011 of whom 51 million are economic migrants. It is important to note that most of the economic migrants in India emanate from the rural areas. States that are considered to be laggards in agricultural and industrial development are net senders of migrants to other states and regions. The state of Assam has always been plagued by the twin problems of lacklustre economic growth and burgeoning population resulting in joblessness. This problem is more acutely visible in the rural areas where lack of agricultural development and tardy expansion of the non-farm sector have forced an exodus of workers to other states and even other districts within the state. The district of Hailakhandi situated in the southern part of Assam is one of the net migrant-sending districts of Assam. According to estimates, the net migration rate of workers from rural areas of the district during 2001–2011 in the age group of 20–29 years was − 9.25 (Dey et al. 2020). It is important to note that such economic migration gives rise to remittances to left-behind family members. These transfers are likely to have important economic impacts on the receiving area. The impact of remittances can be far-reaching and can be felt in different dimensions of the rural economy. At the micro-level, remittances can influence household spending patterns and welfare (Dey 2014). They can also have distinctive impact on the household’s labour supply decisions in terms of labour participation, occupational distribution and work intensity (Dey 2021). At the meso-level, remittances can impact rural wages and overall economic performance of the village in terms of poverty status and agricultural and non-farm development. This paper uses primary data collected from 325 households across five development blocks of Hailakhandi district to study the impact of remittances arising out of worker migration on household welfare, spending patterns and labour market choices. The research questions addressed in the paper are as follows: a. What is the impact of remittances on recipient household’s welfare? b. Do remittances influence the spending pattern of households? c. How do remittances influence the labour market decisions of adult household members in terms of labour market participation, work intensity and occupational choice? The paper is organised in six sections including the current introductory one. Section two gives an overview of available literature on the trends of outmigration from Northeast India. Section three contains a description of the study area and outlines the sampling design. Methods employed in the study are discussed in Section four. Section five presents the principal analytical findings of the paper. The last section summarises and concludes.",

India is no exception. Even prior to the pandemic, the inability of the Indian economy to create an adequate number of good, non-farm jobs was a topic of much debate in academic as well as popular realms; though at times this debate has generated more heat than light due to its political implications. In the years leading up to the pandemic, not only had economic growth slowed down, but the relationship between growth and jobs was the weakest it had ever been. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis, the employment challenge has acquired even more urgency. It is too early to predict the long-term consequences of the pandemic-induced shock on India’s structural transformation trajectory. Hence, the present paper deals mainly with legacy problems of weak structural transformation and slow employment generation that are expected to continue, if not worsen in the years to come. The Indian economy is characterised by declining output elasticity of employment generation, increasing informalisation within the organised sector, and a weak tendency towards structural transformation arising from a mismatch between high-growth and high labour absorption sectors together with serious constraints on the supply-side of the labour market, such as persistently low rates of labour force participation by women and a skilling/education crisis.Footnote 1 Thus, the labour market suffers from structural problems on both the demand and the supply side. The results are persistently high levels of informality and underemployment, as well as high levels of open unemployment among educated youth. The resulting debates on jobless growth, low female labour force participation, and continued informality have yielded rich insights into the Indian experience. However, there is sometimes a lack of clarity on what indicators to look at and what the appropriate points of comparison are. The result is confusion with regard to the pace and nature of structural transformation. In this paper, I propose a set of indicators that draw on existing literature and together can present a comprehensive picture of structural change. In these indicators, special emphasis is placed on employment conditions as opposed to output growth rates. I also analyse the nature of India’s structural transformation in a global perspective using the World Development Indicators database (WDI) and the Economic Transformation Database (ETD) of the Growth and Development Centre of the University of Groningen. Country-level data for India are obtained from the Employment-Unemployment Survey and the Periodic Labour Force Surveys of the NSO. I show that India’s performance in pulling workers out of agriculture is as expected given its level of GDP per capita, but the same is not true for pulling workers out of the informal sector as a whole. The result is a vicious cycle that connects precarity in the labour market to lack of structural change via a worsening distribution of income. I offer a conceptual framework to understand slow structural change and persistence of informality in India. I conclude by drawing on recent policy work at the Centre for Sustainable Employment and elsewhere to present a possible framework for a national employment policy that addresses both supply and demand side problems in the labour market. The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 outlines 5 key indicators that capture the relationship between growth, structural change and employment and that can be used to gauge the extent and nature of structural change. Section 3 takes a closer look at India’s performance over the past decade. Section 4 places India’s trajectory over the past three decades in an international perspective. Section 5 outlines a conceptual model to explain slow structural change. Section 6 offers a possible framework for a national employment policy.",2

In the 2011 Census, more than one-third of Indians, 37.6 per cent or 455.8 million, reported as lifetime migrants—four out of every ten Indian are migrants. The proportion increased from 31 per cent or 314.5 million, with a growth rate of 4.5 per cent per annum between 2001 and 2011. When the total volume of migrants is quite large, interstate migrants are minuscule and have been surprisingly low since 1961. It was recorded 3.3, 3.4, 3.6, 3.3, and 4.1 per cent in 1961, 1971, 1981, 1991, and 2001, respectively, and finally reached 4.5 per cent or 54.3 million in 2011 (Das and Mistri 2015). As the cheap labour force is one of the important factors of production, interstate labour migration balances the demand of labour to the economically well-off states like Maharashtra, Gujrat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Delhi, Punjab, and Haryana, supplying from the economically less-progressive states, namely Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, and Rajasthan. This trend has remained the same since the 1991 Census (Mistri 2021). In the 2011 Census, the North-East States and even West Bengal contributed substantially to the labour force supply (Mistri 2021). Despite a very meagre proportion, interstate migration plays a significant role in India's economic growth, and it shows unique characteristics for North-East states.

In many regions in the world, not only are women more likely to become and remain unemployed compared to men, they also have to accept lower-quality jobs. At the all-India level, women’s labour force participation is low and has declined from 38.9 to 23.3% between 1999–2000 and 2017–2018. By contrast, men’s labour force participation rates, though also declining, remained relatively high during this period, averaging 83.6% in 1999–2000 and 75.8% in 2017–2018.Footnote 1 The female workforce participation in India has been declining in spite of specific steps taken by the government on incentives, reservations, self-employment and skill training programmes. Between 2011–2012 and 2017–2018, the majority of the states have experienced decline in female labour force participation rate. In Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Punjab and Odisha, in particular, the average rate of decline of female labour force participation rate was worse than all India average (Thampi 2020). In Jharkhand state, three-fourth of the women workers are in the agriculture, mining and quarrying in rural areas. Less than 10 per cent of the women workers are in the manufacturing sector (PLFS, 2017–2018). The official statistics on employment can capture only part of the women’s work. Women work disproportionately more hours than men on ‘unpaid work’. Unpaid work encompasses a gamut of activities usually related to the household, ranging from cleaning and cooking, fetching water, wood, feeding/tending cattle to taking care of children and the elderly/sick, disabled. In developed countries, women spend on an average around twice the time on unpaid care work compared to men. In developing countries, this ratio is roughly three times (ILO 2018). Such imbalance in the distribution of unpaid care work has serious adverse implications for women’s work participation and thereby their economic empowerment. This paper aims to explore, based on a primary survey, the level of female workforce participation in rural Jharkhand at present, and to examine the quality of their employment. Their work status, wages earned and other aspects of employment are analysed along with the reasons for women staying out of the labour force. A brief discussion is also presented regarding the empowerment of women in rural Jharkhand. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the literature review. Details of sampling and survey instruments are described in Sect. 3. The results are discussed in Sect. 4. Finally, we provide a discussion of findings and conclusions in Sect. 5.",

Accordingly, the Indian Parliament on 23 September 2020 passed a set of three labour reforms bills, namely, the Industrial Relations Code (IRC), 2020; the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code (OSHWCC), 2020; and the Social Security Code (SSC), 2020. Along with the Code on Wages, introduced in 2019 by the Ministry of Labour, Government of India, these four bills form the much-demanded labour-laws reform by the industry bodies and investors. These labour reforms aim to decongest and simplify India’s otherwise multitudinous and complex structure of labour laws. Broadly, the Code on Wages, 2019, amends and consolidates the existing central legislation regulating minimum wage, payment of wages, bonus, dues, claims, etc. (GOI 2019). The SSC, 2020, amends and consolidates the existing central laws on social security, targeting the expansion of social security provisions to all employees and workers in all sectors of the economy (GOI 2020a). The OSHWCC, 2020, amends and consolidates the existing central laws related to occupational safety, health, working conditions, and related matters of employees working in various establishments (GOI 2020b). Finally, the IRC, 2020, amends and consolidates the existing central laws regulating trade unions, employment conditions, and industrial disputes resolution (GOI 2020c). Before the IRC 2020 got passed, the COVID-19 pandemic brought the abrupt disruption of the economic activities during the lockdown in early 2020. The looming economic crisis led several state governments to propose sweeping changes in the labour laws through ordinances as labour is in the Concurrent List. These states claimed that the proposed labour law changes are a remedial measure to kickstart the economy. However, few states even revoked most of the existing laws, including the various provisions under the Industrial Disputes Act (IDA), 1947 and its amendments in 1976 and 1982. Madhya Pradesh showed moderation in its decision to abrogate most of the provisions under IDA exclusively for the new firms established in the state over the next three-year period while continuing to commit to addressing the industrial disputes appropriately. Gujarat too abrogated the applicability of the existing provisions of the IDA for the new firms for the next little more than three years. However, Uttar Pradesh took the extreme step of revoking IDA altogether, not just on the new firms but also on the existing ones for the next three years. The labour organisations across the board, by and large, criticised these changes by various states which have not received the Presidential Assent yet. The state-level changes in the labour laws in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic coincides with the passing of the four labour reforms bills by the central government mentioned earlier. However, the four labour bills introduced by the central government were under formulation much before the pandemic. Hence, it is crucial to distinguish these from the State-level attempts in amending labour laws. The industry bodies have supported the labour reform bills passed by the Parliament that has received the President’s assent as these labour reforms were long overdue. However, the labour reform bills invited intense criticism from all the trade unions, arguing that the new labour codes are disproportionately pro-employer. One controversy is centred around the new provisions in the IRC 2020 governing industrial disputes resolution and employment protection in relatively big firms. These new provisions replaced and diluted the existing provisions brought through Chapter VB in IDA 1947 in 1976 and 1982. The new provisions in IRC 2020 relaxed the threshold size of firms from less than 100 workers introduced in IDA 1982 to less than 300 workers by allowing them the flexibility to initiate layoffs, retrenchments and closures without prior approval from the appropriate government agencies. In this note, we analyse the implications of the provisions of employment protection under IRC, 2020. The rest of the note is organised in the following fashion. Section 2 discusses the origins of the controversy related to employment protection legislation in India and surveys the existing evidence on the effects of labour market flexibility regarding layoffs, retrenchments, and closures regulations on employment dynamics. Next, in Section 3, we present the (estimated) number of factories and workers affected due to the change in threshold size in the IRC 2020. In Section 4, we examine the current relevance of the employment protection legislation during the Pandemic and what aspects of industrial relations could be the future focus of reform. Finally, Section 5 concludes the note.",

In 2015, the ILO adopted Recommendation No. 204 concerning the transition from the informal to the formal economy. The UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, adopted in 2015, have also focused on greater formalization. What is ironic, however, is that with the Covid pandemic, the world has seen informality—and consequent impoverization—increase across different countries. The ILO Monitor that regularly tracked the effects of the pandemic noted that more than 75% of the world’s 2 billion workers in the informal economy were adversely affected, with lock-downs and curbs reducing the earnings of those in informal employment significantly.Footnote 1 Subsequent editions of the Monitor noted that informal women workers were hit harder than their male counterparts.Footnote 2 Does a long-term response to such distress, as was faced and continues to be faced by our working poor, warrant a public policy and regulatory focus on reducing informality? Can there be a common set of policy responses on ending informality, or, is the reality of informality in the Global South different from that of the Global North? I ask these questions because the discourse on informality from the Global North has focused on the ‘standard’ employment relationship; deviations from that standard have been seen as characterizing informality. Policy prescriptions that flow from such a diagnosis are then centred on identifying critical aspects of the employer–employee relationship (the employment relationship) which are required to be strengthened. This course of action is premised on the employment relationship as being central to the world of work. The policy measures required to formalize the informal economy in the Global South, however, need to necessarily focus on not only the employment relationship, but also on self-employment, which predominates the world of work. Another challenge in formulating policies towards formalization is to map the categories of work that the law recognizes and to understand how well they correspond to the categories of work recognized internationally by labour statistics relating to informality of work and informality of enterprises. The convergence, if any, of the legal and statistical categories would assist in developing suitable policies to aid formalization of workers and enterprises. I propose to look at the different types of informal employment/work in India. Broadly speaking this would cover persons who are directly employed, persons working via intermediaries/contractors under a contract to supply labour, those employed in product outsourcing (or supply chain) economic units which are under a contract to supply goods or services to a brand, persons who work via platforms, and own-account enterprises that produce goods or provide service using only family labour. In all these instances, as R. 204 of the ILO notes, informality exists where economic units or workers are not covered or insufficiently covered by formal arrangements. I propose to examine the varieties of ways in which work is organized to explore entry points for formalization of informal work.",1

The gross domestic product (GDP) in India has increased at an annual average rate of about 7 per cent since 1993–94. This high rate of economic growth has been accompanied by a substantial decline in India’s poverty rate and changes in employment patterns, with a growing proportion of jobs in services and industry and a declining share of employment in agriculture. The Indian labour market, however, remains characterised by high levels of segmentation and informality (ILO, 2018). Labour market dualism in India has been documented widely in terms of formal-informal, employment status of workers, occupation types, sectors of employment and gender. The distinguishing feature of labour market duality in India can be located in the wage structure of the workers (Karan & Selvaraj, 2008; ILO, 2018). The analysis of wage trends is important for understanding changes in employment structure and functioning of labour markets (Himanshu, 2017). The level of earnings and wages of a workforce is considered a robust indicator of the livelihood status of the population. Real wages in India grew strongly after 2004–05 (ILO, 2018; Papola & Kannan, 2017). According to Papola and Kannan (2017), growth in GDP over the past two decades did not bring about higher wages. This was because factors that have an important bearing on wages such as higher demand for labour, greater state intervention or increased bargaining power showed a declining trend, and hence, employment growth has been declining. However, for some segments of the economy and the labour market, the trends have been different from that in the macro-economy and the national labour market, and often these segments have led the trends in wages. Some of the factors which have contributed to acceleration in wage rates include (a) agricultural growth along with periodic revision of support prices, (b) the implementation of MGNREGA, which stipulated minimum wages as part of social spending, (c) the employment dynamics in the construction sector, (d) shift of workforce away from agriculture to non-agriculture, (e) increase in casualisation, (f) decline in female workforce participation rate and (g) implementation of pay commissions (Papola & Kannan, 2017; Himanshu, 2017; ILO, 2018; Jacoby & Dasgupta, 2018). Thus, the increase in real wages of workers in general has not so much been a result of a simple general up-scaling of wages across all groups of workers, as of a structural change in labour market, but was characterised by increase in demand in some sectors and segments of labour market (Papola & Kannan, 2017). Further, in recent years, the twin shocks of demonetisation and goods and services tax (GST) have affected many sectors of the economy in terms of employment and earnings. The focus of this paper is on the trends in wages of regular salaried/wage employees (RSWE) and the wages of casual labourers. Since the data used in this paper are drawn from the surveys conducted by the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO), we follow the definitions used by NSSO. RSWE are persons working in farm or non-farm enterprises (both household and non-household) of others and getting in return salary or wages on a regular basis and not on the basis of daily or periodic renewal of work contract. On the other hand, a person casually engaged in farm or non-farm enterprises (both household and non-household) of others and getting in return wages according to the terms of the daily or periodic work contract is a casual wage labourer. It may be noted that RSWE may consist of workers in the organised sector or the unorganised sector. Similarly, casual wage labourers may be working in the organised or the unorganised sector. The organised sector consists of the entire public sector, private corporate sector, factory manufacturing and also the educational and medical institutions receiving government grant-in-aid. The unorganised sector consists of all unincorporated private enterprises owned by individuals or households engaged in the sale and production of goods and services operated on a proprietary or partnership basis and with less than ten total workers. All agricultural activities except those in the plantation sector and other types of organised agriculture (e.g. corporate or co-operative farming) are also considered as being in the unorganised sector. The literature has distinguished between organised/unorganised sector and organised/unorganised employment. Unorganised workers consist of those working in the unorganised enterprises or households, excluding regular workers with social security benefits, and the workers in the organised sector without any employment/social security benefits provided by the employers (NCEUS, 2007). There is correspondence to a large extent between unorganised sector and casual wage employment. But casual wage employment is increasing in the organised sector also. The RSWE may consist of workers whose employment is more contractual in nature. Consequently, this informalisation of the regular workforce will have an effect on the average wages. Therefore, it is important to analyse the trend in wages for RSWE and casual workers. Though there are many studies on wages and earnings in India, most of these studies are mainly focussed on agricultural wages. Moreover, there are very few studies that present a comprehensive picture of the trends of wages by location and across different states over a bigger time span. The present paper is a modest attempt in this direction. The rest of the paper is organised in the following fashion. In section two, we discuss the sources of data and methodology. In section three, we look at the distribution of regular wage or salary earning employees and casual workers. In section four, we look at the general trend of real wages for both regular and casual workers from 1983 to 2017–18. This is followed by an analysis of state-wise trend of real wages for both regular and casual workers in section five. Section six concludes the paper.",
65,3,The Indian Journal of Labour Economics,27 September 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41027-022-00390-w,"Brazilian Wage Curve: Further Evidence Based on Spatial Interactions in Times of Recession, 2012–2019",September 2022,Guilherme Cemin de Paula,André M. Marques,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"This paper verifies the existence of a spatial Brazilian wage curve based on individual hourly real wages using the Brazilian National Household Sample Survey (PNAD) for the period 2012 to 2019, probably the largest (microdata) sample ever used in this field. The central hypothesis is that the individual real wage responds negatively to local unemployment and competitive conditions in other regionally interconnected markets (e.g. contiguous states) because of labour mobility and the wage policy of enterprises. We assume that the local market conditions and labour supply in neighbouring areas affect local businesses’ wage policy, leading to spatial spillovers. The labour market’s capacity to adapt the labour force to new circumstances is essential in reducing the costs of macroeconomic shocks and policies (Amadeo and Horton 1997). However, in the face of labour mobility, commuting, and lower transport costs, local competitive conditions may be subject to the prevailing conditions in nearby areas when the regions are interconnected. In particular, the unemployment rate may exhibit a significant spatial autocorrelation: the unemployment of one region is correlated with the unemployment of neighbouring locations (Manning 1994; Palombi et al. 2017; Fingleton and Palombi 2013). We may expect employers to be aware of job opportunities in the local labour market and neighbouring areas (Longhi et al. 2006). The Institute of Applied Economic ResearchFootnote 1 (IPEA) indicates that since 2010, the lowest monthly unemployment rate in the metropolitan region of São Paulo was 9% (December 2011). In contrast, the highest was 18.8% (May 2017), after a reversal toward an upward trend in January 2015. This scenario corresponds to a roughly 100% increase in the unemployment rate, implying a considerable decline in the real wage in Brazil.Footnote 2 Besides, measuring the magnitude and significance of spatial spillovers is important for policy. The competition for state revenues or a drop in the level of activity in a given state may adversely affect the local real wage and lead to a reduction in real wages in neighbouring federative units. Thus, changing conditions in interconnected markets may accentuate negative trends by spreading their adverse effects. If spatial spillovers exist, they highlight the need for coordinated policy decisions at the state level. According to Baltagi and Rokicki (2014), neglecting spatial effects may lead to an overestimation bias of the elasticity of wages to local unemployment, mistakenly implying greater wage flexibility (lower costs) in response to changes in the local economic conditions. Besides, previous studies pay little attention to misspecification issues. In contrast, we adopt formal specification tests for the weak instruments problem and the exogeneity of the regressors. Neglected endogeneity and unaccounted-for heterogeneity might lead to inconsistent estimates. This paper contributes to the wage-curve literature in four aspects. First, while most studies in this field analyse developed countries, we use the largest micro-database that includes Brazil’s current conditions. Further, we obtain the disaggregated estimate for the elasticity of individual real wages for the whole sample and 20 different worker segments (e.g. men and women; rural and urban) and not only for aggregated data. Elhorst et al. (2007) and Buettner (1999) use only the mean of the variables. Second, we use 1-year lagged unemployment as an instrumental variable with region fixed effects, as suggested by Blanchflower and Oswald (1995), Baltagi and Blien (1998) and Elhorst et al. (2007). Therefore, our methods account for the unobserved heterogeneity and endogeneity of unemployment beyond estimating the magnitude of spatial spillovers. In contrast to Baltagi and Blien (1998), Baltagi et al. (2017), and Baltagi and Rokicki (2014), who ignore the problem of weak instruments and lack tests for endogeneity, we overcome these limitations by presenting formal hypothesis testing for both potential difficulties of the instrumental variable (IV) estimator.Footnote 3 Third, our spatial regression model enables us to estimate the magnitude of the local wage’s rigidity (direct effect) and its response to variations in the level of unemployment in neighbouring states (indirect effect)—the spatial spillover. Hence, our methods complement previous studies of Brazil that ignore these different sources of impact. Finally, using a considerably larger sample size, we obtain precise estimates and greater power for hypothesis testing than in previous studies [see, for example, Baltagi et al. (2017)].Footnote 4 When considering the whole sample, a 100% increase in local unemployment reduces the individual real hourly wage in Brazil by 2.61% while the same increase in unemployment in contiguous states leads to an additional 1.00% reduction in real wages. The same increase in unemployment reduces men’s real hourly wage by 2.45% and women’s hourly wage by 2.29%. Further, spatial spillover is significant only for men. The female labour market is not affected by competitive conditions in contiguous states. Our findings are robust to spatial effects present in the data, the weak instruments problem, and the endogeneity of the regressors. After a comparative analysis, we conclude that the assumption of independence of observations tends to generate an overestimated elasticity for the wage curve, as pointed out by Baltagi and Rokicki (2014). When we neglect spatial dependence, we observe an overestimation effect for the whole sample, men and women, formal and informal sectors, youth, and other categories. Besides, in contrast to Longhi et al. (2006), Baltagi et al. (2012), and Baltagi and Rokicki (2014), who have found inconsistently positive spatial spillovers, our estimates consistently show that both the direct effect and the spatial spillovers exhibit a statistically significant negative sign, following the theory. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 compares previous estimates and discusses related literature. Section 3 presents the methodology. Section 4 presents the results for the traditional and spatial wage curve, and Section 5 concludes. We provide relevant additional information in the Appendix.",

Discrimination may occur when most people obstruct a group’s access to quality education, health care, or high-level occupations. Accordingly, employment discrimination is any distinction, exclusion, or preference made based on race, color, sex, religion, political opinion, national extraction, or social origin, thereby adversely affecting disadvantaged groups’ opportunity in employment (International Labor Office (ILO) 2003). One of the types of discrimination that is prevalent in the labor market can be employment discrimination based on sex, particularly discrimination against women. The presence of women in the labor market has increased over the last decades, and the rising participation rate of women has led to a threat to men’s employment in different occupations, especially in high-level jobs (primary jobs). Therefore, many people, men account for the vast majority of the people, have tried to prevent women from entering the labor market. Women may thus face formidable obstacles that decrease their chance to achieve their goals in the labor market in comparison with men (Kricheli-Katz 2012; Plickert and Sterling 2017). The beginning of the considerable presence of women in the labor market was contemporaneous with the Second World War since the labor supply of men declined during the period. The dramatic decrease in the labor supply of men influenced public attitudes to the participation of women in the labor market because employers encouraged women to enter the labor market to counter shortages in the labor supply. However, when the men, who were engaged in fighting in the war, returned home, they faced competitive conditions in the labor market that could decrease the number and range of jobs available to them. Due to the problems encountered by the men, many people, particularly male workers, persuaded employers not to hire females. Therefore, many female workers have left their jobs or worked in low-level occupations (secondary jobs). Despite drastic measures taken in different societies to eliminate gender inequality against women in the labor market, many females face employment discrimination that can be the main impediment to their career advancement (ILO 2003). Employment discrimination would decrease the profitability of discriminators owing to an adverse impact on the labor supply, provided the labor and product markets were perfectly competitive (Becker 1957; Burns 2012). Assuming that workers are homogeneous (so that there are no differences in productivity between different groups of workers), a glance at Fig. 1 reveals the changes in the wage rate of labor and employment rate as a result of the participation of individuals discriminated against by some employers in the labor market. According to the figure, when this group of people enters the labor market, the supply curve of labor shifts to the right that not only reduces the wage rate of workers but also raises the number of employed people. The change in the supply curve of labor influences the price and quantity of output. Thus, the revenue of firms would be positively affected by employing all working groups. The effects of the participation of discriminated individuals on employment and wage Figure 2 shows the changes in the price and quantity of output caused by the participation of the group of people mentioned above in the labor market. The supply curve of output shifts to the right owing to the changes shown in Fig. 1. The revenue of discriminators and other firms, according to the changes shown in the figure, is different. Unprejudiced firms can increase their products from Q1 to Q2, while the price of the products in the product market decreases from P1 to P2. Nonetheless, prejudiced firms cannot reach Q2, and their maximum quantity at P2 is Q1. Accordingly, the revenue of prejudiced firms can be represented by the area P2CQ1O, whereas the revenue of unprejudiced firms can be shown by P2 E2Q2O. The effects of the participation of discriminated individuals on the price and quantity of output Due to the detrimental impacts of gender employment discrimination on economic growth and employment levels, the purpose of this study is to measure taste-based employment discrimination between women and men in six countries that include the Dominican Republic (DOM), Egypt (EGY), Hungary (HUN), Peru (PER), UK (GBR), and Uruguay (URY). We examine six types of economic activity classified by the codes of ISIC-REV.3.1 that are A–B, C–E, F, G–H, I, and J–P. One of the main reasons for selecting the countries is to measure employment discrimination in various regions with diverse cultures and different levels of development. In addition to the mentioned reason, the severely limited availability of data on some variables required for estimating the model employed to measure employment discrimination is another reason for selecting these countries. Furthermore, different periods are used for these countries owing to data constraints. Hence, employment discrimination is measured in DOM during 2000–2014, in EGY from 1996 to 2008, in HUN between 1996 and 2007, in URY during 2000–2010, in PER from 2009 to 2018, and in GBR during 1998–2007. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we cover theoretical and empirical literature.

From an economic perspective, social capital can be understood as an intangible form of capital, embedded within the structures, quantities and qualities of social network between and among economic agents, as well as the shared norms, beliefs, values and behavioral codes. It can indirectly work as a factor of production through facilitating access to physical, financial, human capital, and enhancing productivity as well. For example, ‘social collateral,’ i.e., networks, personal relationships and reputation, often replaces the traditional forms of collateral in case of poor’s access to formal credit (Bastelaer 1999), or facilitating access to financial capital. Moreover, social capital has a direct positive influence on a number of well-being indicators (Helliwell 2001). Social capital becomes relevant in studying the well-being of informal workers from both of these perspectives. Due to the key characteristics of informal employment, like income poverty, human development gaps and social exclusion (Chen et al. 2004), informal workers often tend to rely on social capital for their lives and livelihoods. In this paper, we attempt to evaluate social capital for a group of 542 informal workers residing in the rural and urban areas of Hooghly district, West Bengal, India. One of the many differences of social capital from the other forms of capital is its ownership. As social capital is generated from social relations, although an individual can exclusively invest in personal ties and contacts, and get return from their investment, there will always remain a certain amount of collective investment and return beyond individual control. Hence, social capital is simultaneously owned by the individual and the community or society concerned. Since our study is a micro-level analysis, focus has given on the individual ownership and the collective components (like shared norms) are treated as individual perceptions. Based on the theoretical structural-relational-cognitive construct of social capital proposed by Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998), we first construct an individual-level composite social capital index. Then we investigate how income varies with social capital and other relevant demographic factors. Section 2 provides an overview of literature, Section 3 presents the research objectives, Section 4 presents the methodology of analysis, Section 5 gives an overview of the different dimensions of social capital index and Section 6 investigates the effect of social capital index and other demographic factors on income of informal workers.",

With the COVID-19 pandemic, as the worldwide economic recession intensifies, NREGA is also increasingly emerging as an invaluable employer of the last resort across rural India. Due to one of the most stringent COVID-19 lockdowns in the world (Hale et al., 2020), to combat the loss of livelihoods and incomes, the demand for NREGA has increased significantly. In 2020–2021, NREGA provided employment to an unprecedented 76 million rural Indian households. Though, as a temporary COVID-19 relief measure, the central government had allocated an additional Rs 40,000 crore ($5 billion) in 2020 for NREGA, within a few months, several state and local governments had exhausted their expanded budgets. Despite this shortfall, the finance minister in the 2021–2022 budget has substantially reduced the allocation for the legal employment guarantee by 34 per cent from the revised estimate of the previous year. Instead, in the face of these economic shocks, there is a compelling need to revive and expand the allocations for guaranteed employment. However, since 2014, when the prime minister critiqued the entitlement in Parliament as a failure of the previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) coalition government (Scroll, 2015), there have been repeated attempts to undermine federalism (Aiyar & Tillin, 2020) and indirectly pressurise states to curtail NREGA expenditure and employment, notwithstanding legal obligations (Sethi, 2016). Attempts have also been made to reduce the provision for compensation for delayed payments (Sethi and Makkar, 2017). Despite the legal principle of work on demand, the central government has also introduced unprecedented ceilings on NREGA expenditure by state governments (Abreu et al., 2014). In this context, this paper analyses in the first section the fulfilment of the design of the NREGA as a legal entitlement conceptualised by a strong grassroot social movement to provide pro-poor benefits, especially for women and marginalised communities through the creation of productive assets. Second, the contention that the current NDA government has reduced support for the programme is examined for its veracity. Lastly, NREGA is compared with other successful international ‘employer of the last resort’ programmes to gauge the potential for its expansion. Based on this analysis, this paper argues for the universal expansion of employment guarantees in both rural and urban areas.",

Domestic work is not recognized as work, and there is a lack of documentation of domestic workers. The approximations in the literature (Goyal and Kumar 2019) put the number of domestic workers at five million, most of whom are women.
 Most of the domestic workers come from backward communities and relatively marginalized sections of society. The work done by the domestic workers is undervalued, underpaid and poorly regulated. Lack of decent wages, working conditions and defined work time, sexual harassment at the workplace and lack of protective legal provisions are some of the characteristics of domestic work in India. Unlike other works, domestic work is not restricted to any particular set of tasks within a household. Therefore, this occupation is defined by not the type of task but the place of work, which is the household. The “private, familial domain” also implies that state regulation is absent, and thereby, the standardization of wages and effective unionization is also limited. The wide variations in nature and types of tasks not only pose challenges in understanding the status of workers, but they also make the concepts of decent work difficult to be applied in this sector. Since the household is not considered a place of work, it is outside the inspection landscape of labour administration. Attempts are made to introduce a minimum wage for domestic workers, but fixation of minimum wage and implementation is not easy so far. Given this context, this paper ascertains the working conditions and wages of domestic workers in two cities, namely Ahmedabad and Kolkata, and generalizes the findings in a pan-Indian context. The working conditions and wages are discussed within the larger contexts of informality, the relationship between employer and employee and the dearth of protective legal provisions.",

In recent years, researchers’ interest has bought many discussions on ever persisting wage inequality across the globe. Empirical studies (Bertola & Ichino 1995; Kim & Sakamoto 2008; Mouw & Kalleberg 2010) have found that since 1990s, in-between occupational wage inequality has been affecting overall wage inequality in the USA. Further, the size of high and low-skilled occupations was visibly increasing than the medium-skilled occupations leading to occupational structure in USA more polarised. During 1983–2004, wage inequality was witnessed to be very high, but after evaluating the effect of the individual level factors such as educational diversity among workers, researchers have found that in-between occupational wage inequality was high as compared to within occupational inequality (Mouw & Kalleberg 2010). There is inequality in total wage earnings based on gender and education. During the period 1980–2007 in the USA, within occupation wage inequality has increased regardless of education of workers (Killewald & Near 2016). At the same time, within-occupational inequality trends were increasing across high-skilled occupations at different educational level. Level of wage inequality was high in unstructured jobs, particularly for those working in the field of medicine, whereas it was comparatively low in relatively structured job opportunities, i.e. teaching and engineering. Within-occupational wage inequality was relatively high among heterogeneous occupations such as sales work and management as compared to homogenous occupations such as teaching, nursing and engineering. Homogeneous occupations require similar trainings & job tasks and hence don’t provide wide base for wage variations. In the era of liberalisation and globalisation, the demand for skilled & professionally educated workers has increased in comparison with demand for unskilled & uneducated labour (Chamarbaghwala 2006; Sharma 2016). In a study on founder members of European Monetary Union, Theil index of income inequality measures found to be minimum (0.15) for Netherlands and maximum (0.24) for Portugal. The wage inequality in-between these two countries was up to 9 percent of overall income inequality (Beblo and Knaus 2001). Wage inequality is a reality of Indian labour market. Prior to 1991, wage inequality was witnessed to be increasing for all workers. Afterwards, in the way towards cope up with economic reforms, wage inequality increased in first decade, but started declining during 2004–2005 and 2011–2012 (Kannan 2018). It is observed to be high in private formal sector as compared to public sector & private informal sector. Rural wage inequality is also higher than urban, and the level of wage inequality is higher among regular workers as compared to casual workers (Das, 2012). However, it started increasing in urban area during 1993–2004. There was a visible growth in consumption expenditure of rich people as compared to poor people who live in rural areas (Cain et al. 2010). Before 1991 reforms, wage inequality has started increasing. During 1980–1990, wage inequality was increasing among urban male workers. Unequal distribution of skills and increasing premium on acquired skills are two main reasons of increasing wage inequality (Kijima 2006). At the nutshell, this is an accepted fact that economic inequality is a barrier in the growth path of an economy. Research generally link wage inequality to other economic inequality as wage inequality further causes consumption inequality, wealth inequality and income inequality. Wage inequality is also related to economic growth. Higher economic growth causes lesser wage inequality and vice versa. Economic growth is positively related to investment and employment generation process. So, the concept of wage inequality is having direct or indirect linkages with overall growth of an economy and hereby an important matter for exploration. The present study analyses wage inequality with the help of Theil index to facilitate computation of within and between skill-based occupational groups. The manuscript is organised in five sections. Section 1 provides a brief introduction of the concept followed by Section 2 which presents a detailed literature review of the related studies to understand the contribution of researchers in this area and to trace the research gap. Section 3 elaborates methodology in tune with hypothesis framed in the preceding section, and Section 4 is dedicated to the results obtained from the application of relevant tools & techniques on the data employed along with discussion on important points of results.

The economic growth driven by industrialization is further characterized by a structural change. By moving the economy from low-productive sectors to high-productive and efficient sectors, the industrialization process alters the social, political and economic dynamics of a society/population toward a positive and sustainable growth progression (Guadagno, 2003). However, a direct application of the experiences of the developed world cannot be copied and pasted into the current policies and practices of the developing nations. The developing nations have started their journey of independence and welfare governance roughly after the end of the Second World War (1945 onward). Most of these nations sought to go for the planned national development (Slater, 1975). The delivery of the expected outcomes failed at certain levels. The evidence for the same can be quoted from across the globe, for example, studies like Clark (2008) for Congo, Han, (2020) for South Korea, Haqqani, (2006) for Pakistan, McLaren & Cop (2011) for Turkey, Rao et al. (2017) for India among many others. People continuously moved out from agriculture but the industry failed and proved to be inadequate in absorbing all of this surplus labor. As a result of which people in the developing world were left with the option of finding self-employment ventures. Necessity and compulsion forced people into petty economic activities the sum total of which is referred to as the informal sector (Gurtoo & Williams, 2009). As such, the current economies of the developing world have starkly been bifurcated into (a) the formal sector and (b) the informal sector. Though there exists vast ambiguity over a well-defined, formal and globally accepted definition of the formal and the informal sectors in the economic literature, there is a general unanimity of thought that the registered economic units are a part of the formal sector economy while the un-registered economic entities belong to the informal sector (Desai, 2011). Though the neo-classical school of economic thought has associated economic growth and sustainable development with the formal sector of the economy (like; De Paula & Scheinkman, 2007; Ghose, 2017; Pratap & Quintin, 2006), the developing world has been growing on its own indigenous patterns. Self-employment has been pulling more and more people into the informal sector as the formal sector has been failing to absorb the ever increasing labor force in the developing world. One of the major questions arising from this observed digression to development manifested by the developing nations including India is whether the informal sector in the developing world is contributing positively to the economic outcomes or is it a negative sub-sector of the economy that needs to be disfranchised and halted to grow any further? The study is further motivated by questions like; Are these two sub-sectors differentiable? Does the formal sector suffice the needs and demands of the people living in the developing world? Is informal sector able to affect the lives of the people living in the developing economies of the world? And do the two sectors show a unique mutually inclusive growth trajectory in the field of study? The present study is an attempt to simultaneously understand the economic status of formal and the informal sector(s) in terms of efficiency of the Indian economy at a point in time. The study is motivated by the very ground realities faced by the people living in the developing part of the world. Informal sector being an essential part of the lives  of such people, it becomes essential to explore the coexistence of the formal and informal sub-sectors within such economies. The relevance of the present study lies in the direct association between the common people across the developing world and the impact formalization, semi-formalization and informalization have on them. Based on these considerations, the need was felt for a simultaneous analysis of the formal and the informal sub-sectors of one such economy, in this case India. Only after an empirical analysis informed policy interventions can be recommended and set in place. Which is the ultimate aim of the present study. The stochastic frontier analysis is used as the econometric approach toward the understanding of the same. India being a large nation, the largest democracy of the world and having the second largest population as a country is a strong case to understand the nature of the formal and informal sectors of the (Indian) economy. At the same time, it is a perfect fit to open up the debate about the simultaneous existence of the formal and the informal sectors. Therefore the present study first analyzes some descriptive statistics pertaining to the formal and the informal sectors of the Indian economy. After the preliminary analysis is made, the study estimates the stochastic frontier production functions for the two sectors and predicts the technical efficiency of the firms. The findings of the study bring forth some features of the two sectors and validate a positive and constructive presence and contribution of the informal sector in the Indian economy alongside the formal sector. The regression analysis in the study highlights the factors contributing positively and negatively toward the technical efficiency (TE) of both the formal and informal sector in order to arrive at better policy recommendations. The manuscript is divided into five sections. Section 2 briefly discusses the Indian industry in light of the formal and informal sub-sectors. This is followed by data and methodology summed up in Section 3. The results and discussion of the current study are presented and analyzed in detail in Section 5. The study is concluded in Section 5 and the policy recommendations following the analysis are presented therein.",1

Subcontracting means the manufacture of goods by one firm for another based on the latter’s specifications (Lazerson 1990a, b). A firm offering subcontract known as the principal firm requests another independent enterprise called the subcontracting firm to undertake the production or carry out the processing of a material, component, part or sub-assembly according to specifications or plans provided (Holmes 1986). It allows principal firms to take better advantage of the division of labour. Subcontracting helps principal firms shed marginal activities and concentrate on strategically important ones (Lazerson 1990a, b). The study explores subcontracting in the unorganized manufacturing sector in India. It examines the incidence and determinants of subcontracting and attempts to investigate the motivation of firms pursuing subcontracting. Profit share is the simplest estimate of the firms’ surplus and does not take into account the wages or compensation paid by the owner to family workers and other workers being engaged full time or part time. So, we estimate net accumulation fund (NAF) which provides a better picture of the firms’ surplus. NAF is based on the notion that the owner possesses liability towards unpaid workers. The compensation to unpaid workers (pseudo wage) is calculated based on the wage of hired workers from similar enterprises. This pseudo wage is adjusted from the surplus of the firm in order to estimate the real surplus or NAF which potentially transforms to the capital accumulation by firms. Subcontracting was not given due importance in early classical and Marxian literature, they considered it as a marginal activity which would gradually disappear. However, it continued across different phases of industrialization. Conceptualization of production techniques such as vertical integration and markets based production facilitates economic understanding of subcontracting (Arrow 1975; Coase 1937). A firms’ decision to obtain a product either through internal organization or via the market depends upon transaction or organization cost. Firms rely on the market when the cost of organizing an extra transaction within the firm becomes equal to the cost of carrying out the same transaction by means of an exchange in the open market or cost of organizing in another firm (Coase 1937). Firms’ ability to vertically integrate the production process depends on the ability to control and coordinate the high volume flows (Chandler 1977). Subcontracting is not very widespread as it creates high transaction costs by the assets specificity linked to it. The asset’s specificity arises in geographical, physical or human attributes. The transactions of these particular assets are highest, creating bilateral dependency. The problem of bounded rationality arising out of the dependency or bilateral monopoly involves additional settlement costs. The same is resolved very quickly in a vertically integrated company. Therefore, reliance on subcontracting is profitable only if the transaction costs are non-repetitive and the products require minimum capital or skill or if there are standardized and non-complex products (Williamson 1971). In recent years, such linkages are steadily spreading in many industrially advanced regions. Small and micro-enterprises work for more extensive industrial units. The rationale for forging such an arrangement is robust only in some product lines. It is estimated that in 2015–16, 30.04% of manufacturing firms pursued subcontracting. Of the total, 32.64% of subcontracting firms were in rural areas against 26.51% in urban areas. The unorganized sector enterprises employ families and other workers for production. These firms are either own account enterprises (OAEs) or establishments with few hired workers located within households. About 85% of the total unorganized firms are OAEs. There is a lack of information on the compensation paid to the family members. Therefore, there is a gap in profit or surplus reported and actual surplus. Surplus is a part of gross value added (GVA) left after paying rent, interest and compensation to the workers. The retained earnings or surplus of the enterprise is also the net income of the household (Kesar and Bhattacharya 2019). A part of the surplus is paid directly or indirectly to the family workers. This invisible part is a subset of the surplus of the enterprises. Involving family workers means more funds are required for consumption as the firms’ income is the primary source of household earning. It is probably due to this factor that the reported surplus of the firms does not lead to the capital accumulation and enlarged productive capacity therein. The study, therefore, attempts to draw the net accumulation fund (NAF) using the pseudo wage fund calculated using a similar firm from the same cohort. Pseudo wage is the expected compensation given to the unpaid family workers, had they been working as a hired worker in the same enterprise. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the available literature on the issue, discussing both theoretical and empirical studies. Section 3, the methodology section, discusses the data, methods and variables used in carrying out required analyses. Section 4 consists of the results and discussion on incidence, profit share, pseudo wage and net accumulation fund, determinants of SC, the status of required assets and loans, and the nature of SC relationships. Section 5 discusses the conclusion of the study.",

Most women workers are either working as unpaid labour on their family farms or are landless workers working for wages on others’ farms. They are also largely engaged in animal care. With the fall in overall Female Labor Force Participation (FLFP) in rural India, from 33.3% in 2004–2005 to 18% in 2017–2018 (NSS 2004/2005, PLFS 2017–2018),Footnote 1 the proportion of women engaged in agriculture has also come down significantly from 83% in 2004–2005 to 73.2% in 2017–2018 (PLFS, 2017–2018). However, this period of falling FLFP in rural India coincides with a phase of high economic growth and a process of structural transformation in terms of an absolute fall in the number of workers engaged in agriculture (Thomas 2020). Kesar (2019) finds that between 2005 and 2011–2012, approximately 50% of the households that received their primary income from agriculture self-employment or agriculture wage labour in 2004–2005 transitioned towards non-agriculture sectors in 2011–2012 as their primary source of income. This can be seen as the manifestation of a more general process of deagrarianization. Deagrarianization is a multi-dimensional process that involves livelihood reorientation and spatial realignment away from rural/agrarian bases (Bryceson 2019). The process of structural transformation and movement away from agriculture at the economy level and its effect on FLFP have been studied with respect to the U-shaped hypothesis. Goldin (1994) proposes that in the initial stages, FLFP is high as women are largely concentrated in agriculture. In the second stage, as the manufacturing sector becomes dominant, FLFP falls via simple income effect and because of the stigma associated with women working in factories or outside their homes more generally. In the third stage, as the services sector becomes dominant and the gender gap in education falls, FLFP rises as women can obtain white-collar jobs. There is no concrete evidence in the favour of the existence of the U-shaped hypothesis in the Indian context (Gaddis and Klasen 2014; Lahoti and Swaminathan 2013). This paper proposes a different understanding of the process of structural transformation in terms of deagrarianization at the household level. This alternative understanding is very crucial to study the FLFP outcomes in a country like India, primarily, because family farms are very important for women and deagrarianization changes the dynamics in family farms in terms of change in land use and change in the division of labour based on sex. As a large majority of women depend upon family farms for employment, with deagrarianization at the household level, women may no longer have the option to engage in agriculture and allied occupations like animal care, especially if deagrarianization is driven by a change in land use from agriculture to non-agriculture purposes. The overall female labour force participation outcomes in terms of shifting to non-agriculture sectors of the economy or withdrawing from the labour force altogether will depend on a variety of demand and supply-side factors including the nature of the growth process in terms of the creation of employment opportunities, the burden of household responsibilities on women and household and individual characteristics including caste, religion, age, education, etc. This alternative understanding is also important because the Indian growth process doesn’t follow the standard structural transformation pattern and FLFP outcomes are mediated by household and individual characteristics which are captured better at the household level. Therefore, this paper examines the effect of deagrarianization at the household level on the nature and scale of women’s work. There are some studies in the African context (e.g. Bryceson 2020; Porsani et al. 2019) which examine the relationship between FLFP and Deagrarianization at the household level and have found that deagrarianization can result in various kinds of FLFP outcomes such as a change in industry/occupation from agriculture to non-agriculture or feminization of smallholder farming. To the best of our knowledge, this relationship hasn’t been examined for the Indian case. We use the Indian Human Development Survey panel data set for 2004–2005 and 2011–2012 to examine the various trajectories of Female Workforce Participation outcomes such as staying in the workforce or dropping out of the workforce in the face of deagrarianization at the household level using a Linear probability model. The paper also maps transitions across different types of work (agriculture/non-agriculture) in the face of deagrarianization at the household level. Note that the paper looks into WFP outcomes for females rather than FLFP outcomes. This is because, in IHDS, we have data on if a person is working or not, but we do not have data on whether a person is actively looking for work or not. Accordingly, the paper considers individuals who are working as per the definitions used in IHDS as part of the workforce. A household that earned the majority of its income from agriculture in 2004–2005 is considered deagrarianized in 2011 if agriculture is no longer the primary income source in 2011–2012. More details on identifying the workforce status of a woman, type of work and identifying deagrarianized households will be discussed later in the data and definitions section. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 looks at the existing literature on the effect of deagrarianization on female Workforce participation outcomes. Section 3 discusses the data and definitions used in the paper. Section 4 provides the deagrarianization pattern at the household level for the Indian economy for the period 2004–2005 to 2011–2012 and female workforce participation outcomes.

The world is a collection of systems, and path dependence has shaped the economic and social realities of institutions and individuals. However, growth is not an organic process. In most developing countries the process of growth has been exclusive which has led to thriving dualism and inequality. Contemporary literature on economic development suggests that this inequality is the most tangible manifestation of Neo-liberal capitalism (Koechlin 2013). Neo-liberalism, by definition, has been widely used to characterize the resurgence of market-based institutional shifts and policy realignments across the world economy and is known to generate diverse geographical outcomes by reacting and compounding with the local features of spaces. Around the globe and especially in the global south, urbanization and privatization have aggravated the troubles of the marginalized sections who migrate to urban areas in search of work. This has led to the creation and expansion of informal spaces that are defined by slum dwellings where the migrated population lives, works, and navigates through the ordeals of life under clouds of risks, threats, and uncertainty. Rural to urban migration streams cause an inflow of a huge number of migrants who often find a place in the peripheries of the cities. In India, the migrants who move down such streams end up taking jobs in the labour sector with wage differentials between them and the local population of the city. Moving to the city ensures some rise in employment opportunities, but it exposes the migrant population to certain economic and social challenges. The cost of living in the city, the challenges of informal work, along with social challenges such as the degree of hybridity and extent of hospitality, received from the host society amalgamate to create precarity for the migrant population. The contemporary literature offers pieces of evidence as to how women migrants have been at the forefront when it comes to post-migration precarity. Their ordeals vary yet persist at all three levels of migration—the transition, settlement, and interaction. To understand the creation of precarity for women migrants who move down from rural to urban migration stream and settle in the city that runs on ruthless wheels of neo-liberal development, we shall take the case of migrant women to waste pickers settled in the urban slums of the city of Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. These women, along with their families, have migrated from Barpeta, Assam, which lies in northeast India. Assam is largely a rural agriculture-based state economy. District Barpeta lies in lower Assam which is highly prone to floods. With several geographical, social, and political challenges, it has also been called the “problem state” of India. The state has had a history of episodes of ethnic violence and conflicts. The lower Assam shares a porous boundary with the neighbouring country of Bangladesh and there has been an influx of cross-border immigration.
 Due to this phenomenon, the inhabitants here also face the allegations of being illegal immigrants who enter the Indian territory through the river route, settle in the riverine islands of lower Assam which are known as Chars in local parlance, and then move further to mainland claiming that they belong to the state of Assam (Khandakar 2016). Due to this identity problem, all the Bengali-speaking Muslims of Lower Assam region, even those who are indigenous Muslims, face discrimination and are victims of the insider–outsider debate. When floods and failed crops take them to upper Assam, they are denied work opportunities because of their identity. Income, insufficient land, and poverty along with the identity crisis lead them to migrate to other states outside Assam (Misra 2015). One such migratory route ends in the city of Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. Lucknow is the capital city of Uttar Pradesh which lies in the central north region of the Indian territory. The distance between Barpeta to Lucknow is 1577 km, and hence, this is a long-distance rural to urban migration phenomenon. While studies show that seasonal or circular migration is a popular form of migration to break the cycle of poverty (Kumar and Rajan 2021), this migration stream between Lucknow and Barpeta happens to be permanent in nature. In the past 20 years, more than 90,000 migrants have moved through this stream to settle in the slums of Lucknow (Vigyan Fountain, Lucknow). They have come to Lucknow through networking. Many people from different villages in and around Barpeta come here and later on tell their counterparts in Assam that livelihood prospects are better in Lucknow and they can work round the year unlike in Assam where annual floods displace them from their homes as well as from work. Carrying the burden of wounded identities (Misra and Tewari 2020), the ordeal of their daily quest takes a new shape in their host society where they engage in the informal work of waste picking. While they migrate, most of them bring their families along with them, and males along with their wives and children are engaged in the occupation of collecting waste from door to door.
 In this paper, we bring together a qualitative analysis of the lived experiences of female waste pickers now residing in Lucknow. To understand the intersectional realities of migration and identity, we have considered women waste pickers for our study. Homogenizing identities is a way in which the voices of the vulnerable are purposely unheard. To acknowledge this purposive ignorance, we adopt the terminology of “precarity” rather than “vulnerability” (Standing 2011). Women commonly get engaged in waste picking work as it does not require any educational qualification, no financial or capital prerequisites. There are no barriers to entry. But the placement of women in the lowest position shows that women in the informal sector are low-paid and exploited and prone to higher risks and uncertainties (Kabeer 2015). In the next few sections, of this paper, we have systematically laid down how women got placed in these lowest positions and how this relates to the neo-liberalism debate, thus, creating a systemic inequality in India.

Technological advancement is endemic to economic growth, and growth in output which is more than proportionate increase in inputs is attributed to total factor productivity growth (TFPG), after controlling for returns to scale. Therefore, decomposing growth in terms of resource-driven and non-resource-based components, the endogenous growth models can be relooked to identify the major determinants of the latter part, i.e. TFPG. Endogenous growth models urge that research and development (R&D) expenditures taken as a broad proxy for innovative moves contribute directly to firms’ productivity enhancement, and indirectly through their industry-wide spill-over effects (see Grossman & Helpman 1990; Romer; 1986). Similarly, import of technology and foreign direct investment (FDI) can also result in technological advancement, contributing to TFPG. At the global level, TFPG has witnessed a deceleration in the recent past which is a matter of serious concern. In the light of Kuznets’ (1966) modern economic growth, while the developing countries may be trying to catch up with the developed countries by investing in factors that contribute to productivity and growth, the gap between the two sets of countries may not actually disappear. This is likely to happen only when the developed countries are able to pursue technological progress in a continuous manner, translating into shifts in higher levels of productivity. However, the productivity decline in the recent past is indicative of poor performance both from the point of view of the developed as well as developing countries. Investment growth has slowed down in both developed and developing countries with implications on innovation, skills and infrastructure, and through these factors on productivity (Das 2018). The technological progress among the leaders has decelerated, while the developing countries are not able to raise their performance in terms of productivity. Even when factor input contributions remained relatively strong, TFPG declines occurred in the emerging market economies (Erumban & Ark 2018). The contribution of ICT has reached a saturation point (Erumban & Ark 2018) as the cost of capital for the price of IT capital input is very large relative to the cost of capital comprising non-IT input (Jorgenson 2018). Though the labour share is on the decline, the share of intangible capital is on the rise and the globalization process with its consequent effect on value chain has possibly resulted in productivity declines in the developed countries without commensurate increase in productivity growth in the developing countries as their growth is resource intensive. Besides, the cost of knowledge workers using ICT might have been on the rise, reducing the TFPG (Jorgenson 2018). The other issue relates to the effect of technology on employment. A large number of studies have argued that new technology, particularly when it is imported from the labour scarce developed countries, is capital and skill intensive, which may be reducing the pace of employment creation, particularly from the point of view of the unskilled variety of labour (Berman and Machin 2004; Acemoglu 2003). The import of capital and skill intensive technology from the developed to the developing world results in sluggish employment growth though UNIDO (2005) urged that such technology mobility should be facilitated by other means of reforms on the macro-front. Globalisation and the economic reforms pursued by most of the countries at the behest of World Bank-IMF initiation did witness a sharp decline in the effective rate of protection and other trade barriers all of which encouraged import of technology. The adoption and adaptation of these international technologies are indeed costly because of tacit knowledge and circumstantial sensitivity of technology (Evenson & Westphal 1995). Further, unless an importing country has significant technological capability, it cannot fully utilize the imported technology. Besides, imported technology may require more skilled than unskilled workers, while developing countries usually have an abundant supply of the latter type. Acemoglu and Zilibotti (2001) argued that due to the difference in skill scarcity, technology in developed countries tends to be skill intensive and is inappropriate for developing countries. Though UNIDO (2005) argues that it is still cheaper for a latecomer to buy the technology already invented by others than to re-invent the wheel, there can be serious implications in terms of employment loss. On the other hand, a number of reasons are cited to suggest that new technology in developing countries can still create new employment opportunities. Vivarelli (2013) for example argues that the new technology may enhance profitability, resulting in new investment with job avenues. The displacement and compensation mechanisms which are at work have been discussed with great details by Vivarelli (2013). He reminds that labour-saving and deskilling effects of capital-intensive technology have been a concern since the Luddite movement of the early 19th century. However, he also draws attention to the theoretical debate, which identifies a range of compensation mechanisms that may alleviate such concerns. Labour-saving effects of technology can be offset through: (i) additional employment in industries producing the new machines; (ii) higher demand for goods/services due to lower prices; (iii) new investments made using extra profits; (iv) decreases in wages resulting from price adjustment mechanisms; (v) higher income resulting from redistribution of innovation gains; and (vi) new products created using new technologies. Mitra and Jha (2015) further noted that innovation of new technology may lead to an expansion in the activities of firms such as processing of by-products, without any proportionate increase in capital. All this is expected to raise employment in absolute terms though labour to value added ratio may not increase in comparison with its pre-innovation magnitude. The paper uses the UNIDO data for the organized manufacturing across 132 countries for the period ranging from 1990 to 2010. The definition of the organized sector may be different across the countries, and hence, the interpretation needs to be made carefully. The study proposes to estimate TFPG and technical efficiency (TE) for several countries (relatively more number of developing countries) and decipher patterns, if any. It also examines the relationship between TFPG and labour productivity growth (LPG) in order to throw light on the dampening effect of TFPG. The effect of technology perceived through changes in TFPG/TE and the number of patents, on employment, comprises another important dimension of the paper. Information on patent and per capita income in constant prices is taken from the World Bank data set. The variables such as value added, wage rate and capital in different countries are given in nominal terms by UNIDO, and they are subjected to the influence of foreign exchange movement and domestic inflation. In order to convert them into real terms, we have considered the figures in international currency (dollar) based on the average exchange rate prevailing over 1990–2010 and then deflating the figures by the country-specific implicit price deflator. The methodology adopted to estimate TFPG and TE from panel data is due to Cornwell et. al. (1990), where TFPG is estimated as a combination of technological progress (regress) and the change in technical efficiency. From the production function estimated on the basis of the panel data (across countries and over time), the coefficient of time trend is taken as the pace of technological progress (regress). In the second stage using the residuals as a quadratic function of time for each country separately, TE and the change in TE (dTE/dt) have been estimated. Then, the estimated values of the residual from all the country specific regressions, using the inter-temporal data, have been pooled and relative to the maximum value the efficiency index for each country and for every year has been generated: exp(residual—max residual). Thus, though the technological progress is perceived to be common for all countries over a given time period, which in a globalizing world is quite a realistic assumption, the change in technical efficiency over time is perceived to be different across countries. Hence, TFPG over time and across countries is likely to have considerable variations (for details on the methodology see appendix). The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 focuses on the TFPG estimates across countries over different time constellations and tries to verify if the cross-sectional variations in productivity estimates are converging in a broad sense. Section 3 turns to the relationship between labour productivity and TFPG in order to reflect on whether the contribution of non-resource-driven growth is driving the factor productivity or whether the rise in productivity of one factor (labour) is mainly related to capital accumulation without improvement in the overall performance. Section 4 turns to the relationship between technology and employment. Improvements in technology may raise productivity which in turn tends to reduce the utilizations of all factors including labour. Alternately, technological progress makes technology cheaper, improves the accessibility of all types of firms, expands the scale of production and encourages the processing of by-products, all resulting in rise in employment. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the major findings.",

Formulating and implementing an effective public response to the pandemic requires high-frequency data. In the Indian case, the only national-level household survey data on incomes, employment and consumption, that was available throughout the pandemic at a lag of a few months, was the private Consumer Pyramids Household Survey (CPHS) of the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy (CMIE). This dataset has been used extensively to analyse the economic impact of the pandemic as well as the reach of relief measures (Abraham, Basole & Kesar, 2021; Bhattacharya & Sinha Roy 2021; Bussolo et al. 2021; Deshpande 2020, Deshpande 2022; Dhingra & Ghatak 2021; Gupta et al., 2021; Gupta et al. 2022; State of Working India, 2021; Vyas 2020). More recently, this dataset has also been used by World Bank researchers to estimate extreme poverty in India prior to the pandemic (Sinha Roy & van der Weide, 2022). However, the CPHS is a complex and relatively new dataset, and several questions remain unanswered as to its comparability with official surveys released by the National Statistical Office (NSO). In this paper, we examine the comparability of labour income estimates from the CPHS and India’s official labour force survey, the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS). In the past year, there has been a debate about the sampling and representativeness of the CPHS. Somanchi (2021) compares CPHS with the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) on age structure, sex ratio, educational distribution, and asset ownership. He finds that the former underrepresents women and young children, and overrepresents well-educated households while underrepresenting the poor. Pais and Rawal (2021) critique the sampling strategy of the survey. On comparing data with other national surveys on some key employment and occupation variables, they identify problems with survey design and implementation which could result in exclusion of households belonging to marginalised communities. Vyas (2021a, 2021b) counters these claims and maintains that even with differences in the sampling techniques when compared with official surveys, CPHS is representative at the national level. Abraham and Shrivastava (2022) compare the employment status for men and women across CPHS, Labour Bureau and PLFS data to find that even with the differences in methodologies, the estimates for labour market indicators for men coming from CPHS are comparable with those from other surveys. They find results to vary for women with measures of participation in the labour force being sensitive to the way questions were asked in the different surveys. Sinha Roy and van der Weide (2022) have recently developed an alternative set of household weights for the CPHS sample that brings survey averages in closer agreement with NSO estimates. We build on this literature by comparing estimates of labour income from the CPHS and PLFS. But our aim is not to “benchmark” CPHS estimates to PLFS (implying that PLFS numbers are true estimates which other surveys must be able to reproduce). Rather we aim to improve our understanding of CPHS data by comparing it to a more familiar data source, and in the process also to increase our confidence in estimated labour income levels by placing two independent sources side by side. Our exercise is also likely to be of interest to policy-makers and researchers in other developing countries since it reveals the extent of agreement or disagreement between independent household surveys in a developing country context. We employ two distinct approaches to calculate labour incomes in CPHS. First, we combine employment and income data, and calculate labour incomes only for those individuals who report being employed. While this is the most straightforward approach, it suffers from some problems. One problem is that the definition of employment in CPHS is different from that in PLFS. The PLFS follows the standard NSO approach and considers any individual who engages in an income-generating activity for at least one hour of the past week as employed (Current Weekly Status). CPHS does not have a time criterion and instead only asks if the person was employed on the day of the survey or the day prior, or failing both, whether they expected to return to work in the near future. While definitional differences are to be expected across surveys, a more significant problem is that employment and income data are collected independently in CPHS, without reference to one another. This is unlike the NSO approach where income questions are fielded only to those who report being employed. Lastly, the structure of the CPHS data forces us to combine same-month recall data for employment with 4-month recall for income, in order to obtain both for the same month. As we discuss below, these factors make the CPHS income data potentially noisier when combined with employment information. For example, 15 percent of employed individuals report zero incomes, while 7 percent of individuals with positive incomes are not employed. To circumvent this problem, our second approach uses only the CPHS income module to identify employed workers in the survey. That is, an individual is considered employed if they report earning a non-zero labour income. We provide estimates for three different definitions—a person is considered employed (and thus part of the estimate) if they report earning an income for at least six months, at least four months or at least one month of the preceding year. This method is simpler to execute and allows the user to make full use of the income data (all 12 months as opposed to only 3 months for which employment data are available). But it suffers from two limitations. First, it is not a conventional way to define employment. Second, these data cannot be used for any purpose that also requires information  on the type of employment or occupation. Our main findings are as follows. At the all-India level, mean labour income in 2018–19 as per the PLFS was INR 11,233 per month.Footnote 1 Using the employment-income linked approach, the CPHS estimate for 2018–19 stood at INR 14,531 with zero incomes included and at INR 17,354 without zero incomes. That is, monthly labour income as per CPHS was 29 percent higher than that reported in PLFS (55% if we drop zero incomes). Under the six months income approach, the estimates come closer, with monthly labour income being estimated at INR 13,547 for CPHS, i.e. 19 percent higher than the PLFS estimate. In the employment-linked approach, income inequality is higher in CPHS, as expected, if zero income values are included. The Gini is 0.52 in CPHS as compared to 0.44 in PLFS. If we exclude zero incomes, the Ginis come very close to one another (0.42 in CPHS, 0.44 in PLFS), but the means move further apart since the bottom decile in CPHS, which was zero, is now higher than the PLFS bottom decile. To circumvent the problem of zero incomes in CPHS, we also measure the p90/p50 ratio. This ratio is 3.1 for CPHS with zero incomes, 2.9 without them, and 2.7 for PLFS at the all-India level. By the six-month income approach, the story is flipped with the Gini falling to 0.37 in CPHS (and 0.44 as before in PLFS). The p90/p50 ratio is 2.5 as per CPHS, by this approach. Across different methods and assumptions, as well as rural/urban locations, CPHS mean monthly labour earnings are anywhere between 5 percent (income definition for urban workers) and 50 percent (employment-linked approach, excluding zero incomes at all-India level) higher than corresponding PLFS estimates. The results presented here are consistent with the concern that CPHS misses poorer households compared to NSO surveys. But it is also possible that the differences arise from the way employment and income are captured differently in the two surveys. Or both may be the case. The current study cannot distinguish between these possibilities. It is also worth noting that even though the estimates from the two surveys diverge significantly in proportionate terms, certain stylised facts regarding absolute levels of labour incomes in India are supported by both surveys. The 95th percentile in both PLFS and CPHS is less than INR 50,000 a month. That is, an individual earning INR 50,000 per month lies in the top 5 percent of the income distribution in India. Second, both PLFS and CPHS show that the median worker earns around INR 10,000 a month or less. Recall that the Expert Committee on Determining the Methodology for fixing the National Minimum Wage (Ministry of Labour and Employment 2019) proposed INR 375 per day (INR 9,375 per month) for rural areas and INR 430 per day (INR 10,750 per month) for urban areas as the minimum wage. Thus, half of the Indian workforce earns below the recommended National Minimum Wage, as per both surveys. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 briefly describes the two data sources. Section 3 presents results from an approach that matches employment and income data within CPHS. Section 4 presents results for an alternative approach that uses only income data. Section 5 concludes.",

For persons aged 15 and above, male and female labour force participation rate (LFPR) (ps + ss) were reported to be 75.53% and 24.53% respectively in 2019. Between 2012 and 2019, workforce participation rate (WPR) has fallen by 2.2 percentage points for men, while it went down by 4.3 percentage points for women. Women form half the population, but constitute less than one-third of the total workforce. The education levels among females have risen; as seen in the gross enrolment ratio (GER) in higher education, which has increased from 17.9% in 2010–11 to 25.4% in 2017–18 (AISHE 2018). Along with this, there has been a fall in total fertility rates. It has gone down from 2.4 to 2.2 between 2011 and 2018 in the country. For graduates and above it was 1.7 in 2018 (SRS Statistical Report 2018). This rise in enrolment in education and reduction in fertility levels in the period of decent economic growth has, however, not translated into a rise in labour force participation (LFP)  among women in India. Females in urban areas are more educated compared to rural areas in India, but in terms of LFP the statistics are reversed. In 2019, 26.42% of females in rural areas were in the labour force against 20.4% in urban areas. World Development IndicatorsFootnote 1 show that India’s female LFPR (women who are employed or looking for work) at 20.8% (2020) is lower than that of its neighbouring countries namely Bhutan (59.5), Nepal (81.5), Sri Lanka (33.6), and Bangladesh (36.4). The growth in female employment level is important as it improves women’s agency and increases empowerment. It provides intergenerational benefits in terms of health, education and nutrition. For the nation as a whole, it aids in reducing poverty. Calculations by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 2015 present that raising female participation in the paid labour in India can raise the growth rate by 2 percentage points (Mehrotra 2019). Adding more females to the workforce enables the country to tap its demographic dividend adequately, if sufficient employment opportunities are provided. This issue of low female employment has been identified by policy makers and the Strategy for New India@75 (2018) has set out the goal of raising female LFP to 30% by 2022–23. Reducing inequality in the labour market by gender is a target in the SDG India Index 3.0 as well. In light of these dwindling figures of female employment, this paper attempts to investigate the determinants of female LFP in rural and urban India.

Imran Khan,Pallavi Wats,Jannet Jacob Farida,Unknown,Female,Female,Female,"Education has a very important role in economic and social development, and it is used as a tool for reducing poverty. An individual would prefer to attend school only if the present value of the expected benefits from schooling exceeds that of the expected costs (Becker 1964). The estimates of the rate of return to education would be a useful indicator of the reward for education in the labour market and also guide public and private investment in education. Hence, the study has an important policy implication as it throws light on the importance of education in changing the labour market outcomes in developing countries, in general, and India, in particular. The return to investment in education has been widely examined in developed, as well as developing economies (Psacharopoulos 1994; Psacharopoulos et al. 2010). In India too, returns to education is well documented, with education as a significant factor affecting the wage earnings of the workers (Agrawal 2012; Azam 2012; Duraisamy 2002; Dutta 2006; Fulford 2014; Kingdon & Theopold 2008; Madheswaran & Attewell 2007). Despite the extensive literature on returns to education, little is known about the returns to self-employed workers which constitute half of India’s workforce. The Government of India has, after over two decades of deliberation, brought about the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, which seeks to revitalize the whole education system, from primary to tertiary education sectors. Among the many reforms, it mandates in school and university education, the new NEP 2020 envisages to reinforce vocational education and training (VET) at school and higher educational levels, thereby integrating it to mainstream education system. This is expected to reap the full potential of demographic dividend of the country and to realize the Sustainable Development Goal 4.4 (Government of India 2020). This policy emphasis may be empirically based on the significant higher returns for VET than general education in the labour market (Agrawal & Agrawal 2019; Ahmed & Chattopadhyay 2016). However, it is not yet sure whether VET earns higher returns for different categories of workers. Empirical investigation has so far analysed the returns to general, technical and VET for workers, which include wage/salaried workers and casual labourers (Agrawal & Agrawal 2019; Ahmed & Chattopadhyay 2016), but not for self-employed workers.Footnote 1 This study takes the existing literature one notch further by computing the returns to education for self-employed workers, and also ascertaining the returns to VET for self-employed workers across gender. In addition to that, we are also reporting the returns to general and vocational education of wage workers to understand the returns to self-employed workers in a comparative perspective. For this analysis, we exploit five rounds of National Sample Survey (NSS) data, 1993–94, 1999–2000, 2004–05, 2011–12 and 2017–18, to explore the evolution of returns to education for wage and self-employed workers, separately, in India. In particular, we assess the returns to formal and informal vocational education for all the categories of workers. Women’s educational backwardness in India is well known. Kingdon (1998) shows that women’s returns to education are significantly lower than men, suggesting that they have less economic incentives to invest in women’s education than men. The estimates of variation in returns by gender and regions at a point in time and over a period of time would help in understanding the nature and functioning of labour markets and guide region specific educational investment policies. We estimate Mincerian wage earnings equations to estimate returns to education. The selection issue is addressed using multinomial Logit model based on multiple correction terms developed by Dubin and McFadden (1984) and modified by Bourguignon et al. (2007). It is a two-stage procedure—the first step being multinomial Logit estimation of the employment selection and the second being a model of wage earnings. We find that general education seems to be more rewarding for male and female regular salaried workers than casual wage workers. There is a positive and incremental positive return with levels of general education accruing on self-employed workers, both male and female, albeit with huge gender wage gap. Higher levels of education are rewarding for women across all employment choices, yet their labour force participation has declined for over a decade now. The paper is structured as follows. Section two briefly discusses the literature on returns to education. Section three presents the status of employment in India. Section four describes the data and the empirical framework. Section five reports the empirical results and discussion. The final section concludes.",

ILO’s concept of work expanded radically through its ground-breaking resolution in 2013 on Statistics of Work, Employment and Labour Underutilization. The main reasons for passing the Resolution in the 19th ICLS were: (1) that the concept of employment was “too broad a concept”, as it covered, over and above-paid work, a wide range of non-market production including production of goods produced at home for self-consumption; (2) the concept of unemployment was viewed as inadequate, as it did not provide information on characteristics of unemployment, such as the time for which the person was underemployed and the time for which the person wants additional work in the labour market, i.e. labour underutilisation; and (3) there was a need to expand the concept of work to include “all forms of work”. ILO has presented three new conceptual frameworks in the Resolution, namely new definition of work and new forms of work, new labour force status classification, and measures of labour underutilisation. This paper deals with the first concept, namely definition of work and workers in India.
 ILO redefined work as “any activity performed by persons of any sex and age to produce goods or to provide services for use by others or for own use.” This definition recognises all production activities, legal and illegal, formal and informal as work, and is consistent with the concept of General Production Boundary under the Systems of National Accounts (SNA). This definition excludes those activities that do not satisfy the third person criterion (non-delegable activities) and activities that do not produce goods or services, such as begging and theft.",

In the meantime, very soon after one of the world’s most stringent lockdowns was announced suddenly by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 26 March 2020, a slew of labour law relaxations (outside of the proposed codes) were announced by several states, even as a very large migrant worker crisis unfolded in the form of millions of migrant workers fleeing their workplaces to trudge home to their villages, often hundreds of kilometres away. It had become apparent that there was great urgency to implement labour deregulation in the midst of the large-scale work and livelihood crisis that the pandemic unleashed. Most recently, it has been announced in government proclamations that the codes will take effect from October 2021, inaugurating a new and supposedly less complicated phase in labour regulation in India. Labour regulation debates in India have been besieged with the juxtaposition of various aspects of reality in labour markets that, it has been argued, make the applicability of labour regulations, as they existed, limited and hence warrant major changes. For one, it has been pointed out that the presence of the large informal sector and the inapplicability of labour regulations to enterprises and workers in the informal sector lays to naught the basic principles of labour regulation that are predicated around a certain kind of employment relationship (NCEUS 2008).Footnote 2 Second, it is argued that labour reforms are essential for efficiency and enhancement of employment, and that regulations that have been in force in India inhibit employment (Ahsan et al. 2008; Ahsan & Pages 2009; Fallon & Lucas 1993). Third, it is argued that despite the existence of stringent labour regulations, they have been ineffective as employers have found ways to circumvent them. In other words, by this argument, employment has not really been inhibited by labour regulations, but this has exacerbated the informalisation process in India. Fourth, the maze of regulations has been considered inimical to labour and to employment, and hence simplification and standardisation is recommended and promoted (Ahsan et al. 2008). The changes that have occurred in the labour regulation framework through recommendations of the Second National Commission on Labour and the passing of the Labour Codes have aggravated apprehensions about the ability of regulation to protect labour, even as they supposedly address the various concerns outlined above.Footnote 3 Apart from these major national level changes in regulatory framework, various states in India have enacted laws over time that deregulate the labour market and employment conditions, including during the pandemic. How does the world of labour deregulation interact with the ways in which work and employment are structured and changes that have occurred in an industrial organisational sense in India? Can labour regulations, as they have unfolded in recent times, protect labour in the context of a multiplicity of organisational changes that have occurred in recent years? What is the political economy of labour protection in the present context in India? It is opportune to take stock, along with the key arguments that have animated labour regulation and deregulation debates (leading to the recent developments), the changes that have come to characterise the world of work in terms of industrial organisation (the extent and kinds of outsourcing arrangements between enterprises and companies, the profiferation of the service economy), employment arrangements (short-term, irregular, contract and various other kinds) and spatiality (work from home, gig work, digital work). Do the changes in labour regulations reflect these changes and what are the implications? How can we look at the larger political economy of the trajectory of labour regulations in India from an economic and industrial organisation viewpoint and from labour studies perspective?
 This paper looks at the challenges to labour regulation that are posed by various features of labour and employment in India, the structural and organisational characteristics of production (of goods and services) that challenge traditional employment relationships, and to what extent the changes in labour regulation respond to the structure and the changes in it. The paper is divided into the following sections: Section I provides a broad overview of the framework for labour regulation in India and the changes that have been proposed with the labour codes. Section II points to some analytical aspects of the relationship between industrial organisation and work organisation that are important for the purpose of regulation in the world of work in India and looks at the implications of labour regulation changes in the light of the organisational aspects.

This decrease in women’s presence in the labour market leads to an increase in unpaid activities (Unni & Raveendran 2007). In response, scholars have attempted to measure the amount of time that women spend on household tasks (Hirway 2015). The household is considered a social unit comprising people who are closely related and dependent on each other due to their vulnerabilities (Talmon-Garber 1962). The distribution of work within a household is determined by the division of labour in the family unit. However, the time spent by women on unpaid domestic duties is influenced by their kinship ties within the family. This kinship role results in an unequal distribution of the time spent on unpaid and non-market activities, which are influenced by social, patriarchal, and cultural practices (Srinivas 1977). The unequal time spent in unpaid activities restricts women from participating in the labour market, which has profound effects on their economic and social status (Kandiyoti 1988). Women’s reduced participation in the labour market leads to economic deprivation, lack of independence, and marginalisation. Additionally, the gender gap in labour force participation reinforces patriarchal norms and perpetuates gender inequality in India. The traditional patriarchal system in India requires women to reside with their husbands and in-laws (i.e., relatives by marriage) after getting married. Within this system, the daughter-in-law is expected to shoulder all domestic responsibilities (Anukriti & Dasgupta 2017). Nevertheless, the household has a closely knit relationship between the mother-in-law (head’s wife) and daughter-in-law. The mother-in-law is responsible for assigning the household duties and regulating the time spent by daughter-in-law on domestic chores (Anukriti et al. 2020). Generally, in an Indian household, a daughter-in-law performs household chores, while the male members of the family go out to earn a livelihood (Khanna & Pandey 2020). The role of the daughter-in-law is not limited to household chores; she also needs to indulge in animal husbandry, fetch water,  collect firewood, and community gatherings, etc. In most of the households, the daughter-in-law doesn’t have any choice, power, or authority to decide whether or not to perform unpaid duties (Eswaran et al. 2013). The burden of excessive unpaid domestic duties has been shown to significantly constrain women’s agency and sense of identity (Anderson & Baland 2002). In order to question the patriarchy, it is necessary to stop the oppression of women regarding time spent in unpaid activities within the family structure (kinship) (Gupta & Negi 2021). The unmarried daughter is in an advantageous position in the family, whereas the daughter-in-law, under the shade of patriarchy, is forced to indulge in multiple household activities (Agha 2021). The daughter-in-law also works under the subordination of the mother-in-law or any other senior woman in the household, which adds to her responsibilities (Troll 1971; Allendorf 2017). The daughter-in-law gets treated as an external member and is forced to engage in additional unpaid domestic chores, which leads to passive exclusion. In addition to the household chores, the daughter-in-law also needs to indulge in caregiving activities. Caring is an emotional form of labour, which involves building and developing of a particular form of relationship with the household (James 1989; Adams et al. 1996). Furthermore, unpaid work is not limited to providing services only to the household member and community (Anderson & Baland 2002). It is responsible for the social fabric, sense of community, civic responsibility, and norms that help in maintaining trust, goodwill, and social order (Himmelweit 1995). However, despite its essential role, unpaid work is not recognised as productive work by both the National Accounts Statistics (NAS) and the capitalist society. As a signatory member of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2015, India is committed to achieving gender equality and empowering women and girls. SDG 5.4.1 aims to reduce the proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work by 2030 (UN 2016). This goal is crucial because unpaid work limits women’s agency and unique sense of identity, leading to gender inequalities and hampering women’s full participation in the economy and society (Anderson & Baland 2002). Therefore, addressing unpaid work is not just a matter of gender equity but is also imperative for sustainable development (Alonso et al. 2019). As India works toward achieving the UN SDGs by 2030, reducing and redistributing unpaid work must be a critical policy intervention to empower women and girls, increase their agency and unique sense of identity, and support their full participation in society and the economy.
 Since 1960, the visibility and pattern of time spent on unpaid activities by gender and division of labour have been a vital issue of discussion (Himmelweit 1995). However, the discrimination and time spent within the gender have not been adequately highlighted. Consequently, the burden of the kinship role has become an inevitable social and economic challenge for daughters-in-law. Hence, this study aims to present the overall distribution of unpaid activities. Further, this study contributes to the existing literature by providing empirical insights on time spent by daughter and daughter-in-law in unpaid domestic activities. Moreover, this study estimates the socioeconomic determinants responsible for the different unpaid activities associated with their kinship role. The study comprises five main sections. The first section serves as an introduction to the research problem, while the second section provides an overview of the data source, concept, and methodology employed in the study. In the third section, the study presents the estimated time (in minutes) spent by daughters and daughter-in-law in various unpaid activities, aiming to understand their time allocation patterns. Additionally, this section delves into the socioeconomic factors that influence the time spent by daughters and daughter-inlaw, assessing the determinants that impact women's time use. The fourth section synthesizes the findings and policy messages derived from the study, offering a comprehensive conclusion. Finally, the fifth section highlights the limitations of the data used in the study.",
