(2010), Wüthrich and Merz (2013), Pelsser and Stadje (2014), Happ et al. (2015) and Dhaene et al. (2017). But given that a perfect approach to hedging does not always exist, this assumption needs to be examined more carefully. Indeed, this assumption postulates that liquidly traded assets and payoffs replicable by them do not carry any risk as they can be converted to cash at any time. In this paper, we show that this assumption necessitates the hedging strategy to be perfect, i.e., the market pricing rule is cone linear over the cone of fully hedged portfolios. However, the possibility of a perfect hedging can be challenged in practice along many dimensions. For instance, nonzero ask–bid spreads, costly dynamic hedging or model risk are among the reasons that hedging strategies do not need to be perfect. We will discuss these particular reasons using a few examples in Sect. 2.3. This paper considers a financial market where hedging is not necessarily perfect. In the first part, we argue that with an imperfect hedging strategy, we have to distinguish between two different (type I and II) market consistencies. Market consistency of type I only asserts that the valuation of a fully hedged position is the same as its market price, whereas market consistency of type II assumes further that hedging with hedgeable strategies cannot improve the valuation of the risky positions. The existing literature uses the type II market consistency as the usual definition. We characterize market consistent evaluators of either type and prove that a market consistent valuation of type II is well defined only in perfect markets. In the second part of the paper, we observe that market consistent valuations are strongly related to hedging. Interestingly, this connection will help us characterize market consistent valuation by introducing a best estimator. We show that if some market principle conditions hold (e.g., compatibilityFootnote 1), the type I and II market consistent evaluators are best estimators. In addition, we demonstrate how the best estimator characterization of market consistent evaluators can facilitate obtaining a two-step representation. Finally, we introduce and discuss practical ways for constructing market consistent evaluators. First, we introduce a family of two-step market consistent evaluators. Second, inspired by super-hedging pricing methods, we introduce the family of super-evaluators. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the notation, provides some preliminary definitions and states the main problem. Section 3 discusses the concepts and studies the properties of market consistent evaluators. Section 4 develops a general framework for hedging in an imperfect market and shows its relation to the market consistencies of either type. In Sect. 5, we provide several examples of market consistent valuations. Section 6 concludes.",7

In many models that have been proposed, the tails are of power law type. Consequently, not all moments of the asset price are finite Existence of the moments has been thoroughly investigated for classical models; in particular, we mention here Keller-Ressel’s work (Keller-Ressel 2011) on affine stochastic volatility models. Precise information on the critical moments—the exponents where the stock price ceases to be integrable, depending on maturity—is of interest for several reasons It allows to approximate the wing behavior of the volatility smile, to assess the convergence rate of some numerical procedures and to identify models that would assign infinite prices to certain financial products. We refer to Andersen and Piterbarg (2007), Keller-Ressel (2011) and the article Moment Explosions in Cont (2014) for further details and references on these motivations. Moreover, when using the Fourier representation to price options, choosing a good integration path (equivalently, a good damping parameter) to avoid highly oscillatory integrands requires knowing the strip of analyticity of the characteristic function. Its boundaries are described by the critical moments (Lee 2004b; Lord and Kahl 2007). See Sect. 10 for some details. In recent years, attention has shifted in financial modeling from the classical (jump-)diffusion and Lévy models to rough volatility models. Since the pioneering work by Gatheral et al. (2018), the literature on these non-Markovian stochastic volatility models, inspired by fractional Brownian motion, has grown rapidly. We refer to Alòs et al. (2007), Comte et al. (2012), Comte and Renault (1998) and Fukasawa (2011) for earlier work on fractional volatility modeling, and, for example, to Bayer et al. (2017) for many further references. In the present paper, we provide some results on the explosion time and the critical moments of the rough Heston model. While there are several “rough” variants of the Heston model, we work with the one proposed by El Euch and Rosenbaum (2018, 2019). The dynamics of this model are given by where W and Z are correlated Brownian motions, \(\rho \in (-1,1)\) and \(\lambda \), \(\xi \), \(\bar{v}\) are positive parameters. The smoothness parameter \(\alpha \) is in \((\tfrac{1}{2},1)\). (For \(\alpha =1\), the model clearly reduces to the classical Heston model.) W.l.o.g. we assume zero interest rate. Besides having a microstructural foundation, this model features a characteristic function that can be evaluated numerically in an efficient way, by solving a fractional Riccati equation (equivalently, a nonlinear Volterra integral equation; see Sect. 2). Its tractability makes the rough Heston model attractive for practical implementation and at the same time facilitates our analysis. We first analyze the explosion time, i.e., the maturity at which a fixed moment explodes. While the explosion time of the classical Heston model has an explicit formula, for rough Heston we arrive at a well-known hard problem: computing the explosion time of the solution of a nonlinear Volterra integral equation (VIE) of the second kind. There is no general algorithm known, and in most cases that have been studied in the literature, only bounds are available. See Roberts (1998) for an overview. Using the specific structure of our case, we show that the explosion time is finite if and only if it is finite for the classical Heston model, and we provide a lower and an upper bound (Sects. 3–5). As a by-product, the validity of the fractional Riccati equation, respectively, the VIE, for all moments (including complex exponents) is established in Sect. 6. In Sect. 7, we derive an algorithm to compute the explosion time, under some restrictions on the parameters. The critical moments are finite for all maturities (Sect. 8) and can be computed by numerical root finding (Sect. 9). Our approach has two limitations: First, to compute the critical moments, maturity must not be too high. Second, our algorithm can compute the upper critical moment only for \(\rho >0\) and the lower critical moment for \(\rho <0\). As the latter is the more important case in practice, we focus on the left wing of implied volatility when recalling the relation between critical moments and strike asymptotics (Lee’s moment formula; see Sect. 11). Corollary 3.1 in El Euch and Rosenbaum (2018) is related to our results. For each maturity, it gives explicit lower and upper bounds for the critical moments. Inverting them yields a lower bound for the explosion time; the latter is not comparable to our bounds. Further bounds are contained in the recent preprint (Keller-Ressel and Majid 2019).",13

Oosterlee,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The market provides option prices for a discrete set of strikes and maturities. In order to price over-the-counter vanilla options with different strikes, or to hedge more complex derivatives with vanilla options, it is useful to have a continuous arbitrage-free representation of the option prices, or equivalently of their implied volatilities. For example, the variance swap replication of Carr and Madan consists in integrating a specific function over a continuum of vanilla put and call option prices (Carr et al 1998; Carr and Lee 2008). An arbitrage-free representation is also particularly important for the Dupire local volatility model (Dupire 1994), where arbitrages will translate to a negative implied variance. A rudimentary, but popular representation is to interpolate market implied volatilities with a cubic spline across option strikes. Unfortunately, it may not be arbitrage-free as it does not preserve the convexity of option prices in general. Kahalé (2004) designs an arbitrage-free interpolation of the call prices. It, however, presents the following drawbacks: It requires convex input quotes and employs two embedded nonlinear minimizations, and it is not proven that the algorithm for the interpolation function of class \(C^2\) converges. In reality, it is often not desirable to strictly interpolate option prices as those fluctuate within a bid–ask spread. Interpolation will lead to a very noisy estimate of the probability density (which corresponds to the second derivative of the undiscounted call option price). More recently, Andreasen and Huge (2011) have proposed to calibrate the discrete piecewise constant local volatility of the single-step finite difference representation for the forward Dupire equation. In their representation, the authors use as many constants as the number of market option strikes for an optimal fit. It works well but often yields a noisy probability density estimate, as the prices are overfitted. An alternative is to rely on a richer underlying stochastic model, which allows for some flexibility in the implied volatility smile, such as the Heston or SABR stochastic volatility models. While semi-analytic representations of the call option price exist for the Heston model (Heston 1993), the model itself does not allow to represent short-maturity smiles accurately. The SABR model is better suited for this, but has only closed-form approximations for the call option price, which can lead to arbitrage (Hagan et al. 2002, 2014). 
Grzelak and Oosterlee (2017) use stochastic collocation to fix the Hagan SABR approximation formula defects and produce arbitrage-free option prices starting from the Hagan SABR formula. Here, we will explore how to calibrate the stochastic collocation polynomial directly to market prices, without going through an intermediate model. This is of particular interest to the richer collocated local volatility (CLV) model, which allows to price exotic options through Monte Carlo or finite difference methods (Grzelak 2016). A collocation polynomial calibrated to the vanilla options market is key for the application of this model in practice. Another application of our model-free stochastic collocation is to price constant maturity swaps (CMS) consistently with the swaption implied volatility smile. In the standard approximation of Hagan (2003), the CMS convexity adjustment consists in evaluating the second moment of the distribution of the forward swap rate. It can be computed in closed form with the stochastic collocation. This allows for an efficient method to calibrate the collocation method jointly to the swaptions market implied volatilities and to the CMS spread prices. The outline of the paper is as follows: Section 2 presents the stochastic collocation technique in detail. Section 3 explains how to calibrate the stochastic collocation directly to market prices and how to ensure the arbitrage-free calibration transparently, through a specific parameterization of the collocation polynomial. Section 4 reviews some popular option implied volatilities interpolation methods and illustrates the various issues that may arise with those on a practical example. Section 5 applies the direct collocation technique on two different examples of equity index option prices. Section 6 introduces the joint calibration of CMS convexity adjustments and swaption prices in general. Section 7 applies the model-free stochastic collocation on the joint calibration of CMS and swaption prices. Finally, Sect. 8 explores some limitations of the stochastic collocation technique along with possible remedies.",3

One reason is related to the management of museums resources, generally scarse, which have to be optimized by taking into account the cultural objectives to be pursued. Another reason is related to fundraising; the survival of a cultural organization is often guaranteed by the presence of both private and public funding and this calls for transparency and evidence of an efficient use of the resources. The present contribution aims at measuring the museum performance by proposing a model that combines the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Balanced Scorecard (BSC) methodologies with a third methodological tool which is often used to support the decision-making process, namely the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Recently, the advantages of integrating DEA with BSC for the evaluation of museum performance have been explored by Basso et al. (2018) with the proposal of a DEA–BSC model which employs a two-stage evaluation process. Starting from such a model, in the present paper we explore the possibility to exploit also the potential of the AHP method in the second stage of the evaluation process, with the aim to include some experts’ judgements on the relative importance of the four BSC perspectives in the model. A first approach is to use directly the weights obtained using the pairwise comparison matrices computed from the judgements of the museums’ experts interviewed (the so-called AHP priorities) in order to aggregate the four BSC performance scores computed at the first stage into an overall performance indicator. This direct approach often presents some difficulties linked to the presence of inconsistency in some judgements and/or to an excessive dispersion of preferences of the different experts. A second approach utilizes the judgments of the museums’ experts indirectly, to impose proper restrictions on the weights of the outputs of a second-stage DEA model. This second approach allows us to overcome the problems arising from the differences in the judgements of the various decision makers, since it can be applied in any case, no matter how big the differences. Both approaches proposed in this contribution are applied to a case study, represented by the set of municipal museums of Venice first analyzed in Basso et al. (2018). The paper is organized as follows. We first summarize the essential features of the BSC and DEA methodologies and their applications to the evaluation of the performance of museums (Sect. 2). In Sect. 3, we briefly present the two-stage DEA–BSC model developed in Basso et al. (2018) to assess the museums performance. Sect. 4 discusses how the AHP methodology can be used to directly compute the weights for aggregating the BSC performance scores of museums, while Sect. 5 reports the results of the application carried out to the municipal museums of Venice. Section 6 proposes the DEA–BSC–AHP three-system model which uses AHP to define the weights restrictions in the second-stage DEA model. Finally, this model is applied to the municipal museums of Venice in Sect. 7.",5

Specifically, the DEA model is based on linear programming to measure the efficiency of the i-th DMU under evaluation relative to the other DMUs of the set. The model was initially proposed under the constant returns to scale assumption of a firm’s production activity by Charnes et al. (1978) and later extended to the variable returns to scale by Banker et al. (1984). The multiple advantages of the DEA make it an important analysis tool for benchmarking in various scientific areas such as operational research, decision analysis, management science, social science, etc. However, the learning procedure through which DMUs are benchmarked against each other implicitly assumes precision in data and ignores the uncertainties and noise inherent in the inputs and outputs. Hence, the traditional models as proposed in Charnes et al. (1978) and Banker et al. (1984) can be practically unsuitable in application. For instance, in many applications, some of the data are only known within specified bounds or in ordered relations while others are described vaguely such that the real values are unknown or uncertain. These uncertainties when neglected can affect the reliability of the efficiency scores and the stability of management decisions. The classical approach to deal with uncertainties in management decisions is the stochastic programming and sensitivity analysis (see Land et al. 1993; Olesen and Petersen 1995; Cooper et al. 1998). To address the issue of imprecision and uncertainty which conceivably have potential feasibility and optimality concerns in DEA, many researchers adopt advanced deterministic models such as imprecise DEA, fuzzy DEA and the robust DEA (RDEA). We refer the reader to Zhu (2003) and Hatami-Marbini et al. (2011) for extensive reviews of these approaches. The RDEA approach was proposed by Sadjadi and Omrani (2008) to deal with uncertainties in input and output data. The approach offers to immunize the uncertain inputs and outputs data of DMUs in a user-defined uncertainty set and provides a probability guarantee for reliable efficiency scores, robust discrimination and ranking of DMUs. The RDEA is based on the robust optimization (RO) technique which was initially introduced by Soyster (1973) and extended by the likes of Ben-Tal and Nemirovski (1998, 1999, 2000) and El Ghaoui et al. (1998). The theory and applications of the RO have been reviewed in Bertsimas et al. (2011) for a wider reading. A good background and review of the RO to DEA have also been provided in Mensah (2019). When applying the RO to DEA, two main techniques are enhanced to characterize the uncertainties in the input and output data: scenario-based and uncertainty set-based techniques. The former is proposed by Mulvey et al. (1995) and researched further by Laguna (1998). Its application to DEA includes the works of Zahedi-Seresht et al. (2017) and Esfandiari et al. (2017). The scenario-based RO, however, has a drawback of changing the structure of the deterministic program. On the other hand, uncertainty set-based techniques have been developed in Ben-Tal and Nemirovski (1998, 1999, 2000), Bertsimas and Sim (2004). The general concept of this approach thrives on formulating an alternative optimization model called the robust counterpart which seeks all or most possible realization of the uncertain parameters in decision-maker-defined uncertainty set. Broadly speaking, a major modeling concern of the RO in this direction is the design of a tractableFootnote 1 robust formulation for the nominal problem that guarantees constraints feasibility with high probability. To deal with model tractability and conservativess of robust solutions, different robust concepts: reliability of the robust solution (Ben-Tal and Nemirovski 2000), price of robustness (Bertsimas and Sim 2004), adjustable robustness (Ben-Tal et al. 2004) and light robustness (Fischetti and Monaci 2009; Mensah and Rocca 2019) among others have been proposed in the past few years. These concepts are largely based on two main sets: the ellipsoidal uncertainty sets of Ben-Tal and Nemirovski (1999, 2000) and a family of polyhedral uncertainty sets otherwise called the budget of uncertainty of Bertsimas and Sim (2004). These sets ensure model tractability and offer the decision maker the ability to control the conservativeness of the robust solution. The main disadvantage of the former, however, is that the nominal linear optimization model is transformed into a nonlinear problem which can be computational demanding. Bertsimas and Sim (2004) model approach preserves the linearity of the nominal problem. As a result, the concept has been applied to different classes of DEA problems. For instance, Shokouhi et al. (2010) proposed a general RDEA model in which inputs and outputs are constrained in an uncertainty set with data uncertainties covering the interval DEA approach. The authors applied the robust approach of Bertsimas and Sim (2004) and Monte Carlo simulation to compute for the range of Gamma values for the conformity of the ranking of the DMUs. Omrani (2013) introduced an RDEA to find the common set of weights (CSW) in DEA with uncertain data under a similar uncertainty set. In a related paper, Salahi et al. (2016) developed an optimistic RO approach for the CSW in DEA. Arabmaldar et al. (2017) proposed a robust super-efficiency DEA model. Toloo and Mensah (2019) studied the computational complexity RDEA models in their reduced form using the concept of the budget of uncertainty. It is noteworthy that, RDEA models with ellipsoidal uncertainty seem to be relatively unexplored. To the best of our knowledge, Sadjadi and Omrani (2008), Lu (2015), Wu et al. (2017), Salahi et al. (2018) and Lu et al. (2019) are the only few researchers who have made advances to RDEA considering uncertainty in an ellipsoid. Most of these studies are, however, limited to output data uncertainty due to the larger concern of considering input data uncertainty in the equality normalization constraint. Uncertainty in the constraints of the DEA models must be strictly satisfied to obtain a feasible solution for the RDEA counterpart. The issue equality constraint in RDEA is well addressed in Toloo and Mensah (2019) and considered in this paper. This paper will focus on the ellipsoidal uncertainty sets introduced in Ben-Tal and Nemirovski (1999, 2000) to identify inefficiencies of DMUs using the risk preference of the decision maker (DM). From the mathematical point of view, the ellipsoidal uncertainty set provides a convenient entity and offers the decision maker the ability to control the conservativeness of the efficiency solution to different data perturbations via the semi-axis of the ellipsoid. These sets are also practically useful for modeling correlation (if they exist) among the inputs (output) data which is relevant to prevent the effect of correlation on the efficiency mean (Farzipoor Sean et al. 2005). To be more specific, we adopt an ellipsoidal uncertainty set to model unbounded distribution of uncertainties while input and output data with bounded random distribution are modeled with an interval-based ellipsoidal uncertainty set. Another contribution of this paper provides a classification scheme based on the proposed models. The scheme allows DMUs to be classified into fully robust efficient, partially robust efficient and robust inefficient. We further extend our robust approach to the non-radial additive model where a newly proposed robust additive model is compared with peer imprecise additive models proposed in Lee et al. (2002) and Matin et al. (2007). The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 will provide the background of the DEA and RDEA models. This is followed by RDEA models developed from the two ellipsoidal uncertainty sets in Sect. 3. A robust classification scheme and a numerical example are also given in this section. Section 4 will extend the RDEA approach to a robust additive DEA model and will compare it to some imprecise DEA models in the literature. The penultimate section illustrates the applicability of the RDEA models with banking studies in Italy. Finally, Sect. 6 will provide conclusions and further research.",5

In the last years, many stealthy and sophisticated cyber attacks targeted public and private sector organizations. The annual cost of cybercrime study conducted by Ponemon InstituteFootnote 1 confirms that, combined with the expanding threat landscape, organizations are noticing a steady rise in the number of security breaches: The average number has moved from 130 in 2017 to 145 in 2018 (+11% last year,+67% last 5 years). The impact of these cyber attacks on organizations, industries and society is relevant, as the total cost of cybercrime for each company has increased from $11.7 million in 2017 to a new high of $13.0 million in 2018 (+12% last year, +72% last 5 years). The 2018 study reports that the global average cost of a data breach is up 6.4% over the previous year to $3.86 million. The average cost for each lost or stolen record containing sensitive and confidential information has also increased by 4.8% year over year to $148. According to the Online Trust Alliance,Footnote 2 the number of cyber attacks worldwide doubled in 2017 to 160,000, although endemic underreporting means that the true figure could be as high as 350,000. Despite the improvements in security countermeasures and practices, the statistics presented above highlight how cyber insurance represents an important tool for risk managers to mitigate the economic impact of cyber attacks. The demand for cyber insurance is expected to experience a huge growth, as people and companies become aware of the economic risk behind cyber attacks. However, the market for cyber insurance is undersized, mainly because insurance and reinsurance companies are still unprepared to offer coverage for such kind of risks. As KPMG highlights in one of its reportFootnote 3 on cyber insurance, insurers still need to improve their modeling capabilities with respect to these specific types of risk. With the availability of new databases, academic research has started offering its contribution to understanding a particular class of cyber risk, namely data breaches. The literature on cyber risk and information security is plenty of papers in the area of information technology, while less work has been proposed in economics, finance and insurance. A comprehensive reference for an overview on the latter is Xu et al. (2018). In the study, the authors discuss a statistical analysis of a breach incident dataset obtained from the Privacy Rights ClearinghouseFootnote 4 and use stochastic processes to fit and predict inter-arrival times and breach sizes. The work includes a detailed review of prior contributions on the topic: Among others, it is worth mentioning Eling and Loperfido (2017) that analyzes the PRC Database with some actuarial insights, and the related studies on data breach statistical evaluations such as Maillart and Sornette (2010); Edwards et al. (2016); Wheatley et al. (2016, 2019, 2020). The PRC Database is also used in Farkas et al. (2019): The authors investigate the heterogeneity of the reported cyber claims using regression trees. The economical value of cyber risk is discussed in Eling and Wirfs (2019) where the authors focus the attention on cyber losses from an operational risk database and analyze the dataset with methods from statistics and actuarial science. As far as cyber insurance is concerned, a review of the available scientific approaches for the analysis of the cyber insurance market is Marotta et al. (2017), where the authors offer insights from both market and scientific perspectives. In this paper, we go a step ahead in the understanding of data breaches by providing a dynamic analysis in which we find a causal relation between the intensity of data stolen and some metrics of the cryptocurrency market. Our original conjecture is as follows: If hackers perform data attacks to make a profit, they must somehow cash the attack. In this case, some cryptocurrencies offer the quickest and most anonymous way to monetize the attack. To test our postulate, we perform, on two distinct datasets of data breaches, a rigorous cointegration analysis between the daily number of stolen data, the daily Bitcoin’s price and the daily number of transactions in Bitcoin. In addition, we run Granger causality tests between the three variables. In both datasets, we find strong empirical evidence of the existence of a causal relationship between the number of data breaches and the Bitcoin-related variables both in the short run and in the long run. To the best of our knowledge, we provide for the first time a set of easily measurable variables that explain data breaches. Thus, our findings offer new insights into the statistical estimation and forecasts of data breaches. This might guide insurers and reinsurers in the process of building new products that offer protection against such kinds of risk. In the remaining of the paper, we proceed as follows: In Sect. 2, we summarize the methodology used. In Sect. 3, we describe the datasets used and present the results of the cointegration analysis and Granger causality tests. To quantify the impact of Bitcoin-related variables on data breaches, we perform an impulse response analysis and a variance decomposition of the forecasting errors. In Sect. 4, we conclude highlighting our results and suggesting new directions of research.",1

Most Asian options that trade on exchanges are options on the arithmetic average of the futures price and not on the spot price. Turnbull and Wakeman originally developed their formula for Asian options on the spot price, that is, for an underlying with a cost-of-carry different than zero. Yet, it costs nothing to carry a futures contract. One has to put up margin for futures, but one typically receives an interest rate on the margin money, and several exchanges even allow one to put Treasury bills up as margin collateral. Thus, at least in theory, the cost-of-carry for a futures contract is zero. The Turnbull–Wakeman formula can be extended to hold for options on futures (with zero cost-of-carry); we first showed this work in an unpublished working paper in 2006. In 2017, the European Energy Exchange announced that they had switched from using the Black-76 formula (Black 1976) for settling freight futures options to the Turnbull–Wakeman formula as modified by Haug in 2006 (see The European Energy Exchange 2017). From 2018 on, the European Energy Exchange has been settling both freight futures options and iron ore options based on our modified Turnbull–Wakeman formula. In their own words, “The calculation of prices for options on freight and iron ore futures is based on the mathematical equation of the Turnbull and Wakeman formula extended by Espen Gaarder Haug” The European Energy Exchange (2018).",2

In this setting, an investor optimally allocates wealth across risky assets caring only about the mean and the variance of portfolio returns. Although theoretically sound, the mean–variance framework has not reached widespread consensus in the finance industry. Among the causes of what Michaud (1989) defines “the Markowitz optimization enigma”, he identifies the fact that mean–variance portfolios ignore factors, such as liquidity, that are important for investment decisions. The relevance of liquidity in the asset allocation problem is widely recognized in the financial economics literature. For instance, Canner et al. (1997) show that portfolios recommended by four popular financial advisors are not on the mean–variance efficient frontier and consider assets marketability among the possible explanatory factors. Similarly, Ghysels and Pereira (2008), Hodrick and Moulton (2009) and Bazgour et al. (2016) find that fund managers are sensitive to liquidity while achieving their targets in the portfolio allocation decision. Despite these empirical evidences, few efforts have been devoted to understanding how investors can manage liquidity within the mean–variance framework. Since the last financial crisis, both regulators and investors have expressed concerns about the worsening conditions of liquidity in the markets. First, the regulatory restructuring related to the traditional activities of banks and financial intermediaries tightened capital requirements, reducing their ability to supply liquidity. Funding constraints and higher margins can force liquidity suppliers to liquidate their positions in case of redemption pressures, thus raising market illiquidity (Gromb and Vayanos 2002; Chiu et al. 2012). Second, the growth of the ETF industry is raising concerns for a possible liquidity crisis.Footnote 1 In case of investor redemption, passive (index-tracking) funds following similar strategies can induce coordinated liquidations of securities (Scharfstein and Stein 1990), depressing market prices and thus leading to “liquidity spirals” (Brunnermeier and Pedersen 2008; Hameed et al. 2010). These premises warrant the development of a methodological framework to manage portfolio liquidity. In this paper, we consider an investor who uses the minimum-variance frameworkFootnote 2 to allocate funds across stocks, and pursuits a volatility timing strategy (Fleming et al. 2001, 2003). The portfolio is rebalanced on a daily basis, and the solution of the optimization problem is a sequence of optimal weights that vary exclusively according to changes in the conditional covariances of the assets held in the portfolio. Using this framework, we aim to answer the following questions: how can we include liquidity in the dynamic portfolio optimization problem? How can we measure portfolio liquidity? Can we consistently generate portfolio liquidity gains selecting portfolios that are close to the minimum-variance portfolio? The traditional approach to portfolio construction in the presence of illiquid assets entails the modeling of the transaction costs and the solution of a dynamic portfolio strategy. Some examples are given by Constantinides (1986), Gârleanu (2009) and Gârleanu and Pedersen (2013). A similar route is adopted in the literature on asset pricing with transaction costs (Amihud and Mendelson 1986; Acharya and Pedersen 2005; Vayanos 1998; Vayanos and Vila 1999) and in that on optimal trade execution (Bertsimas and Lo 1998; Almgren and Chriss 2000). Modeling and estimating the transaction costs is a difficult task. Commissions fees, bid–ask spreads, funding costs, price-impact are all relevant components of the transaction costs that may not be directly available to the investor. For this reason, a set of simplifying assumptions are typically imposed on the transaction cost function, and the existence of a closed-form or numerically tractable solution crucially relies on these assumptions. The approach adopted in this paper is deliberately different. Our goal is to include the liquidity dimension in the standard Markowitz framework without explicitly modeling the transaction costs. To be more specific, we look for a synthetic and easy-to-compute measure which reflects the main determinants of portfolio illiquidity. In doing so, we try to conciliate the need for sufficiently liquid portfolios with parsimony and computational efficiency. Bandi et al. (2017) show that asset prices observed at high-frequency update less frequently than what assumed in standard continuous time models of asset pricing. They introduce an economic indicator, named idle time, that estimates the probability of observing a zero return (or a stale price, whence the nomenclature adopted in this manuscript) at a given sampling frequency. Idle time provides information on the extent of liquidity of an asset, and it is related to both transaction costs and absence of volume (Bandi et al. 2020). We extend this notion to a portfolio of assets by defining the concept of portfolio staleness: on a given day, portfolio staleness is computed as the weighted average of assets’ idle times, using the corresponding portfolio weights. This measure has several attractive features: (a) is easy to compute, as idle time solely requires data on transaction prices to be implemented; (b) has a clear economic interpretation, as idle time can be regarded as an illiquidity proxy within a model of price formation with transaction costs and asymmetric information; (c) being idle time a probability, it naturally ranges between zero and one, allowing to easily compare and rank portfolios. Building upon these considerations, our first contribution is to propose a tractable framework where the liquidity dimension is integrated into the portfolio selection problem. This is done by imposing an additional constraint (henceforth referred to as staleness constraint) on the minimum-variance portfolio optimization that limits the degree of portfolio staleness. The intuition behind this approach is straightforward: a portfolio with lower staleness places larger weights on assets with lower idle time. To the extent that idle time proxies illiquidity, the new portfolio is expected to give larger weights to liquid assets than the standard minimum-variance portfolio. On the other side, a very tight upper bound on the level of staleness for the assets included in the allocation will unavoidably result in a less-diversified portfolio. These considerations naturally lead to wonder to what extent such a staleness constrained asset allocation delivers a more liquid portfolio. Several definitions and measures of liquidity are available for individual securities, but the literature offers little guidance toward defining and assessing portfolio liquidity. Here, we adopt the economically motivated measure of portfolio liquidity of Pastor et al. (2017) to evaluate the degree of liquidity of an asset allocation strategy. Pastor et al. (2017) argue that the liquidity of a portfolio should depend not only on the liquidities of the stocks held in the portfolio, but also on the degree of portfolio diversification. The intuition underlying this argument is that a more diversified portfolio can lead to lower trading costs.Footnote 3 Similarly, when the total value of the assets in the portfolio relative to the market capitalization of the assets is large, trading is more expensive. They formalize this intuition in a simple economic setting and derive the following portfolio liquidity measure: where N is the number of assets held in the portfolio, \(\omega _i\) is the portfolio weight of stock i, and \(m_i\) denotes the weight of asset i in a market-cap-weighted benchmark portfolio. Note that \({\mathbb {L}}\) takes values between 0 and 1. It can be shown that the portfolio with lowest \({\mathbb {L}}\) is the one fully invested in the stock with smallest market capitalization, and that the portfolio with largest \({\mathbb {L}}\) is the one coinciding with the benchmark portfolio, for which \({\mathbb {L}}=1\). In addition, Pastor et al. (2017) show that \({\mathbb {L}}\) factorizes into the product of two components: (1) the average of individual liquidities, defined as a function of the stock market capitalization; (2) a measure of the degree of diversification, related to the number of stocks held in the portfolio and to the Herfindahl index of portfolio weights. Our second contribution is to show empirically that an appropriate choice of the staleness constraint leads to significant liquidity gains over the standard minimum-variance portfolio, as quantified by the measure of Pastor et al. (2017). Moreover, we show that gains in portfolio liquidity are much larger than the unavoidable increase in portfolio variance. Noteworthy, the risk profile of the staleness constrained portfolio is found to be very close to that of the minimum-variance portfolio. This result is somewhat consistent with the evidence in Canner et al. (1997) that investors do not choose portfolios on the efficient frontier, but are not too far from it. Finally, our third contribution is to show how the proposed asset allocation strategy can be implemented in practice in an out-of-sample exercise. Given that idle time significantly changes over time, the portfolio staleness constraint must be adapted dynamically to the evolving market conditions. We show that this can be done with a simple rule based on forecasts of portfolio staleness. As before, we find that staleness constrained portfolios are significantly more liquid than minimum-variance portfolios, and that the liquidity-risk tradeoff is definitely in favor of portfolio liquidity. Our paper is closely related to the works of Michaud (1989) and Lo et al. (2003), but it substantially differs in at least three aspects. First, we work in a dynamic setting, as the portfolio is rebalanced on a daily basis; second, we use an economically motivated measure of portfolio liquidity (i.e. portfolio staleness) to assess the degree of liquidity of the constrained portfolio; third, we show how to set the portfolio staleness constraint to obtain out-of-sample liquidity gains. Our paper is also related to the literature on shrinkage of portfolio weights (Jagannathan and Ma 2003; DeMiguel et al. 2009). However, instead of reducing the uncertainty on the estimated covariance matrix, our aim is to shrink portfolio weights towards more liquid assets. As a robustness check, we replicate our analysis using, in place of portfolio staleness, the weighted average of inverse daily trading volume and the weighted average of daily bid–ask spreads. We show that bounds on these illiquidity measures provide liquidity-volatility profiles similar to those obtained through portfolio staleness. However, we discuss why portfolio staleness is more suited within the portfolio optimization framework. The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 introduces the methodology and describes the staleness constrained portfolio; Sect. 3 provides details on the econometric modeling and forecasting of portfolio staleness and realized covariances; Sect. 4 reports the results of the empirical analysis and provides a comparison with common liquidity proxies; Sect. 5 concludes. Supplementary analyses are relegated to “Appendix”.",4

MCDA enables to simultaneously consider the many factors that affect firms’ creditworthiness, in order to directly involve the decision maker (DM) in the credit risk assessment process, and—particularly important—to incorporate her/his preference structure in the evaluation model. Usually, the preferential system of the DM is mainly specified by the parameters of the adopted MCDA. Of course, the quality of the creditworthiness analysis performed by the considered MCDA strongly depends on the “appropriate” determination of its parameters. When this determination is not immediately available by the DM (as in most cases), it can be endogenously inferred by a proper reference set of evaluations/decisions previously taken by the same DM. The methodological approach considered in this occurrence is the so-called preference disaggregation analysis, which is widely used in different application contexts (see Jacquet-Lagrèze and Siskos 2001 for a classical review and see Kadzinski et al. 2020a, b for recent developments). Within this reference framework, in this paper we consider a MCDA methodology known as MUlticriteria RAnking MEthod (MURAME)Footnote 1 to evaluate the creditworthiness of a large sample of Italian Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SME), using as input their balance sheet data. This methodology produces results in terms of scoring and classification into homogeneous rating classes. A distinctive goal of this paper is to consider a preference disaggregation method to endogenously determine some parameters of MURAME, by solving a nonsmooth constrained optimization problem. Because of the complexity of the mathematical programming problem, for its solution we use the evolutionary metaheuristic known as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), coupled with a specific efficient initialization. This is combined with an unconstrained reformulation of the problem, which provides a reasonable compromise between the quality of the solution and the computational burden. The study we present here continues a line of research initially developed in Corazza et al. (2014, 2015b, 2016). Briefly, with reference only to the two papers of main interest for the current study, in Corazza et al. (2015b) a novel evolutionary approach was adopted in order to determine the MURAME parameters. To this aim, an auxiliary mathematical programming problem was solved for tuning MURAME parameters. It was based on minimizing the inconsistency between the creditworthiness evaluations from the MURAME-based methodology and those revealed by a DM. The heuristic procedure PSO was adopted, in order to solve an unconstrained global optimization problem. In particular, PSO was adopted for the minimization of a nondifferentiable penalty function, where standard initializations for PSO were used, inasmuch as the main focus of the paper was on a creditworthiness problem. In Corazza et al. (2016), a general MURAME-based methodology has been applied to evaluate the creditworthiness of about 36,500 Italian SMEs in the period 2006–2008, a triennium including the beginning of the past economic and financial crisis. In that paper, the MURAME-based procedure was not coupled with any optimization procedure, and the assessment of its parameters was exogenously based on standard indications from the literature. The obtained results have shown that the MURAME-based methodology was able to detect early signals of recession in the Italian SMEs sector. Furthermore, numerical results have also confirmed the robustness of this methodology with respect to the number of the evaluation criteria. Despite the findings obtained in Corazza et al. (2015b, 2016), one of the key aspects to improve efficiency of MURAME is represented by a reliable and effective assessment set of its parameters. Even though the approach in Corazza et al. (2015b) partially focuses on an endogenous assessment of MURAME parameters by PSO, it requires to force the reformulation of a constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained one, through the use of penalty terms. This might be a difficult task, since the use of penalty terms can possibly raise numerical instabilities, as better detailed in the sequel. Conversely, the current contribution has three distinctive tasks:  We employ an endogenous computation of some MURAME parameters to score and to classify into homogeneous rating classes the Italian SMEs belonging to the same dataset of firms considered in Corazza et al. (2016). This is an enhancement to what we have done in Corazza et al. (2016), where the scoring and the classification were determined only using an exogenous specification of the MURAME parameters. Notice that the endogenous determination employed in the present work is focused on correctly scoring and classifying bankrupt firms, which are particularly important for any economic/financial institution. (The reasons of this choice will be detailed in Sect. 4.) In turn, this is different from what some of these authors have done in Corazza et al. (2015b), where the MURAME parameters were endogenously determined to minimize the number of all the firms, both active and bankrupt, incorrectly classified; The preference disaggregation method we consider to endogenously determine some parameters of MURAME implies to solve a constrained optimization problem. But the metaheuristic solution we use was conceived for unconstrained problems, and its direct application cannot prevent from generating infeasible solutions. Therefore, in order to manage the constraints of the involved mathematical programming problem, in place of adopting the penalty function approach applied in Corazza et al. (2013, 2015b), we consider a novel nonlinear reformulation of the constrained optimization problem in terms of an unconstrained oneFootnote 2; We use the metaheuristic procedure as in Corazza et al. (2015b), but we endow it with two recently introduced deterministic initializations (see Corazza et al. 2015a; Diez et al. 2016) never used before in this research area. We remark that the initialization procedures adopted here significantly differ from the one in Campana et al. (2010), as better detailed in Subsect. 5.3. Finally, to validate our approach, we compare the results in terms of scoring and of classification, when comparing the above initialization procedures and the standard random initialization in Corazza et al. (2015b) (see Sect. 6). Furthermore, we also carry out a comparison with the results got by applying our MURAME-based creditworthiness model with the exogenous parameterization considered in Corazza et al. (2016) (see again Sect. 6). The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section reports a brief review of the literature, whose main purpose is not to be exhaustive but, rather, to highlight the most relevant contributions on this research area. Sect. 3 presents the MURAME methodology adopted for the creditworthiness evaluation of SMEs. Section 4 first formulates the constrained optimization problem for the endogenous determination of the MURAME parameters, then describes the balance sheet data of the Italian SMEs used in the empirical investigation. Regarding Sect. 5: it first introduces some basics about PSO, then it illustrates the nonlinear reformulation of the constrained optimization problem in terms of an unconstrained one. Next, to compare the PSO solver based on this novel reformulation with the PSO one based on the penalty approach in Corazza et al. (2013, 2015a), Sect. 5 briefly presents the unconstrained reformulation of the mathematical programming problem within a penalty framework. Lastly, the same section details the PSO deterministic initializations we use. Section 6: first presents the results related to the classification of the investigated Italian SMEs into homogeneous rating classes, using the methodology we propose here; then compares these results with those obtained in Corazza et al. (2016) using an exogenous determination of the MURAME parameters. Section 7: first compares the aforementioned results also with those from a PSO solver based on a penalty function approach; then issues some very preliminary ideas to possibly improve the exploitation of the informative content coming from the aforementioned SMEs. Finally, Sect. 8 includes some concluding remarks.",1

On the contrary, he showed that when the monopolistic wage setter combines wage-fixing with employment-fixing by means of an all-or-none offer there may be an efficient redistribution of labour income that improves the welfare of the seller as well as the one of the buyers (cf. Fellner 1947). That was the seminal intuition from which originated the theory of efficient—or cooperative—wage bargaining that in the labour economics literature is usually opposed to the theory of non-cooperative negotiations encapsulated in the right-to-manage and the monopoly union models (cf. Booth 1995). From a theoretical point of view, the achievement of efficiency in the wage negotiation process that involves workers—or trade unions—and productive firms and its labour market implications have been explored in several directions. For instance, McDonald and Solow (1981) argue that the efficiency gains described by Leontief (1946) can be approximately achieved by a bargaining process that involves wages and the capital–labour ratio (cf. Johnson 1990). Moreover, Espinoza and Rhee (1989) as well as Strand (1989) derive the conditions under which efficient outcomes emerge from the repeated bargaining between a labour union and a firm carried out by means of alternate wage proposals from the two parties. Petrakis and Vlassis (2000) show that when the bargaining power of the union is sufficiently low, the firm can find profitable to commit itself to a given employment level because this would allow it to become a Stackelberg leader in the output market by creating the incentives to achieve Pareto-optimal solutions. More recently, Dobbelaere and Luttens (2016) show that in a model economy with concave production and risk-neutral agents where bargaining proceeds as a finite sequence of sessions between a firm and a union of variable size, the resulting equilibrium is equivalent to the efficient bargaining outcome (cf. Stole and Zwiebel 1996). In this paper, drawing on ideas originally sketched by Guerrazzi (2011) in a companion work, I aim at further contributing to the theoretical literature on cooperative wage negotiations by deriving and solving a dynamic version of the efficient bargaining model grounded on the Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle. Specifically, following a normative perspective, I develop an inter-temporal optimizing framework with continuous time in which an omniscient and infinitely lived mediator—or an arbitrator—is assumed to set the real wage by maximizing a weighted average between the profit of a risk-neutral firm and the sum of the utilities of a group of risk-averse unionized workers by taking into account that the stock of employed workers tends to adjust smoothly in the direction of the upward-sloping contract curve implied by the objective functions of the two bargaining parties (cf. Raiffa 1953; Muthoo 1999, Section 10.3). To the best of my knowledge, completing the analysis set forth by Guerrazzi (2011), the present contribution is the first attempt to frame the efficient bargaining model in an optimal control setting in which time is assumed to evolve without discontinuities as it usually happens in differential games of bargaining (cf. Ambrus et al. 2015; Castaner et al. 2018). The results of this theoretical exploration reveal that the typical findings retrieved in a companion right-to-manage framework in which employment is assumed to adjust itself in the direction of the downward-sloping labour demand schedule of the firm are completely overturned. In detail, I demonstrate that increases in the bargaining power of the firm push the equilibrium outcomes of the dynamic negotiation process in the direction of the allocation in which the wage equals the marginal productivity of employed labour by accelerating the speed of convergence towards the stationary solution of the model (cf. Lockwood and Manning 1989; Guerrazzi 2011). Furthermore, since the mediator of the bargaining process is assumed to consider the effects of its wage-setting behaviour on employment dynamics, I show that the inter-temporal negotiation of wages tends to penalize unionized workers and favour the firm with respect to the bargaining outcomes of a similar wage-setting framework in which the time dimension is omitted (cf. de la Croix et al. 1996). The paper is arranged as follows. Section 2 sets out the model and derives its analytical solution. Section 3 explores its numerical properties. Section 4 compares the outcomes of the dynamic efficient bargaining model with the ones of a similar timeless framework. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes by providing suggestions for further developments.",2

A preference profile is a list of individual preferences, one for each committee member. A social preference correspondence (spc) is a procedure which associates with any preference profiles a family of rankings of the alternatives to be interpreted as the family of the social preferences which better fit the individual preferences. A k-multiwinner social choice correspondence (k-scc) is instead a procedure which associates with any preference profile a family of sets of k alternatives to be interpreted as the family of all the sets of k alternatives that can be considered the best k alternatives for the society. While the concept of spc is classic, the one of k-scc, which extends the well-established single-winner framework (corresponding to the case \(k=1\)), is more recent. Indeed, it has been explored for about thirty years, but only for some years it has been getting a new attention. We refer to the recent papers by Elkind et al. (2017) and Faliszewski et al. (2017) for general information on that topic.
 Many spcs and k-sccs have been proposed and studied in the literature. Most of them satisfy two requirements which are considered strongly desirable by social choice theorists, namely anonymity and neutrality. A spc (k-sccs) is said anonymous if the identities of individuals are irrelevant to determine the social outcome, that is, it selects the same social outcome for any pair of preference profiles such that we get one from the other by permuting individual names; neutral if alternatives are equally treated, that is, for every pair of preference profiles such that we get one from the other by permuting alternative names, the social outcomes associated with them coincide up to the considered permutation. Since in many cases collective decision processes are required to select a unique outcome, an important role in social choice theory is played by resolute spcs and k-sccs, namely those spcs and k-sccs associating a single ranking or a single set of k alternatives with any preference profile. Unfortunately, classic spcs and k-sccs are not resolute in general. As a consequence, if the members of a committee agree to use one of the classic spcs to aggregate their preferences and a unique outcome is needed, then they also need to find an agreement on which tie-breaking rule to use when two or more social rankings are selected. Similarly, if they agree to select the best k alternatives for the society via a classic k-scc and a unique outcome is needed, then they also need to decide which tie-breaking rule to use when two or more sets of k alternatives are selected. The choice of a tie-breaking rule usually has a deep impact on the properties of the final decision rule. Consider, for instance, two special tie-breaking rules often used in the single-winner framework. The first one, proposed by Moulin (1988), is based on a tie-breaking agenda, that is, an exogenously given ranking of the alternatives: In ambiguity case, it is chosen the alternative of the social outcome which is best ranked in the agenda. The second one is instead based on the preferences of one of the individuals appointed as tie-breaker: In ambiguity case, it is chosen the alternative of the social outcome which is best ranked by the tie-breaker. Of course, the resolute refinements built through a tie-breaking agenda fail to be neutral while those built through a tie-breaker fail to be anonymous. Our work allows to cast these two special types of tie-breaking rules within a more general theory (Sect. 8).Footnote 1 We firmly believe that a reflection on the concept of tie-breaking rule is mandatory for social choice scientists in order to control the effective properties of the various resolute spcs and k-spcs in use and of those which could be used in the future. Indeed, it is clearly useless to choose a spc or a k-scc full of desirable properties and spoil a large part of them through an inappropriate tie-breaking rule. On the same line of thought, Jeong and Ju (2017) observe that it is unfortunate that tie-breaking rules are not incorporated in the definitions of the classic 1-sccs. In the context of two alternatives and allowing individuals to express also indifference between them, they discuss anonymous but non-neutral tie-breaking rules for the simple majority and the majority with quorum. In the same framework, but with profiles of variable length, McMorris et al. (2020) discuss many variations of the simple majority and, among them, they consider some of its resolute versions obtained through non-anonymous tie-breaking rules. Their scope is to characterize those variations in terms of weak versions of classic axioms and focusing on consistency. Thus, those authors implicitly treat also the properties which can derive by the use of different tie-breaking rules. In order to better explain our results and simplify the exposition, let us focus now on spcs. The concept of tie-breaking rule can be naturally formalized in terms of refinement of a spc. Let C and \(C^{\prime }\) be two spcs. We say that \(C^{\prime }\) is a refinement of C if, for every preference profile, the set of social preferences selected by \(C^{\prime }\) is a subset of the set of social preferences selected by C. Thus, refinements of C can be thought as methods to reduce the ambiguity in the choice made by C. In particular, resolute refinements of C completely eliminate the ambiguity leading to a unique social outcome, so that they can be identified with the possible tie-breaking rules for C. Of course, if C is not resolute, it admits many resolute refinements. Thus, an interesting issue to address is to understand whether it is possible to find resolute refinements of C which satisfy suitable properties. In particular, since it is immediate to understand that resolute refinements of even anonymous and neutral spcs are not generally anonymous and neutral, one may wonder whether anonymous and neutral resolute refinements of a given spc do exist. Unfortunately, as proved by Bubboloni and Gori (2014, Theorem 5), the existence of an anonymous, neutral and resolute spc is equivalent to the strong arithmetical condition \(\gcd (h,n!)=1\) which is rarely satisfied in practical situations. As a consequence, given a spc, we cannot in general get any anonymous and neutral resolute refinement of it. The condition \(\gcd (h,n!)=1\) was first introduced by Moulin (1983, Theorem 1, p.25) as a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of anonymous, neutral and efficient social choice functions; Bubboloni and Gori (2014, Theorem 15) generalize Moulin’s result considering in addition the qualified majority principle; Campbell and Kelly (2015) show that if \(n > h\) (so that \(\gcd (h,n!)\ne 1\)) and anonymous, neutral and resolute social choice functions exist, then those functions not only are inefficient but exhibit even more undesirable behaviors.Footnote 2 Fortunately, in many concrete cases, anonymity and neutrality are too strong requirements. That happens, for instance, for those committees having a president who is appointed to be more influential than the other committee members or when a committee evaluates job candidates giving the female candidates an advantage over the male ones. Indeed, in such situations, individual and alternative names are not immaterial. For such a reason, we propose generalized versions of anonymity and neutrality which can take into account possible distinctions among individuals and among alternatives. Let \(S_h\) be the group of permutations of the set \(H=\{1,\ldots , h\}\) of committee member names and \(S_n\) be the group of permutations of the set \(N=\{1,\ldots , n\}\) of alternative names. Given a subgroup V of \(S_h\), we say that a spc is V-anonymous if it selects the same social outcome for any pair of preference profiles such that we get one from the other by permuting individual names according to a permutation in V; given a subgroup W of \(S_n\), we say that a spc is W-neutral if for every pair of preference profiles such that we get one from the other by permuting alternative names according to a permutation in W, it associates with them social outcomes which coincide up to the considered permutation. The special groups of permutations V and W need to be identified on the basis of the specific features of the situation at hand. Of course, \(S_h\)-anonymity corresponds to anonymity and \(S_n\)-neutrality corresponds to neutrality. As a consequence, each anonymous (neutral) spc is V-anonymous (W-neutral) for every V (W). It is worth noting that, depending on the particular structure of V and W, it is possible to get V-anonymous, W-neutral and resolute spcs even when no anonymous, neutral and resolute spc exists.Footnote 3 That implies that, in a situation where suitable weak versions of anonymity and neutrality are sensible, there may be room for finding a resolute spc satisfying such versions of anonymity and neutrality by refining a given anonymous and neutral spc. In this paper, we propose conditions on V and W which are necessary and sufficient to make a V-anonymous and W-neutral spc admit a V-anonymous and W-neutral resolute refinement. Those conditions are summarized by an arithmetical relation between the size |W| of W and a special number \(\gamma (V)\) associated with V (defined in (12)). Namely, given a V-anonymous and W-neutral spc C (like, for instance, the Borda, the Copeland, the Minimax and the Kemeny spcs which are anonymous and neutral and then V-anonymous and W-neutral for every choice of V and W), we have that C admits a V-anonymous and W-neutral resolute refinement if and only ifFootnote 4 (Theorem 17). The computation of the numbers \(\gamma (V)\) and |W| is, in principle, hard. Fortunately, it becomes easy for many subgroups of interest in the applications (see Sect. 8). For example, consider a situation where individuals can be divided into disjoint subcommittees, say \(H_1,\dots ,H_r\), where individuals have the same decision power and that alternatives can be divided into disjoint subclasses, say \(N_1,\dots ,N_s\), where alternatives have the same exogenous importance. Assume first that such subcommittees (subclasses) can be ranked in such a way that, for every pair of subcommittees (subclasses), each individual (alternative) belonging to the subcommittee (subclass) having higher rank is more influential (more important) than any individual (alternative) belonging to the other subcommittee (subclass).Footnote 5 In this case, it is natural to require a collective decision process not to distinguish among individuals (alternatives) belonging to the same subcommittee (subclass). Thus, two groups V and W naturally arise: V is given by those permutations of individual names mapping every \(H_i\) into itself; W is given by those permutations of alternative names mapping every \(N_j\) into itself. Clearly \(|W|=\prod _{j=1}^s |N_j|!\) and we show that Footnote 6 so that condition (1) becomesFootnote 7 Assume now that subclasses can be ranked as before while no ranking of subcommittees is available. However, it is known that subcommittees having the same size must have the same impact in the final decision. This particular situation leads to consider a collective decision process which does not distinguish among individuals (alternatives) belonging to the same subcommittee (subclass) and also does not distinguish among subcommittees having the same size. Thus, V is now given by those permutations of individual names mapping every \(H_i\) into one of the subcommittees having its same size (possibly itself), while W is the same as before. We prove then that where \(t_i\) counts the number of subcommittees of size \(|H_i|\), so that condition (1) becomes We further deepen the analysis of the resolute refinements of a given spc by considering the property of reversal symmetry, a property first introduced by Saari (1994). Recall that the reversal of a ranking of alternatives is the ranking obtained by making the best alternative the worst, the second best alternative the second worst, and so on, and that a spc is said reversal symmetric if, for any pair of preference profiles such that one is obtained by the other by reversing each individual preference, it associates with one of them a set of social preferences if and only if it associates with the other one the set of their reversal. We prove that the condition along with other technical conditions, is necessary and sufficient to make any V-anonymous, W-neutral and reversal symmetric spc admit a V-anonymous, W-neutral and reversal symmetric resolute refinement (Theorem 18). In particular, from that result, it is easily deduced that the Borda and the Copeland spcs admit a V-anonymous, W-neutral and reversal symmetric resolute refinement if and only if (4) holds true. Along with the described analysis of spcs, we also study the problem to determine whether a k-scc admits V-anonymous and W-neutral resolute refinementsFootnote 8 and whether some of them are immune to the reversal bias too. Recall that a k-scc is immune to the reversal bias if it never associates the same set of k alternatives with a preference profile and its reversal (see Saari and Barney 2003; Bubboloni and Gori 2016a). We prove that if (1) holds true, then any V-anonymous and W-neutral k-scc admits a V-anonymous and W-neutral resolute refinement (Theorem 20). Assuming (4), we also find out conditions to make every V-anonymous, W-neutral and immune to the reversal bias k-scc admit a resolute refinement having the same properties (Theorem 21). Remarkably, that analysis put in evidence the role played by the number k of selected alternatives with respect to the number n of alternatives, pointing out that the existence of an immune to the reversal bias resolute refinement is guaranteed when the pair (n, k) belongs to a very specific set. We emphasize that the methods developed in the paper allow to deal with situations in which forms of symmetry conceptually different from V-anonymity and W-neutrality are required. The idea is to give room to any possible mixture of the anonymity and neutrality principles through the consideration of generic subgroups U of \(S_h\times S_n\) and the corresponding definition of U-symmetry and U-consistency given for spcs and k-sccs (see (7), (8), (9)). That is done not in view of a mere and vacuous generalization, but in order to capture every possible decision scenario. As a concrete application, we examine, in detail, the case of a committee facing the problem of electing a subcommittee of size k among n members of the committee itself who run as candidates. In this particular situation, a collective decision process should make no distinction among individuals who are candidates and among individuals who are not candidates and, at the same time, it must carefully take into account the fact that the alternatives to choose from are now a subset of the set of individuals. In Sect. 8.3, we prove that if \(\gcd (h,n)=1\), then any anonymous and neutral k-scc admits a resolute refinement consistent with the above described requirements. Note that some contributions dealing with weak versions of anonymity and neutrality are present in the literature. Assuming there are only two alternatives, Perry and Powers (2008) calculate the number of resolute spcs that are anonymous and neutral and the number of spcs satisfying a weak version of anonymity (that is, all individuals but one are anonymous) and neutrality; Powers (2010) shows that a spc satisfies the previously described weak anonymity, neutrality and Maskin monotonicity if and only if it is close to spc obeying an absolute qualified majority; Quesada (2013) identifies seven axioms (among which there are weak versions of anonymity and neutrality) characterizing the rules that are either the relative majority rule or the relative majority rule where a given individual can break the ties; Campbell and Kelly (2011, (2013) show that the relative majority is implied both by a suitable weak version of anonymity, neutrality and monotonicity, as well as by limited neutrality, anonymity and monotonicity. In the general case for the number of alternatives, some observations about different levels of anonymity and neutrality can be found in the paper by Kelly (1991). Bubboloni and Gori (2016b) consider, only for 1-sccs, weak versions of anonymity and neutrality, determined by partitions of individuals and alternatives. More recently, a wide literature about k-sccs which are representation-focused on some attributes of the alternatives (sex, age, profession, ethnicity) has been growing. See, for instance, Lang and Skowron (2016), Bredereck et al. (2018), Celis et al. (2018). The techniques used in our paper are based on an algebraic approach focused on the theory of finite permutation groups and the notion of action of a group on a set. That approach was initially used by Eğecioğlu (2009) and Eğecioğlu and Giritligil (2013) for analyzing the set of preference profiles and later developed by Bubboloni and Gori (2014, (2015, (2016b) to describe, in a unified framework, profiles and functions on them satisfying some symmetry properties.Footnote 9 We emphasize that, generalizing ideas and results in Bubboloni and Gori (2015, (2016b) for managing the resolute refinements of spcs and k-scc is in no way a trivial adaptation of the results in there. On the contrary, some proofs require complex and tricky arguments and, in particular, a deep consideration of the concept of regular group, first introduced in Bubboloni and Gori (2015), is needed. The paper is organized as follows. In Sects. 2, 3 and 4 we give the definitions, the notation and the basic results needed to understand the model. In Sect. 5, the main results are stated and developed. Section 6 is devoted to a careful analysis of the concept of regular group. Section 7 explores V-anonymity and W-neutrality as an application of the main results of the general theory. Section 8 is about some concrete applications of V-anonymity and W-neutrality, as described in this introduction. Finally, appendices A and B contain the proofs of the main results.",3
44.0,1.0,Decisions in Economics and Finance,23 January 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10203-021-00317-y,Non-compliant behaviour in public procurement: an evolutionary model with endogenous monitoring,June 2021,Raffaella Coppier,Francesca Grassetti,Elisabetta Michetti,Female,Female,Female,Female,"Beccaria (1764) and Bentham (1789) were among the first authors to begin studying crime and criminal response in a rational way focusing on the scientific approach to criminology research. The modern theory that derives from this literature underlines how the criminal makes a decision whether to proceed with the crime after weighing up the possible risks and benefits of carrying out the crime. The criminal act will take place if the advantages appear to outweigh the potential costs. As a consequence, for a punishment to work and have a deterrent effect, the predicted utility of the crime must be less than the utility from abstention. In Becker’s seminal paper of 1968 (Becker 1968), the main principle of the utility model states that a rational criminal has to speculate on the possible outcome. If he decides not to carry out a crime, there will be no risk involved, but obviously no criminal advantage. On the other hand, if he decides to go through with the crime, he will gain a criminal benefit but risk the consequential penalty. The predicted cost of carrying out a criminal action is a function of the probability of a criminal being caught and the degree of punishment he will receive when arrested. Following this approach, social investments in police and prisons will have an influence on the total number of crimes, while labour-market opportunities also have an impact on the relative cost of time involved in criminal offences. Regarding these offences, the most important element is deterrence. If criminals are discouraged from carrying out illegal activities in the first place, there is no need to go through the long (and expensive) process of arresting, prosecuting, sentencing or imprisonment. The present contribution aims at considering non-compliant behaviour attached to public procurement by following the Becker’s intuition. Public procurement refers to the process by which public authorities, such as state or local authorities, purchase works, goods or services from private companies. Governments and public firms must procure a wide variety of public goods, services and works from the private sector: they can range from basic IT equipment to important public infrastructures (e.g. roads, railways, etc.). Public procurement is a key economic activity of governments accounting for a relevant percentage of gross domestic product (GDP): in fact, there is a need for “value for money” regarding the relevant share of public spending involved in public contracts which is estimated on average to be 15% of GDP worldwide. As stressed by Iossa “This range will increase in the next years because of the increased level of delegation to the private sector of the provision of public services, not only in traditional sectors such as transport, energy and gas, but also in new sectors, such as the prison sectors and waste”.Footnote 1 Many corruption and fraud risks are present in the public procurement procedures leading them to be considered as examples of fraudulent and dishonest behaviour. The main reason must be searched within the strict link between the public and the private sector, link which can lead to conflicts between interests often producing dishonest behaviours. To be more precise, the non-compliant aspect involved in public procurement process is mainly due to the asymmetric information which can regard both the supplier selection phase and the implementation phase (quality, costs and delays). Illegal behaviour in public procurement can be identified in the award phase since the corrupt public official in exchange for a bribe can “pilot” the award of the contract to the firm that paid the bribe. Otherwise, especially in the case of public infrastructures, the quality of public procurement depends on the implementation phase: for this reason the possibility that the firms who provide the good through the auction can produce low-quality goods must be considered. It is therefore very important to try to ensure high-quality public procurement in order to guarantee good governance. footnoteSee, for example, Iossa and Martimort (2016). Hence, even if the choice on the allocation of public resources may be correct, the final result can still depend on different elements, such as the design rules of the process, the choice of suppliers, the contract gain and control on the implementation phase (as we will consider in the present study). The evolution of corruption and punishments has been investigated by means of different dynamical techniques that spread from cellular automata [see, for example, Wirl (1998)] to game theory [see, for example, Povey (2014)] and focusing on different systems of the economy, from tax avoidance to strategic management [see, for example, Lorenz (2019) and Masch (2004)]. De Giovanni et al. (2019) studied the optimal control problem of a tax authority and the dynamics of compliance when individuals have to decide whether to engage in tax evasion depending on an evolutionary adaptation process. Tax evasion, evolution of compliance and regulation have been analysed also in Petrohilos-Andrianos and Xepapadeas (2016) that focused on the effect of imitation in the evolution of strategies adopted by the population. In order to describe the evolution of non-compliant behaviour in public procurement, the model herewith presented is formalized as an evolutionary adaptation process able to establish whether compliant or non-compliant behaviour predominates in society. Furthermore, players (firms) will show either compliant (honest) or non-compliant (dishonest) behaviour according to the type of company they encounter and the rewards involved (word-of-mouth process). Following Lamantia and Pezzino (2017), we assume that honest firms which are in contact with corrupt firms may decide to change their behaviour if they realize that the reward they obtain from being corrupt is greater than the one they receive from being truthful. In addition, following Brianzoni et al. (2019), we consider the honesty propensity assumption to hold, that is all dishonest firms meeting honest ones will choose to change type if the expected utility from dishonest behaviour is not greater than the expected utility derived from honest behaviour, while not all honest firms meeting dishonest ones will choose to change type even if a higher expected utility can be reached. Differently from the previous contributions, in the present paper we focus on the behaviour of non-compliant firms when the auditing level fixed by the State is linked to the diffusion of non-compliance in the economy, i.e. the endogenous monitoring level by the State is considered. Hence, the auditing level corresponds to the enforcement effect in the model, where auditing is controlled by the probability with which a firm is monitored and penalized for the infringement once discovered. The approach of an enforcement authority will most probably affect the equilibrium and the dynamics which in turn have influence on the balance compliance decisions of the firms. In fact, as explained in Bajari and Tadelis (2001) and Brianzoni et al. (2011), due to the varying levels of the quality of goods, difficulties appear when companies lie about the original quality of a good. Since the quality of a good is confidential information, only the State’s controllers can check the authenticity of a product. Therefore, the State can reduce or even abolish corrupt behaviour by putting in place a monitoring activity depending on several factors. For instance, Stranlund and Dhanda (1999) analysed how the probability with which a firm is monitored and the obligation to punish corruptive behaviour varies according to the different types of firms. On the other hand, Lui (1986) considers how difficult and costly it can be to monitor a corrupt official, especially if other officials are also corrupt. Finally, as analysed by Waqar (2016), the environment in which a tax inspector works also has an influence on how effective monitoring can be. Moreover, Waqar (2016) considers how equilibrium depends on the level of monitoring and the percentage of corrupt firms. By following this research line, we assume an endogenous monitoring technology, which depends on the diffusion of corruptive behaviour in society, in order to show how the endogenous audit level has an effect on equilibrium and evolution in the public procurement sector when considering non-compliant behaviours. Furthermore, we consider that different countries may have a higher or lower intrinsic attitude towards honesty. Higher intrinsic honesty derives from the fact that a greater social stigma is attributed to dishonest behaviour (as indeed it emerges from the paper by Fisman and Miguel (2007), in which the importance of considering the “culture of legality” of a country is highlighted). Clearly, this intrinsic honesty of the country is a variable on which a State can act but only in the medium–long term. Considering and comparing countries characterized by a different “attitude” towards honesty allow us to evaluate how much the efficacy of economic policies in fighting the dishonesty depends on the starting conditions and the attitude of the considered country. The economic model proposed in the present paper is formalized by a dynamical system describing the evolution of both the fraction of dishonest firms and the monitoring effort by the State over time. The final system can be differentiable or piecewise–smooth depending on the relation between production costs for honest and dishonest firms and the level of fines. By using both analytical techniques and numerical experiments, our model aims at demonstrating that the economy may converge in the long run towards monomorphic configurations, i.e. firms are all honest or all dishonest (i.e. dishonesty trap), or even to polymorphic compositions characterized by the presence of both groups. In addition, fluctuations can emerge. The transitions to different long term qualitative scenarios can be explained by considering modifications in some key ingredients of the model (such as honesty propensity, fine level, social stigma, effort put in place by the State to fight dishonest behaviour, etc.) and the related parameters (i.e. bifurcation analysis is presented). In particular, as the system can result to be continuous but not differentiable, besides the standard bifurcations occurring in smooth systems, also border-collision bifurcations (BCB) can emerge.Footnote 2 Starting from the initial works by Nusse and Yorke (1992) and Nusse and Yorke (1995), several contributions investigated BCB structures both in one-dim and two-dim systems [see, for instance, Panchuk et al. (2013, 2015), Banerjee et al. (2000) and Gardini et al. (2010)] and several applications in economics have been proposed [see Gardini et al. (2011, 2015)].Footnote 3 Moving from standard smooth bifurcation structures to BCB sequences, the modification in qualitative dynamics as some key parameters are changed can be no more predictable, providing that economic policies aiming at fighting dishonest behaviour are difficult to be fixed. This work conducts an analysis of the possible tools that a State can use to eliminate or at least reduce dishonest behaviour. We found that the culture of legality, i.e. the inner honesty of a country, is a necessary and sufficient condition to remove corruption: only countries with a high level of honesty will, independently of other instruments, be able to eliminate dishonest behaviour. Conversely, in countries where the culture of honesty is low, a low level of punishment for discovered dishonest behaviour leads the economy to converge in the long term towards a trap of dishonesty, i.e. a stable equilibrium in which all firms are dishonest. If the level of punishment for dishonest behaviour and the amount of public resources devoted to fighting dishonesty are high enough, the economy can converge towards an equilibrium in which there are both honest and dishonest firms. Finally, in the case in which the inner honesty is intermediate, the economy could converge towards equilibria in which both honest and dishonest firms coexist or even fluctuate. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the economic model; in Sect. 3, we show the dynamics of the system, and Sect. 4 concludes.",2

Investors and consumers pressure companies to consider social and environmental issues (see, e.g., Manasakis 2018; Fernández-Kranz and Santalo 2010; Kitzmueller and Shimshack 2012; Starks 2009; Mohr et al. 2001) and CSR reporting has become mainstream among big companies. In the past, CSR research has been primarily concerned with defining and categorizing CSR activities and empirically investigating the link between corporate social performance and corporate financial performance, although without arriving at clear-cut results (McWilliams et al. 2006; Baron 2001; McWilliams and Siegel 2000). In recent years, an increasing number of researchers have employed game-theoretic models to study the long-term investment characteristics of CSR decisions and its impact on firm and industry performance. An important conclusion that can be drawn is that if a firm’s stakeholders have social preferences, then engaging in CSR can be fully compatible with profit-maximizing behavior (see Kitzmueller and Shimshack 2012; Bénabou and Tirole 2010; Lyon and Maxwell 2008).To contrast such a type of investment from “altruistic” or “coerced” CSR, the term “strategic corporate social responsibility” has been introduced (see Baron 2001; Husted and de Jesus Salazar 2006; Piga 2002; Heslin and Ochoa 2008).Footnote 1 The issue of first-mover or second-mover advantages has been hotly debated in the strategy and economics literature with a variety of insightful and testable results (see, e.g., Lieberman and Montgomery 1988, 1998, and Kopel and Löffler 2008 for references). In contrast, in the CSR literature only very few authors devote space to this issue despite the obvious importance for firms engaged in CSR activities. Among these exceptions are Reinhardt (1998) and Vogel (2005), who point out that it is difficult to keep CSR activities specific to a firm’s strategy and to profit in the long run. Their argument is succinctly summarized by a comment in The Economist (2008): “First-mover advantage soon passes. After a while, for example, everybody turns green, and the winners are the companies with the best execution. One large consultancy advises its big clients to be number two or three on corporate responsibility rather than number one.” In contrast, Tetrault Sirsly and Lamertz (2008) argue that a CSR leader can maintain a first-mover advantage if it develops “... a strategic CSR initiative that is central to the firm mission, visible to stakeholders and with firm-specific benefits beyond those of public goods.” (p. 360). In the present paper, I try to advance this line of research on CSR leadership by introducing a formal model to see under which conditions a first-mover or a second-mover advantage arises. In particular, I address the following research questions. I ask if the CSR leader, i.e., the firm which invests in CSR before the rival, always achieves a first-mover advantage. Furthermore, under which circumstances does a CSR follower obtain higher profits? I also study the incentives to invest in CSR. Does the CSR leader or the CSR follower have higher incentives to engage in CSR activities? Who has a higher absolute level of CSR activities? Then, I explore the influence of “CSR spillovers.” How do these results change if “CSR spillovers” exist, i.e., if the CSR leader’s activity also benefits the rival. How does this depend on the level of CSR spillovers? Finally, I explore the influence of competition. How do the results depend on the degree of competition in the industry? Is a higher degree of competition in an industry beneficial for investments in CSR or not? The main findings of the present study are as follows. If CSR activities are specific to the CSR leader, i.e., if there are no spillovers to the rival or spillovers are very low, then in line with Tetrault Sirsly and Lamertz (2008) I find that a first-mover advantage exists. If CSR spillovers are higher, then there is a second-mover advantage for the CSR follower. The result that the CSR leader achieves higher profits than the CSR follower in the case of perfectly appropriable CSR investments is intuitive and somehow expected. What is surprising, however, is that the level of CSR spillovers for which a first-mover advantage can be sustained is in fact very low. In other words, although the benefit of CSR investments by the leader is almost fully proprietary, to be the first firm which invests in CSR does not pay off in terms of profits since even the smallest opportunity to free-ride on the leader’s investment gives the follower a competitive advantage. This confirms Reinhardt (1998) and Vogel (2005) who both have raised doubts that CSR leadership can lead to a competitive advantage in the long run. The second notable finding in my paper is that for the leader and the follower there is an asymmetry in incentives to engage in CSR which depends on the intensity of competition. With increasing intensity of competition and low spillovers, the CSR leader first decreases CSR efforts, but then increases CSR efforts again. This contrasts with the CSR efforts of the CSR follower, which decrease throughout for increasing intensity of competition. If CSR spillovers are sufficiently high, then the CSR follower’s level of CSR is higher than the CSR leader’s level and the CSR efforts of the CSR follower now first decrease for increasing competition, but then start increasing again. The finding that the interaction between CSR spillovers, CSR activities and the level of competition is rather complex leads to the conclusion that it might be difficult to show empirically which firm has a higher incentive to engage in CSR, since the answer depends on factors which are quite hard to measure accurately. With regard to the ongoing discussion among strategy scholars about the relationship between specific components of corporate social performance and corporate financial performance (e.g., Surroca et al. 2010; Brammer and Millington 2008; Godfrey et al. 2009), my paper shows that even in an ideal setting where the only effect of CSR engagements is to lead to higher prices by increasing the consumers’ willingness to pay, CSR does not necessarily yield a competitive advantage for the first-mover. The occurrence of a competitive advantage depends in an intricate way on contextual factors like the substitutability between the firms’ products, on strategic choices like the timing of CSR engagements, and on particular elements of corporate social performance which are captured here by CSR spillovers. Finally, my study also sheds light on the issue of convergence of CSR practices. Being aware of reputation spillovers, industry leaders oftentimes pressure and support less socially responsible competitors to imitate their CSR practices (Misani 2010; Vogel 2005). Although strategically motivated, this then results in the leading firm giving up its differentiation and first-mover advantage based on its CSR expertise. Consequently, since all firms converge on their CSR practices, empirical studies show no or a rather weak link between corporate social and corporate financial performance.",4

To avoid over-exploitation that leads to the “tragedy of the commons” (see Hardin (1968)), forms of harvesting regulation are usually employed, mainly based on optimal control techniques.Footnote 1 In spite of the various forms of regulation employed, most natural resources are over-exploited, with many species being extinct or on the verge of extinction, see, for instance, McWhinnie (2009). One of the main reasons for this failure relates to the difficulty in monitoring and enforcing optimal rules. For this reason, one could replace those forms of rigid control, difficult to impose, with milder forms of regulation. An example relating to the possible dynamics of these rules is provided in Bischi et al. (2013a) and concerns the harvesting of two species of shellfish from the Adriatic Sea (Venerupis aurea and Callista chione). These species do not interact biologically with each other and, on the basis of a proposal to regulate their exploitation, fishers must only commit themselves to harvest only one of the two resources for a given period of time. This can occur because an authority imposes that fishers have to stick to the decided strategy for a given period of time after which they can reconsider their decisions on the basis of observed profits. The dynamics of the resources, modeled by means of a continuous-time system, are therefore coupled with a discrete-time dynamics on the species to be taken, based on the profits from fishing. The model that follows is then a hybrid system that combines continuous and discrete time dynamics, see Aubin et al. (2002), Goebel et al. (2009) and Haddad et al. (2006). From a mathematical point of view, even if hybrid models are more complicated to study, they are closer to a more correct description of the reality being analyzed (see also Bischi et al. (2013b), Lamantia and Radi (2015) and Bischi et al. (2015) for related models). In this paper, we provide a dynamic analysis of the hybrid dynamical system proposed in Bischi et al. (2013a). In addition to the reasons indicated in Bischi et al. (2013a), this type of modeling is coherent to all those situations of specialized fisheries, in which a particular species is targeted and for a certain period of time, due to technical requirements of the harvesting (types of gears) or rules, it is not possible to change the species taken, see French et al. (2019) for an analogous example. The purpose of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, we extend the model to include financial evaluation of the interests on profits in the various harvesting periods. In addition, we provide an equivalent reformulation of the model in Bischi et al. (2013a) by means of a discretization of the continuous-time dynamics of the resources in the periods in which there may be a change in the choices of the species to be taken.Footnote 2 These choices are then modeled by means of an evolutionary dynamic (discrete-time replicator type), which is based on the profits obtained over the previous periods (see Weibull (1995) and Hofbauer and Sigmund (1998)). The discrete-time representation of the hybrid dynamical system proposed in Bischi et al. (2013a) allows us to underline interesting aspects of the global dynamics of the model that were neglected in Bischi et al. (2013a). The first relevant aspect that we are able to underline is the type of bifurcation, that is period-doubling or flip, through which the inner equilibrium of the system loses stability when a different time scale between the decision process of quantity to harvest and the one of the species to harvest is introduced. A second relevant aspect that we underline by means of numerically generated bifurcation diagrams is the existence of chaotic dynamics. Specifically, we show a sequence of period-doubling bifurcations leading to chaotic dynamics. A third relevant aspect that we underline is the presence of coexisting attractors, that introduces path dependence and the related economic issues. Therefore, the current work adds to the existing literature by explaining for the first time the mechanisms behind the global dynamics of the hybrid bio-economic model proposed in Bischi et al. (2013a). The structure of the paper is as follows. In Sect. 2, we summarize the essential elements of the bio-economic model considered in Bischi et al. (2013a). In Sect. 3, we reformulate that hybrid model through a three-dimensional map and propose a possible extension to take into account the compounding of risk-free interests in harvesting profits. In Sect. 4, we present the main results on the global dynamics of the model, in particular, regarding the influence of economic parameters on the dynamics of the species subject to exploitation. Section 5 concludes. All the proofs are in Appendix A.",

Evidence from dynamic short-term perspective,December 2021,Jihed Majdoub,Salim Ben Sassi,Azza Bejaoui,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Overwhelmingly, cryptocurrencies have become a widespread and fascinating phenomenon which is eminently addressed by financial and governmental institutions as well as academic researchers. From a policy standpoint, digital currencies put forward a shift away from the established design of financial system infrastructures given their digital representation. They have interestingly soared in response to uncertainty surrounding the conventional economic and banking systems and the perceived failures of governments’ central banks during crises (e.g., European debt crisis of 2010–2013). Obviously, the advent of such new currencies brings into play the functioning and stability of the financial systems. From a research standpoint, the digital currencies drew tremendous interest in the financial literature and significant attempts have been made in exploring different issues. Undoubtedly, the first interesting question deals with the nature of Bitcoin, if Bitcoin can be considered as an alternative currency or speculative asset (or investment). Whereas a currency can be characterized as a unit of account, medium of exchange and store of value, an asset does not conspicuously have the two first ones and can be apparently disentangled (Baur et al. 2017). Therefore, if the Bitcoin is considered as an investment, it could compete with other assets (e.g., stocks and government bonds). Rather, if it is employed as a currency to pay for service or goods, it might compete with other fiat currency and influences central bank’s monetary policies. Selgin (2015) and Baeck and Elbeck (2015), among others, assert that Bitcoin represents a speculative asset rather than a currency. Yermack (2013) reports that many features such as a lack of a central governance structure, cybersecurity risks, the diversity of Bitcoin prices among different exchanges and Bitcoin’s comparatively low level of adoption hinder such cryptocurrency to be a currency. Using different data, Glaser et al. (2014) examined what users’ intentions were when changing their domestic into a digital currency. They clearly show that the interest of new users affects the Bitcoin volume traded at the exchange but not on the volume within the Bitcoin system. This implies that exchange users purchasing Bitcoin seem to keep such digital currency in their wallet for speculation purposes but do not employ it for paying goods or services. They also show that Bitcoin returns react on news about this crytocurrency, again implying that users perceive Bitcoin as an alternative investment. As well, Baur et al. (2017) reveal that Bitcoin is primarily used as investment rather than being employed for transactions (i.e., a medium of exchange) due to its high volatility and returns. By considering cryptocurrency as an asset, other researchers thereafter tried to investigate some empirical proprieties of cryptocurrency prices and in particular the volatility dynamics. For instance, Katsiampa (2017) attempted to estimate and explain the Bitcoin price volatility by comparing several competing GARCH-type models. The results clearly indicate that the AR-CGARCH model performs very well, implying the importance of having both short-run and long-run components of conditional variance. Chaim and Laurini (2018) used different specifications to apprehend the dynamics of daily Bitcoin returns and volatility. They reveal the importance of integrating permanent jumps to volatility. They also highlight the existence of two high volatility periods: the first one from late 2013 to early 2014 and the second one during the 2017 year. More recently, Ben Cheikh et al. (2019) investigated the asymmetric behavior of volatility in the major cryptocurrency markets (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin) over the period 28/04/2013–01/12/2018. Using the Smooth Transition GARCH model, they show an inverted asymmetric reaction for the most of virtual currencies. In other words, good news tends to affect much more the volatility’s behavior than bas news. Katsiampa (2019) examine the volatility dynamics of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin and Stellar Lumen over the period 07/08/2015–10/02/2018. The empirical results display that the conditional variances of all the five digital currencies are significantly affected by past conditional volatility and previous squared errors. Also, asymmetric past shocks influence the current conditional volatility. The volatility dynamics of virtual currencies appear to be generally responsive to major news. Baur and Dimpfl (2019) analyze the asymmetric volatility effect for twenty cryptocurrencies. They show that positive shocks increase the volatility more than negative shocks. Such finding can be explained by the trading activity of uniformed investors (resp. informed investors) in the case of positive (resp. negative) shocks. Caporale and Zekokh (2019) search for the best (or set of) model(s) to model cryptocurrency price volatility based on different procedures (backtesting VaR and ES and Model Confidence Set procedure). They clearly display that employing classic GARCH models can lead to incorrect VaR and ES predictions and ineffective risk management, portfolio optimization and pricing of derivative securities. In parallel, other researchers rather prefer to examine the role of cryptocurrencies from the perspective of investors. More explicitly, they investigate the safe haven, hedging and diversifying capabilities of Bitcoin given its weak negative or positive correlation with other assets. For instance, Dyhrberg (2015) analyzes the hedging ability of Bitcoin against stocks in the Financial Times Stock Exchange Index and the American dollar over the period 19/07/2010–22/05/2015. The results clearly display that Bitcoin is characterized by hedging capabilities against the FTSE Index. Bitcoin can be used as a hedge against the dollar in the short-term. Bouri et al. (2016a) show that Bitcoin has safe haven propriety over the pre-crash period. Such propriety nevertheless tends to vanish after the price crash of 2013. Bouri et al. (2017a, b) test if Bitcoin can hedge global uncertainty over the period 17/03/2011–07/01/2016. They clearly display that Bitcoin has hedging capability against uncertainty at the extreme ends of the Bitcoin market and global uncertainty at shorter investment horizons. Bouri et al. (2017a, b) investigate the hedge and safe haven proprieties of Bitcoin against different assets (e.g., major world stock indices, bonds, gold and oil) over the period 07/2011–12/2015. They display that Bitcoin is poor hedge and can be considered as an effective diversifier for most of the cases. Otherwise, in a few cases, Bitcoin has hedge and safe haven proprieties which differ between horizons. Chan et al. (2018) investigate if Bitcoin can diversify and hedge risk against the Euro STOXX, Nikkei, Shanghai A-Share, S&P500 and the TSX index in dynamic way. They indicate that Bitcoin is (resp. is not) an effective strong hedge for all the indices based on monthly (resp. daily and weekly) data frequency. Urquhart and Zhang (2019) examine if Bitcoin can act as hedge or safe haven against fiat currencies. They prove that Bitcoin plays a role of hedge (resp. diversifier) for the CHF, EUR and GBP (resp. AUD, CAD and JPY). They also show that Bitcoin is a safe haven for economic policy uncertainty. From the aforementioned findings emerge two facts. First, Bitcoin presents high volatility and therefore can be considered as high risk investment. Second, the safe haven, hedge and diversifier proprieties of Bitcoin tend to vary according to data frequency, the nature of assets and methods. That is why Pal and Mitra (2019) instead seek to investigate the possibility of hedging Bitcoin prices with different assets (S&P500, gold and wheat) over the period 03/01/2011–19/02/2018. They find that Bitcoin can be hedged with gold, wheat and S&P500 based on different GARCH-type models (DCC-GARCH, GO-GARCH and ADCC-GARCH). Following Pal and Mitra (2019), we compute optimal hedge ratios between Bitcoin and fiat currencies in order to explore whether Bitcoin can be hedged by such assets and therefore potential hedging strategy might be well-established. From methodological standpoint, we employ VAR-DCC-GARCH model, VAR-ADCC-GARCH model and VAR-component GARCH-DCC model to adequately model volatilities and conditional correlations between Bitcoin and fiat currencies. We also perform a rolling window analysis to establish out-of-sample one-step-ahead forecast of dynamic conditional correlations. Such method can help to take into consideration changing variability into the data (Basher and Sadorsky 2016). This leads to compute optimal hedge ratios and thereby cross-hedging (fiat/virtual) currency markets. The layout of this paper is as follows. Section 2 gives an outline of the methodology adopted. Section 3 presents the data used and the descriptive statistics. Section 4 reports the empirical results. Section 5 highlights cross-hedges for virtual and fiat currency markets. Sections 6 and 7 discusses and concludes, respectively.",13

International stock markets, futures, and crude oil prices dropped successively. Since the breakdown of Bretton Woods, gold does not have the same prominence in the international monetary system. However, it still attracts considerable attention from investors, media, and researchers. Especially, during the global economic and financial crisis that started in 2007 with the subprime mortgage market crisis in the USA, the gold price has recorded an intense increase while other assets had losses (Beckmann et al. 2015). In recent years, correlations among most types of assets increased significantly. However, gold is still considered to be a zero-beta asset (McCown and Zimmerman 2006) and is often said to be uncorrelated with other assets (Baur and Lucey 2010). Oil is a raw material, while gold is a precious metal. Tiwari and Sahadudheen (2015) explored the relationship between real oil prices and real gold prices. They found that oil has the lowest average return, while gold has the highest average return. Similarly, oil has the highest volatility, whereas gold has the lowest volatility. They employed many types of GARCH models and find that shocks in gold prices have an asymmetric effect, which means that positive and negative shocks have different effects on gold prices in terms of magnitude. Dyhberg (2016a) claimed that the global uncertainty surrounding the 2007 global financial crisis eased the emergence of the first decentralized cryptocurrency based on the blockchain technology named Bitcoin and strengthened its popularity. Nakamoto (2008) designed Bitcoin. It facilitated electronic payments between individuals without going through a third party. Bitcoin has been the subject of challenges and opportunities for policymakers, consumers, entrepreneurs, and economists since its introduction. Bitcoin is considered to be different from any other asset in the financial market. It creates new possibilities for stakeholders with regard to portfolio analysis, risk management, and consumer sentiment analysis (Dyhberg 2016a). Bitcoin is compared to gold because they have many similarities. Neither of them has a nationality or is controlled by a government. They are mined by several independent operators and companies. Gold has some intrinsic values but most likely it does not justify its current market value (Dyhrberg 2016b). Bitcoin is defined as a highly volatile asset (Brière et al. 2015; Selmi et al. 2018; Symitsi and Chalvatzis 2019; Agosto and Cafferata 2020; Giudici and Pagnottoni 2020; Baur and Hoang 2020). It has become a main theme in the financial press and academia. Given the acceptance of Bitcoin as an investment and its rising importance, modeling Bitcoin price volatility becomes important to investment decisions and risk management (Katsiampa 2017). Many studies used the GARCH- family models as the backbone of modeling Bitcoin’s volatility (Katsiampa 2017; Bouri et al. 2017; Guesmi et al. 2019; Fakhfekh and Jeribi 2020). Glaser et al. (2014) and Gronwald (2014) have employed linear GARCH. Dyhrberg (2016b), Bouoiyour and Selmi (2015, 2016) and Bouri et al. (2017) have used the Threshold GARCH (TGARCH). Using asymmetric GARCH models, Bouri et al. (2017), Katsiampa (2017), Baur et al. (2018), and Stavroyiannis (2018) investigated the response of the conditional variance to past positive and negative shocks and find an inverted leverage effect. At the same time, another line of research is interested in studying the correlation between conventional asset classes and Bitcoin. Modeling the dynamic volatilities of cryptocurrencies and other assets is an important and new subject to study because of recent developments in increased integration between financial markets. Various studies use a number of methods and find that Bitcoin is very weakly associated with conventional assets such as bonds, commodities, and equities (e.g., Bouri et al. 2017; Gajardo et al. 2018; Klein et al. 2018; Bouri et al. 2020). Based on the MVQM-CAViaR approach, Wang et al. (2019) show that the impact of the VIX shocks on Bitcoin’s risks is negligible. However, Jareno et al. (2020) show negative and statistically significant effects of VIX on Bitcoin returns. While Bitcoin is still perceived to be mysterious and not very well understood by many financial market stakeholders. The analysis of Bitcoin’s capabilities in terms of different financial aspects must be carried out. Two observations are considered from the above studies. First, the Bitcoin volatility has received a lot of attention in most studies using the GARCH family models. Second, the relationships between Bitcoin and conventional asset classes are discussed somewhat, especially during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the existing literature lacks a clear understanding of the Bitcoin’s volatility. It also lacks evidence of relationships between other cryptocurrencies and conventional asset classes. Most of the researches that studied volatility dynamics and correlations between Bitcoin and other assets have used multivariate GARCH models like BEKK-GARCH (Klein et al. 2018; Corbet et al. 2018), DCC-GARCH (Bouri et al. 2017), or ADCC-GARCH (Kumar and Anandarao 2019; Gajardo et al. 2018; Tiwari et al. 2019). Most of the works focused on Bitcoin as the cryptocurrency market’s leader. A number of new cryptocurrencies appeared and most of them are developed further on the basis of blockchains. Previous studies like Baur and Dimpfl (2018), Phillip et al. (2018), and Fakhfekh and Jeribi (2020) were interested in modeling the volatility dynamics of cryptocurrencies. However, a small number of studies have investigated volatility transmission between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies (Katsiampa et al. 2019; Beneki et al. 2019). Agosto and Cafferata (2020) investigated the relationships between the explosive behaviors of cryptocurrencies through a unit root testing approach. They confirmed the presence of high interdependence in the cryptocurrency market as in Corbet et al. (2018) and Yi et al. (2018). Aslanidis et al. (2019) studied the conditional correlations between four cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Monero, Dash, and Ripple), S&P 500, bond, and gold. The results indicated that the studied cryptocurrencies are strongly correlated. However, the associations between cryptocurrencies and conventional financial assets are negligible. Tiwari et al. (2019) investigated time-differentiated correlations between the S&P 500 and six other cryptocurrencies. They suggested that cryptocurrencies are perceived to be a hedge against the risks of the S&P 500. Charfeddine et al. (2020) investigated the dynamic relationship between Bitcoin and Ethereum and major financial commodities and securities. They supported the idea that these two cryptocurrencies can be ideal for financial diversification. Bouri et al. (2020) compared the safe-haven roles of Bitcoin, commodities, and gold against global and country stock market indices. The results indicated that Bitcoin is isolated from financial assets and can be seen as a new virtual gold. Their results are similar to that of Dyhrberg (2016a). Previous studies concentrated mainly on Bitcoin in contrast to gold and other financial assets, while little attention was paid to other cryptocurrencies. Given that the information provided by the VIX serves as a valuable reference to investors, it is imperative to examine the relation between cryptocurrencies and the VIX. In this paper, we analyze the relationship between the cryptocurrencies volatilities, American indices (S&P500, Nasdaq, and VIX), oil, and gold prices. First, we estimate the spillover effect between cryptocurrencies and other assets. Second, we estimate the dynamic conditional correlations between the crypto-currencies. Finally, we examine the dynamic conditional correlations between crypto-currencies, American indices, gold, and oil returns. This study adds to the existing literature in two ways. First, it investigates the relationships between cryptocurrencies and financial assets in contrast to gold, especially during the COVID-19 outbreak. Second, it analyzes the relationship between five cryptocurrencies and VIX, on the one hand, and between five cryptocurrencies and WTI on the other hand. The layout of this paper is as follows. Section 2 gives an outline of the econometric methodology adopted. Section 3 is devoted to highlight the relevant data and the empirical findings. Finally, Sect. 4 concludes.",33

Much of the social debate centers on cyber-security, legitimacy, and reputation issues due to possible hacking attacks of the peer-to-peer network used for the electronic payments, which allows anonymous transactions and carries risks as money laundering, the financing of criminality and terrorism, and tax evasion. More recently, the high volatility of price series has fostered an increasing interest in bubbles detection and price dynamics of cryptocurrencies in the associated markets (Garcia et al. 2014; Bouoiyour et al. 2015; Donier and Bouchaud 2015; Hencic and Gouriéroux 2015; Blau 2017). Bariviera (2017), Bariviera et al. (2017), and Lahmiri et al. (2018) studied the long-range dependence of return and volatility, and other statistical features of Bitcoin daily and intraday prices, from 2011 to 2017. They found the long-range correlation behavior in the daily volatility series of Bitcoin. Lahmiri and Bekiros (2018) showed that, as opposed to returns, Bitcoin prices incorporate and exhibit chaotic dynamics and nontrivial correlation patterns at different time scales. By using methods that originate in physics, Cheah and Fry provided empirical evidence that Bitcoin prices contain a substantial speculative bubble component (Cheah and Fry 2015) and identified shocks and crashes in cryptocurrency markets with specific evidence for negative bubbles (Fry and Cheah 2016). Corbet et al. (2018) related Bitcoin and Ethereum prices to ‘‘fundamental drivers’’ to reveal the existence and dates of bubbles periods in the market. By applying the methodology discussed in Phillips et al. (2015), Cheung et al (2015), Li et al. (2019), and Bouri et al. (2019) aimed at detecting a bubble behavior in price dynamics at some point in time. Chaim and Laurini (2019) and Cretarola and Figà-Talamanca (2019b) related to strict local martingale theory to investigate price dynamics of Bitcoin by a continuous time stochastic model. More precisely, Chaim and Laurini (2019) estimated the volatility function of Bitcoin daily and high-frequency five minutes prices, whereas in Cretarola and Figà-Talamanca (2019b) the association of cryptocurrencies price dynamics with investors’ attention and sentiment is described with a regime-switching correlation parameter. The impact of market attention on Bitcoin returns and volatility is also the research interest in Kristoufek (2013, 2015), Figà-Talamanca and Patacca (2019), Cretarola et al. (2019), Cretarola and Figà-Talamanca (2019a). Lahmiri and Bekiros (2020) explored the evolution of the informational efficiency in 45 cryptocurrency markets and 16 international stock markets before and during COVID-19 pandemic. They found that investing in digital assets during big crises could be considered riskier as opposed to equities, as cryptos showed more instability and more irregularity during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to international stock markets. For the study of dynamical systems, Luque et al. (2011) have proposed a novel method, called the horizontal visibility graph (HVG) algorithm, which captures the nature of different classes of series in a network context. By the HVG algorithm, time series are proficiently converted into a network representation and then analyzed from a new and complementary viewpoint, and with a full set of alternative techniques and tools from the complex network theory. Most of all, the topology of the network inherits the structure of the time series, in such a way that periodic, random, and fractal series map into motif-like, random exponential and scale-free networks, respectively (Bollobás 1998; Watts and Strogatz 1998; Barabási and Albert 1999). However, in spite of its suitability for the study of time series, the application of HVG algorithm to cryptocurrencies price dynamics is limited to the study carried out in Liu et al. (2020) to investigate the Bitcoin price volatility and deepen the understanding of the markets for rare items, e.g., the gold market. In this paper, we took advantage of the HVG algorithm to derive information about the process that generates the time series of three cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC), over the period September 1, 2015–March 31, 2020. Actually, BTC, ETH, and LTC are the most popular, big name cryptocurrencies. As of August 2020, BTC and ETH are the digital coins with the largest market capitalization (assets in circulation multiplied by asset price) just below 218 and 46 billion of US dollars (Investing.com 2020), respectively. LTC stays behind Bitcoin as the seventh largest digital currency by market cap. It is often referred to as “silver to Bitcoin’s gold” as LTC adopts many of the features of BTC, and changes some other aspects that in 2011 the founder Charlie Lee felt could be improved. In fact, compared to BTC, LTC can produce a greater number of coins and it is characterized by faster transactions, lower transaction fees, and a new cryptographic algorithm for a more easily accessible process, said “mining,” for generating and releasing new coins and for verifying, authenticating, and then adding the ongoing network transactions to a public ledger. Among the three cryptocurrencies considered, ETH is the youngest one as it was launched by Vitalik Buterin on July 30, 2015. Therefore, we chose to consider a time frame starting from September 1, 2015, in order to have three time series of the same length. Besides price and volume dynamics, in the proposed study, we also investigated the degree of synchronization between the three leading cryptocurrencies cited to detect potential interactions among bubble periods within the cryptocurrency markets. Hence, two research questions guided our analysis. As a first concern, we questioned whether the source of unpredictability in the price dynamics of the virtual currencies under study origins in a chaotic, deterministic, or stochastic dynamical system, which is a fundamental issue for modeling and forecasting purposes. To this end, we used results from Lacasa and Toral (2010) showing that the three series map into a graph with exponential degree distribution, \(P\left( k \right)\sim \exp \left( { - \lambda k} \right)\), where the value of λ characterizes the specific process that generated the series. Second, we investigated whether price and volume upswings and crushes in one cryptocurrency market can lead to similar dynamics in other cryptocurrencies by running a synchrony analysis for the series investigated. To this aim, we followed the procedure described in Freeman et al. (2018) and Cazelles (2004). Potential interactions among bubble periods within the cryptocurrency market might influence diversification possibilities and trading strategies. In fact, an investors might prefer to switch from one cryptocurrency to another to exploit the opportunities of profit generated by the correlated behavior of virtual currencies. The above research questions represent where our paper seeks to contribute to the existing literature. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. We start in Sect. 2 with the description of the data and methods set used in our study. In Sect. 3, we focus on the empirical analysis and summarize our results. Section 4 concludes.",2

Many projects have already financed themselves by selling blockchain-based digital tokens that represent some form of (future) value, and many ICO investors have already made a fortune or total loss. One of the main reasons for the success of ICOs is the fact that tokens can be traded on secondary markets as soon as a cryptocurrency exchange agrees to list them. A special feature of cryptocurrency markets is that there is virtually no order routing through brokers; instead, the assets are traded on a large number of different exchanges, each of which has its own specific characteristics and user base. It is not uncommon for ICO tokens to be successively cross-listed on multiple exchanges, which means that cross-listing events occur more frequently for tokens than for stocks. One speaks of a cross-listing when an asset, which is already tradable on at least one secondary market, is listed on another secondary market—in the case of ICOs tokens cryptocurrency exchanges. Accordingly, cross-listings never represent the first opportunity but a further option to trade an asset. For stock markets, market segmentation, market liquidity, information disclosure and investor protection have been identified as reasons for cross-listings (Roosenboom and Dijk 2009). Yet stock markets are different from cryptocurrency markets. For example, cryptocurrencies are traded 24/7, and they are but decentralized computer protocol that in theory any exchange can list without the consent of the project itself. Some cryptocurrency exchanges are fully centralized and resemble stock exchanges, while other, decentralized exchanges solely operate as computer code on a blockchain infrastructure, allowing the users to trade peer-to-peer with each other (Warren and Bandeali 2017). The level of regulation and transparency also differs across exchanges. Some of them manipulate or inflate their own markets in order to signal liquidity to potential users and projects and to thereby earn more trading and listing fees (Alameda Research 2019; Bitwise Asset Management 2019). The effects of cross-listings are a rather new research field for the cryptocurrency sector. To our knowledge, two studies have specifically analyzed such effects, but so far no study has focused solely on ICOs. Benedetti (2019) finds positive listing returns for a sample of 3,625 tokens on 108 exchanges and identifies an increase in trading volume and characteristics like on-blockchain transfer volumes of Ethereum-based tokens. Ante (2019) analyzes 327 cross-listings on 22 exchanges and finds abnormal returns of 5.7% on the listing day and 9.2% over a 7-day event window around the listing. The study also finds significant differences between individual exchanges, as well as evidence of informed trading. For initial listing effects of ICOs, Benedetti and Kostovetsky (2018) find significant underpricing in a sample of ICOs, with abnormal buy-and-hold returns of 48% within the first 30 trading days, while Momtaz (2019a) finds average underpricing of 8.2% in ICO campaigns over $1 million. Furthermore, Momtaz (2019b) identifies an average abnormal return of 14.8% on digital currencies within the first trading day after their initial exchange listing. The returns are also driven by key figures like liquidity and market capitalization. This is the first cross-listing study to focus on ICO tokens. The goal of this article is to provide a fundamental scientific basis for cross-listing effects of ICO tokens. It shall be identified if cross-listings represent positive market (quality) signals, similar to traditional markets, which are expressed by abnormal returns. We aim to explore how ICO tokens perform in exchange cross-listings and whether specific cryptocurrency exchanges or liquidity-related characteristics—in line with signaling theory (Spence 1973)—have any effects on listing returns. This can help to better understand the efficiency of ICO token markets and to derive corresponding implications for theory (i.e., academic research) and practice (i.e., crypto market participants). To this end, we subject a data set of 250 listing events of 135 different cryptocurrencies issued through ICOs to an event study of abnormal returns. Potential effects of individual exchanges are tested through sub-samples, and we build regression models of abnormal returns to test for any effects of liquidity metrics. The ICO phenomenon can be contemplated from various angles, such as the perspective of projects seeking funding (Ante et al. 2018), investors looking for financial return (Fisch & Momtaz 2020), society benefiting from a new source of finance for start-ups (Fisch et al. 2020), or specific industry players, such as cryptocurrency exchanges (Benedetti 2019). Most of the existing studies assume the perspective of projects, investigating the determinants of success. The present study mostly focuses on the perspective of investors, whom listing returns may afford considerable (short-term) gains. However, the analysis may also be of interest to all other involved parties: (1) The projects can better understand what investors and the market look for and how to respond to investor expectations; (2) regulators may learn whether specific areas of the market require intervention, for instance if listings are preceded by significant returns, which could indicate market manipulation; (3) cryptocurrency exchanges may be able to identify ‘promising’ projects to list; and (4) society and regulators can improve their understanding of the market for ICOs and assess its (in)efficiency. In following section, three hypotheses are derived on the basis of literature. We will provide an overview of cross-listings, where stock markets have received much more research attention than cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based financing such as ICOs. In addition, special characteristics of the market for ICO tokens, cryptocurrency exchanges and liquidity metrics, to which explicit hypotheses refer, are explained. The review of the literature also informs our selection of variables. Section 3 describes the data set and methods while Sect. 4 is dedicated to some descriptive statistics. Section 5 presents the empirical findings, relating first to the general market effects of listing events and then to individual crypto exchanges and market characteristics. Leading up to a brief conclusion, Sect. 6 offers a discussion of the results, some limitations of the paper, implications and avenues for future research.",5

Particularly, the severe development of climate-related factors, such as drought caused by heat waves, has direct impact on planting and harvesting conditions of agricultural commodities. Such drastic and unpredictable changes are further reflected in the price development of agricultural commodity derivatives. The crucial role of external factorsFootnote 1 has been already recognized in early research on price modeling and forecasting of these derivatives. Based on several fundamentals such as stock inventories, temperature, production levels and export demand Chatrath et al. (2002); Geman and Nguyen (2005), and Hayenga et al. (1997) analyze the relation of these factors to the price development of derivatives. Furthermore, there exists a vast number of research that examines the role of reports from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) as being a price-driving factor themselves for a broad range of agricultural commodities. Starting from the literature in earlier years (Garcia et al. 1997; Summer and Mueller 1989) to recent work based on the current economic situation, Boudoukh et al. (2007); Karali (2012), and Karali et al. (2019) verify that these reports still represent an important source of information for the price formation of these commodities. In a more general setting, Broll and Eckwert (2008) model fundamentals as observable realizations of a random variable that are assumed to be correlated with the development of futures prices in a commodity market and thus have an impact on them. Mathematical and statistical methods which establish the relation between fundamentals and the development of commodity prices include the formulation of stochastic price processes (Geman and Nguyen 2005; Haug 2021; Schwartz 1997; Zhu et al. 2009) as well as the construction of time series models (Garcia et al. 1997; Karali et al. 2019). More advanced stochastic models have been developed in the scope of electricity price modeling, where Benth and Meyer-Brandis (2009), Hess (2012) and Hess (2020) model fundamentals such as carbon dioxide emission costs and temperature by stochastic processes of Ornstein–Uhlenbeck type, among others. Also in the domain of electricity price modeling and forecasting, more complex statistical models can be found, where ARX-type time series are widely used in applications (Kristiansen 2012; Nogales and Conejo 2006; Weron and Misiorek 2008). However, due to the nonlinear relation between price-driving factors and the price process, linear time series models are not able to fully capture the complex relations. For this purpose, hybrid approaches that combine classical statistical models with methods of machine learning have been developed and have recently gained attention in research pertaining to different markets. Besides the application of more sophisticated machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks (ANN) (Fan et al. 2007; González et al. 2005; Niu et al. 2010), simpler methods are as popular as their more complex counterparts. Indeed, a comparison of ANNs and support vector machines (SVM) in Sansom et al. (2003) shows better performance of SVMs in the context of electricity price forecasting. Further analysis of hybrid models, also in the scope of electricity price modeling and forecasting, can be found in Che and Wang (2010), which combines SVMs with standard (linear) time series models. With a focus on metal commodities and under consideration of price-driving factors, Kristjanpoller and Hernández (2017) analyze the performance of ANNs in combination with a GARCH model for forecasting price volatility. Finally, the use of machine learning methods as a stand-alone tool for price modeling and forecasting tasks for different markets has also been analyzed in the literature. In the context of electricity markets Fan et al. (2007) and Niu et al. (2010) introduce a two-stage machine learning approach in order to obtain short-term forecasts of day ahead electricity prices. In particular, different methods of supervised and unsupervised learning are combined in order to obtain direct price forecasts as outputs of the learning process. We propose a two-step hybrid model that combines a well-established theoretical price model for agricultural commodities with the strengths machine learning methods offer. Based on historical data on futures prices and a selection of their price-driving factors, our approach allows for a characterization of different price behavior and development into different price states. To make this more precise we explain its three major components as given in Fig. 1:  In the first step we apply a clustering algorithm to historical futures price data to identify K price states of commodity futures, see block \(\textcircled {1}\) in Fig. 1. Specifically, we apply the K-means algorithm to historical futures log returns for the identification of states of log returns.Footnote 2 The clustering results then serve as input data for the subsequent classification and calibration tasks. In the second component we link a selection of external factors to the commodity price states by using a classification algorithm that assigns each set of values of the external factors to a commodity price state, see block \(\textcircled {2}\) in Fig. 1. More precisely, we use the identified prices states from block \(\textcircled {1}\) as classes on historical data of the external factors for the training of the classification algorithm. As it is often much easier to forecast the values of the external factors, we use their forecasts as input to the selected classification model to predict the corresponding commodity price states. In our analysis we consider the two classification algorithms K-nearest neighbors (K-nn) and random forests (RF) with external data on weather and supply and demand data on corn cultivation as external factors. In the third component, for each cluster we calibrate the parameters needed as input for the valuation formula of Sørensen (2002) for futures prices. We use the clustering results from block \(\textcircled {1}\) for the state-dependent calibration of the model parameters given by an approximate version of the stochastic price model, see block \(\textcircled {3}\) in Fig. 1. Finally, we combine the classification and calibration results for a Monte Carlo simulation of futures prices based on the predicted price states, see block \(\textcircled {4}\) in Fig. 1. These simulated prices can also be utilized for further scenario analysis and computation of risk measures in risk controlling units of agricultural commodity businesses, which, however, is beyond the scope of this paper. The main benefit of hybrid models that combine stochastic modeling with machine learning methods lies in the incorporation of mathematical interpretability and domain knowledge into a data-driven approach. Moreover, the two-step approach allows for exploiting the strengths of supervised and unsupervised techniques in detecting nonlinear relationships between agricultural commodity prices and their driving factors. Hybrid models were considered in Kristjanpoller and Hernández (2017) and two-step machine learning approaches were used in Fan et al. (2007), and Niu et al. (2010). However, in the literature we did not find an approach applying clustering and classification in combination with external factors for price modeling as proposed by us. Our work is organized as follows: We describe the hybrid and machine learning-based price state prediction model (ML price model) in detail in Sect. 2. A description of futures price data and the price-relevant factors is given in Sect. 3. The application of our model to real corn futures data and its empirical and simulation results are presented in Sect. 4. A summary of our main results concludes the final section.",6

Historically, Long (1990) was the first who observed that one can rewrite the risk neutral pricing formula as a conditional expectation under the real-world probability measure where the so-called numéraire portfolio (NP) acts as numéraire. The benchmark approach postulates only the existence of the NP and no longer relies on the rather restrictive classical no-arbitrage assumptions, which are equivalent to the existence of an equivalent risk neutral probability measure. Under this much weaker assumption, one can still perform all essential tasks of valuation and risk management. The only condition imposed is that the NP, which is in the long run the pathwise best performing portfolio, remains finite in finite time. Obviously, when this assumption is violated for a model, then some economically meaningful arbitrage must exist, causing the candidate for the NP to explode. In this case, the respective model makes not much theoretical and practical sense. Note that, when a finite NP exists, various forms of classical arbitrage may be present in the market; see, e.g., Loewenstein and Willard (2000) and Heston et al. (2007) for various examples in the literature on bubbles.
 The current paper illustrates the divergence of the benchmark approach from the classical approach by focusing on the currency market, which is one of the most active markets. We present and calibrate a hybrid model describing the dynamics of a vector of foreign exchange (FX) rates and the associated interest rates. We extend and unify the FX multifactor stochastic volatility models of De Col et al. (2013) and Baldeaux et al. (2015) by means of the general transform formula presented in Grasselli (2017). The resulting general model that we develop allows for the simultaneous presence of multiple stochastic volatility factors both of square root (see Heston 1993) and 3/2 type (see Heston 1997; Platen 1997). More explicitly, the square root of each CIR factor appears in both the numerator and the denominator of the diffusion terms. Based on Grasselli (2017), we refer to this model as the 4/2 model. Our specification for the volatility process spans a large class of dynamics ranging from the 3/2 to the Heston model. This means that we can let market data dictate the relative importance of the two stochastic volatility effects that we consider. While the 4/2 model might appear as an involved choice, we will show in Sect. 3.3 that it naturally emerges, e.g., in a simple Heston setting for a suitable choice of the risk premium. Moreover, such CIR factors can be freely combined in order to drive stochastic interest rates. Therefore, the model is suitable for the valuation of long-dated FX products, for which interest rate risk becomes a relevant risk factor, see the discussions in Gnoatto and Grasselli (2014). The framework we propose is general to the extent that for suitable parameter combinations our model may not admit the existence of an equivalent risk neutral probability measure for some economies. In spite of this feature, the problem of pricing and hedging contingent claims can always be solved under the more general benchmark approach of Platen and Heath (2010), with in addition the possibility to apply benchmarked risk minimization for hedging, as developed, e.g., in Du and Platen (2016). Despite the richness of our framework, it is possible to efficiently solve and implement the pricing of plain vanilla instruments via Fourier-based techniques, see Carr and Madan (1999) and Lewis (2001). Semi-analytical closed form solutions for products such as European FX options can be computed thanks to the availability of the exact formula for the joint Fourier transform of the model’s state variables, see Grasselli (2017). The flexibility of the 4/2 model has also been exploited in recent contributions of Detemple and Kitapbayev (2018) and Cheng et al. (2019). We test our model on real datasets of vanilla FX options by performing several calibration experiments. Our empirical results are twofold. On the one side, we confirm the empirical findings of Baldeaux et al. (2015) on the violation of the risk neutral pricing paradigm. The appearance of such violations may change over time and across currencies. In fact, our multiple calibration experiment seems to suggest the presence of regime switches in traded FX-option prices between the standard risk neutral and the real-world pricing approach. Such a feature calls for a modeling framework which is able to span both valuation principles, which is provided by the benchmark approach. The paper is structured as follows: In Sect. 2, we introduce the general multi-currency modeling framework and recall some notions from the benchmark approach. Section 3 motivates and formally introduces the 4/2 model as a unifying framework for stochastic volatility models driven by the CIR process as the Heston-based model of De Col et al. (2013) and the 3/2-based model of Baldeaux et al. (2015). The 4/2 model extends the Heston model and allows for the possibility of a failure of the risk neutral paradigm. The analytical tractability of the 4/2 model is demonstrated in Sect. 4, which constitutes a prerequisite for an efficient model calibration, presented in Sect. 5. Section 6 concludes, while we gather in the appendix the proofs.",3

Kountzakis,Damiano Rossello,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Coherent measures of risk for processes as introduced in Cheridito et al. (2004) generalize the well-developed point-in-time framework for quantifying market risk. The main idea is to define a mapping acting on suitable spaces of stochastic processes modelling possible realizations of cash flow over a finite time horizon. Practically, the need of such risk measure may be attributed to regulatory institutions who want to compute the numerical value of losses potentially incurred at any time of a trading horizon. Indeed, since the early 1990s, the point-in-time value at risk, defined as quantile of a profit and loss probability distribution at the end of a fixed trading horizon, has been a widely used quantitative measure of market risk for regulatory purposes (cf. Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 2006 and Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 2019). But major deficiencies of this risk measure are well known: firstly, the actual size of losses is ignored; secondly it is not subadditive, then violating the axiomatic definition of coherence in the sense of Artzner et al. (1999); lastly, it does not account for the whole magnitude of potential losses within a trading horizon. The first two items have been addressed by introducing the expected shortfall risk measure, which is coherent and sensitive to the tail of the profit and loss distribution (see Artzner et al. 1999; Acerbi and Tasche 2002; Rockafeller and Uryasev 2002). Moreover, the recent market risk framework of the Basel Accords admits the expected shortfall as an adequate risk measure because of its ability in providing sufficiently conservative risk estimates. This and a constant demand for quantitative measures which depends on all extremes in a trading horizon push forward the recent academic contributions on the subject. In particular, considering the running minimum of a profit and loss process and applying the point-in-time definition of value at risk to the resulting real-valued distribution have been recently studied in Bhattacharyya et al. (2009), Bakshi and Panayotov (2010), Boudoukh et al. (2004) and termed as intra-horizon risk. Other directions have been explored for example by Goldberg and Mahmoud (2017) where intra-horizon risk measures are in connection with the well-known maximum drawdown. However, all these risk measures are not coherent in the sense of Cheridito et al. (2004). A possible remedy to the lack of coherence has been recently studied in Farkas et al. (2020), replacing the point-in-time expected shortfall to the distribution of the profit and loss’s running minimum. Along the lines of the above theoretical and practical issues, the current article describes the duality \(\langle \mathscr {R}^{\infty },\mathscr {A}^1 \rangle ,\) and in general the transfer of the \(L^p\)-duality to spaces of stochastic processes through the dual pairs \(\langle \mathscr {R}^{p},\mathscr {A}^q \rangle ,\) for conjugate exponents \(p,q \in [0, +\infty ].\) The set \(\mathscr {R}^{p}\) for \(p \in [1, +\infty ]\) contains càdlàg processes satisfying a moment condition concerning the running maximum of the reflected process, see Sect. 2. In particular, the set \(\mathscr {R}^{\infty }\) contains bounded càdlàg processes, while \(a \in \mathscr {A}^1\) are bi-variate stochastic processes acting as integrators in the bi-linear form \(\langle X, a \rangle ,\) see Cheridito et al. (2004) and Sect. 2. The proper choice of \(a \in \mathscr {A}^1\) gives raise to interesting examples of risk measurement for processes, see (Cheridito et al. 2004, Section 5). The space \(\mathscr {A}^q\) generalizes to the case \(q>1\) for conjugate exponents \(p^{-1}+q^{-1}=1,\) and contains bi-variate processes satisfying a moment condition concerning the variation of both components, see again Sect. 2. In view of all these premises, the purpose of our paper is twofold: Given two Orlicz spaces of stochastic processes \(\mathscr {R}^{\varPhi },\mathscr {A}^{\varPsi },\) with corresponding conjugate Young functions \(\varPhi ,\varPsi ,\) we define Orlicz duality by the dual pair \(\langle \mathscr {R}^{\varPhi },\mathscr {A}^{\varPsi } \rangle ;\) We define convex and coherent monetary risk measures on these spaces and then provide their representation accordingly. For the coherent case, we additionally provide a representation result for special classes of financial performance measures. The reason for using Orlicz spaces in finance, and more specifically in risk analysis, is highlighted if we recall the set-inclusion scheme as provided, for example, by (Cheridito and Li 2009, Example 4.1.3): for any \(p \in (1 ,\infty )\) and every \(\lambda >0,\) where \(\varPhi (x)=\text {e}^{\lambda \, x} -1\) induces the Orlicz norm \(\Vert \,\cdot \,\Vert _{\varPhi }\) and similarly induces the Orlicz norm \(\Vert \,\cdot \,\Vert _{\varPsi }.\) The families \(L^{\varPhi }\) and \(L^{\varPsi }\) contain those random variables describing discounted future net worth for which \(\Vert \,\cdot \,\Vert _{\varPhi }\) and \(\Vert \,\cdot \,\Vert _{\varPsi }\) are finite. Recall that \(L^{\varPsi }\) is an Orlicz space and \(M^{\varPhi }\) is the Orlicz heartFootnote 1 of the conjugate Orlicz space \(L^{\varPhi }.\) Since any Orlicz norm might be used to estimate the tail of a probability distribution, especially if based on exponential functions which give much more weight in the tails, the above set-inclusions imply that every random variable in \(L^1\) having finite Kullback–Leibler divergence (hence finite relative entropy) under different probability measures is a non-heavy tailed random variable. This also implies that the use of Orlicz duality far from \(L^p\) spaces has a specific risk-analytic meaning: The Young function \(\varPhi \) of the Orlicz heart \(M^{\varPhi }\) represents a ‘moment-function’, while the conjugate Young function \(\varPsi \) of the Orlicz space \(L^{\varPsi }\) can be interpreted as a risk functional. See “Appendix A” for a quick review of Orlicz spaces. In words, since models in finance and insurance as profits/losses at a terminal date or cumulative returns are better described by unbounded random variables and they can be derived by corresponding unbounded stochastic processes, our contribution is to define risk measures for processes whose paths are not necessarily bounded. To this scope, we use the dual pair \(\langle \mathscr {R}^{\varPhi },\mathscr {A}^{\varPsi } \rangle \) where in general the moment condition satisfied by processes belonging to \(\mathscr {R}^{\varPhi }\) is based on the Luxemburg norm \(\Vert \,\cdot \,\Vert _{\varPhi }\) and \(\mathscr {R}^{\varPhi }\) acts as an Orlicz heart modelling unbounded financial paths such that \(\mathscr {R}^{\infty } \subseteq \mathscr {R}^{\varPhi } \subset \mathscr {R}^{0}.\) We do not pursue the extension argument of Cheridito et al. (2006) from \(\mathscr {R}^{\infty }\) to \(\mathscr {R}^0.\) For the sake of completeness, notice that \(\mathscr {A}^{q} \subseteq \mathscr {A}^{\varPsi } \subseteq \mathscr {A}^{1}\) for conjugate exponents p, q (for the exact definition of \(\mathscr {A}^{\varPsi }\) see Sect. 2). The present article is organized as follows: Section 2 sets up the proper spaces of stochastic processes to work with. In particular, Sect. 2.1 adequately motivates our contribution with respect to that of Cheridito and Li (2009). In Sect. 3, risk measures on Orlicz spaces of stochastic processes are defined, and robust representation results are provided. Section 4 yields the connection between such risk measures and acceptability indices of performances for processes. The financial and mathematical duality is formally established, and a representation result is proved. Moreover, the differences between the current contribution and that of Cherny and Madan (2009) are pointed out. Section 5 contains some concluding remarks.",

A mathematical puzzle for market efficiency,June 2022,Michael Heinrich Baumann,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In the 1970s, the so-called market efficiency hypothesis was highly accepted (Fama 1965, 1970). Later on, it was criticized, yet also defended (Malkiel 1989, 2005). Much of the criticism concerned so-called predictable patterns. Also, the joint hypotheses problem has to be taken into account, which states that usually market efficiency and a market model have to be tested simultaneously (Jarrow and Larsson 2012). Further, statistical inefficiency and economical inefficiency must be distinguished. When external variables are used to construct a strategy with too high returns, it may be the case that these variables are just appropriate ratios for the risk. When introducing risk-adjusted returns, excess returns are no contradiction when they go hand in hand with excess risk. In this work, we present some results attacking the market efficiency hypothesis that do not have to deal with the joint hypothesis problem because no specific market model is assumed. The strategies under analysis neither use predictable patterns nor external variables, i.e., the typical defenses of the market efficiency hypothesis do not apply. By means of a mathematically rigorous proof, we show that the strategy contradicts the statistical efficiency of the market. A backtest with past market data also gives a strong evidence that the economical efficiency is contradicted. Risk adjustments and comparisons with other strategies do not solve the puzzle satisfactorily why it is possible to construct a market beating strategy when stochastically independent growth rates are assumed. The work at hand is technically based on a generalization of Baumann and Grüne (2017). The crucial difference to that work is that we allow for a time-varying trend (in contrast to a constant trend). This generalization does not only make the results more universal, but it constitutes the point that contradicts the efficient market hypothesis. The assumption used by Baumann and Grüne (2017) that there are assets with a constant nonzero trend (compared to the numéraire) seems to be rather unrealistic. In this work, we just assume a trend that is sometimes nonzero—and it does not matter whether the trend is positive or negative. Further, we give a closed-form formula for the gain’s variance and introduce a technique to discount older price information. Much of the discussion on market efficiency, technical trading, and beating the market follows the idea that a trader (i) has to find a predictable pattern, (ii) has to construct a trading strategy to exploit this pattern, and (iii) has to test this new strategy against randomly selected broad index buy-and-hold strategies (Malkiel 1973). However, a new strand of research—mainly in engineering sciences and mathematics—goes another way. In the view of the respective authors, task (i) can be skipped, allowing trading strategies to be constructed directly. These strategies usually are model free and use neither predictions of patterns nor estimations of parameters. In short and using the terminology of the control community: they are constructed to be robust against the price. Instead of task (iii), which relies on real market data, (performance) properties are proven mathematically. This way, the overfitting problem (cf. Bailey et al. 2014) is avoided. The results of this work do not rely on the momentum effect as they are more general in two ways: Firstly, the main results concerning control-based trading strategies are proven mathematically while for the performance of momentum strategies there is empirical evidence. Secondly, control-based trading rules can easily deal with a sign-changing trend.
 The paper is organized as follows: In Sect. 2, we briefly discuss the literature on efficient markets. In Sect. 3, the market setup as well as the trading strategies are explained and the relating literature is discussed. In Sect. 4, new results concerning special control-based trading rules, the so-called simultaneously long short (SLS) strategies, in a general market model with time-varying trends and volatilities are obtained (in detail, closed-form formulae for the expected gain and the gain’s variance). In addition, risk as well as a comparison to buy-and-hold strategies are discussed. To account for trading costs and bid-ask spreads—which are not considered in the analytical part of the work at hand—Sect. 5 is provided, in which we perform backtests on past market data using bid and ask prices. After that, in Sect. 6, the standard SLS rule is generalized to the so-called discounted SLS rule, in which old data has less influence on the strategy. Finally, in Sect. 7, we discuss the results—especially in view of the efficient market hypothesis—and conclude the paper.",3

But it is a well-documented fact that value-at-risk is not subadditive in general and hence it is not a coherent risk measure. Moreover it does not account for the size of losses beyond the threshold \(\alpha \), because quantiles hardly depend upon the frequency of tail losses and not on their values. On one hand, coherence is a good theoretical property satisfied instead by expected shortfall, see Artzner et al. (1999), that also accounts for extreme losses in the tail of the P &L distribution, as recognized by the recent market risk framework of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2019). On the other hand from the regulatory and statistical point of view, methodologies for testing the accuracy of a risk model are essential then value-at-risk is preferred. Expected shortfall requires a huge amount of data for accurate estimation, in fact it is not elicitable as pointed out for example by Gneiting (2011). A standard risk measure that is coherent and appropriate for backtesting is the mean, but it cannot capture tail risk. Expectiles have been receiving increasing attention as risk measures in mathematical finance and actuarial science since the contribution of Kuan et al. (2009). In fact expectiles are both coherent for a threshold level range and elicitable risk measures, see Bellini et al. (2014) and the references therein. From a statistical point of view, expectiles are the least square analogue of quantiles, both being M-functionalsFootnote 1 with asymmetric convex loss function, but the latter are not coherent as risk measures. There are other advantages of using expectiles as coherent risk measures: they rely on tail expectations rather than tail probabilities, thus they are sensitive to extreme losses (in contrast to quantiles) and may lead to more prudent and reactive risk management: altering the shape of extreme losses does impact the expectiles in contrast to value-at-risk. In addition, expectiles avoid the use of regularity conditions on the underlying distribution of losses. For a detailed account of all these aspects in connection with the problem of estimation of expectiles see for example Daouia et al. (2018) and Daouia et al. (2021). Moreover, numerical evidence found in Bellini and Di Bernardino (2017) is in favor of expectiles as a reasonable alternative to value-at-risk or expected shortfall, especially when using them in portfolio management based on the gain-loss ratio.
 Evaluating the performance of a financial trade is a crucial point for making informed choices among alternative investments. A popular guideline suggests that rational analysts and investors should select their portfolio according to a reward/risk criterion acting as a performance measure. Performance measurement is also a device to judge the quality of the value-added service provided by fund managers, when processing information not reflected by market prices. Needless to say, the classical Sharpe ratio is the prototypal of performance measures. Other indices have been proposed over the past four decades based on criticisms about the Sharpe ratio, concerning distributional assumptions needed for its compatibility with the mean-variance approach to portfolio selection, or the lack of consistency with arbitrage principles. Thus Bernardo and Ledoit (2000) proposed the alternative gain-loss ratio, beside Cherny and Madan (2009) elaborates on this and provides an axiomatic approach to frame performance indices meant to measure the largest nonnegative level at which the risk of loss is still acceptable. Following their approach, for a risky position X modelled by a bounded random variable, its index of acceptability is characterized as a performance measure satisfying four axioms: (increasing) monotonicity, quasi-concavity, scale invariance and Fatou property (see Sect. 3 below). Moreover, Cherny and Madan (2009) pointed out that such an index corresponds to a continuum of degrees of acceptability based on a system of acceptable bounded trades X, and Cherny and Madan (2009, Theorem 1) provides its representation through an associated system of scenarios that support the dual representation of corresponding coherent risks in such a way their expectations are positive accordingly. This is because a system of acceptable trades can be equivalently defined in term of an increasing family of coherent risk measures for which acceptability is typically given by their nonnegativity. The contribution of this article is structured as follows. First, we propose expectile-based performance measures as special cases of acceptability indices introduced by Cherny and Madan (2009) but which generalize the gain-loss ratio and the Omega ratio used in the finance industry, see Bellini et al. (2018) and the references therein. We characterize acceptability indices of performance using the dual representation of expectiles as coherent risk measures as studied in Bellini et al. (2014). To this end we additionally give a representation of performance measures for position modelled as random variables with finite expectation. Our expectile-based performance measure leads to a more general risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC) other than the gain-loss ratio or the Omega ratio, where the coherent risk measure is the expectile itself or the expectile-based analogue to the expected shortfall, as proposed by Daouia et al. (2020) and Daouia et al. (2021). Second, given the law-invariance of our expectile-based performance measure we also provide the corresponding Kusuoka representation. Moreover, we analyze the elicitability of the proposed performance index and highlight some practical aspects of choosing competing point forecasts. Third, we provide a conditional characterization of expectile-based performance indices whenever the coherent risk measure used is the conditional expectile as introduced by Bellini et al. (2018) as a generalization of the conditional mean. The outline of this article is as follows. Section 2 anticipates the definition of expectile-based performance ratio and highlights the advantage of using it from an economic point of view. Section 3 sets up the definition and properties of acceptability indices for financial positions with finite expectation, then delivers the representation of coherent acceptability indices. Section 4 presents a quick review of expectiles together with their use as coherent risk measure, and provides the representation of expectile-based acceptability indices. Section 5 provides two main examples of expectile-based performance ratios. Moreover, the connection of expectile-based acceptability indices with the Omega ratio as well as the gain-loss ratio is highlighted. Section 6 is on elicitability of the expectile-based acceptability index. Section 7 develops a conditional version of expectile-based acceptability indices. Section 8 contains some concluding remarks.",

In order to consider a realistic context that permits to achieve consistent risk estimates, the model has been developed in a market where the traded asset dynamics is characterized by stochastic interest rates since, as evidenced by Aas et al. (2018), the choice of an adequate interest rate model represents an additional key component in life insurance and financial evaluations. Under this perspective, the model allows to choose the most appropriate dynamics, among the ones widely used in finance and insurance, for both the interest rate and the underlying asset, by combining financial and demographic risk and embedding in the contract early exercise features. Pricing options when the underlying asset pays discrete dividends is a nontrivial problem that, in the financial literature, has been faced applying different techniques. Attempts working on European options have been provided by Merton (1973) and Beneder and Vorst (2001). An approximation for American options with a single dividend has been proposed, among others, by Black (1975) and, separately, by Roll (1977), Geske (1979) and Whaley (1981) (the well known Roll–Geske–Whaley method). Unfortunately, in some cases, both the Black and the Roll–Geske–Whaley methods underestimate the call option price. An alternative approach widely used to price both European and American-type options written on assets paying discrete dividends is represented by lattice-based methods. They can be easily applied to take into account single or multiple discrete dividends, even if computational problems arise due to the jumps at the dividend payment dates that cause the lack of the lattice recombining structure. To overcome this problem, Vellekoop and Nieuwenhuis (2006) present a modified Cox et al. (1979) tree (CRR hereafter) based on suitable integration techniques that are introduced at the dividend payment dates. Later, in Vellekoop and Nieuwenhuis (2011), the same authors derived an integral formula to deal, among others, with discrete dividends in a free-boundary problem framework. Dai (2009) introduces a new recombining tree structure, the stair tree, which uses extra nodes only when it needs to simulate the price jumps due to the dividend payments. Indeed, the stair tree follows the CRR tree structure between dividend dates while, for nodes at the dividend dates, trinomial branching schemes are devised to connect the two adjacent CRR tree structures. Finally, it is worth citing the recent work of Costabile et al. (2018), who propose a suitable construction of a tree with a reconnecting property. A computational problem, similar to the one encountered when evaluating financial options written on assets paying discrete dividends, may be faced in the procedures that use lattice-based methodologies to estimate the premiums of VA embedding a GMWB rider. In its classical form, such a rider returns to the policyholder the entire initial invested premium through periodical withdrawals during the policy lifetime regardless of the subaccount performance, plus the remaining subaccount value balance, if any, at maturity. As a consequence, the effect of the periodical withdrawals on the lattice structure used to discretize the subaccount value is similar to the effect of the paid dividends on the lattice discretizing the underlying asset, i.e., the lattice loses its recombining structure when the withdrawals are paid. Evaluation models for VA with GMWB have been proposed by many stems of the actuarial literature. For instance, when the policyholder receives a constant withdrawn amount at each withdrawal epoch, contributions have been developed both under the assumption of a constant interest rate by Milevsky and Posner (2001), and stochastic interest rate by Lin and Tan (2003), and Peng et al. (2012). On the other hand, when considering the more involved and challenging pricing problem that embeds a surrender option in the policy contract or, alternatively, gives the policyholder the possibility to optimally decide the amount to withdraw at each anniversary in order to maximize the current policy value, various contributions have been proposed by Milevsky and Salisbury (2006), Bauer et al. (2008), Dai et al. (2008), Chen and Forsyth (2008), Yang and Dai (2013), Luo and Shevchenko (2014), Hyndman and Wenger (2014), Bacinello et al. (2016), and Costabile et al. (2020). The main contribution of this paper is to provide a lattice-based evaluation method suitable to evaluate both European or American options written on assets paying discrete dividends during the option lifetime, and VAs characterized by GMWB riders even when the policy embeds a surrender option. The choice of a lattice methodology has been driven by its flexibility and ease of implementation that makes it very useful for practitioners. The proposed framework is quite general because it may accommodate a wide range of diffusions used in finance and insurance, both for the stochastic interest rate and for the underlying asset, by simply modifying the process parameters. The considered continuous time processes are approximated by means of recombining lattices, which work directly on the original processes. Indeed, the generated lattice values discretize only the diffusion part of the processes, while branching probabilities are computed to assure that the first and the second order local moments of the discrete distribution match the corresponding continuous-time ones, at least within the limit. The main feature of the proposed approach is relative to the fact that it does not make use of any preliminary transformation of the original processes to obtain the approximating recombining lattices. For instance, to support this assertion, we evidence that the straightforward application of the Cox and Rubinstein (1985) model to discretize the spot rate process, which is generally heteroskedastic, leads to a non-recombining bushy tree that makes the evaluation problem computationally unmanageable. As a consequence, to construct approximating recombining lattices, preliminary transformations of the original heteroskedastic processes have been proposed to obtain homoskedastic processes, as it happens in Nelson and Ramaswamy (1990). To sum up, our model is based on the construction of reconnecting lattices for the original processes bypassing such transformations. After discretizing the spot rate process, the algorithm works to discretize the dividend-paying underlying asset process in the case we want to evaluate an option, or the subaccount value in the case we want to evaluate a VA with GMWB. The discretization is still based on a recombining binomial lattice that is similar to the one used to approximate the interest rate dynamics but, in addition, presents a vector of representative values in correspondence with each node, generated by taking into account the payments of the dividends or withdrawals up to that node. Indeed, the main problem to face is relative to the fact that the jumps due to the payments of the dividends or withdrawals cause the loss of the recombining shape of the tree. Consequently, the number of trajectories connecting the root of the tree to a generic node grows up quickly when increasing the number of time steps. Since considering all the paths connecting the root to a generic node is computationally infeasible, we propose to select a pre-specified number of representative trajectories along which we compute the underlying asset or the subaccount values. The resulting two lattices are combined in order to establish a bivariate tree presenting four branches for each node. Joint probabilities are computed for the possible jumps in order to take into account the correlation between the two processes. As the model works on representative values, a linear interpolation technique is used when solving backward through the lattice to compute the option price or the VA present value in terms of the discounted payoffs over the bivariate lattice branches. The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, after presenting the continuous-time model, we establish the discretizing lattice for the interest rate and the underlying asset (when valuing an option) or the personal subaccount (when valuing a variable annuity), then introducing the resulting bivariate lattice. Section 3 concerns the application of the algorithm presented in Sect. 2 for the pricing of options written on assets paying discrete dividends and the valuation of VAs with GMWB riders. Section 4 presents some numerical results confirming the accuracy of the proposed model and provides some comparisons with the existing methods. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes the paper.",1

Peris,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Bankruptcy problems describe situations where a given amount of a perfectly divisible good, say money, has to be distributed among some agents according to their demands. The key issue of these problems is that there is not enough money to satisfy the demands by all the agents. Even though solutions for bankruptcy problems have been suggested throughout the ages, the seminal paper by O’Neill (1982) can be seen as the starting point of a large literature formally focusing on how bankruptcy problems should be solved when some fairness criteria have to be preserved. Among the many different solutions proposed along this literature, three of them have captured the attention of several academics. These solutions share a common feature, namely all of them try to equalize the agents’ perception of how they are treated. The proportional solution, attributed to Aristotle, is designed to equalize the agents’ relative award. The Constrained Equal Awards solution (Maimonides 1180) is designed to equalize the agents’ absolute award. Lastly, the Constrained Equal Losses solution (Maimonides 1180) is built to equalize the agents’ absolute unfulfilled demand. For the sake of completeness, we also mention that the proportional solution equalizes the agents’ relative unfulfilled demand. The two (Constrained Equal) solutions proposed by Maimonides (1180) have been very relevant to build some alternative ‘hybrid’ solutions as the Talmud (Aumann and Maschler 1985), the Piniles’ (Piniles 1861), or the \(\alpha _{\min }\) (Giménez-Gómez and Peris 2014) solutions, among others.Footnote 1 Our aim in this paper is to delve into the knowledge of how the dual proposals by Maimonides work. To this matter, we propose an expression that lightens the computations needed to get these solutions. Our approach is also useful to better understanding the conflict of interest between agents with a low demand (that prefer to equalize awards) and those with a large demand (that prefer to equalize unfulfilled demands). To be precise, for any given problem, when exploring the opinion of each agent about two different solutions, we can consider two groups of agents: those that prefer the proposal of the first solution and the ones preferring the distribution associated with the second solution. When the two solutions are dual (Aumann and Maschler 1985), this analysis becomes simpler because there is an agent, which we identify as the ‘central claimant,’ exhibiting the following property: agents whose demand does not exceed that of the central claimant prefer one of the solutions, while the alternative solution is (weakly) preferred by agents whose demand exceeds that of the central claimant. The Constrained Equal Awards solution is characterized by a ‘common award’ parameter, usually denoted by \(\lambda \), that each agent receives unless his demand is lower than this amount, in which case he receives his claim in full. Similarly, the Constrained Equal Losses solution is characterized by a ‘common loss’ parameter, usually denoted by \(\mu \), that each agent discounts from his demand, unless it is lower than \(\mu \), in which case he receives no amount. We explore the relationship between these two equalizing parameters, and we find that for each given problem, it is mainly conditioned by the relative degree of conflict (Alcalde and Peris 2022): the ratio between the aggregate unfulfilled demand and the aggregate demand. Our results clarify the relationship between the characteristic values \(\lambda \) and \(\mu \) defining these solutions, and the agents associated with these parameters: the first agent obtaining exactly the uniform award \(\lambda \), or the first agent exactly incurring in the uniform loss \(\mu \). These results are useful to better understanding these classical solutions and also to define new solutions combining them. It is also remarkable that the central claimant is precisely the agent with the lowest demand exceeding the value \(\lambda + \mu \). The remaining of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the main definitions. Section 3 contains our main results. Section 4 analyzes who is the central claimant in a bankruptcy problem. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes by introducing a new solution, the Consensus-Weighted solution, that combines the two constrained equal solutions according to their ‘relative popularity.’",

For more complete descriptions and presentations, Readers are addressed, e.g., to Nurmi (1999), Gehrlein and Lepelley (2017), Montes et al. (2020), Stearns (1959) and bibliography cited therein. We think of a system of possible elections, based on a fixed set of potential candidates, labeled as 1, 2, ..., m, and on a fixed set of voters, \(v_{1},v_{2},...,v_{n}\). Denote by \(\left[ m\right] \equiv \{1,2,...,m\}\) the set of candidates and by V \(\equiv \{v_{1},v_{2},...,v_{n}\}\) the set of voters. Each voter is supposed to cast one and only one vote, at any election. On the other hand different elections can be considered, respectively, characterized by the different subsets \(A\subseteq \left[ m\right] \) of participating candidates. The differences among elections’ outcomes, encountered at varying the subsets of candidates, are just at the core of the questions considered here. Concerning the mechanism determining the vote of the single voter \(v_{l}\) (\(v_{l}\in V,l=1,...,n\)) in any of such elections, it is assumed that the individual preferences, among candidates, of \(v_{l}\) are complete, transitive, and also antisymmetric, coherently with the assumption that indifference is not allowed between any two candidates. Thus, individual preferences give rise to a linear preference ranking. In other words the preference ranking of \(v_{l}\) is described by a permutation \(r_{l}\) over the set [m]. Such a permutation is to be viewed as a piece of a-priori information, established independently of the special subsets of candidates which will be encountered in the elections. Thus, in an election characterized by a subset \(A\subseteq \left[ m\right] \) of candidates, the vote expressed by \(v_{l}\) is definitely addressed to the one who is the preferred candidate among the elements of A, according to the permutation \(r_{l}\), for \(l=1,...,n\). As a further feature of our work, we concentrate attention on objects of the following type. For any subset \(A\subseteq \left[ m\right] \) (A containing two or more elements of \(\left[ m\right] \)), we fix an arbitrary ranking among the elements of A. Then we consider the collection \(\varvec{\sigma }\) of all such rankings, obtained by browsing all the subsets A. Such a collection gives rise to the notion of ranking pattern (see Definition 2 in the next section) which extends the one of majority graph, or preference pattern. Coming back to the above scenario of Voting Theory, we now remind the notion of voting situation. On this purpose we look at the collective of all the n voters and denote by \(N^{(m)}(j_{1},\ldots ,j_{m})\) the number of the voters who share the same linear preference ranking \(\left( j_{1},\ldots ,j_{m}\right) \), where \(j_{1}\) is the most preferred candidate and \(j_{m}\) is the least preferred one. The family of numbers \({\mathcal {N}}^{(m)}\equiv \{N^{(m)}(j_{1},\ldots ,j_{m})\}\), is typically referred to as the voting situation. Maintaining the assumption that, for any \(A\subseteq \left[ m\right] \), any voter casts a single vote addressed to the preferred candidate in A, and comparing the numbers of votes so obtained by any single candidate \(j\in A\), a voting situation \({\mathcal {N}}^{(m)}\) determines a corresponding ranking pattern \(\varvec{\sigma }\), that will be termed ranking pattern q-concordant with \({\mathcal {N}}^{(m)}\) (see Definition 2 in the next section). The problems solved in this paper can be simply formulated as follow: Fixed, for given m, an arbitrary ranking pattern \(\varvec{\sigma }\) on the subsets of \(\left[ m\right] \), can we guarantee the existence of some q-concordant voting situations \({\mathcal {N}}^{(m)}\)? If so, is it possible to construct at least one of such \({\mathcal {N}}^{(m)}\)? What can be said about the number of voters needed to realize such an \({\mathcal {N}}^{(m)}\)? The above questions can be connected to the literature about the paradoxes studied in the voting theory. An arbitrary ranking pattern may exhibit several types of surprising behavior. In particular one can observe different forms of Condorcet-type paradoxes. It is well known that the latter topic is related to non-transitivity of collective voting outcomes and is one of the starting points of voting theory. The literature related to voting paradoxes has a long history (see e.g. Alon 2002; Fishburn 1981; Mala 1999; Saari 1989, 1995, 2018a). Along such literature a very wide catalogue of, more or less complex, special cases has been thoroughly analyzed to show the possibility of different types of paradoxes. In particular, important contributions have arisen as direct extensions of the original Condorcet observation which shows the possibility of the phenomenon of non-transitivity, in the presence of three candidates. Considering the case of an arbitrary number m of candidates, the basic result by McGarvey shows, for any preference pattern, the existence of a voting situation triggering that pattern. Also the mathematical results by Saari can be seen as extensions on the same line of the McGarvey’s theorem in McGarvey (1953). Several other important contributions in the same direction have been given in more recent times. See e.g. Nurmi (1999), Saari (2018b), Mala (1999) and references therein. As also well known a somehow different literature, starting from the controversy between Borda and Condorcet, is concerned with the comparison among voting systems and, on the basis of a fixed voting situation, with different definitions of the election winners. See e.g. Fishburn (1981), Nurmi (1999), Perez-Fernandez and De Baets (2019), Klamler (2005), Van Newenhizen (1992) and references cited therein. Other parts of the literature have been devoted to analyzing the probability that paradoxes can manifest, in the case of random voting situations and under different stochastic models (see e.g. Kalai 2004; Hazla et al. 2020). Following the same direction of Condorcet, McGarvey, Saari, our results actually lead to conclusions very similar to those of the results given by the latter Author. They are however constructive and provide some quantitative information about the number of voters needed to constructing concordant voting situations. Within the family of all the ranking pattern, we distinguish the subclass of strict ranking patterns. In such particular case our solutions can be presented in closed forms. In De Santis and Spizzichino (2023), the definition was given of ranking pattern p-concordant with a multivariate survival model and it has been proven that, for any strict ranking pattern, there exist p-concordant survival models (see Theorem 2 in De Santis and Spizzichino (2023), recalled here as Theorem 7 in “Appendix”). Starting from this result, here we prove the existence of q-concordant voting situations for any (strict or weak) ranking pattern (Theorems 1, 2). Results proven here, however, also allow us to solve a problem that was left open in the paper (De Santis and Spizzichino 2023). In fact, concerning with weak ranking patterns, Theorem 2 leads to a general existence result about p-concordant voting situations (Corollary 1). Such a generalization of the results presented in De Santis and Spizzichino (2023) would not be smooth without the passage through the logic and the language of voting theory. More precisely, the plan of the paper is as follows. In Sect. 2, we recall notation, definitions, and preliminary results. In particular, we recall the definition of ranking pattern p-concordant with a probability model for a m-tuple of random variables. Based on this material we detail the identity between the considered voting-theory scenario and the study of probability distributions, induced by the m-tuples of random variables, over the space of the permutations of the elements of \(\left[ m\right] \) (Proposition 2). Section 3 is devoted to presenting results concerning the construction of q-concordant voting situations. By exploiting and extending results presented in De Santis and Spizzichino (2023), we in particular single out a method to construct voting situations concordant with weak ranking patterns, by starting from voting situations concordant with strict ranking patterns (see Theorem 2). Distinguishing between the two cases of strict and weak ranking patterns, the issue of possible values of the number of voters required for obtaining q-concordant voting situations is studied in Sect. 4. We in particular exhibit a universal value \(\overline{\theta }_{m}\) (depending on m, the total number of candidates) such that, for an arbitrary strict ranking pattern \(\varvec{\sigma }\), a q-concordant voting situation exists and can be produced with \(\overline{\theta }_{m}\) voters. Such a voting situation can be constructed explicitly (Theorems 4, 5). In Sect. 5 we present a discussion based on some concluding remarks. For the sake of self-consistency, in the Appendix we review definitions and main results on load-sharing models, which have been used in De Santis and Spizzichino (2023) for the construction of survival models p-concordant with strict ranking patterns.",
