Both emphasized periodicity in economic activity whereas most earlier writers interpreted interruptions to growth as random financial crises. Jevons work was largely concentrated on English experience and had an idiosyncratic emphasis on the influence of sun-spots (1). Juglar’s analysis was comparative. He concluded that cycles were roughly synchronous in France, the UK, and USA. The evidence he assembled related mainly to monetary phenomena-expansions or contractions in central bank activity, rates of interest, prices of key commodities, etc., plus narrative ‘business annals’. It is frequently asserted that Juglar found cycles of a characteristic length of 9 years, but this is not in fact true. His cycles for France averaged 7 years with a range from 3 to 18 years, and for the UK 6 years with a range from 2 to 10 years. For several decades the quantitative indicators available to cyclical analysts were similar to those used by Juglar, though they were later augmented to include price indices, data on output and foreign trade. A more sophisticated causal analysis (under-consumptionist) was also developed by the Russian economist Mikhail Tugan-Baranowsky (1894, 1865–1919) in 1894 in his analysis of cycles in the UK. In the 1920s, institutes were set up in several countries to measure and interpret variations in current economic activity, in historical perspective. These included the Conjuncture Institute in Moscow and the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) in New York, both set up in 1920. The London and Cambridge Economic Service started its Monthly Bulletin in 1923. In 1925, Ernst Wagemann, the President of the German Statistical Office, set up an officially financed Institut fur Konjunkturforschung in Berlin, with a staff of 50, to brief decision-makers in the public and private sectors with an up-to-date analysis of the economic situation (see Tooze 1999). In 1933 it became the Deutsches Institut fűr Wirtschaftsforschung. The Institute of Statistics in the Sorbonne in Paris, the Institutes of Statistics in the Universities of Rome and Padua presided by Corrado Gini, and the League of Nations Committee of Experts on Economic Barometers started work in 1926. The Osterreichisches Institut fur Konjuncturforschung, directed by Friedrich von Hayek, started in Vienna in 1927 (see Mitchell 1927, pp 201–202). At this time, most of these countries did not have national accounts (except Germany, where they were initiated in 1929 and the USA from 1934), so their basic analytical tools were not macro-measures of output, expenditure and income but miscellaneous indicators of prices, financial transactions, commercial activity, output of various agricultural, mining and manufacturing products. They concentrated on business activity and generally ignored the role of government. The heterogeneity of their indicators was a substantial problem in measuring cross-country synchronicity of business cycle movements. The ultimate refinement in this type of business cycle analysis was the massive effort of the NBER, under the successive leadership of Wesley Mitchell (1874–1948), and Arthur Burns (1904–1987). The first phase of their research was preparation (a) of a huge databank of statistical indicators and charts on production, construction, transport and communication, wholesale, retail and foreign trade, wages and employment, currency, banking and financial transactions (see Mitchell 1927), and (b) narrative chronologies of past cycles (business annals). The annals were compiled by Willard Thorp (1926), in liaison with associates in other countries, including von Hayek, Aftalion, R. Kuczinski, and Kondratieff; they provided a cyclical periodisation for 17 countries; for the UK and USA back to 1790, for other countries to the mid-nineteenth century. With this material, NBER developed a series of ‘reference cycles’ for four countries (France, Germany, Great Britain, and the USA) based mainly on monthly quantitative data, which started in 1854 for the last two countries, in 1865 for France, and 1879 for Germany. The number of monthly or quarterly series for the USA was 19 for 1860 rising to 811 in 1942 (plus 161 annual indicators). The monthly and quarterly series were seasonally adjusted. For the three European countries the number of indicators was much smaller. The NBER derived its ‘reference cycles’ by plotting most of the information on charts in de-seasonalized form, and, by iterative procedures of inspection, identifying the turning points of cycles by the size of clusters of roughly concurrent fluctuations (Burns and Mitchell 1947, pp 20:78–79, and 82). Thus its central concept of economic activity was a fuzzy cocktail rather than a clearly defined measure of aggregate economic activity. The main purpose was to develop sensitive warning indicators of turning points in business activity. These were classified as leading, coincident, or lagging. The reference cycle became part of the official statistical armoury of the USA for forecasting purposes, though it is now supplemented by the more sophisticated econometric models of aggregate activity (quarterly GDP). For the period 1857 to 1978 the NBER discerned 28 successive peak-to-trough movements for the United States, i.e. a recession on average every 4 years, with a variation in their incidence from two-and-a-half to nine-and-a-half years. For other countries the average duration was found to be longer: 53 months for France, 62 for the UK and 64 for Germany for prewar years. The NBER cycles were not adjusted to eliminate trend, so they were not measures of oscillation in economic activity. They registered recessions only when there was an absolute fall in the relevant indicators (2). The NBER technique of using monthly and rather volatile series picked up more cycles than a GDP index based on annual data, and the ‘reference cycles’ that did correspond with GDP movements did not always have exactly the same dates (3). The NBER approach is a useful tool in interpreting quantitative economic history, but a major problem is that it yields no satisfactory measure of the amplitude of fluctuations because of the difficulty of producing a meaningful summary measure from such heterogeneous data. Thus one cannot use the reference cycle itself to distinguish major and minor cycles, in the same way that one can with simpler measures of industrial output or GDP. Arthur Burns (1934), Production Trends in the United States since 1870 was an attempt to look at longer term ‘trend cycles’, based on annual movement (1870–1929) of commodity output indicators for 90 agricultural, mining and industrial items and 14 for transport and communications. It analysed patterns of growth and retardation for individual industries, but made no attempt to measure their aggregate movement. Although the bulk of NBER research in the 1920s was concentrated on business cycles, there was also a feeble effort to measure national income of the USA. Two studies were published in 1921, followed by Wilford King’s unimpressive National Income and its Purchasing Power in 1930, which contained no aggregate estimate nor any concept of what such an aggregate would be. In 1930 Mitchell asked Simon Kuznets to take over the work on national income. Kuznets migrated to the USA in 1922, after doing his undergraduate studies in Kharkov. He did his Columbia Ph.D. thesis on cyles under Mitchell in 1926 and worked in the Bureau in 1927–1929 on his post-doctoral monograph Secular Movements in Production and Prices (1930). It resembled other work in the Bureau in type of indicator, but Kuznets used only annual data, had somewhat wider country coverage, much more ambitious decomposition of time series, explored fluctuations over periods distinctly longer than business cycles, and his analytical approach was influenced by the Russian tradition. From 1930 onwards his professional interests were transformed. He blazed a new trail which he followed for the rest of his life, developing comprehensive measures of aggregate activity and economic growth, first for the United States, and then the rest of the world. He lost interest in the fuzzy cocktail of indicators that continued to be Burns’delight, though he continued his close association with the NBER, and was successful in persuading it to undertake important studies on economic growth which buttressed his own work (4).",9

The German mark collapsed in that summer, followed by runs on the British pound and the American dollar in early fall. The ensuing financial troubles turned a bad recession into the Great Depression. Several of the large Berlin banks found themselves in dire straits at the same time, leading the government to recapitalize some and guarantee deposits in others. The traditional view of the German crisis was taken from the preceding Austrian crisis: banking problems caused by over-extended lending brought down the currency. Other work, however, argues that the budgetary problems of the Weimar Republic brought down the German currency, and that the ensuing currency crisis brought down the banks. If banking problems initiated the crisis, then bankers are to blame; if the currency was key, politicians are the villains who caused the Great Depression. This paper reviews the literature on the German crisis and the evidence on which it rests. It concludes that the evidence reveals that politicians, not bankers, precipitated the 1931 German crisis. The issue is where instability arose in the international economy. It is clear that instability can come from many quarters, but we may be able to avoid crises if we understand better the origins of instability. It is natural in a time of crisis to blame bankers because they are at the center of modern economies. They also are well paid, and their claims that they are victims rather than perpetrators of economic ills are suspect. Nevertheless, we want to know if fixing the banking system will make the world economy more stable. Since the greatest peacetime economic crises were in the Great Depression, careful examination of these crises is warranted. The German crisis in the summer of 1931 was a key moment in the growing depression. It led to further currency crises and problems and to an ever-deepening crisis (Temin 1989; Eichengreen 1992, 2004). The German crisis was an important turning point in the depression, although economic policy would have had to change if the avoidance of crisis was to have a major impact (Eichengreen and Temin 2003). The interpretation of events in Berlin during the summer of 1931 therefore colors a view of the whole depression. Investigators may be motivated to present a particular view of the German crisis in order to support a view of depression as a whole. This paper reexamines the crisis in light of recent scholarship, surveying relevant general work on crises in the next section and turning to 1931 in succeeding sections.",26

Timmer,Gaaitzen J. de Vries,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Recent studies of economic growth have moved from explaining average trends in long-term growth to study the determinants of growth accelerations and growth decelerations, because of the great instability in growth rates within countries. Very few countries have experienced consistently high growth rates over long periods. Rather, the more typical pattern is that countries experience phases of growth, stagnation, or decline of varying length. A study of these separate periods seems more revealing for a study of the determinants of growth than a long-period average (Pritchett 2000). This raises the natural question which sectors in the economy contribute most to accelerations and decelerations in growth. For example, Jones and Olken (2008) suggest that employment reallocation to more productive sectors lies behind accelerations and decelerations of growth in many developing countries. Because of missing sectoral data, they are unable to test this hypothesis. In this paper, we provide empirical evidence on the significance of various sectors in generating aggregate productivity growth by introducing a novel shift-share analysis and by applying this method to a new sectoral database for 19 countries in Asia and Latin America, spanning the period from 1950 to 2005. Each sector can contribute to aggregate growth in two ways: by productivity growth within the sector (the within-effect) and by expanding its share in aggregate inputs (the between- or shift-effect). To measure these contributions we modify a standard tool in an economic historians’ tool-box: the shift-share analysis introduced by Fabricant (1942). The shift-share analysis is used in many studies to measure the contribution of structural change to aggregate growth. For example, it features prominently in the discussion about the extent of Britain’s decline relative to Germany and the US since the end of the nineteenth century (Broadberry 1998). Unfortunately, the interpretation of results from the traditional shift-share method is not straightforward [see for example the discussion between Broadberry and Crafts (2003) and Booth (2003)]. We propose two modifications to the traditional shift-share analysis, which make its results more useful. First, the standard method does not allow for disequilibria in factor markets in which average productivity differs from marginal productivity. Especially in early stages of development, the agricultural sector is characterised by wide-spread disguised unemployment (Dennison 1967; Broadberry 1998). We use estimates of the shadow price of labour to measure this wedge and adjust the shift-share method accordingly. This adjustment increases the measured importance of structural change to growth. Second, the traditional method does not properly account for differences in productivity levels between sectors. For example, the expansion of a low-productive sector such as government services would show up as being positive for aggregate growth. We account for differences in productivity levels between sectors and derive more meaningful measures of the contribution of particular sectors to aggregate productivity growth. This novel decomposition method is used to study the sectoral contribution to growth accelerations and growth collapses in Asia and Latin America since 1950. We apply the decomposition to a new database called the GGDC 10-sector database. This database provides sectoral detail to the long-run macro data in Maddison (2003) and is a complement to the sectoral database for OECD countries by van Ark (1996). It covers 19 countries in Asia and Latin America and includes employment and value added data on agriculture, four industrial sectors, three market services sectors and government. We find that resource reallocation is not the main driver of accelerations and decelerations in aggregate economic growth. Productivity improvements within sectors, in particular within manufacturing and market services, appear to be much more important for growth in Asia and Latin America since the 1950s. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2 we present the new decomposition method. Section 3 describes data contents, selection criteria and sources of the sectoral data set for developing countries. Sectoral contributions to growth accelerations are presented in Sect. 4. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes.",127

Today, it is generally recognized that traditional accounts of the industrialization process such as those of Rostow (1960) and Landes (1969) tended to conflate the economic significance of the steam engine with its early diffusion. In fact, the available shreds of evidence on the growth of steam power in the British economy in combination with data on the cost effectiveness of early steam engines indicate that steam power gave a only modest contribution to aggregate productivity growth until at least the 1830s (Von Tunzelmann 1978, Crafts 2004a, b). However, it is important to stress that these revisionist accounts concern the timing of the economic effects of the diffusion of steam power technology and do not intend to question the fundamental role played by this technology for economic growth over the long-run. Thus, the views of Cipolla (1962) and Wrigley (1988, 2004) which regard steam power as a critical technological breakthrough that changed the energy budget of the British economy providing the opportunity for tapping into inorganic stocks of fossil fuels (coal) and thereby reaching a steeper growth trajectory (usually referred to as “modern economic growth”) are not in principle in contrast with the findings of Crafts and von Tunzelmann. Recent developments in growth theory have actually pointed out a series of factors which can explain why the impact of a general purpose technology such as the steam engine on the rate of economic growth is going to be affected by long delays (Lipsey et al. 2005; Bresnahan 2010). This cursory summary suggests that the broad contours of the relationship between the diffusion of steam power and economic growth have been probably successfully outlined. However, this concerns only the aggregate dimensions of the diffusion process. In fact, several contributions have actually argued that a proper understanding of the processes of economic change occurring during the British industrial revolution needs to be based on a regional perspective (Pollard 1981; Langton 1984; Hudson 1989; Berg and Hudson 1992). These authors claim that industries exhibiting fast rates of output growth and extensive technical and organizational changes displayed a strong tendency towards regional concentration.Footnote 1 From these considerations, it is clear that, when accounting for the diffusion of a technology in this period, due attention must be paid to regional aspects. Kanefsky (1979) and Kanefsky and Robey (1980) have assembled a comprehensive data-set on the adoption of steam power in Britain throughout the eighteenth century. On the basis of these data, they have provided a quantitative descriptive outline of the diffusion process (Kanefsky and Robey 1980). This paper serves a twofold purpose. The first aim is to expand on Kanefsky and Robey by providing a new quantitative characterization of the timing, the pace and the geographical extent of steam engine diffusion during the eighteenth century adopting a framework of inquiry based on the economics of technological diffusion. The second goal is to assess the factors influencing the adoption of steam engine technology in different locations. In particular, we want to test systematically the role played by the price of coal, which the studies of von Tunzelmann (1978, pp. 47–92) and Kanefsky (1979) have identified as the critical factor affecting steam engine usage. In this respect, it is worth noting that both the studies of von Tunzelmann (1978) and Kanefsky (1979) were based on estimates of the cost effectiveness of “representative” Newcomen and Watt engines at different level coal prices integrated by some anecdotal evidence (e.g. von Tunzelmann 1978, pp. 76–78), but they did not investigate systematically the existence of an actual correlation between coal prices and the number of engines installed at regional level.Footnote 2
 The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In the next section we present a brief overview of the development of the steam power technology in the course of the eighteenth century. Clearly the aim of this section is to provide the necessary background (from the history of technology point of veiw) to our diffusion study. In Sect. 3, we provide a broad outline of the geographical diffusion patterns of Newcomen and Watt engines. Section 4 examines the timing and pace of steam engine diffusion at the level of individual counties. In Sect. 5, by estimating “adoption equations” of various types of steam engines by county, we assess the relative role of a number of specific location factors. In the same section, we also attempt to interpret the results of our econometric analysis against the background of the existing historical accounts of the emergence of steam power technology. Section 6 draws conclusions.",31

A note on the contrasting experiences of England and France up to 1800,January 2012,Paul R. Sharp,Jacob L. Weisdorf,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"One of the perennial themes in economic history is why the Industrial Revolution first occurred in England rather than France. The traditional view of England as ‘a beacon of progress’ whilst France was ‘mired in backwardness’ seemed strange in the light of empirical work showing respectable growth rates in France for most of the eighteenth century (Marczewski 1961) and was brought into question by Nicholas Crafts (Crafts 1977). Since then, scholars have repeatedly pointed to the lack of differences between England and France in the run up to the Industrial Revolution, adding further to the mystery as to why England went before France. Indeed, Hans-Joachim Voth and Nico Voigtländer, in support of Crafts, recently argued that ‘chance played a role in the timing and speed of Britain’s initial surge’, maintaining that France could in fact have moved into manufacturing faster than England, had it not been for a number of random factors, based on the simulation of a probabilistic modelFootnote 1—they thus do not believe that this outcome was predetermined. Bob Allen’s illuminating computation of his so-called ‘welfare ratios’ across Europe was probably the first study to indicate that Londoners were well beyond their Parisian counterparts in terms of purchasing power in the run up to 1800 (Allen 2001). Allen was able to draw this conclusion by designing a basket of everyday consumer goods (food, clothing, housing, heating etc.); he then calculated the number of times an average-sized family (consisting of two adults and three children) was able to buy the basket given prevailing prices and wages, computed on the assumption that a labourer worked 250 days per year. Figure 1 below compares the welfare ratios of London building labourers to those of their Parisian counterparts between 1500 and 1800. It is evident from the graphs that, whilst the French were barely able to afford one basket, the English, with a labour input similar to that of the French, were capable of buying between 1.2 and 1.6 baskets. Allen’s ‘welfare ratios’ for London and Paris, 1500–1800 (Source: Allen 2001, Table 6) Two important points seem to have escaped Allen’s attention. The first has to do with the fact that he groups observations in blocks of 50 years. This means that any year-to-year price and wage variation is hidden from the reader. The second point has to do with the fact that workers may have varied their working year in response to economic circumstances, for instance so as to maintain a constant standard of living in the face of real wage volatility. Indeed, independent estimates of labour input, which will be discussed below, suggest that Allen’s assumption of a flat 250 days of work per year was at the lower end of the scale. In this paper, therefore, we expand the analysis of Allen (2001) along two dimensions. Firstly, by looking at year-to-year fluctuations in real consumer prices it becomes immediately apparent that, whilst in London building workers were facing low and stable consumer prices in the three centuries leading up to 1800, the French were subject to huge variations in the cost of living throughout the period. Secondly, we follow the computational exercise in Allen and Weisdorf (2011), which fixes consumption rather than labour input and then calculates the working year required to obtain exactly one consumption basket. We show based on this calculation that, whilst the English worked twice as much as they had to in order to buy the basket, the French often had to cut consumption in order to make ends meet, especially in the century leading up to the French revolution. The struggle for subsistence amongst Parisian workers, on the one hand, and the industrious behaviour of London labourers on the other (supporting de Vries’ (2008) twin hypotheses of an ‘industrious revolution’ and a ‘consumer revolution’ feeding the industrial revolution), jointly suggest a new reason as to why France was driven towards the French revolution, whilst England experienced the industrial revolution.",11

In a book published in 1861 “Java, or how to manage a colony showing a practical solution of the questions now affecting British India” J.B.W. Money suggested the Netherlands Indies as a model colony for British India (Wesseling 1988, 140–176). The effectiveness of Dutch extractive policies in the Indonesian archipelago also formed a source of inspiration for the Belgian King Leopold II, who aspired to turn Belgium into a colonial power, and eventually acquired a vast territory in the Congo basin under private royal control (Stengers 1977; Vanthemsche 2007). The extraordinary profitability of the ‘cultivation system’ introduced by the Dutch on Java in the 1830s, contributed substantially to the economic development of the metropole. At its peak, in the 1850s, the forced cultivation of sugar, tea, indigo and coffee by Javanese peasants contributed an estimated 52 % to Dutch central tax revenues and an estimated 4 % to Dutch GDP (van Zanden and van Riel 2000, 223). The net surplus on the Indonesian balance of payments was used to service high levels of Dutch state debt, to finance Dutch infrastructural investments and to subsidize the less ‘productive’ Dutch colonies in the West Indies (Geertz 1963; Elson 1994; Booth 1998; Lindblad 1989; van Zanden 2004). The historical debate on the late colonial era, with which we engage in this study, has been deeply affected by the idea that after the gradual abolition of the cultivation systems after the 1860s, the Dutch kept reaping exceptional returns on colonial investments, although most of it now hinged on private capital investments instead of state-directed programs of forced cultivation (Gerretson 1938; Vandenbosch 1938; Boeke 1940a, b; Derksen and Tinbergen 1980 [1945]; Haccoû 1961; Maddison 1989; Gordon 2010). This view has been scrutinized by a revisionist literature that has criticized the data and estimates that have been used to assess various aspects of colonial FDI in the late colonial era (Baudet and Wijers 1976), as well as attempts to place the discussion on the ‘colonial drain’ in the wider context of mutual economic interdependence (van der Eng 1998a, b). The data and methods that have been used to estimate rates of return to investments during the interwar era all suffer substantial flaws. In this paper we address these flaws and offer new estimates of the return to colonial FDI of 17 companies listed at the Brussels stock exchange (BSE) for 1919–1938. We focus our analysis on the interwar decades, but we also present additional estimates for the period 1940–1958. Although our sample is limited by size and type of investment, which makes it impossible to tell exactly how representative they are for the broad range of investments in Indonesian plantation agriculture, we consider this study as a first step in a new research avenue with potentially high returns, especially if historical Dutch stock market data would become available in a future digitization project (as is currently undertaken for French stock markets). More specifically, the intended contribution of this paper is threefold. Firstly, we introduce a new database with monthly data on dividend yields and capital gains from a sample of stock-based companies active in the Netherlands Indies listed at the Brussels stock exchange. These data have been used to estimate returns to FDI in the Belgian Congo (Buelens and Marysse 2009) and can offer a fresh perspective on the study of returns to FDI in the Netherlands Indies. Secondly, we apply the Dimson–March–Staunton (DMS) method to compute rates of return on investment, which is a method that has not been applied before to this case, but adheres much better to generally accepted principles in finance than the methods used in previous studies (Dimson et al. 2002; Brocquet et al. 1997). Thirdly, we are the first to discuss the estimates for the Netherlands Indies in a global comparative perspective, using estimates of returns to FDI in other countries during the interwar era which have all been computed using the DMS-method. We find that returns to FDI in the Netherlands Indies during 1919–1928 were impressive (14.3 %), almost 3 percentage points higher than the world average. During 1929–1938 the tides turned, with an average annual rate of return of −2.8 % compared to a world average of 2.2 %. Compared to the general rate of return on the Amsterdam stock exchange, the returns to colonial FDI were considerably higher: 2.1 % for the period 1920–1939 versus 5.4 % for our sample 1919–1938. However, returns to FDI in the Netherlands Indies were subject to a higher degree of volatility and became worthless after 1940. We will argue that high returns to colonial FDI in tropical agriculture were underpinned by repressive colonial labour policies and cheap access to land, but also may have partly reflected a higher risk-premium. Section 2 proceeds to discuss Dutch historical perspectives on the profitability of empire. Section 3 discusses patterns of economic specialization and private investment in the Netherlands Indies during the late colonial era. Section 4 discusses existing estimates of returns to investment and Sect. 5 introduces our data and methodology. Section 6 focusses on stock price indices to identify trends in each of the sub-periods. In Sect. 7 we present and discuss our main results. Section 8 places the results in an international perspective and Sect. 9 concludes.",9

This large interest derives from the fact that stability of money demand plays a crucial role in the conduct of monetary policy and it also reflects the importance attributed to money demand stability in theoretical modelling. As stated by Milton Friedman: «the quantity theory is in the first instance a theory of the demand for money», and the «quantity theorists accepted the empirical hypothesis that the demand for money is highly stable» (Friedman 1969, pp. 98, 108). Friedman’s statements imply that there is a stable demand function that is a stable relationship between income, price level, relative rates of return, and money demand. Moreover, the stability of money demand represents a fundamental assumption to adopt monetary targeting. Central banks can implement monetary manoeuvres on the basis of the estimated relations between money demand and its determinants; then, a stable money demand function is considered as a necessary condition for the use of monetary aggregates in the conduct of monetary policy. In the presence of an unstable function, it is not possible, in fact, to postulate a constant conditional model for money demand. Poole (1970) argues that in the presence of an unstable money demand, the target of monetary policy should be the interest rate. Following this reasoning, many central banks switched from monetary aggregates to the interest rate as their target in the 1970s, when money instability increased sharply. However, regardless of the monetary instrument, money still plays an important role in the formulation of an efficient policy strategy, because money demand instability implies an unstable money multiplier, preventing any possibility of forecasting the effects of monetary policies. In this paper we study money demand in Italy in the period 1861–2011 by investigating both its determinants and its stability. Italy represents an interesting case because its monetary system has undergone several economic, social, and institutional changes (Fratianni and Spinelli 1997). For a century and a half, Italy has had different monetary regimes, has adhered to diverse exchange rate systems, and has experienced changes in the financial regulation framework. These are all factors that can influence the demand for money (Boughton 1992). In addition, in this long period, the country has experienced twelve banking crises, as well as several financial turmoils and episodes of high inflation (De Bonis and Silvestrini 2014). The stability of money demand in Italy has been analysed in other studies (see, for instance, Thornton 1998; Caruso 2006; Muscatelli and Spinelli 1996, 2000). With respect to the existing literature, the present paper examines a longer period that covers all the relevant changes occurred in the Italian monetary policy regime and financial system, including a decade of the euro circulation. In order to do so, we reconstruct the time series for two monetary aggregates (M1 and M2), inflation, real effective exchange rate (REEX) and exchange rate volatility, by merging different existing series and by means of our own calculations. The reconstructed series are then used together with the existing series for GDP and short-term interest rate, allowing us to cover such a long period of time with an extensive analysis of money demand determinants. The empirical analysis is conducted by using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) methodology in order to differentiate between long- and short-run effects on money demand by its determinants. Then, we investigate the stability of the estimated relations by means of the CUSUM and CUSUM of squares tests. The analysis is performed on M2, which is the standard aggregate considered to measure money demand, but also focuses on the narrow money aggregate, M1, in order to isolate money demand from other portfolio choices. We adopt two different money demand equations. Firstly, money demand is analysed with the GDP, inflation, and short-term interest rate as its determinants. Secondly, we augment this specification by including REEX and its variability as additional explanatory variables. Our results show that instability cannot be excluded when a standard money demand function is estimated for Italy, irrespectively of the use of M1 or M2 as proxies. Furthermore, we demonstrate that despite the fact that the period of multiple banks of issue (from 1861 to 1893) seems to be characterised by a stable money demand in Italy, the period of development of the banking and financial system (from the beginning of the century till the 1930s), characterised by the strong shift from coins to paper money and bank deposits, and the following sharp increase in price levels and World War I, present an unstable money demand till up the end of the World War II (1945). Then, we argue that the reason for possible instability resides in omission of relevant variables. This allows us to show that fully stable demand for narrow money (M1) in Italy can be obtained with an augmented money demand function, involving REEX and its volatility as additional explanatory variables. As the same does not apply to the estimation of M2, we also conclude that narrower monetary aggregate should be employed as the proxy for money demand in order to obtain stable estimated relations. The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 highlights the main historical events in monetary regimes and policies that potentially could have affected the demand for money in Italy. Section 3 synthesises the main results in the literature related to our analysis. Section 4 describes the methodologies employed and reports the main results obtained. Section 5 concludes the paper.",5

The question of the causal connection between economic and population growth in agrarian society is still unresolved. As Diebolt (2016, 1) notes “cliometrics can proceed only if the nature of causal explanation has been resolved.” There are opposing interpretations. While most Malthusians emphasize diminishing returns on natural resources, producing mortality crises, many of their critics point out that population growth by itself generated advances in technology. Malthus’ concept of positive checks is usually operationalized as the response of death rates to fluctuations in living standards (Galloway 1988, 291; Klemp and Møller forthcoming, 5). His concept of preventive checks is usually operationalized as the response of marriage or birth rates. The unified growth theory, which aims to model both technological progress and demographic transition in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries endogenously, predicts that while preventive checks were initially strengthened, positive checks were weakened once technological progress took off (Galor and Weil 2000; Pfister and Fertig 2010). However, what exactly a Malthusian model entails is a topic for an ongoing discussion, and there is no reason to interpret the Malthusian mechanism in just one way. In fact, Mokyr and Voth (2008, 14–15) suggest that the Malthusian model rests on two assumptions: (1) that population growth reacted positively to living standards through preventive and positive checks and (2) that living standards were negatively related to the size of the population. They contrast two Malthusian versions against each other. In its strongest form, it predicts stagnant per capita income without shifting mortality and fertility schedules and stagnant population in the absence of technological advance. In its weaker version, it accentuates equilibrium mechanisms, i.e., the positive and preventive checks on population rather than the specific outcomes. The analysis of the development of preventive and positive checks is highly dependent on which variables are chosen and not only on the statistical model. Earlier international research on the effect of economic stress on the population in the pre-industrial period has largely relied on real wages or grain prices as indicators of living or nutritional standards (Wrigley and Schofield 1989, pp. 368–384; Galloway 1988, 1994; Lee and Anderson 2002; Nicolini 2007; Bengtsson and Broström 2011; Bengtsson and Ohlsson 1985; Dribe 2003; Crafts and Mills 2009; Pfister and Fertig 2010; Chiarini 2010; Klemp 2012; Møller and Sharp 2014; Klemp and Møller forthcoming).Footnote 1 Malthusians often point to the development of real wages, which fell from the late Middle Ages to the early nineteenth century, to advance their main proposition that population growth outpaced production (Allen 2001; Clark 2007). Anti-Malthusians tend to disagree (Persson 2008). Maddison (2007, 308) contends that wages cannot be used as indicators of living standards since they do not represent a macroeconomic variable. The volatility in grain prices was also affected by market integration, not only by harvests (Edvinsson 2012). While there was a strong correlation between movements in grain prices and harvests in the early modern period, this relation attenuated during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries due to improved international market integration. Recently, Dribe, Olsson and Svensson (2011) demonstrate that at the local level in southern Sweden, grain output had a different impact on mortality than grain prices, since the latter reflected conditions in surrounding areas. Vital statistics are data on the births, deaths, marriages, divorces, etc. Vital rates are calculated by dividing these vital statistics to the total population. This paper utilizes recently constructed annual series of Swedish vital rates and harvests to estimate the elasticities of vital rates back to 1630. The whole period 1630–1870 is put into investigation, although a comparison is also made with 1871–1920. Harvest data are transformed into the per capita production of calories. The “Appendix” explains the data sources in detail. In this paper, the elasticities of vital rates are calculated as cumulative elasticities, since the impact of harvest could be delayed. In the first step, a simple distributed lag model (DLM) and an ARMAX (autoregressive moving average with exogenous input) model are presented. Subsequently, a structural vector autoregression model (SVAR) is applied to estimate structural impulse response functions that can be given a causal interpretation (Eckstein et al. 1984; Nicolini 2007). The empirical evidence supports the view that there was a short-term Malthusian equilibrium mechanism in the Swedish pre-industrial economy, even if the mechanism changed over time. The question of whether there was a medium- or long-term Malthusian equilibrium mechanism is, however, outside the scope of this study. A short-term mechanism does not necessitate a long-term one, even if there is usually a connection between the two under ceteris paribus.",9

We reconstruct a social table for one of the economic and political centres of Poland, the Voivodeship of Cracow, and on this basis also explore the level of per capita GDP of Poland in this period (we discuss the representativeness of the region for Poland as a whole later in the text). We compare the results internationally between 1410 and 1910. Our findings confirm the impressions provided by previous comparative studies of preindustrial Poland that the country lagged behind compared with England and The Netherlands (Allen 2001; Van Zanden 2001; Wójtowicz and Wójtowicz 2009; Baten and Szołtysek 2014). This growing apart of Poland and the North Sea region happens especially in the seventeenth and the eighteenth century. With this evidence, we validate the hypothesis known as the ‘Little Divergence’, which proposes that relative income levels in northwestern Europe increased vis-à-vis the rest of the continent through the early modern era (Allen 2001; Van Zanden 2001; Broadberry et al. 2015). We also confirm the claims made by Milanovic et al. (2011) about the link between the level of real income and income inequality. We demonstrate that income inequality in the Polish agricultural sector was constrained by the inequality possibility frontier. However, contrary to the theoretical model proposed by Kuznets (1955) and in opposition to the relations identified empirically for Western Europe (for example for Holland by Van Zanden 1995 and for Northern Italy by Alfani and Ammannati 2014), income in the Polish agricultural sector was distributed less equally than in the urban sector. We link this finding to the demesne economy based on serfdom, which defined class relations in the country. This is not the first study that tries to chart the long-term growth curve of the Polish economy in the early modern period (Van Zanden 2001; Wójtowicz and Wójtowicz 2009), but our reconstruction is based on new data and on the methodology used in similar articles on GDP in pre-1800 Spain (Alvarez-Nogal and Prados de la Escosura (2013), Italy (Malanima 2010) and Germany (Pfister 2011), making the results comparable to those of these (and other) European countries. The methodology uses changes in real wages and urbanisation to gauge shifts in real income. Thanks to recent work by Malinowski (2016a), who estimated real wages in preindustrial Poland, we can use this methodology to make estimates for GDP per capita for the benchmark years 1500, 1578, 1662, and 1776. The results indicate a moderate growth in the economy in the sixteenth century, a strong contraction in the seventeenth century, and a stagnation in the eighteenth century. In the sixteenth century, Polish per capita GDP was already below that of Western Europe. After the seventeenth century crisis, Polish real income went down to a level below that of India or Japan. Positioning Poland in the debate on early modern growth is one objective. The other is to test ideas about the determinants of income inequality. According to Kula (1983), in the Polish demesne economy based on serfdom, surplus generated by the peasants was extracted by their landlords. This suggests the existence of a wide income gap between the top and the bottom levels of Polish society, which could have resulted not only in high levels of income inequality but also in a high extraction rate (see Milanovic et al. 2011 for a definition of the concept), particularly in the agricultural sector. Contrariwise, according to Kuznets (1955) and Milanovic et al. (2011), poor and agrarian societies should be characterised by relatively low inequality. The latter authors propose that, for every value of per capita GDP there exists a maximum potential inequality, determined by real income and the subsistence minimum below which people cannot survive. This relationship is known as the inequality possibility frontier. The frontier is low in poor preindustrial societies, regardless of their political setup, and high in rich societies. Milanovic et al. (2011) built on the ideas of Kuznets (1955), who famously argued that early economic growth should result in a rise in income inequality. The latter author argued that, due to low productivity, agriculture should be characterised by low levels of income inequality. Kuznets theorised that economic growth is related to shifts of labour from agriculture to industry that is characterised by higher productivity. According to his model, due to the productivity gap between the rural and urban sectors and the arguably higher income inequality within the more productive sector, industrialisation/urbanisation makes societies richer, but it also makes them more unequal (Kuznets 1955: 7–8). Van Zanden (1995) suggested that Kuznets’s model could be also applied to explain preindustrial economic growth (so-called Super Kuznets’s Curve). He demonstrated that, in the case of Holland, income in the Dutch agricultural sector was relatively evenly distributed and that early modern economic growth went together with an increase in income inequality. In this article, we try to put the Polish experience into the Western European perspective, and investigate whether (A) demesne economy based on serfdom in early modern Poland resulted in relatively high levels of income inequality and extraction or (B) whether inequality in the country was constrained by the small size of its agricultural economy. We conclude that, contrary to Western Europe, the agricultural sector in Poland could have been more unequal than the urban one. Our evidence also indicates that income in Poland was distributed more equally than in contemporary Holland. However, the extraction rate in the Voivodeship was much higher than in the North Sea area.",45

Nelson and Phelps 1966; Schultz 1975; Benhabib and Spiegel 1994). Contrary to what the theory predicts, economic historians have described the role of human capital in the English Industrial Revolution as minor (Mokyr 1990; Nicholas and Nicholas 1992; Mitch 1993; Crafts 1996; Clark 2005). Literacy rates were at best mediocre. Around 1800, literacy rates were about 60% for males and 40% for females (Cressy 1980). Reis (2005) has shown that this was slightly higher than France, but significantly lower than the Netherlands, Sweden and Germany. For instance, Sweden was fully literate by the early nineteenth century.Footnote 2 There was not much improvement in literacy during the Industrial Revolution itself: male literacy rates fluctuated around 60% between 1750 and 1850 (Mitch 1993). Similar conclusions can be drawn from school enrolment figures. Out of the male population in the age bracket between 5 and 14, 28% were enrolled in schools in 1830. In 1850, by the end of the first Industrial Revolution, it had increased to 50%, but this was equal to France (51%) and considerably less than Prussia (73%) (Lindert 2004).Footnote 3
  The conclusion that human capital did not play an important role in the British Industrial Revolution draws upon records of school enrolment and literacy.Footnote 4 Literacy rates are likely to underestimate the overall level of formal education, as they only proxy primary schooling (reading and writing abilities) and enrolment rates do not take into account the age structure of the population. What is more, by largely focussing on the period after 1750, these measures are expected to understate the growth of literacy and that of schooling in general, which occurred in the centuries leading up to the Industrial Revolution.Footnote 5 The recent studies of Baten and van Zanden (2008), Buringh and van Zanden (2009) and Boucekkine et al. (2007) introduce more comprehensive measures of schooling levels, such as per capita book consumption and the number of (secondary) schools, and trace their evolution back to the mediaeval period. What these studies show is that the level of schooling was much higher in England than previously assumed from the evidence on literacy and enrolment rates. For instance, in the first half of the eighteenth century, levels of book consumption per capita were highest in Holland and England, whilst the rest of the continent lagged behind (see Buringh and van Zanden 2009). Likewise, Boucekkine et al. (2007) document significant growth in the number of new school foundations in England between ca. 1500 and 1660. Baten and van Zanden (2008) and de Pleijt and van Zanden (2016) moreover empirically demonstrate that human capital formation contributed to pre-industrial economic growth.Footnote 6
 Therefore, no clear consensus exists on the importance of human capital for the growth record of England in the very long run. Economic theory suggests that it may have been crucial, but the empirical record is rather mixed, sometimes confirming theoretical expectations, in other cases demonstrating the limited impact of human capital. Part of the apparent confusion is probably due to the use of different measures for human capital, and part is probably related to the fact that different periods are studied—the years before the start of industrialisation may be telling a different story than the Industrial Revolution itself. One way to extend this debate is to study the same concept—human capital measured as average years of education—in the very long run and see how this established metric relates to the process of growth in the different periods concerned. In this paper, I therefore apply a Perpetual Inventory Method to estimate average years of education for England between 1300 and 1900. The estimates on the stock incorporate extensive statistical evidence on literacy rates, the number of primary and secondary schools and their average class sizes, and matriculations to the Universities of Cambridge, Oxford and London. Assumptions about demographic ratios, such as survival ratios of individuals, are applied to estimate average years of schooling. An additional distinction is made on the basis of gender (years of education of males and females) and of level (primary, secondary and tertiary education). It is shown that years of schooling can be quantified rather well, in particular for the period after 1540. The estimates presented in this paper are therefore able to give a far more coherent picture on the evolution of formal schooling in the long run than do literacy rates alone. In this way, it becomes possible to examine the extent of formal schooling in the period preceding, as well as during, the Industrial Revolution. It should be mentioned here that the estimates of educational attainment refer to just one part of the ‘human capital variable’—i.e. formal education. It does not capture the part of the stock of human capital, which did not involve formal schooling, but which could have been important for the productivity of workers. This includes, amongst others, apprenticeships and on-the-job learning (see Humphries 2003; Wallis 2008; Mokyr 2009). In most growth models, however, estimates of average years of education are used as the best proxy for human capital (see Gurgand 2005; Sunde and Vischer 2011 for overviews). It is possible to draw some conclusions from the series on educational attainment. To start with, the years of schooling measure began to increase rapidly after the 1530s. The basis for this growth was laid in the Middle Ages, when many new secondary schools were founded. Following Orme (2006), the number of secondary schools had increased from ca. 100 in 1400 to 230 in 1530, whereas the population had only slightly increased from 2.1 to 2.6 million. Between 1530 and 1700, secondary education accounted for over half of the share of the overall education stock of males. One in seven boys went up to the secondary level by the turn of the seventeenth century. A pronounced shift occurred after 1720, as indicated by stagnation in average years of primary schooling and a vast decline in attainment levels of secondary and tertiary schooling. By the second half of the nineteenth century, only one in thirty boys went up to the secondary level. The educational attainment levels of females were well below those of males, although it is the only series that shows consistent growth until 1800. Over the course of the nineteenth century, females rapidly caught up with males in terms of average years of primary schooling. Overall, from the evidence on the evolution of average years of education, it can be concluded that the first Industrial Revolution coincided with a pronounced decline in secondary schooling levels of males. There was substantial growth in per capita GDP after 1750 whilst the average level of schooling stagnated, and, in the case of higher education, sharply declined (Broadberry et al. 2015). This finding provides further evidence for the predominant view that the benefits of formal education were not sustained following the initial stages of the industrialisation process (e.g. Nicholas and Nicholas 1992; Mitch 1993; A’Hearn et al. 2009). Relative to this strand of the literature, several contributions are made. Previous conclusions are derived from the observation of a pause in the growth of male literacy between 1750 and 1850. The trends in the stock of primary education of males indeed suggest that this must have been so. However, the movement away from formal secondary and tertiary schooling during the first Industrial Revolution is a factor that should not be overlooked. The decrease in average years of schooling was much greater than the evidence on the spread of literacy alone would suggest. The findings in this paper therefore show that previous research has underestimated the decline in formal education between 1750 and 1850. Before the ‘dramatic’ decline in years of schooling during the years of the Industrial Revolution, there was, however, an almost equally ‘dramatic’ rise in human capital in the late medieval period and, in particular, in the years between 1530 and 1720. This important result may suggest that the growth of the English economy in the ages before the industrialisation of the eighteenth century was associated with the rise of the level of schooling during those years.Footnote 7 Recent research by Broadberry et al. (2015) has shown convincingly how dynamic the English economy was in this period. This paper adds to this picture by showing the equally dynamic development of literacy and secondary schooling. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 presents the data on average years of education and elaborates on the assumptions underlying the estimates. Section 3 discusses the implications of the findings for the debate on the nature of human capital formation in England and that for the relationship between human capital and economic growth more generally. Section 4 summarises the main results.",24

At the time, regions already differed in both social and economic indicators, suggesting that the diverging trajectories originated well before 1861. The decades following Unification saw a consolidation of the North–South gap with the formation of the so-called Industrial Triangle between the three regions of the North-west of the country—Piedmont, Lombardy and Liguria. The “Questione Meridionale” is as old as Italy, and it emerged immediately as one of the most compelling issues in the post-Unification period. At the turn of the century, the idea that the negative economic conditions of the South represented an obstacle for the entire nation emerged. Nitti (1900) claimed that the first Italian tax system redistributed wealth from South to North, impairing its economic development; De Viti de Marco (1930) suggested that the South fell behind because it had been transformed in a colonial market for northern industrial goods; Salvemini (1955) believed that the delay of the South was due to inequalities in the ownership of land which ought to have led a land reform. More recently, further explanations have been proposed by economic historians to account for the formation and persistence of regional inequality. For instance, the backwardness of southern agriculture has been pointed to as the cause of the gap by Cafagna (1989) and Zamagni (1990). This view has been later challenged by Federico (2007). In the 1990s, the work by Putnam et al. (1993) started a new line of research that focused on southern culture and institutions, which were regarded as less conducive to economic growth compared to the northern ones. Human capital has also gained increasing attention as an explanatory variable, along with social capital (Felice 2012; Cappelli 2016, 2017). Felice and Vasta (2015) proposed, as origin of the divergence, the failure of elites in the South to guide society through the stages of active industrialization, with progress taking place only through state intervention. Over time, differences in physical geography have also been seen as a possible cause of regional disparities. Fenoaltea (2014) focuses on the different energy endowments from water and Daniele and Malanima (2011) on proximity to the centre of Europe. The present article aims to explain what drove the industrialization of the Italian regions in the period between Unification and the First World War by testing several of the above hypotheses in a unified model. The goal is to identify the determinants of the industrialization of regions within an analytical framework that takes account of both the Heckscher–Ohlin (H–O) theory on factor endowment and the new economic geography (NEG) theory on market access. The methodology used is theoretically grounded on the seminal work by Midelfart-Knarvik et al. (2000) on the location of European industries from 1970 to 2000. This methodology has also been applied to historical cases by Crafts and Mulatu (2006) on Britain, Wolf (2007) on Poland, Martinez-Galarraga (2012) on Spain, Klein and Crafts (2012) on the USA and Nikolić (2018) on Yugoslavia. The methodology used here mainly follows Klein and Crafts (2012) and is quite straightforward: the dependent variable is the share of employment of each industrial sector in each region. This is explained by interactions between industry characteristics and regional characteristics of both the H–O and the NEG type, plus region and sector controls. The regional characteristics considered include market access, energy endowment, agricultural labour and human capital availability. Industry characteristics include measures of energy, labour and skill intensity as well as intermediate input use, sales to industry and mean plant size. The contributions of this work are several. First, we bring a new perspective to the quantitative study of the Italian North–South divide. The development of the industrial sectors played a big role in the regional divergence process and studying how industries located in their early stages is informative on how the overall disparities among regions were formed in the first place. Also, by applying a well established methodology to the Italian case, we propose for the first time quantitative testing for several hypotheses regarding market and endowment forces by exploiting variation across industrial sectors and regions making use of both regional and industrial characteristics. Moreover, the Italian case is particularly fruitful for the study of location decisions in early stages of industrialization and their persistence over the long run. The main results of this study are that the energy interaction is the most consistent of all in explaining industrial location, with positive and significant coefficients across all specifications. Human capital also gives positive and significant results. Market forces drive the industrial location through the interaction describing the effect of economies of scale only when domestic markets are considered. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides some historical background and literature on the economic development of the Italian regions. Section 3 explains the methodology for studying the determinants of industrial location. Section 4 provides an overview of the sources. Section 5 shows the empirical results for the Italian case. Section 6 compares our results with the existing literature. Section 7 concludes.",7

Not surprisingly, the existence and strength of the causal link between schooling and economic development has been investigated in numerous cross-sectional regressions (Sala-i-Martin 1997; Hanushek and Woessmann 2012). Proposals regarding the provision of schooling count among core policy recommendations issued to developing countries around the world (Easterlin 1981). But apart from these economic considerations, primary and secondary education has also historically served as a vehicle of political socialization through inculcation of specific cultural values and through building a sense of shared history and national allegiance (Glaeser et al. 2007; Bandiera et al. 2016; Pritchett and Viarengo 2015). The politics and the economics of mass schooling have always been intertwined, given the prominent role played by the public sector in this area (Lindert 2004: Chapter 5). What a particular educational system is supposed to achieve—whether development, or socialization or some combination of both—and who supports its creation and pays for it—whether the elites or the masses—are closely related questions because particular political constituencies support particular schooling policies, expecting particular benefits in return for their support. Our aim in this paper is to ask precisely these interconnected questions in case of the schooling system introduced in late eighteenth and early nineteenth century in Imperial Austria. As we discuss in greater detail in Sect. 2, when the masses support schooling, they expect to benefit from the economic advance and modernization that it enables. In those circumstances, traditional elites (such as landed aristocracy) are usually the main bulwark of opposition. This line of argument, recently revisited by Lindert (2004), Go and Lindert (2010), Mariscal and Sokoloff (2000) and others, sees modern growth as a consequence of (among other things) the rise of national public systems of education which themselves were the product of broadened political voice and mass electoral support for tax-based schooling. An alternative line of reasoning sees traditional elites as supportive of mass schooling, when such schooling served to reinforce traditional political structures while posing limited risk of disruptive economic transformation. Under such conditions, it is quite conceivable to have a long-standing schooling system with an almost universal reach and generating high levels of educational attainment (measured in years of schooling), which nonetheless has limited impact on economic development. We argue that the schooling system introduced by the Habsburg emperors in late eighteenth and early nineteenth century was of this latter kind. We build our case in three steps. First, we describe the regulation pertaining to elementary schooling, which we take at face value as an expression of the preferences of the ruling elites. We show that this regulation downplayed the importance of teacher training and was even suspicious of “too much knowledge” (Engelbrecht 1986). Teaching practical (and marketable) knowledge and skills beyond rudimentary literacy and numeracy—what German pedagogy then called Realia—was of second-order importance in the curriculum, while religious instruction stressing obedience, loyalty and social conservatism was prominent. Next, we investigate whether schooling in its mandated form enhanced the sophistication and human capital intensity of the local labor market, thereby giving the masses an avenue for economic advance and consequently a reason to support it. We do not find evidence of such positive impact, except in places (mainly towns) where the curriculum was broad enough to include some instruction in practical knowledge. Finally, we look at various constituencies’ readiness to contribute to this public good. Using the Austrian institution of school patronage (Schulpatronat), we show that the central authorities and aristocratic elites, not the mass of villagers in local communities, were the most determined and single-minded, if not always successful, force for the extension of schooling in Austria. The policy makers controlled the content of education but (perhaps as a result) continued to be frustrated in their efforts to spread it to such extent, as they desired. The general population in towns and villages mostly proved reluctant to make good on (let alone go beyond) the existing regulations. Thus, in contrast to the usual upbeat story of newly enfranchised but credit-constrained masses wisely voting themselves more public school provision to be financed by stingy elites to further the economic fortunes of their children and their country, we describe a system where the elite foisted a politically motivated education on lukewarm masses while making them pay for it mostly out of their own pockets—all with predictably mixed results. One advantage of centrally mandated schooling systems, such as the Austrian one, is that they were often accompanied by extensive data collection at several levels of aggregation, allowing us to investigate these issues in close range. In 1865, the government commissioned the first comprehensive school census which reported detailed information on staff, curriculum and enrollment for each of the almost 11.000 schools across Imperial Austria (K.K. Statistische Zentral-Commission 1870). We merge this dataset with the 1863 empire-wide census of all steam engines (our proxy for local level of technological sophistication) and with the 1869 population census. We use the data on employment structure to construct a measure of the human capital intensity of the local labor market and analyze its variation in relation to local schooling supply, using a simultaneous equations model. Finally, for one of the provinces, Lower Austria, we were able to locate an 1852 teacher and school directory which, when linked with school-level data from the 1865 survey, allows us to go all the way down to the level of individual schools and their school patrons and investigate change in school provision across time at school level (Kaiser 1852). Our results have implications for how we evaluate the impact of schooling on economic growth. Whether a particular educational system “contributed” to a country’s development or whether it “failed” cannot be measured just in terms of enrollment, the staff availability and the level of public expense. Public spending on schooling is an investment that may or may not bear a return depending on how well that investment is made (Hanushek 2013). If such an investment yields scant returns or if the education is supplied beyond where benefits cover the costs on the margin, then the public outlay, in whole or in part, may represent a deadweight loss. In those instances, high enrollment and high public outlays are not a boon to the economy but only a costly burden.",5

Lloyd,Solomos Solomou,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In February 1932, the UK imposed the General Tariff. This represented a 10% ad valorem tariff for British industries, although some industries received additional duties, on the recommendation of the Import Duties Advisory Committee (IDAC), whilst others were exempt or received protection during the 1920s. To evaluate the impacts of this measure, we explore the following questions: were the “newly protected” industries covered by the 1932 legislation stimulated by the tariff over the cyclical recovery of the 1930s, improving their standing relative to the non-newly protected and already protected industries; can we identify short- and medium-term effects from the General Tariff? One of the first quantitative studies to evaluate this effect is Richardson (1967) who concluded that “the tariff had little effect on the growth of newly protected industries between 1930 and 1935”. This conclusion was based on Richardson’s evaluation of the effects of protection on output, employment, labour productivity and trade in the newly protected industries of 1932 relative to non-newly protected industries, comparing the benchmark years 1930 and 1935 using the Censuses of Production data. Having observed that, between 1930 and 1935, the fall in imports in newly protected industries was less than the fall in imports of other industries, Richardson argues for a non-tariff explanation for the healthy performance of the newly protected industries—recovery in the newly protected sector was thus seen as reflecting general economic recovery in the 1930s. A major weakness in Richardson’s analysis is the implicit assumption that the newly protected and other industries shared similar initial conditions in 1930. There is no attempt to compare the economic performance of the newly protected and other industries over a longer period that would allow testing of this assumption. The initial conditions in the 1920s will be unimportant only if industries were comparable in economic performance and shared similar characteristics. We know this was not the case. We apply a difference-in-difference approach, using more information about the economic performance of the two groups of industries in the pre-protection period as well as additional control variables to account for differences in the characteristics of industries over and above their growth profiles. The difference-in-difference approach builds on Kitson and Solomou (1990) who used the data contained in the 1924, 1930 and 1935 Censuses of Production to distinguish the inter-period performance of the newly protected industries of 1932 relative to other industries, comparing the 1924–1930 and 1930–1935 periods. Thus, the inter-period difference in performance between 1924–1930 and 1930–1935 is used to identify the effects of protection on different industries. In order to test whether industry growth was stimulated by tariffs, Kitson and Solomou (1990) considered the output and productivity growth performance of the newly protected industries relative to non-newly protected industries. Output growth in the newly protected group of 1932 was stagnant in 1924–1930, whilst the non-newly protected sector saw a weighted mean growth of 2.7% per annum. However, during 1930–1935 there was a substantial turnaround as the newly protected group grew at 3.8% per annum, whilst the other industries grew at 2.3% per annum. Kitson and Solomou (1990, p. 111) reported a number of significance tests, suggesting that the improved output and productivity performance of the newly protected sector during the 1930s were statistically significant, whilst there was no effect on the non-newly protected industries. Broadberry and Crafts (2011) and Crafts (2012) were the first to estimate difference-in-difference regressions to evaluate the labour productivity effects of the General Tariff on British industries, introducing two innovations: first, the application of the difference-in-difference model adds a formal econometric panel data frameworkFootnote 1 to the tests undertaken by Kitson and Solomou (1990); second, as noted above, the IDAC implemented a system of additional duties, in excess of 10% ad valorem, allowing us to compare three groups of industries instead of two. Broadberry and Crafts chose to compare early protected industries with the newly protected group further divided into two subgroups, the baseline group of industries given 0–10% ad valorem tariff protection in the 1930s and those industries given additional duties on the recommendation of the IDAC.Footnote 2 The Broadberry and Crafts results suggest that whilst the effect of the tariff on productivity growth is estimated to be positive, the coefficient is statistically insignificant, negating the results on labour productivity identified by Kitson and Solomou. The current paper evaluates the Broadberry and Crafts results. Two avenues of research are pursued: first, we place the Kitson and Solomou’s results within a difference-in-difference framework using the two-group comparison between the newly protected industries and the non-newly protected industries; secondly, we make the Kitson and Solomou’s data set comparable to Broadberry and Crafts by distinguishing the additional duties from the baseline 10% protected industries. In constructing our data set, we identified two substantive problems with the Broadberry and Crafts’s study. First, as noted above, there are problems with the implementation of the difference-in-difference method, which mean that the treatment and control groups have not been clearly distinguished. Second, a reading of the tariff regulations of the period, and the decisions on additional duties, has highlighted a significant number of classification differences with Broadberry and Crafts that affect evaluation of the General Tariff. We provide a detailed description of a new data set of the tariff protection received by each of the industries in our sample drawing upon contemporary tariff information from a variety of sources, including IDAC (1932a, b), CET (1935), NIESR (1943), Hutchinson (1965) and various HMRC reports. We present the detailed tariff classification and list of sources in Appendix A of Supplementary material to this paper as a resource for future research. Our paper provides valuable micro-level evidence on the effects of tariffs on UK manufacturing industries in the interwar period. We find that manufacturing industries who were protected by the General Tariff benefited in the 1930s relative to non-newly protected industries. Our results complement recent work by De Bromhead et al. (2017), who find that UK tariffs led to reduced multilateral trade in the 1930s, with a shift towards imperial imports. Although our micro-level evidence is focused on partial equilibrium tariff effects for UK manufacturing industries and does not provide direct evidence regarding the macroeconomic effects of the tariff, our work is related to the broader literature studying the relationship between tariffs and growth from a macroeconomic perspective where diametrically opposing views on the effectiveness of trade policies are common—from both a theoretical and empirical standpoint.Footnote 3 Economic theory is ambiguous about the relationship between trade policy and growth. On the one hand, tariffs can harm growth by increasing import prices, curtailing competition and preventing the exploitation of comparative advantage. On the other hand, temporary tariff protection can potentially benefit infant industries (Williamson 1990) and boost growth by aiding the discovery of dynamic comparative advantages (Rodríguez and Rodrik 2000). Similar divergence exists in the conclusions of empirical research. For example, O’Rourke (2000) finds a significantly positive correlation between tariffs and growth in the late nineteenth century for a panel of ten countries. Using data for 22 countries over the period 1920–1940, Vamvakidis (2002) concludes that, controlling for other determinants of economic growth, tariffs provided a positive and statistically significant growth effect. Clemens and Williamson (2004) studied the interwar period within the context of the “tariff–growth paradox”. They found that in the pre-1914 period, tariffs were positively related to economic growth, in contrast to the post-WWII period where much of the evidence points to a negative relationship. The interwar period is then viewed as a transition period between the two regimes. Using a panel study of 35 countries over the period 1919–1938, they find there is no evidence of a statistically significant negative relationship. Focusing specifically on the 1930s, they find that the four core economies—Britain, France, Germany and the USA—benefited from significant positive tariff effects during the cyclical recovery period after 1932. In contrast, using a panel data set of 16 OECD countries, Madsen (2009) tests the relationship between trade openness (using tariff rates as a proxy variable) and economic growth, reporting a significant negative effect from tariffs on economic growth in the interwar period. The differing results suggest the presence of significant heterogeneity across countries and over time. We seek to add value to this debate by clarifying the evidence at the national level using micro-level data for UK manufacturing industries during the interwar period. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 describes our updated and extended industry-level classification of tariff rates in the 1930s. Section 3 presents the empirical strategy and results. Section 4 concludes.",3

Values and identities are inseparably linked, and many states build on particular state identities. The USSR built its legitimacy on the Communist identity and The Holy Roman Empire (HRE) on Catholic identity. One way of attaining legitimacy is by using extrinsic incentives—hereby referred to as coercion—to deter the spread of non-state identities, such as religious identities in the USSR and Protestants in the HRE.Footnote 1 The authorities of the USSR and the HRE were free to impose whatever level of coercion they wished. Yet, occasionally, if not always, they restrained their use of coercion, and, their non-state identities persisted. How can we understand the use and effect of coercion against non-state identities? If people choose to internalize the identity that gives them the highest extrinsic utility, group identities will be a function of the institutional environment.Footnote 2 This would imply that everyone internalises the most opportune identity. In most cases, this would be the identity aligned with the ruling regime. The state’s ability to instil its state identity by use of coercion would then be unlimited. If this was the case, the dynamics of religious, national, or ideological identities could be ignored in political economy analysis. However, this understanding would poorly account for the following two stylized facts regarding state coercion against non-state identities: Restrained coercion use: coercion levels in consolidated authoritarian states with strong state capacity vary across states and within states over time. If coercion had unlimited efficacy, one would expect there to be little variation in the coercion level, and, that the coercion level would be persistently high in stable authoritarian states with high state capacity. Varying persistence of non-state identities: non-state identities in hostile institutional environments can be remarkably persistent, as demonstrated by the historical evidence of Jews in medieval Spain, as presented in Greif and Tadelis (2010). In contrast, other historical examples, like David Laitin’s study of the Russian diaspora in the former USSR (Laitin 1998), reveal prompt adoption of new beliefs, norm sets, and national identities. In order to account for these two stylized facts, we focus on the micro-assumption of an intrinsic counteraction to the use of coercion, which we refer to as coercion resentment. The paper embeds the assumption of coercion resentment and an insurrection risk on the use of coercion into Bisin and Verdier’s (2001) overlapping generations (OLG) model of identities. In this model, we analyse a game between an authority seeking to maximize the prevalence of the state identity by using coercion, and, non-state identity parents seeking to socialize their children according to their own identity. The authority sets the coercion level whereupon the parents choose how much to invest into socializing their children into the non-state identity, and, whether or not to insurrect. The model analyses how a rational legitimacy maximizing authority sets the coercion level when coercion triggers two opposing effects: the extrinsic incentives to comply and the intrinsic incentives to resist. The balance of these effects determines the prevalence of the non-state identity and, thus, their ability to insurrect against the authority. The paper develops four novel theoretical results. Here, we present historical evidence for these results by considering historical episodes that fit the premise of our model: Stalin of the USSR and the monarchs of early-modern France and the HRE. These authorities had clear and stated agendas to use the state apparatus to deter socialization of their respective non-state identities. They also lacked any institutional constraints on their use of coercion. The results of the model discussed below: Restraints We show that if an authority seeking to maximize legitimacy restrains its use of coercion, it must imply a nonlinear coercion resentment response by the non-state identity parents. In order to assess the validity of this result, we review historical evidence from Stalin’s secularization policies towards Christians and Muslims in the USSR (1922–1953). This secularization project was conducted in a comparatively cautious manner in regions where cultural differences were larger, recognizing the potential counterproductiveness of secularization attempts, thereby supporting the basic premise of the model. Coercion dependence We show how authorities can be dependent on applying coercion to sustain their rule. This occurs if removing coercion sufficiently increases the prevalence of the non-state group, and, thus, their insurrection capability, thereby causing the non-state identity group to choose to commit an insurrection. We apply the analytic tool of coercion dependence to analyse the spread of Protestantism following Luther (1517). The introduction of the new protestant identity posed a direct threat to the unity of the HRE, which built its legitimacy on the Catholic faith. Separatist elements used the Protestant faith actively to deter the influence of the ruling Hapsburg elite, thereby posing an existential threat to the HRE state. Dynamically stable equilibrium We show what combinations of non-state identity prevalence and coercion levels are stable in the long run. By long run, we imply a time interval such that the insurrection capability of the non-state group determined by their prevalence. The prevalence of the non-state group and, thus, the insurrection capability constraining the authority, is determined by the coercion level. Thus, setting the long run coercion level becomes a dynamic problem. We show that there are three unique classes of coercion levels that may constitute a dynamically stable equilibrium (DSE). We also show that every legitimacy maximizing authority will impose, or be in a process of imposing, a uniquely determined DSE. The French crown experience of The Reformation can be understood as a move from a short-term equilibrium to a long-term DSE. The crown went from a non-confrontational policy of appeasement of the Protestants with the Edict of Nantes in 1589 to the gradual increase in pressure to adopt the Catholic faith, thereby making public worship for Protestants illegal, and finally imposing the death penalty for practizing Protestantism at the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. Path dependency We show how authorities with equal military technology and population responses to coercion can have different DSE. This occurs when different initial sizes of non-state identity groups give authorities different sets of coercion levels they might implement without causing an insurrection. Hence, the model displays path dependency: past shocks might affect what coercion levels are currently implementable, and thus the current DSE. We review comparative evidence from the Counter Reformation in early modern France and the HRE (1517–1685) to see if the mechanism of path dependency can explain the freezing pattern in the map of religious identities in Europe following the Peace of Westphalia in 1648.Footnote 3 This paper is part of the literature on mathematical models explaining the spread of cultural traits. This literature began with Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman (1981), which pioneered the application of OLG models inspired by Darwinian biology to analyse the spread of cultural phenomenon. Boyd and Richerson (1988) extend this analysis by allowing for culture to be adopted from both parents and society in general. Bisin and Verdier (2000, 2001) focus on explaining why populations do not converge to a single identity equilibrium as children will be more likely to adopt a majority identity through socialization from society in general.Footnote 4 They explain equilibrium persistence of minority identities from the asymmetry in the cost of failed parental investment, thereby giving minority parents greater incentive to invest into socialization.Footnote 5 
Greif and Tadelis (2010) address identity persistence in the presence of a state authority seeking homogeneity. Greif and Tadelis (2010) account for the persistence of non-state identities in the presence of coercive states by focusing on the role of the ability to conceal one’s identity in public life to avoid incurring the cost of coercion. In their model, the efficacy of coercion is limited by that at a certain level of coercion, parents choose to conceal their non-state identity rather than incurring the cost of coercion. Further, they discuss the role of schooling and how the distance between values and policies can weaken the ability of institutions to propagate its values. This paper extends the model developed by Bisin and Verdier (2000, 2001) and Greif and Tadelis (2010) by adding coercion resentment and analysing the insurrection constraint on coercion. The agents in the model of Greif and Tadelis (2010) are static in the sense that they do not intrinsically respond to coercion; in contrast, our model introduces an intrinsic negative reaction to the use of coercion. This enables our model to account both for a rational authority restraining its use of coercion under certain conditions while using high levels under others. Our model is also novel in that it analyses the non-state parent’s insurrection decision. The insurrection decision is modelled by introducing an upper insurrection constraint on the authority’s use of coercion dependent on the size of the non-state identity group. The insurrection constraint’s interaction with the variation in the efficacy of coercion, arising from coercion resentment, enables the model to explain long-term dynamics in the relationship between the authority and the non-state group. We consider how authorities can be dependent on applying coercion to avoid insurrections and how path dependency arises. This paper relates to four strands of the economic theory literature: social economics (Akerlof and Kranton 2000; Bisin et al. 2011; Carvalho and Koyama 2013; Carvalho 2013), group conflict (Sambanis and Shayo 2013; Acemoglu and Wolitzky 2014), state legitimacy (Johnson and Koyama 2013; Greif and Rubin 2014; Saleh and Tirole 2019), and path dependency in societal outcomes (Rubin 2011; Bisin and Verdier 2017; Besley and Persson 2019; Acemoglu and Robinson 2019). The paper also relates to the literature on nation-building (Alesina and Reich 2013) and optimal sizes of nations as a trade-off between homogeneity and economies of scale (Alesina and Spolaore 2005). In particular, this paper relates to Alesina and Reich (2013) and Alesina and Spolaore (2005) by developing micro-foundation of the limit of nation-building and developing formal prerequisites for when nations will contain two identities. The remainder of this paper is organized in the following manner: Sections 1.1 and 1.2 discuss the main assumption of the model, legitimacy maximization, and coercion resentment. Section 1 extends the OLG model of Bisin and Verdier (2000, 2001), to include a legitimacy-maximizing authority, coercion resentment, and an endogenously determined insurrection constraint. The section then discusses the validity of the results in light of the historical evidence. Section 2 provides a concluding discussion. The appendices contain proofs, the baseline model of Bisin and Verdier (2000), and, further analysis of our model. A premise of the formal model is that authorities seek to maximize legitimacy. It is not claimed that this policy objective is always the prime directive for every authority. Clearly, authorities have additional, occasionally conflicting, agendas. Historical work generally confirms that legitimacy maximizing was an agenda for the authorities we consider—the monarchs of the European early modernity (Johnson and Koyama 2019) and the leaders of the USSR (Froese 2008). We return to discuss this in more detail in the historical section. Here, we present a few arguments as to why maximization of legitimacy often can be an interesting baseline, ceteris paribus, assumption for understanding the coercive policies of authorities.Footnote 6 To any authority, having a high level of legitimacy is desirable for a number of reasons: as Max Weber argues, it increases the probability of remaining in power. If the people of a state do not adhere to the states identity, the identity they adhere to can be used as a legitimization for overturning the state. Another key motivation of states in building national, ideological or religious identities is to make populations respond in a manner that is emotionally related to the identity represented by the state. This is what makes religious and national identities powerful tools for authorities—the ability of internalized norms to invoke reactions that align the interest of the individual with the perceived interest of imagined national, political, or religious communities. Thus, legitimacy reduces costs and expands the possibility frontier of imposing policy (Greif 2008); in addition, it increases the willingness for altruistic behaviour, such as conscription (Levi 1997), or paying taxes (Levi 1999). Finally, a population with homogeneous identities enables central policymaking (Tilly 1992); indeed, services like law and policing, hinge on and grow out of common sets of norms and values. In the short term, the most obvious means to gain legitimacy is to take norms and values as given, and rule in accordance with the prevailing majority identity. To authorities in polities with heterogeneous identities, this implies making compromises between identities where they are incompatible, typically at the cost of reduced legitimacy (Johnson and Koyama 2013). However, states might enhance their legitimacy by increasing the proportion of the population with internalized norms similar to those on which the state builds its institutions. This can be done either by application of “sticks” (disincentives and coercion) or “carrots” (increasing the incentives of belonging to the authorities’ identity). Other measures include increasing socialization and easing communication by creating common standards — that is through building of roads, language standardization, common school systems, and investing in common symbols. We focus on the “stick” approach—coercion—and how it invokes an intrinsic negative reaction, thereby making it a potentially counterproductive measure. To the extent that “carrots”, i.e. positive incentives, invoke a negative reaction amongst the members of the non-state identity, the analysis generalizes to authorities imposing positive incentives for adhering to their identity. Coercion resentment is defined as the response of increasing behaviour that coercion intends to reduce. In the formal model we develop below, we narrow down this definition. Here, coercion resentment is the response of increasing socialization of the non-state identity as a reaction to state coercion. This section focuses on evidence of a micro-level coercion resentment.Footnote 7 States applying coercion to deter socialization of non-state identities to attain assimilation can cause a backlash effect of increased mobilization in the non-state group (Tilly and Ardant 1975; Allardt 1979; Rokkan 1999; Fouka 2016; Fukuyama 2018). A study of socialization investment of German-Americans in the 1920’s, Fouka (2016) shows how this backlash effect can increase socialization investments. Fouka (2016) studies the effect of German language restrictions in American schools following WWI integration of Germans into an American identity, comparing school districts in Ohio and Indiana that imposed language restrictions for exogenous reasons, to those that did not. She finds that such restrictions significantly increase the tendency of German-Americans to give their children German names to distinguish them from Americans. This among other plausible sources of higher socialization, caused the children in districts with language bans to be significantly more likely to marry other Germans. This indicates that choosing German names appears to be a successful strategy for these parents in increasing group cohesion. Thus, increasing the cost of having a German identity increased the investment into children holding a German identity. A parallel study, Fouka (2017), finds that Germans responded to discrimination from general society — measured by voting and violence motivated by nationality—by decreasing their investment into socialization. This happens as a response to increasing the cost of having a German-American identity. Thus, German-Americans responded to targeted intentional measures by increasing socialization, while an untargeted general increase in cost lead them to reduce socialization. This could be explained by the coercion resentment response. Coercion resentment can be considered as irrational to the individual, in the sense that it causes the individual to increase a type of behaviour that becomes more costly for both the “sender” of the identity (parent) and “receiver” (child). The following section considers what motivates coercion resentment by examining evidence from behavioural sciences. The response of coercion resentment could be an emergent phenomenon arising from the interaction between other fundamental human drives. Here, we review five types of motivation documented in the behavioural sciences that can interact to create coercion resentment: Rejection of dominance hierarchies  One way to understand coercion resentment is as a specific behaviour arising from a more general human tendency of the rejecting of hierarchy. State coercion attempts to silence the non-state identity group. For the non-state group, state coercion can be understood as a means of subduing their members to a privileged group: the state identity group. This type of subduing can trigger an resentment among the non-state group. Humans have anti-hierarchical feelings, prefer reciprocal treatment, and are sensitive to the use of coercion (Woodburn 1982; Gintis and Van Schaik 2013). For an individual, being averse to coercion produces behaviour that has both costs and benefits. The benefits of an innate negative reaction to coercion are that it results in behaviour that makes it less likely to be taken advantage of. The cost of being averse to coercion is the cost of conflict and forgoing beneficial relations that are perceived to be coercive. Then, the aversion of humans to coercion must reflect the cost and benefit ratio in the environment of the evolutionary history of human populations. In general, humans are comparatively egalitarian relative to other primates. Woodburn (1982) proposes that an explanation for this is the comparatively low cost of killing conspecifics among humans compared to the cost for other primates. During the long period during which humans developed in small hunter-gatherer societies, every member had access to lethal hunting weapons and would-be coercive leaders had little way of protecting them from ambush. Therefore, coercive human leaders were easy targets for lower-ranking humans. Comparatively, the cost of killing a coercive chimpanzee leader would be much higher in terms of risk and effort for low ranking-chimpanzees lacking in efficient weapons. Hence, human leaders would have had to be comparatively more cautious in using coercion in our long period as hunter-gatherers. This made a general innate aversion to coercion less costly for early humans, and, thus, a more adaptive trait. Reciprocity Coercion resentment can arise as a group-level version of the general trait of reciprocity (Bowles and Gintis 2011): the tendency to retaliate against hostile actions and reward beneficial actions. The assumed mechanism is that individuals that have internalized the coerced identity and feel that the authority has harmed their group, wish to punish the group associated with the coercion through activities aimed at stopping the influence of the authorities. Salience of fulfilling internalized norms Coercion can increase the salience of acting in accordance with internalized norms. For non-state identity individuals, one means to alleviate the dissonance is confronting individuals of the state identity and curb the spread of their identity. In other words, an individual who has internalized a set of values will receive intrinsic utility from actively deterring the influence of an authority pursuing an agenda of opposing his values by increasing rather than decreasing socialization of the coerced identity. Signalling pro-sociality Once coercion is imposed on an identity, defying the coercion and acting according to the coerced identity become costly, and can, hence, be used as a credible social signal of being intrinsically motivated. Our need to fulfil our internalized norms most likely arises from a need to signal pro-sociality, both to ourselves and others. Humans appear comparatively more interested in signalling pro-sociality, possibly arising from early humans participating in tasks that require reliance on cooperation, and magnified by the sum of collective efforts, such as big-game hunting and warfare (Jaeggi et al. 2010; Turchin 2016). Parochial altruism As coercion towards the non-state identity increases, the authority will be considered as a threat to the non-state identity group. This increased external threat may invoke an emotional reaction that triggers a need to protect the group. This increases investment in social identity activities for individuals who have internalized the non-state identity. Thus, the presence of a threat to the group increases in-group identity and strengthens hostility towards the out-group. This out-group threat effect is documented to increase the number of different group-related behaviours, including increased investment in socialization (Huddy et al. 2013).",

New evidence on elite numeracy is presented for the first time, allowing for the long-term relationship between elite violence and elite numeracy to be examined. This study uses a variety of econometric techniques, from panel regressions to spatial methods, first difference regressions to instrumental variable estimation; finding that declines in violence determined growth in elite numeracy in certain European countries since the medieval period, such as in England and the Netherlands. Similarly, higher levels of elite violence corresponded to lower elite numeracy in Eastern and South-Eastern European countries, for example, leading to Europe’s famous divergence movement (van Zanden 2009, De Pleijt and van Zanden 2016; Broadberry 2013). Additionally, we contribute to a modestly sized but growing literature on elite numeracy. To demonstrate that the upper tail of the knowledge distribution mattered for growth, Squicciarini and Voigtländer (2015) use the example of the industrial revolution in France. Inspired engineers and bold entrepreneurs were able to establish firms using recently developed technologies and subsequently developed various technologies further. Baten and van Zanden (2008) studied advanced human capital using book consumption and drew parallels with growth in the sixteenth century, when several European countries managed to set up growth-promoting institutions due to human capital. This resulted in a system of trading cities and merchants who coordinated world trade as far back as the sixteenth century. In general, the debate around explanations for the Great Divergence, which saw Western Europe become the world’s chief economic force during the modern era, has produced advocates for geography, institutional design, gender equality, human capital and a host of other explanatory factors as key elements of Western Europe’s ascent (Bosker et al. 2013; Allen 2001; Diebolt et al. 2017; Diebolt and Perrin 2013; Broadberry 2013). In contrast, the role of violence has not received much attention, except in the studies on the ‘war generates states’ hypothesis, which goes back to Tilly et al. (1975): while many influential studies traditionally focused on the strong state as an obstacle to development (Acemoglu et al. 2005), a recent strand of the literature picked up the Tilly et al. hypothesis, arguing that the experiences of war and conflict allowed tax capacities to develop—most notably during the 100 years’ War in France—which stimulated innovations in tax collection to finance standing armies (North 2000; Hoffman 2012). A wider set of related studies focused on war as the basis of a state’s capacity to tax, arguing that after wars generated taxation states, the resulting state capacity subsequently allowed for more stable development (see, for example, Dincecco 2015; O’Brien 2011; Hoffman 2015). This set of hypotheses is clearly a point of departure for our study. Our strategy for approaching these questions relies on proxy indicators, as standard indicators of violence and human capital are not available for early periods of European history. Hence, we establish a new indicator that is able to trace the development of elite numeracy over the very long term—the share of rulers for whom a birth year is reported in conventional biographical sources. We reason that a ruler’s birth year was regularly reported and entered into historical chronologies only if the elite bureaucracies around those rulers were capable of processing numerical information with ease; otherwise, they were simply forgotten and left unrecorded. Below, we discuss a number of potential biases and reason that they do not invalidate our proxy indicator for elite numeracy. We also report correlations with other indicators of elite numeracy in medieval societies for which both metrics were simultaneously available in the same location. As a proxy indicator for interpersonal violence among the elite, we use the share of murdered rulers. If killed, rulers were typically murdered by their own family members or by competing nobility (see Keywood and Baten 2018). The kingdom’s elite was also affected by the fear of becoming victims to violent death themselves if the ruler was killed—murder, particularly of a central figure, creates an atmosphere of fear in society. This external effect of violence is also supported by twentieth century evidence from psychology literature (OECD 2011; Baten et al. 2014). We have also studied to what degree regicide is correlated with nobilicide, the killing of the nobility, as Cummins (2017) provides valuable data on nobility killed in military conflicts. The correlation is very close, indicating that regicide may also serve as a proxy indicator for the wider elite (see Appendix, Fig. 19). Clearly, violence was not the only factor that mattered for elite numeracy. Hence, we also include religion, geography, institutional factors such as serfdom and early electoral elements of ruler succession, as well as other potential determinants. In order to study the relationship between elite violence and elite numeracy, we use a battery of econometric techniques. Since endogeneity, spatial autocorrelation or temporal autocorrelation may affect our estimates, we use two-stage least squares, controls for spatial autocorrelation, unit root tests, time fixed effects and first difference estimates. Hence, in this study, given the clear relevance of elite human capital, we take an additional step and uncover the medieval roots of the divergence of elite numeracy in Europe. Our approach allows us to resolve crucial questions in European history such as why elite numeracy advanced or declined in certain regions and periods rather than in others, and why that process took place at disparate rates. For example, there was a strong increase in elite numeracy in Italy and Iberia during the late medieval and renaissance periods, while it stagnated in South-Eastern Europe at the same time. Before this period, the European east—which included Constantinople as well as certain less densely populated regions—had an elite numeracy level at least equal to that of Western Europe.",5

As these are processes with a strong path dependence (David 1985), decisions that were made long ago continue to directly and intensely affect society in areas as diverse as economic growth (Peters 2003; Calderón and Servén 2004; Faber 2014), territorial cohesion (Badenoch 2010; Crescenzi and Rodríguez-Pose 2012; Monzon et al. 2019; Naranjo Gómez 2016), urban development (Weber 2012; Modarres and Dierwechter 2015) or electoral processes (Nall 2015, 2018). Consequently, knowledge of the motivations behind the implementation of the new transport infrastructures, of the economic and territorial effects they induced and of the adequacy of their design are therefore important focuses of attention not only for academic analysis but also for social and political debate. In this area, the development of national road networks is one of the issues of greatest interest since they form the basis on which the other transport networks are implemented. The works about the European motorway network (Peters 2003; Badenoch 2010; Crescenzi and Rodríguez-Pose 2012), the Chinese (Faber 2014) or the American one (Nall 2015; Modarres and Dierwechter 2015) are clear examples of this interest. Improvements in transport infrastructure have been considered by centuries (Ward 1762; Smith 1776) as essentially positive, as they lead to economic growth and poverty alleviation through reductions in transport costs and the facilitation of market integration (Calderón and Servén 2004). However, accessibility problems can sometimes benefit certain economically weaker territories by protecting their producers from competition from other regions with lower costs and greater product variety (Peters 2003). If the development of new transport networks is to improve territorial balance, there must be sectors capable of withstanding increased competition; otherwise, market integration can lead to self-sustaining inequality (Martin 1999; Asher and Paul 2016). On the other hand, the long time required for the development of road networks can generate permanent differential effects on the development of regions even if the final design is territorially neutral. During the period of network construction, traffic flows are altered, possibly inducing variations in the comparative advantage of cities that can become permanent and subsist after completion (Berger and Enflo 2017) or even after their disappearance (Bleakley and Lin 2012; Aggarwal 2018). The case we concern ourselves within this paper, namely the design and first development of the contemporary Spanish road network, falls within this area of research, although it is older than the cases mentioned above. Interestingly, more than two centuries after Charles III formally established the guidelines that determined its design and its present structure, it continues to be the object of lively social attention, as evidenced by the large number of recent historical (Rosés et al. 2010; Martínez-Galarraga 2010; Bel 2011; Martinez-Galarraga 2012; Fernández-de Pinedo Echevarría and Fernández-de Pinedo Fernández 2013; Díez-Minguela et al. 2016) and non-historical academic works (Bel 2010; Molinas 2013; Holl 2011, 2012; Garcia-López 2012; Martínez-Galarraga et al. 2015; Garcia-López et al. 2015; Holl 2016), as well as by the abundant news or political discussionsFootnote 1 that take place around it. However, the scope of this paper goes way beyond the specific historic process we study: We are introducing a methodology combining deep and thorough historical research, computer geolocalization techniques, analytical tools of complex network science and agent-based modeling, that can be applied to many other processes. It is becoming increasingly clear that sizable gains can be realized from research that seeks to better understand how local history and context can be leveraged to inform the design of better policy (Nunn 2020). As we will see below, our methodology can be very useful in that context, providing deep insights such as assessing whether a process is path-dependent or not, identifying the effects and disequilibria of processes at multiple levels (national, regional, town), studying counterfactuals to advise policy making, and in sum, providing a faithful picture of the system of interest useful for understanding the past and handling the future. The origin of the current radial structure of the Spanish road network and, in general, of its transport network, has been the object of extensive historical debate (Tortella 1973; Nadal 1975; Artola et al. 1978; Mateo del Peral 1978; Gómez Mendoza 1982; Comín Comín et al. 1998; Bel 2011) due to its influence on Spain’s subsequent economic development and its territorial imbalances, but most of the available research addresses the period after 1850. In turn, the possibility that the decisions are taken in the eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries regarding the design of the transport networks have generated a lock-in (Arthur 1989) that has prevented the subsequent development of more efficient transport networks at present is an issue of great relevance but has not been the subject of many quantitative studies. As far as we know, the studies that have analyzed it from a quantitative perspective have been very limited and focused on the railways (Equipo Urbano 1972; Martí-Romero et al. 2020). The works of Carreras Montfort and de Soto are an important exception, but they mainly refer to the Roman period (Carreras Montfort and de Soto 2013; de Soto 2019). Their analysis for the roads of the eighteenth century uses the work of Escribano (1758) as a main geographical reference, which implies a significant restriction in terms of time reference and potential geographical bias as they acknowledge (Carreras Monfort and de Soto 2010, p. 13). The works that have provided a more direct and quantitative approach to the eighteenth-century road network make a somewhat negative assessment of it (Madrazo Madrazo 1984b; Uriol Salcedo 2001; Martinez-Galarraga 2012). However, these works concern themselves more with an assessment of its results than with a detailed analysis of its layout comparing it with other alternative designs of the network. In fact, other authors accepted that there were some improvements from the previous situation (Herranz-Loncán 2005; Grafe 2012). In this context, it has to be borne in mind that path dependence and consequent lock-in are phenomena that occur under particular conditions and are the result of underlying, more fundamental mechanisms (Vromen 1995). Therefore, it is necessary to adopt an approach of ‘path as process,’ in which the development of road networks must be understood as a continuous process of generation and destruction of optimal trajectories for the agents which produce a transformation of the existing socioeconomic structures and regional development trajectories (Garud and Karnøe 2001; Martin and Sunley 2006). This aligns with what Bednar et al. (2012) calls ‘revised-path dependence,’ which is of crucial importance in the interpretation of political and legal issues but also economic decisions. This implies as well that policy choices as the construction of new roads must be evaluated in light of decisions taken during the process, not just the final equilibrium. For our work on the origin and evolution of the radial structure of the Spanish road network, these ideas lead us to ask whether the design of the network was unavoidable given the topological characteristics of the territory or whether it resulted from small events as the political decisions. From our point of view, an event generates path dependence when it alters the preexisting dynamics in the system, by exceeding its capacity of resilience. This resilience is usually high, and non-chaotic dynamic systems show a tendency to maintain and recover their dynamics, but if the actions or influences on it exceed certain thresholds they can change their evolution in a lasting way in time. In this framework, the road network can be seen as a system in which the links are continuously weakened and require maintenance to remain functional. Improvements to the sections require specific investments to take place. The flows between the nodes derive from their relative position and size, but this is, in turn, affected by the network. There is, therefore, a dynamic of the development of the nodes that can be altered depending on decisions such as the order of execution of the works. This is a complex phenomenon and is multi-scale both in terms of time and space. From a historical viewpoint, the process is affected by the vision of permanence of the human being, and events that last more than one generation are usually considered to be permanent even though they are not permanent. From the spatial point of view, events that do not produce permanent changes in the system when considered as a whole can produce very relevant alterations at the local level. All this makes the consideration of an event as a path-dependent one always complicated and requires a precise definition of the reference framework and the spatial domain under consideration. From the perspective summarized above, in this paper, we use historical data, GIS techniques, and network analysis, to critically examine three statements widely discussed in the literature but far from empirically validated. The first statement is that the dynastic change after the War of Succession meant the ex novo implementation of a radial design of the road network that replaced a preexisting, less centralized one. The works about the issue consider that the radial structure of the Spanish communications network arises around 1720 through the General Regulations for the Direction and Government of the Post and Post Offices of Spain (Uriol Salcedo 1977; Madrazo Madrazo 1984a, b; Ruiz et al. 2015) or, alternatively, and focusing on the roads, with the Royal Decree issued in 1761 to make straight and solid roads in Spain and to facilitate trade between provinces (de Gregorio - Marqués de Esquilache 1761). This radial structure is usually linked to a more centralized vision of Spain motivated by the Enlightened vision of the new dynasty (Uriol Salcedo 1985a, b; Shaw 2009; Carreras Monfort and de Soto 2010; Bel 2011; Garcia-López et al. 2015; López Ortiz and Melgarejo Moreno 2016). To analyze this statement more precisely, we have divided it into two hypotheses: H1A: ‘The newly paved roads of the pre-rail period imply the introduction of a new network design.’ H1.B: ‘The changes in the road network are linked to the Enlightenment vision of the State that came with the Bourbon dynasty.’ The second statement posits that the new roads generated significant changes in the transport network that led to improving the communications of Madrid with the periphery instead of activating the growth of the interior regions (Ringrose 1972; Anes 1974; Carr 1978; Madrazo Madrazo 1984b). To verify this statement, quite consolidated in the literature though not entirely (Grafe 2012), we will use three hypotheses: H2.A ‘The newly paved roads produced important changes on the interregional mobility patterns’; H2.B ‘The improvements in accessibility resulting from the newly paved roads were concentrated in a few regions, mainly Madrid and the coastal regions, which was a comparative disadvantage for the inland regions,’ or, in other words, ‘those investments affected the regions differently’; H2.C ‘The effects were mainly at the level of cities, not so much of regions.’ Finally, the third statement we address is whether the network design is compatible with diverse economic efficiency criteria. More precisely, we consider two hypotheses: First, H3.A ‘the radial network designed by the Bourbon monarchs of the second half of the eighteenth century emerges from a distributed decision-making process in which all the populations of the nation are taken into account in a non-discriminatory manner’ (Martinez-Galarraga 2012). Second, H3.B, ‘the military, political or administrative criteria outlined by various authors (Ringrose, Gómez Mendoza, Madrazo, Bel) are compatible with that of maximizing commercial traffic’ (Ringrose 1972; Anes 1974; Madrazo Madrazo 1984a, b; Gómez Mendoza 2001; Bel 2011). Our research is based on three pillars. First, we carry out an in-depth historic analysis of the time evolution of the land communications in Spain, from the mid-sixteenth century through the eighteenth century. Our work presents the most detailed and well-documented study of this process to date, based on an exhaustive search of relevant maps and reports about the structure of the road network. Second, we resort to complex network analysis techniques, that are becoming widely used in many disciplines, to quantify the effect of the historical evolution of the road network on the communication structure of the territory. Finally, we introduce an agent-based model that allows us to explore different counterfactuals to obtain a network that would result from different decision-making processes. We compare centralized processes with other coordinated, democratic alternatives that considered the distribution of the population in the territory, assessing the relevance of politically motivated decisions on the evolution of the network.",8

Such a large proportion of workers’ income was spent on grain-based food that grain prices, to a large extent, determined the real wage levels and affected general consumer patterns (e.g. Hoskins 1964, 1968; Appleby 1979; Van Zanden 1999; Allen 2000; Campbell 2010). The entire economy was highly grain dependent, with taxes and land rents largely obtained from the surplus of grain agriculture (Le Roy Ladurie and Goy 1982; Leijonhufvud 2001; Edvinsson 2009). This predominant role of cereals in the economy made grain trade one of the most important and well-monitored fields of commerce (Rahlf 1996; Persson 1999; Federico 2011; Bateman 2011; Chilosi et al. 2013). An inadequate supply of grain, triggering high prices, frequently caused economic destitution, civil unrest, malnutrition, and even famines (e.g. Abel 1974; Pfister 1988; Mauelshagen 2010; Alfani and Ó Gráda 2017). The causes of variations in grain yields and prices in early modern (c. 1500–1800) Europe are a research topic first initiated over two centuries ago (e.g. Herschel 1801). Determining the extent to which grain prices were affected by climate variabilityFootnote 1, or mediated through climate-influencing factors such as solar variability, and whether such relationships were episodic or periodic (cyclic)Footnote 2, are long-standing research problems approached from both (economic) history and the environmental sciences. This research has employed data of various quantities and qualities and has been conducted at different levels of statistical rigour. Here, we revisit the question of direct influences of climate variability, and indirect influences of solar variability, on grain prices in early modern Europe within a framework of comprehensive and internally consistent statistical analysis.Footnote 3 To achieve these goals, we employ the so far largest collection of grain price series of multi-centennial length from across Europe, early instrumental climate series, state-of-the-art palaeoclimate reconstructions, and the latest generation of solar variability estimates. We first provide an overview of previous work on the influence of climate (Sect. 2.1) and solar variability (Sect. 2.2) on grain prices in early modern Europe, then identify research gaps (Sect. 2.3), present the data and methods (Sect. 3), and results of our analyses (Sect. 4), and finally discuss various implications and associated uncertainties (Sect. 5).",9

Charting the global patterns of within-country inequality and investigating the potential drivers of these patterns over time are a crucial task for economic historians. Despite the growing interest, the evidence documenting inequality in developing countries pre-dating the 1960s remains scarce (only 20 data points for Ginis in the pre-1960s Global South were recently enumerated by Lindert and Williamson 2017: 292–293). This study contributes by gauging the level of income inequality in Indonesia, then known as the Dutch East Indies, in the early twentieth century. Indonesia was, after India, the largest and most populous European colony and one of the main producers of the tropical commodities (such as rubber and sugar) that fuelled the global economy in this period. The case of Indonesia thus allows to analyse how inequality is affected by global trade within a colonial institutional context. This is particularly important as both the level of inequality and its effects for economic development are influenced by the wider institutional setting (Bennett and Nikolaev 2017; Holcombe and Boudreaux 2016). Some recent research suggests that economic development is negatively affected by high levels of inequality when economic freedom is lacking (Apergis et al. 2013), such as under colonialism. This is not the first study of inequality in colonial Indonesia. Geertz (1963) famously suggested that the Javanese in the nineteenth century suffered from fast population growth that led to decreasing inequality and “shared poverty”. Investigations by Booth (1988, 1998) have highlighted a high degree of inequality, especially between different ethnic groups (Indonesians, Chinese and Europeans) in the late colonial period. van Zanden and Marks (2012) note a substantial increase in inequality between 1880 and 1925 as the Gini rose from 0.39 to 0.48. A study by Leigh and van der Eng (2010) examined the share of total income that went into the pockets of the top 1% of Indonesian society. They find that the top 1 percent obtained 12 percent of the total income in 1921, which increased to over 22 percent in 1933–1934 and then declined slightly to just under 20 percent in 1938–1939. In a recent study, van Leeuwen and Földvári (2017) found high and increasing levels of inequality from the 1920s to the late 1930s with Ginis of around 0.50. Additionally, they find that the share of Indonesians living below the poverty line increased substantially over the colonial era. In terms of explaining the trends in inequality, many of these authors emphasize the role played by global export trade. Leigh and van der Eng (2010) suggest that increasing top income shares in the 1920s and early 1930s was the result of drops in global commodity prices that hit smaller farmers in Indonesia more than the top income earners, who were largely shielded from such developments. van Leeuwen and Földvári (2017: 387) note that rising inequality was possibly caused by increased land rents due to the growth of cash crop production for the global market. They build on the argument made by Williamson (2011, 2015) for colonial Southeast Asia more broadly who argued that in land abundant countries increased global trade tended to benefit landholders rather than labourers. Most recently, Booth (2019: 104) confirms this line of thinking and notes that, for example, in Java the ratio of rent to wage payments clearly rose throughout the 1920s and 1930s. None of these studies, however, have investigated how inequality varied between different parts of the archipelago, but rather analysed trends for Indonesia as a whole. Yet because Indonesia is such a large (not much smaller than Europe in its entirety) and diverse country, differences in both levels and trends of inequality at the sub-national level may be substantial (see also recent work by Bosma 2019). In addition, studies have pointed out the divergent impact of Dutch colonialism in Java compared with the so-called Outer Islands of Indonesia (i.e. Sumatra, Borneo, Bali, Lombok, Celebes, New Guinea, Timor, Ternate, and the Moluccas) (Foldvari et al. 2013). Others noted the differences in colonial rule and patterns of development across Java (e.g. Elson 1994), and between the various regions in the Outer Islands (Touwen 2001). In this article, I put forth new estimates of inequality for colonial Indonesia in the first half of the twentieth century. In doing so, the focus, in contrast to the studies mentioned above, is not to sketch the long-run trends in inequality, but to find out to what extent the degree of inequality differed between the various regions of Indonesia. Regional disaggregation of inequality estimates allows to study which factors have influenced the income distribution (Lindert and Williamson 2016; Geloso 2018). Many of the underlying conditions that have been put forward to explain inequality in the past, such as interaction with the global market (Williamson 2011) and the institutional framework in terms of the plantation system (Sokoloff and Engerman 2000), as well as urbanization and population densities (Milanovic 2018), varied greatly across the archipelago. Therefore, in this paper, the unit of analysis will be the residency, which was the administrative level below that of the state and more or less comparable with present-day provinces. A second aim of this paper is to consequently explain some of the variation in inequality levels across the Indonesian archipelago by looking at the role of export trade and the plantation system. This paper proceeds as follows: in Sects. 2 and 3, I will make use of colonial income tax data from the 1920s, evidence on land distribution, agricultural production and wages in the different residencies, in combination with evidence from a number of investigations on the welfare of the indigenous population that were issued at the time, in order to estimate the degree of inequality in the different residencies of Indonesia. In Sect. 4, possible factors influencing the differences in inequality will be examined and it is shown that plantation agriculture is one of the main drivers of high and increasing inequality. Section 5 will offer the main conclusions from this investigation and provides an agenda for further research.",5

This population had risen due to a combination of an increasing birth-rate, fewer epidemics, improved living standards, and progress in food production (Moheau 1778). France was by then the most important (and powerful) European country simply by virtue of its population. Yet a century later France experienced a major and unprecedented decline in the growth of its population, dropping to 5th position among the countries of Europe. Why did France experience the demographic transition first, and in particular, why did it do so a century before any other European country? This question is still one of the greatest puzzles of economics, demography, and economic history. The demographic transition is recognized as playing a key role in France’s economic development. But the mechanisms in play and the origin of the process remain mysterious. The debate is active and divides scientists between those who favor socio-economic explanations and those who prefer cultural and diffusionist explanations (de la Croix and Perrin 2018). France presents marked divergences from the standard model of demographic transition originally developed by Landry (1934) and Notestein (1945). The theory developed by Notestein (1945) relies on the assumption that the transition from a high birth-rate and mortality to low fertility and low mortality is an outcome of economic development and the appearance of a new system resulting from the process of industrialization and urbanization. The modernization of a society through economic development is argued to be a condition for demographic changes. France stands as a notable exception to the classic theory of demographic transition. Two main facts isolate France from classic explanations of the demographic transition. First, the decline in mortality and fertility occurred concurrently. Second, the process started as early as the end of the eighteenth century in a society that was predominantly rural, e.g., well before the industrialization and urbanization of the country (Fig. 1).  Demographic Transition, France 1740–2010. Sources: Data from Chesnais (1992)—INSEE The French–English comparison reveals a puzzling paradox. While the industrial revolution started in England at the end of the eighteenth century and the fertility transition a century later, France experienced its demographic revolution from the end of the eighteenth century and its industrialization only from the second half of the nineteenth century. The long-run trends in French population are difficult to reconcile with what is known of France’s economy (Weir 1984). Why were demographic developments so late in England and so early in France, while economic developments were so early in England and comparatively late in France? These opposite patterns question the mechanisms and predictions of the theoretical literature analyzing the long-run development process, and in particular the transition from stagnation to sustained growth (Galor and Weil 2000; Galor and Moav 2002; Voigtländer and Voth 2006; etc.). The unified growth theory explains with great pertinence the stages of development as captured by empirical regularities for most countries (i.e., industrialization preceding the fertility transition). But these mechanisms are inconsistent in explaining the timing of the French development process. The literature shows consistent economic explanations of the decline in fertility, in the French case as elsewhere,Footnote 1 but the elements needed to reconcile the theory with the observed patterns are still missing. In order to understand why fertility declined, we need to understand how it did so. The aim of this paper is to explain why the demographic transition evolved from its originating conditions. To answer this question, I first investigate the evolution of the marriage pattern in France from before the origins of the demographic transition. Before the development of modern methods of contraception, access to marriage was an important tool used by societies to regulate their population growth (Malthus 1798; Hajnal 1965). Next, I rely on exploratory methods to identify the specificities of French counties and to determine what set of characteristics can explain the early spread of fertility controls in certain counties and their late percolation to others. In the last part of the paper, I discuss my results in light of some of the greatest events that affected French communities and open the discussion to suggest some future directions for theoretical and empirical research. My paper contributes to several strands of research. First, it brings new knowledge to the research on the European Marriage Pattern (EMP) and its dynamics over time. On this basis, my contribution takes part to the discussion initiated by De Moor and van Zanden (2010) and questioned by Dennison and Ogilvie (2014) about the role played by the marriage pattern to explain economic development. I primarily argue that greater female agency can be reflected by a ‘progressive’ marriage pattern characterized by early marriages and low celibacy. I go on to argue that cultural beliefs and the stickiness of traditional norms matter in considering the question of individuals’ control of their fertility. Individuals living in a progressive environment were less constrained by culture and norms with regard to marriage. In these areas, female agency could be directly reflected within marriage. I ultimately argue that areas characterized by greater female agency display higher economic development (higher GDP, lower fertility) in line with Diebolt and Perrin (2013, 2019), van Zanden and the Utrecht group, and Foreman-Peck (2011), but I show that greater female agency does not necessarily require a late marriage and a high degree of celibacy, explaining why Dennison and Ogilvie (2014) find no support for the view that the EMP improved economic performance. An underlying contribution of the paper is to show that indicators of marital fertility should be used with caution when the fertility of a population is in question. In places where the weight of tradition is high, indicators of marital fertility may trigger misleading appreciations of fertility levels by hiding a substantial part of the story. The paper is organized as follows. The accent is put first on the literature related to the European Marriage Pattern (Sect. 2). Second, attention moves to the changing pattern of demographic behavior in France (Sect. 3). Third, I use exploratory methods to investigate the specific characteristics of French counties in the mid-nineteenth century (Sect. 4). Lastly, I discuss my findings in light of the crucial events in France during the eighteenth century (Sect. 5).",5

Atkinson,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Income inequality in South Africa has received much attention. Over the last years, there have been important studies of recent inequality and poverty, and a heated debate about trends in post-apartheid transition.Footnote 1 South Africa has long been regarded as having one of the most unequal societies in the world. Consistent with this view, the country has the highest survey-based Gini coefficient of household consumption per capita in Povcal database (63.4 in 2011; 63 in 2014). In this paper, we approach the subject from a different direction: the extent and evolution of top incomes. We present estimates of the shares in total income of groups such as the top 1% and the top 0.1%, covering, with gaps, more than a hundred years. As in other countries, top incomes are difficult to measure with precision. They are often not well covered by the household surveys that are today the primary source of evidence about the distribution of income. A partial picture can, however, be obtained from the information contained in the income tax returns, and these are the sources employed in this paper. In this field, and in the related area of national income totals, South African researchers were among the pioneers. Leslie (1935, 1936, 1937) used income tax data to examine the effect on the South African distribution of income of the abandonment of the Gold Standard by Britain in 1931. Frankel and Herzfeld (1943) published estimates of the income distribution among “Europeans” in South Africa based on the income tax returns, by making use of control totals from the census of population and from the national accounts; their use of external information to complement income tax data pre-dated by ten years the study of upper income groups in the US by Kuznets (1953). Graaff (1946) assembled a series based on South African Super Tax data covering the years 1915 to 1942 to examine the stability of the distribution and the causes of fluctuations in income concentration. In seeking to exploit the (more than a) century of income tax data now available, we are therefore following in a long-established research tradition. The picture obtained from tax data is only a partial one because not everyone has to provide income information to the tax authorities, and in earlier years, the tax-paying population was a small minority of the total population; they were the better-off and, in the case of South Africa, very largely white. The picture is also partial in that the income recorded, gross income assessed for tax purposes, does not necessarily capture the full extent of the economic advantage accruing to those at the top of the distribution, and certain categories of income, notably dividends, are incompletely covered. Conclusions drawn from the income tax data are therefore surrounded by qualifications. The tax data do however provide insight into the degree of inequality at the top. Combined with external information about the total population and the total income, as in the pioneering work of Frankel and Herzfeld (1943) but covering all races, the tax returns allow estimates to be made of the share of the top 1%. To the extent that the tax definition of income falls short of that ideally applied, these estimates are likely to be an under-statement. Taken together, the historical series covers, with some gaps, more than a hundred years. This was an eventful period. It goes from the colonial days, through the Dominion phase, the Natives Land Act of 1913, the effective independence in 1931, the systematisation of segregation in the form of apartheid following the National Party government elected in 1948, the Group Areas Acts in the 1950s, the declaration of a republic in 1961, international sanctions and trade boycotts, to the establishment of multi-racial democracy and the election of the ANC government in 1994.Footnote 2 How far do the top income shares reflect these major political events? Or was inequality at the top dominated by underlying economic forces, such as the movements in gold sales? How far were changes in the South African top income shares different from those in other countries? In the paper, we make comparisons with the findings for Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and with other former colonial territories in Africa. Throughout this history, there was much concern about the high levels of poverty in South Africa, and it is on the bottom of the income distribution that attention has rightly focussed. At the same time, poverty has to be seen in the context of the distribution as a whole. As noted by Leibbrandt et al., “in addition to high poverty levels, South Africa’s inequality levels are among the highest in the world” (2010, page 9). Our estimates of top incomes allow us to examine whether that has always been the case. The conclusion of Graaff (1946) was that the degree of income concentration (derived from the Pareto coefficient) was “fairly stable” over the long period. But now, we have many more years of data. Did this stability, however, remain in the apartheid years? Or was there a long-run trend in top income shares? In a recent article on inequality, van der Berg asked “what was the case in South Africa over the past century?” and went on to say that “no data exist to give a definitive answer” (2011, page 125). Our estimates are not definitive, but they provide a point of departure for those seeking to understand the long-run pattern of income inequality in South Africa. Many readers will want to go first to the results. However, an appreciation of the methods used to arrive at the estimated top income shares is necessary to give due weight to their limitations. We therefore begin in Sect. 2 with a description of the income tax data: one of the contributions of this paper is the reconstruction of all the distributional data published by official sources on the basis of the income tax in South Africa since 1903. As already explained, the tax data cannot be employed on their own. The published distributions of taxpayers by income ranges have to be accompanied by external control totals for the total adult population and for total household income, and these are described in Sect. 3. The results for top income shares in South Africa from 1903 to 2007 are set out in Sect. 4, where we consider the changing shape of the upper tail. The findings for South Africa are set in international context in Sect. 5, where we make comparisons with the findings for Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and with other former colonies of the British Empire. In seeking to understand to understand the evolution of top income shares, we preliminary explore three determinants: conquest, discrimination and development. The main conclusions are summarised at the end.",1

On the origins of secondary education in Spain, 1857–1901",May 2023,Pau Insa-Sánchez,Alfonso Díez-Minguela,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Human capital is one of the bedrocks of economic growth and development (Romer 1986, 1990; Lucas 1988). In turn, what allows for the accumulation of human capital, skills and knowledge is intrinsic to human nature and, in general, cannot be observed.Footnote 1 Likewise, human capital formation results from formal and informal learning and occurs over a lifespan, and as a result, its measurement is still a challenge (Goldin 2016). Educational attainment has regularly been used as a proxy in cross-country empirical studies (Barro 1991; Mankiw et al. 1992; Gennaioli et al. 2013).Footnote 2 This approach, however, demands a hierarchical and uniform education system; ignores informal learning and on-the-job training; and neglects a relevant facet, the quality of education (Hanushek and Woessmann 2008, 2012).Footnote 3 In any case, schooling has played (and still does) a crucial role in improving knowledge access while it also shapes our personal and social development (Bowles and Gintis 1976; Oreopoulos and Salvanes 2011) and, more specifically, affects social cohesion and nation-building (Alesina et al. 2021). Regarding formal education, the impact of schooling on human capital formation has been widely discussed. In the age of the Enlightenment, the amount and accessibility of knowledge improved across Europe (Mokyr 2005a): not only more books were available (Buringh and van Zanden 2009; Dittmar 2019) but also numerous societies and public libraries, among others, were founded.Footnote 4 Still, it does not appear that a more literate society was fundamental for the British industrialisation (Schofield 1973; Mitch 1999).Footnote 5 Nonetheless, numerical skills might have been more widespread than literacy in Western Europe before the introduction of compulsory schooling (A’Hearn et al. 2009; Baten and Juif 2014; Tollnek and Baten 2017). In this regard, some authors have suggested that useful knowledge, resulting from the combined efforts of knowledge elites and skilled artisans, was at the core of the matter (Mokyr 2005b, 2017).Footnote 6 Then, and although those in the upper tail received formal education, informal learning and technical training might have contributed more than schooling to pave the way for modern economic growth.Footnote 7 However, it has recently been suggested that intermediate human capital, understood as “intermediate skills formed by the diffusion of basic general knowledge that goes beyond basic literacy and numeracy skills” (Diebolt et al. 2021: 169) was important given its relatively advanced character but generic enough to adapt to the changing needs of nascent industries.Footnote 8 Anyhow, learning beyond basic skills required a more demanding educational infrastructure in terms of schools, teachers and other resources. In this regard, the experience of the United States is paradigmatic. According to Goldin and Katz (1998, 2008), once capital and technology–skill complementarities became apparent in early 20th century, a “race between education and technology” followed.Footnote 9 This American leadership has since been attributed to the high school movement (Goldin and Katz 1999, 2008) which built on common schools (Go and Lindert 2010). Interestingly, the building and funding of high schools responded not only to income and wealth levels but also to the expected returns in local labour markets, what constitutes a meaningful example of a close relationship between educational institutions and economic activity at the municipal level. In more cohesive communities, there was more consensus on the foundation of high schools because, in addition, this was a means to consolidating their own local districts in a context of public service competition among municipalities (Goldin and Katz 1999). Still, this high school movement occurred in an exceptional scenario in which “New World features with republican ideology (…) produced a unique educational system” (Goldin 2001: 275). The expansion of post-elementary education in the USA between 1910 and 1940, however, contrasted with the slow progress witnessed in Europe.Footnote 10 Composition of secondary education (general studies) by type, Spain 1857–1901. Note: Official refers to students enrolled in Institutos, whereas Private-CE and Private-EL stands for students enrolled in private schools and those opting for private tuition (tutors and small academies), respectively. Source: Núñez (2005: Table 3.5). In the case of Spain, it has been argued that the lack of human capital severely limited economic growth and subsequent modernisation (Núñez 1992, 2005; Prados de la Escosura and Rosés 2010; Carreras and Tafunell 2021). Although the core explanation rests on the low social demand for education and the inaction of the State, few countrywide and quantitative studies have delved deeper into the matter. Using literacy, Núñez (1992) and Beltrán-Tapia et al. (2019) have showed marked disparities across and within provinces that may explain, at least in part, the different trajectories of regional development. Yet, and except for some broad approaches (Viñao Frago 1982; Sanz Díaz 1985; Díaz de la Guardia Bueno 1988), there is not a countrywide study on the origins and early stages of secondary education in Spain and, more specifically, the characteristics of its territorial expansion. In this study, we fill the gap by focusing on the period that goes from 1857 to 1901. By 1857, a hierarchical and uniform education system had been instituted. At the top of this pyramidal structure, tertiary education was only offered in State (or official) universities and advanced schools, while secondary studies could be taken in State schools or privately. However, the limited capacity and scope of State education remained basically unaltered during the period of study. Political instability and, above all, the recurring difficulties of the public finances were at the core of the matter (de Riquer i Permanyer 2015).Footnote 11 In this context, private education thrived. In 1857, there were around 50 private schools countrywide. By 1901, there were more than 600. In this article we first document the origins and early years of secondary education. Then, we empirically assess the spatial distribution of private schools by assessing the impact of different socio-economic variables on the decision of opening a private school. For this, a new dataset with information at the municipal level is presented. As expected, the creation of new private schools is not a random process. In line with the high school movement, demand was largely responsible for it, but the Spanish case offers further insight, especially regarding the interplay between local forces and private agents.Footnote 12 The mounting presence of Catholic schools reignited the religious question which in turn led to a conflictive secularisation that marked the early 20th century (de la Cueva and Montero 2007).Footnote 13 Our contribution is twofold. First, although the expansion of elementary schooling has received a great deal of attention (Cappelli 2016a, b; Cvrcek and Zajicek 2019; Montalbo 2020, 2021; Westberg and Cappelli 2019), secondary education is less well documented, beyond some country-specific studies (Banks 1955; Savoie 2013). As post-elementary studies are closely related to knowledge access and human capital formation, we believe that this gap severely limits our understanding of growth and development.Footnote 14 Diebolt et al. (2019, 2021) noted that skill-biased technological change stimulated adult learning and hence the demand for intermediate human capital in 19th-century France, but enrolment rates remained relatively modest. In Germany, research has predominantly focused on practical or technical education (König 1993). Using county-level data for 19th-century Bavaria, Semrad (2015) shows the relevance of modern secondary education for economic performance while Dittmar and Meisenzahl (2020) find that modern research universities played a decisive role in the German industrialisation.Footnote 15 Notwithstanding the significance of industrial or technical knowledge for innovation, limited access to post-elementary education remained an obstacle until the second half of the 20th century. Second, this study contributes to the literature that has set out to explore the role of religious education, as well as private and grassroots initiatives, in human capital formation. First, our work links directly with the contribution of West and Woessmann (2010) in which it is argued that countries where Catholicism was the official religion in 19th century, private (catholic) schools proliferated less, thereby reducing school competition which could have long-term repercussions on educational outcomes. A recent study by Squicciarini (2020) has suggested that religiosity slowed down the adoption of a technical curriculum in primary schools, thereby affecting industrial development in 19th-century France. Kelly (2021:1), however, notes that Catholic schools were mainly located in “impoverished places where it [education] was otherwise unavailable”. Therefore, rather than retarding economic development, Catholic schools emerged wherein official or public education did not. In Spain, given the limited capacity of State or official education, private initiatives may fill in.Footnote 16 Nevertheless, a school is a costly enterprise and pupil shortage a concern. Moreover, secondary studies demand better-trained teachers than elementary instruction. In a context where illiteracy and poverty were widespread, the prospects of operating a school might have been small. Furthermore, the 19th century was marked by the rise of educational movements, but not all have the local economic, social or political support to undertake this enterprise. As we will show, private religious schools did not only proliferate in constitutionally Catholic 19th-century Spain, but they did so mainly following demand-related factors. Even more, and as qualitative studies have shown, Catholic schools adapted to the new educational demands (Fullana and Ostolaza 2007). The article is thus structured as follows. Section 2 portrays the historical context. Section 3 describes the data sources used and explain the empirical methodology followed. Results are then presented in Sect. 4 while a final discussion is offered in Sect. 5.",1

This positive relationship has been theoretically confirmed from a historical perspective by Mokyr (2005) and Galor (2011). Moreover, studying European countries during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, such as England, France, Prussia, Italy, Sweden, or Spain, economic historians have found that education fostered innovation and economic growth, and it was crucial for the implementation of new technologies (Meisenzahl and Mokyr 2011; Squicciarini and Voigtländer 2015; de Pleijt et al. 2020; O'Rourke and Williamson 1995; Cinnirella and Streb 2017; Becker et al. 2011; Ciccarelli and Fachin 2017; Nuvolari and Vasta 2017; Thomson 2005; and Martínez-Galarraga and Prat 2016). Turning to a micro-perspective, the literature that explores economics within households and at the individual level has shown that education is positively linked to socioeconomic status and income levels (Becker 1993; de Janvry and Sadoulet 2001; and Turčínková and Stávková, 2012). In this regard, the literature studying Western European households and individual data in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries finds a positive relationship between education and socioeconomic status (Long 2006; Clark and Gray 2014; Saaritsa and Kaihovaara 2016; and Beltrán Tapia and de Miguel Salanova 2021). Despite this historical evidence of the positive effects of education on economic growth, socioeconomic status or income levels, the factors that were behind the formation of education and human capital accumulation during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries are still in debate.Footnote 1 In this regard, despite the macro factors that affected the expansion of education during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, such as promotion by the Central Governments or the negative effects of inequality, human capital formation was subject to the decisions made with regard to education in the households. Therefore, they constitute a key element for understanding education formation during this period. In this process, the household’s socioeconomic status played a major role, as, for instance, it determined the household’s reliance on child labour, and, therefore, the parents’ views on schooling (Basu and Van 1998; Basu 1999; and Bar and Basu 2009).Footnote 2 For instance, authors studying historical case studies find that for working-class families, schooling might be a luxury good, as they cannot afford the cost of losing their offspring’s income (Cunningham 2000; Borras Llop, 2005; Burnette 2012; Humphries 2013; Larsson and Westberg 2020).Footnote 3 During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, households whose members worked in the mines were among the working-class families with the lowest standards of living and thus relied heavily on child labour (John 1984, pp. 26–32; Heywood 1988, p. 140–144; Kirby 2003, pp. 76–78; Humphries 2011, p. 221).Footnote 4 As Mitch (1992, pp. 88–89) points out for England, this reliance on child labour within mining families, and the absence of literacy requirements to work in the sector, made that levels of school attendance among miners’ children were relatively low. Similarly, Humphries (2011, pp. 340–343), looking at individual data in England finds that children whose father was a miner were relatively less educated, measured in years of school, than children with fathers working in agriculture or factories. However, despite these general and largely valuable characterisations of mining families by historians, only Humphries (2011) has carried out an individual and micro-level analysis in order to obtain a precise account of the education decision-making processes within these families. Therefore, this paper tries to fill this gap in the literature by exploring how living standards—being in a mining family—affected children’s education. Using mining towns and mining families, it seeks to further the understanding of how different dynamics influenced education in a crucial period of human capital accumulation. The low living standards of mining families meant that households struggled to distribute their scarce resources to educate their children. Moreover, cultural factors and the male-dominance of skilled jobs (steel mills, transportation, or trade) or a clearer relationship between being educated and more skilled and obtaining rewarded occupations in the case of men, meant that job prospects for educated women may have been limited. Therefore, this could have affected a family’s preference to educate boys or girls when faced with scarce resources. In order to do this, I analyse 41,982 girls and boys between eight and 18 years old, from a dataset of 254,000 individuals living in 12 Spanish mining towns between 1877 and 1924, compiled from the local population censuses. This data source contains highly detailed individual-level information on literacy, age, occupation, address, the municipality where the person was born, and the person’s years of residence in that municipality. As the Spanish educational law made mandatory for children to attend school when they were between six and nine years old, analysing children between eight and 18 years old enables me to study the decisions about their offspring’s education that families had already made. The 12 mining towns are geographically represented in Fig. 1 and they were in Asturias (Mieres), Cantabria (Castro-Urdiales), Biscay (Abanto, Galdames, Santurce, Lanestosa, and Carranza), Gipuzkoa (Irún), Murcia (Cartagena and Mazarrón), Almería (Vera), and Huelva (Nerva). This dataset covers an interesting period in Spain’s education history, as educational levels (e.g. literacy or provision of schools) started to improve during this period from a significantly low level in comparison with other European countries (Vicent 2003; and Beltrán Tapia et al. 2021). Moreover, the territorial coverage provides a precise picture of the mining sector which significantly increased its production and exports form the late nineteenth century (Pérez de Perceval Verde & López-Morell 2006). Location of the studied mining towns. Note: The shaded areas are the area of the municipality and the names in italics are the Spanish Provinces Following the geographical distribution seen in Fig. 1 and the educational conclusion extracted from Nuñez (1992) and Beltrán Tapia et al. (2021), in order to gain a better understanding of this process, I divide the sample into north and south due to the significant differences in the education provision and literacy rates between these regions. Likewise, I divide the miners themselves into two groups depending on the types of mines that were operating in their towns—i.e. open pit or underground—in order to assess the precise effects of each mining extraction method as different skill requirements and child labour were demanded in open pit and underground mines. Consequently, I study an important process of decision-making regarding children’s education that has not been previously researched in such detail or with such a broad scope by Spanish industrial or educational historiography, contributing to the literature in two ways. First, this study is based on a highly detailed dataset, which, by applying the micro-analysis used by the literature studying home economics and family decision processes for contemporary cases, could enrich our understanding of the historical process of human capital accumulation and its individual determinants. Second, this paper contributes to the literature, not only by showing how living standards affected children’s education, but it also highlights the role of gender in this process. The detail provides a fine-grain view of how scarce resources in working-class families had a clear gender bias, as in these households, girls’ education was neglected. Therefore, although it only analyses Spanish mining towns, this paper contributes to our understanding of the demand side of education, and which factors (in this case, the mining sector) affected human capital accumulation. The results show that living standards were a key determinant of human capital formation. Children whose fathers were farmers, day labourers or miners had significantly lower literacy levels than children in upper- and middle-class families. Low wages, and therefore low living standards could force working-class families to rely on child labour, which would lead to school absenteeism, early dropouts, and the interruption of human capital formation in those children. Moreover, the results reveal a significant gender bias in education, which is potentially linked to the clearer relationship between being educated and accessing better jobs among men than among women. This was especially important in northern working-class families. As these households faced scarce resources, they had to decide who could go to school, their sons or their daughters, choosing the former and neglecting the educational process of the latter. In this regard, it is especially interesting that northern working-class boys had higher literacy rates than their fathers, showing the importance given and the efforts made by these families to educate their sons. Among all the socioeconomic groups, the largest gender gaps prevailed in northern and southern open-pit mining families. This indicates that the lower skill level requirements in these mines, and therefore the lower wages in comparison to other occupations, may have forced open-pit mining families to divert their scarce resources to enable their sons to attend school as they had a similar literacy level to other working-class boys, neglecting girls’ education. However, the result also could imply that these open-pit mining families relied more heavily on women in formal or informal labour, increasing the work or household burden on daughters, and hampering their human capital formation. The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 gives the historical background, describing the mining sector and education of the municipalities selected. Section 3 explains the data, and variables used for the analysis, together with the methodology. Section 4 presents the econometric results. Section 5 concludes.",1

This diversity definitely pertains to economic performance too. Since colonial times, substantial regional income disparities have been reported (Malines van Ginkel 1929; Booth 1988; Maddison 1989; Van Zanden 2003; Leigh and Van der Eng 2009). These regional disparities probably emerged over the course of the nineteenth century, as for the early nineteenth century most wages in Europe as well as in Asia were near subsistence (Van Zanden 2003), thus leaving little room for widespread income differences both among regions and between social classes. The incorporation of colonial Indonesia into the global economy culminated in international trade making up 40 per cent of Indonesia’s GDP by the 1920s and has been noted this increased social inequalities (Van Zanden and Marks 2014; De Zwart 2020). Indeed, Booth (1998, p. 89) observes that the “economic stratification […] was pronounced in Indonesia by the early twentieth century, and in spite of the egalitarian rhetoric […], this stratification persisted into the post-1950 period.” The incorporation of Indonesia in the global economy may also have engendered regional inequalities. Considering highly divergent demographic patterns, the impact of colonial policies, and the modes of export production (e.g., smallholder production and plantations), considerable variations in income and living standards throughout the archipelago should not surprise us. But to what extent we can trace them back into colonial times is a largely unexplored field. Most publications about Indonesian per capita GDP in colonial times are either limited to macro-estimates for the entire archipelago or confined to Java or to the Outer Islands (i.e., all islands of the Indonesian archipelago except for Java and Madura). Some studies using other indicators of income variations at the provincial (also called residency) level for the entire archipelago were conducted in colonial times, but more recent studies have focused predominantly on postcolonial Indonesia (e.g., Malines van Ginkel 1929; Van der Eng 2002a). To capture the trend in regional divergence, it is of crucial importance to disaggregate the GDP of colonial Indonesia by region. We will show that this can be done, even though with some drawbacks, by applying the Geary and Stark method. Even though GDP is thus not available at a regional level, we can distinguish four types of regional studies that do exist for colonial Indonesia. Before presenting our findings upon the Geary and Stark method applied on a large collection of data derived from colonial sources, we will first discuss these four types of existing studies. We start with one of the most well-known fields, which concerns Indonesia’s integration in the world economy and its effect on regional well-being (Sect. 1.2), while three more quantitative variables—related to income, stature, and education—are dealt with in Sect. 1.3. One of the best-known lines of study concerns Indonesia’s interaction with the global economy. In this literature there are many indications that the integration in the world economy in the final years of the nineteenth and early years of the twentieth century impacted differently across Indonesia. This had three reasons: First, the timing of the beginning of the interaction was different. The eastern Moluccan islands and Java had already been extensively colonized, providing the Dutch East India Company with spices, rice, sugar, and coffee. From 1830 to 1870, a significant share of Java’s households was recruited to grow cash crops under the so-called Cultivation System. This island also experienced rapid population growth, resulting in both increasing population pressure and dependency on wage labor in the expanding plantation economy. Forced cultivations also existed in the Moluccas, northern Sulawesi, and West Sumatra, which mostly gave way, however, to free production by local entrepreneurs and smallholders from the 1860s onward. In the early twentieth century smallholders in Sumatra joined the rubber boom, whereas in some of the eastern parts of the archipelago there was a boom in smallholder copra cultivation. Second, the structure of export commodity production in Java on the one hand and in Sumatra, Borneo [Kalimantan], and Sulawesi on the other was markedly different. In Java plantation agriculture dominated, whereas in these Outer Islands—with the notable exception of the rubber and tobacco plantation belt of East Sumatra—smallholder production as well as mining prevailed (Clemens and Lindblad 1989; Touwen 2000; Van der Eng 1996, pp. 260–265, Table A 1.2.). A crucial difference between Java’s export economy and those of the Outer Islands was that, with the exception of East Sumatra, these were smallholder-based, which kept income in the local economies more than in the plantation belts and sites of oil extraction and mineral mining. Third, both global economic cycles and changing terms of trade impacted differently on different parts of Indonesia, and this pertained in particular to the agricultural crisis of the 1880s. Whereas the 1930s Depression struck both plantation and smallholder sectors throughout the archipelago, the agrarian crisis of the early 1880s struck Java almost exclusively, with almost simultaneous occurrence of severe coffee and sugar diseases as well as a rinderpest. Moreover, before 1900 the Outer Islands accounted for only 30 per cent of Indonesia’s exports, and at that time about 60 per cent of Indonesia’s exports consisted of sugar and coffee—overwhelmingly produced in Java. Precisely at the time that sugar became Java’s most important export commodity, it faced sharply declining market prices (particularly in the period 1884–1902). This can also explain why, after 1870, Indonesia’s highly favorable terms of trade fell rapidly to the—still favorable on average—terms of trade of Southeast Asia and turned sharply negative by 1930 (Bassino and Williamson 2017, p. 32, Table 4 and p. 36, Fig. 2). Although from 1900 onward the share of the Outer Islands in Indonesia’s exports increased rapidly, it never rose above 50 per cent (Lindblad 1989, p. 17). In sum, the effects of deteriorating terms of trade and price volatility of commodities impacted more severely on Java than on most of the Outer Islands. Not surprisingly, due to the above-mentioned three factors, the economic history literature dealing with the commodity export sector of Indonesia perceives an economic divergence, with Sumatra and Borneo [Kalimantan] and parts of Sulawesi doing relatively well thanks to palm oil and rubber, while Java’s per capita income stagnated because of demographic pressures, with rising income inequality (Touwen 2000; Leigh and Van der Eng 2009; Van Leeuwen and Foldvari 2016, 2017; Bosma 2019). Besides the exposure to the global economy, we have three other indicators of regional divergence. First, rough estimates exist for diverging GDP trends between Java and Madura on the one hand and the so-called Outer Islands on the other in late colonial times (e.g., Polak 1979; Van Zanden 2002).Footnote 1 In addition, reports were published in the 1920s about taxation pressure on the populations of Java and the Outer Islands, by Meijer Ranneft and Huender (1926) and Malines van Ginkel (1929), respectively. Since the two reports are very different in terms of data collection and presentation, we cannot compare their findings. Nonetheless, the Meijer Ranneft and Huender report contained alarming facts, particularly with regard to the increasing inequality and precarity of marginal farmers (Meijer Ranneft and Huender 1926). One of the authors, W. Huender, had already observed in 1921 that the people of Java were “taxed to the limit” (quoted in Booth 1980, p. 91). Moreover, the nutritional situation of Java’s population seems to have deteriorated over the 1920s (Booth 2012). Furthermore, available data from the 1960s onward also reveal significant regional income disparities, as Van der Eng has pointed out, which can most likely be traced back to the colonial period. East Nusa Tenggara is positioned at the lower end of incomes, whereas since the early twentieth century oil-rich Kalimantan has been positioned at the higher end (Van der Eng 2002a, 8; Touwen 2001). It should be noted, however, that oil revenues do not stay within a region but flow to the center, which is the reason we exclude oil income in the following sections of this paper. Nonetheless, in terms of Gross Value Added for Agriculture per capita, according to Van der Eng (1993), the Outer Islands exceed that of Java by 8 percent in 1920 and 30 percent in 1930.Footnote 2 Still, regional disparities should not be perceived as a Java–Outer Islands binary. That East Java might have been doing better than the rest of Java, while the dry eastern part of Indonesia (Nusa Tenggara) stagnated, is strongly suggested (Malines van Ginkel 1929). Van Ginkel’s data (see Table 3) are particularly interesting because they are partly based upon field research, present both wage data and qualitative evaluations of welfare levels, and show significant regional variation. It is somewhat disappointing that Malines van Ginkel reports only assessments of living standards for the Outer Islands, but the information provided is still valuable. Table 3accords with the observation made by Van der Eng for the 1960s (Van der Eng 2002a)—for example, that the Nusa Tenggara were relatively poor, whereas the residencies of Jambi, Palembang, Benkulen, and Riau were doing well. In these residencies booming smallholder and coffee cultivation may have contributed to higher wages and living standards. However, the levels of the living standards are at variance with the agricultural wages, suggesting relatively good living standards in parts of East Nusa Tenggara, Bali and Lombok, and West Sumatra despite modest agricultural wages. Indeed, this point partly accords with the observation made by Booth (2012): real wages do not always form a useful indicator of living standards. Second, studies based upon anthropometrics sometimes show the stature (i.e., height) of people, which is often argued to be related to the per capita income of their parents when they were children (e.g., Baten et al. 2010; Foldvari et al. 2013; Van Leeuwen and Foldvari 2016). These studies find that stature on average was higher in the Outer Islands in the period 1920–1940. Yet, at a further disaggregated geographic level there are also differences (Table 1): in addition to North Sumatra, it is mainly the smaller islands of the Outer Islands (East Nusa Tenggara, and Bali and Lombok) that show higher statures in these years, a trend that seems to persist in the 1965–1985 period. On Java it is West Java that shows the highest statures over this period. These data seem to contradict the above-quoted observations that East Java did economically better than Central Java and West Java, as well as that Bali and Lombok were relatively poor. The data on stature also seem to contradict our findings about per capita GDP corrected for prices (Table 9). Yet, considering that these data are obscured by migration patterns, and since they also include non-monetary aspects, such as health, and do not suggest a particularly strong pattern; human heights do not, by themselves, present conclusive evidence. Besides the above-mentioned indicators, a third category of publications pertains to data on factors of production, such as education enrolment as a proxy for human capital (Table 2).Footnote 3 These show a considerably higher enrolment in education for Sumatra than for the rest of Indonesia and seem to correlate with stature. Both were significantly higher in West Java than in Central and East Java. Sumatra’s educational attainment greatly exceeded that of Java. Similarly, we test for correlations between GDP per capita (Table 9) and educational enrolment (Table 2). We find strong correlations between income and enrolment in 1910 and 1920, primarily driven by high values in the various regions of Sumatra. However, this correlation diminishes over time: whereas Sumatra and West Java remained leading in educational enrolment up to 1930, the 1910s and 1920s witnessed a shift in the ranking of per capita GDP from Sumatra to other Outer Provinces, such as Sulawesi and Kalimantan. In summary, the three available categories of data (income, stature, and educational enrolment) suggest regional disparities in living standards, stature, and production factors, in which West Java and Sumatra in particular belonged to the most prosperous regions. As such, the assessment of living standards in Table 3, which only include the Outer Islands clearly seem to be in line with the previous tables (Tables 1 and 2), in which we found Sumatra to be high in terms of both stature and educational enrolment up to the 1920s. Obviously, GDP is a financial indicator, which is not necessarily correlated with nutrition, stature and educational enrolment. From this perspective, Table 3 is of particular interest because it contrasts data on wages (being a financial indicator) with qualitative observations on living standards. Here we see that relatively low nominal wages, such as in West Sumatra, Bali and Lombok, and Sulawesi, do not exclude relatively good living standards. Conversely, conditions on the tin and pepper island of Bangka, for instance, were considered to be poor even though wages were relatively high—not least because food had to be imported, whereas Bali and Lombok produced enough rice to allow them to export part of their crop. The discrepancy between income measures such as GDP and other indicators is thus far from negligible. If we were to run correlations between the various indicators and other regional indicators discussed above, the coefficient may turn positive or negative depending on the variable and time period.Footnote 4 Hence, there is ample reason to attempt a regional approach toward trends in per capita GDP in colonial Indonesia. Our article does not aim to explain variations but confines itself predominantly to presenting figures for the development in GDP between ten macro-regions of colonial Indonesia over the sixty years between 1870 and 1930. This approach applies the Geary and Stark method to a large body of data collected by the colonial government (Sect. 2). This results in Sect. 3 in estimates of GDP for ten macro-regions between 1870 and 1930. In Sect. 4 we discuss the results and make some suggestions for further research.",
