Traditional analysis of real estate investment decisions focus mostly on the response of new construction to demand shocks. Studies of commercial office investment, for example, predict construction by lagged growth in office employment and lagged rents (Hekman 1985), by lagged vacancy rates (Rosen 1984) and by lagged office stock relative to office employment (Wheaton 1987; Wheaton et al. 1997). More recent studies allow construction decisions to be influenced also by the cost of capital and volatility as suggested by the real option theories. Sivitanidou and Sivitanides (2000), for example, study office construction in the 15 largest U.S. metropolitan office markets from 1982 to 1998. Their findings show that construction decreases with the cost of capital and the volatility of the demand growth. Holland et al. (2000) report similar findings in a study of the aggregate construction of four categories of commercial real estate in the U.S. from 1972 to 1992. The extant real-option-based empirical studies of real estate investment are inadequate in a number of respects. First, they leave several important real option implications untested. In particular, Capozza and Li (1994, 2002) show that volatility not only delays irreversible investments but also influences the way the investment timing decision is affected by real interest rates and expected rental income growth. Capozza and Li (2001) is the only empirical study that examines the influence of volatility on the way construction responds to interest rate changes but fails to take adequate control of demand shocks in a cross sectional study of residential markets. In the present paper, we seek to examine how volatility affects the impact of interest rate changes and expected demand growth on construction in commercial office markets. Second, the extant studies provide inadequate control of the demand for new construction. Sivitanidou and Sivitanides (2000), for example, use the office rents relative to construction costs and office vacancy rates to account for the demand for new construction. However, the vacancy rate always converges to a normal vacancy rate as rents adjust to clear the market regardless of the gap between the building stock and its equilibrium level; hence the vacancy rate is a good indicator for price adjustment but a poor indicator for new construction demand. Furthermore, office rents and the construction costs are not necessarily cointegrated, since the difference between the two (in real terms) reflects the real land rent, which is typically nonstationary. Including this nonstationary regressor in the analysis leads to a mis-specification of the construction model. Holland et al. (2000) overcome this problem of nonstationary regressors by differencing the construction quantity on the left-hand side of their regression equations and all the explanatory variables on the right-hand side. However, in so doing they eliminate much useful information on disequilibrium gaps contained in the price levels and, not surprisingly, find construction to respond hardly to the price changes. We propose a more satisfactory measure of the demand for new construction based on a stable long-run equilibrium relationship between the office stock and the office employment in a city. When combined, the office stock and office employment form a cointegrating vector, whose variation over time indicates the supply gap to be offset by new construction. Third, the extant studies usually apply a myopic approach and construct the measures of expected demand growth and volatility based on past growth rates. Holland et al. (2000) represent an exception in that they use a forward-looking implied volatility measure derived from commercial real estate debt prices. Reliable prediction of building activities based on real option models requires forward-looking measures of demand growth expectations. The present paper derives such a measure from the forward-looking behavior of local asset prices. Specifically, we employ the observations from Singapore and Hong Kong office markets to test the real option models. Both city states are major business centers in Asia and the local stock market indices reflect the demand for local business services and hence provide good signals for the forward-looking local office demand growth.Footnote 1
 The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We summarize the implications of the real option models for real estate construction in “Real Option Rules for Real Estate Investment”, which is followed by the discussion of our empirical model and data in “Model Specification and Data”. We present our findings in “Empirical Findings” and conclude in “Conclusions”.",9

If vacancy rates are below their long term average office rents react significantly stronger to positive changes in office employment when compared to periods of abundant supply. Understanding rent dynamics is key to both users and investors in office markets, markets that have developed into a significant proportion of the overall economy. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics office employment accounts for over 19% of non-farm employment. This statistic represents a total of 26 million office based employees in the U.S. by the end of 2007. For metropolitan areas like San Francisco, Washington DC and New York the weight of office employment can reach peaks of close to 30%. Office rents are also a key input variable for construction decisions and to a large extent determine the profitability of new office investments. Hence, a vast strand of academic literature has developed over the years, which aims at cracking the DNA code of office rents. In these models, rents are typically related to changes in employment, office supply and vacancy levels. However, in almost all of these studies the authors assume that these relationships are symmetric, and thus that changes in employment will have similar scale effects irrespective of the level of the vacancy rate. Early studies by Wheaton (1987) already showed that vacancy rates evolve around a natural rate, and that given the non-negativity constraint vacancy rates tend to reach more distinctive peaks than troughs. Therefore, an increase in office employment, when vacancy rates are low, is likely to have a very different impact on rents, than when rates are high. Englund et al. (2008a) are the first to include these asymmetric properties into their model calibration. They explicitly studied asymmetric rent adjustments depending on the level of vacancy rates when modeling Stockholm office rents for the period 1977–2002 and reported a significant increase in the explanatory power of their rent models due to this inclusion. This paper will add to the existing literature by applying an asymmetric rent adjustment model to a unique panel set of quarterly data that covers fifteen metropolitan areas (MSA’s) in the United States over the period 1990–2007. Measured by net rentable area of office floor space these MSA’s are the largest in the U.S. and include Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Washington DC. Besides a panel that includes all MSA’s in one specification we also estimate the model based on different clusters. We group MSA’s with multi dimensional scaling based on similarity in rent- or employment dynamics and run panel data regressions based on these clusters. The clustering methodology benefits from an increase in the number of observations when compared to analysis on a MSA level while keeping the in-group homogeneity as large as possible. Our results show that changes in office employment have a larger impact on office rents when vacancy rates are below their long term average. This finding implies for office investments that new demand does not influence rent rates in a symmetric way but is most influential when prevailing vacancy rates are relatively low. We also show that the coefficients are similar in sign and magnitude across clusters. The paper continues as follows. After discussing the office market literature that is most relevant for our research, we discuss the rent adjustment model that will be applied in the subsequent analysis. Before discussing our results, we first present our dataset and review the main attributes of the markets that are included in our sample. In our results we explicitly compare results that were yielded from competitive model specifications; models with and without asymmetric properties. Besides discussing pooled panel results we also look at results, for clusters of cities. The main results will be summarized in our conclusions.",23

Shilling et al. (1987) were among the firsts to apply this model to explain local US office rents, while Wheaton and Torto (1988) estimated the model for the aggregate US office market. In this paper we use an error correction model in line with Hendershott et al. (2002b) to model office rents for ten cities across five European countries over the period 1990–2006. We extent existing methodology and findings by examining an international panel of cities, and by incorporating two geographic aggregation levels of economic data. To model changes in real prime office rents we use national economic and employment series and the most detailed local versions of these data available for European cities; the Nuts 3 level which corresponds to Départements in France, Kreise in Germany, Corop-regions in the Netherlands, Provincias in Spain, and Counties in the UK.Footnote 1 Through the analysis of premier and second ties office market cities in each country we are able to test whether local data availability is more important for smaller cities that make up less of the national aggregate than for the premier office markets of each country. The concentration of office centers of variable size and importance in various countries within a relatively small geographical area makes the exploration of return determinants for European office markets, as executed in this study, an interesting case. To facilitate the analysis of the local nature of the markets we selected the primary and a secondary office market for; the United Kingdom, Spain, Germany, France, and The Netherlands. Based on this selection we constructed a dataset consisting of London and Glasgow; Madrid and Barcelona; Frankfurt and Düsseldorf; Paris and Lyon; and Amsterdam and Rotterdam. During our sample period the average correlation between real prime rent changes of pairs of first and second tier office cities within one country equals only 0.36. Hence, there is little reason, a priori, to expect that national economic growth figures are accurate for modeling changes in real prime rents given that changes in this variable differ strongly between cities within one country. Results of a two stage error correction model indicate that office rents adjust to short-run changes in office related economic activity, lagged changes in rents, and to the deviation of rents from their long-run values. We vary the definition of office related economic activity using service employment and gross domestic product (GDP), but find only marginal differences in model performance. Furthermore, our results offer no proof that error correction mechanism (ECM) models for office rents improve significantly by specifying economic growth figures beyond the national aggregated level. Office markets of large cities are driven by economic developments that reach beyond city boundaries due to the concentration of (inter)national conglomerates in large cities, so it is no direct surprise that changes in GDP on a local level do not perform better in explaining local office rents. However, this would not hold for employment figures. Service sector employment on a local level should influence local demand for office space and therefore changes in office rents. However, due to the high correlation between local and national level changes in service sector employment we find no significant differences in model fit. The remainder of the paper continues as follows. “Modelling Office Rents” discusses relevant literature and the methodology we use in the analysis. “European Office Market Data” presents the data. In “Regression Results” we discuss the findings. “Conclusion and Discussion” concludes.",30

W. Chau,S. K. Wong,Frederik I. H. Pretorius,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Male,"Land and real estate are intrinsically related in various ways. Land is a major factor of production for all products, and also a major “raw material” for development of real estate. In finance, vacant land is treated as a call option on real estate. In the appraisal profession, land value is derived from real estate value through the “residual valuation” method. Despite their close relationships, land and real estate are generally traded in two distinct markets. Vacant land is traded in a market by mainly developers, who actively manage development risk for profits. Real estate, being a long lived final product, is traded by end-users or investors in the secondary market. Land price may contain information on future real estate prices because it reflects what a developer might sell in the real estate market in the future, after accounting for development costs. If developers’ expectations about future real estate prices, as revealed in land prices, deviate significantly from those of the real estate market, how would real estate prices react to such “unexpected land prices”? This study aims to examine whether land transactions, in the form of public auctions, convey any new information to the secondary real estate market and, if so, how the secondary real estate market would react to such information. There have been numerous studies on price discovery between direct and indirect real estate markets (e.g Chau et al. 2001),Footnote 1 and recently a number of studies on spot and presale real estate markets (e.g. Chau et al. 2003; Wong et al. 2007), but those between direct real estate and land markets are scant. Perhaps the most relevant studies are those on how auctioned land prices affect share prices of the winning real estate companies. For example, Ooi and Sirmans (2004) and Ching and Fu (2003) examine how land auctions affect the share price of the winning company in Singapore and Hong Kong respectively. Our study also examines whether land auction outcomes have any signaling effects, but the focus differs from these two studies in a number of ways. First, we examine the information flow between the vacant land market and secondary real estate (rather than indirect or securitized real estate). Second, we remove market expectations and focus on price signals in the unexpected land auction prices. Third, we examine both the market-wide temporal effect and the local spatial effect of unexpected land auction prices. We aim to address two related issues: (1) Do land transactions contain timing information that would change the price level of the entire secondary real estate market? (2) Do land transactions contain location-specific information that would change the price level of nearby properties? We call the first type of price discovery a “temporal signaling effect” and the second one a “spatial signaling effect”. The first question is similar to many event studies on the timing performance of financial institutions, but the second one is unique in real estate markets and has not been attempted before. These two issues are important as they provide new insights into price discovery between different but related markets. If developers are perceived to have superior timing information, the secondary real estate prices will respond positively (negatively) to higher (lower) than expected land auction prices. This implies that unexpected land auction prices are not random valuation errors made by the winning bidders. Furthermore, vacant land lots sold in auctions are usually large in scale. These transactions may be regarded as a mass purchase order of future real estate that is affected by location-specific information such as new urban plans, infrastructure development or demographic shifts that may have an impact on development potential of the region where the auctioned sites are located. If developers are perceived to have superior private location-specific information, then traders in the secondary real estate market will adjust their valuations according to the unexpected auction land price. Two methods are employed in this study: an interrupted time series analysis is conducted to test the temporal signaling effect, and a cross-sectional event study is conducted to test the spatial signaling effect. There have been numerous event studies of financial market phenomena but those in the real estate market are limited. Most event studies in real estate are concerned with how real estate company or REIT prices are affected by their acquisition of real estate assets (e.g. Glascock et al. 1991) or other indirect real estate (e.g. Allen and Sirmans 1987). As far as the authors could determine, there have been no event studies of direct real estate markets. A brief review of the event study literature is presented in the next section to support this observation. The data in this study are drawn from Hong Kong, where the real estate market is very active and public land auctions are held from time to time. With all land virtually owned by the Hong Kong government, land auctions are the most common method for developers to obtain new developable land. To ensure fairness to all bidders, land characteristics (e.g. land uses and development density) are made available to the public prior to each auction. Except for a few very small plots of land in remote areas, land auctions in Hong Kong are typically big events and are reported widely by the major media. Before land sales, the media will interview valuation professionals and ask for auction price forecasts, from which we can estimate the market’s expectation of land prices. After the auction, the outcome will usually appear as headlines in financial pages of most newspapers. Such a transparent land auction market provides a good case study for us to test the effects of unexpected auction outcomes on the secondary real estate prices. The paper is organized as follows: Literature Review is a brief review of the event study methodology; Price Signals in Unexpected Land Auction Outcomes explains why unexpected land auction outcomes may have an asymmetric impact on real estate prices. Research Design describes the procedures designed for the empirical tests, Data and Sources describes the data used, results are presented in Results, and we conclude in Conclusion.",22

Francke,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The value of the housing stock is a significant portion of the national wealth. The total value of the private real estate market in the Netherlands was approximately € 1,239 billion in 2007, corresponding to 436% of the real disposable household income in 2007, see CPB (2009). For that reason, many organizations and individuals, such as financial institutions or house owners, are interested in house price movements. A frequently used method to model house price movements is the repeat sales approach. For example, the House Price Index of the Kadaster (the Dutch Land Registry) is an application of the repeat sales model for the Netherlands, see Jansen et al. (2008). Individual house characteristics, like house size, plot size, age, etc., can be omitted from the repeat sales model. This is one of the main advantages of the repeat sales model in absence of individual house characteristics. On a negative side, only selling prices of houses sold more than once can be used in a repeat sales model: all single-sales are not used in the estimation. A more general problem that the sold houses are a non-random selection of the entire housing stock (sample selection bias) is addressed by Gatzlaff and Haurin (1997) and Hwang and Quigley (2004), based on a procedure proposed by Heckman (1979). In this article, however, we do not address the problem of sample selection bias. Implicit assumption in the repeat sales model is that the house characteristics and their impact on house prices do not change over time. This assumption does not obviously hold true for the age of the house in different selling years. In the repeat sales model the effect of age is embedded into the model’s estimates of the time effect, see Cannaday et al. (2005). In this article we focus on the specification of the time effect in the repeat sales model by specifying it as a structural time series model. A structural time series model is a model in which the trend, seasonal and error terms, plus other relevant components, are modeled explicitly. In particular, we focus on the estimation of price trends in thin markets where the number of repeat sales is relatively low and, hence, the impact of transaction price noise on the estimation of the price trends is high. Structural time series models have already been used in real estate applications. For example Schwann (1998) estimates a hedonic price index for a thin market, where the periodic returns follow a stationary autoregressive process. Francke and De Vos (2000) estimate hedonic price indices by a hierarchical trend model, in which different trends are simultaneously estimated for different market segments. Both models have the format (in logs): observed series = trend + regression effects + irregular, where some structure for the trend component is assumed. To our knowledge, structural time series models have not previously been used in order to estimate repeat sales price indices. In the structural time series repeat sales model, the trend component is modeled explicitly using a local linear trend (LLT) model. The LLT model depends on two variance parameters, which are estimated by maximizing the appropriate likelihood function. Small values of these parameters result in smooth price indices. The approach of Goetzmann (1992) is a special case of the LLT repeat sales model. In this paper, we provide an alternative to his two-step estimation procedure. In the next step, we examine the effect of the time between repeat sales on the estimation of the price level. Empirical evidence shows that large profits are made when the time between sales is relatively short, for example within first 6 months. This can be the result of “flipping houses”, that is buying and selling houses for profit in a short period of time or house improvements (about the latter, see Goetzmann and Spiegel 1995). A simple solution would be to drop these sales out of the sample. In this article, we include a variable containing the reciprocal of the time between repeat sales, as an alternative solution to dropping sales within first 6 months. This article is structured as follows. Section “Repeat Sales Models and Small Samples” discusses existing methods for reducing the impact of transaction price noise on repeat sales price indices in small samples. Section “A Local Linear Trend Repeat Sales Model” describes the local linear trend repeat sales model, which also includes a term for the time between repeat sales, as an alternative solution to the approach given by Goetzmann (1992). The same section provides some background on structural time series models, its relation to the non-parametric methods, and references to real estate applications. Section “Estimation” explains the estimation approach of the LLT repeat sales model. Section “Application” begins with a description of the Kadaster database, containing all selling prices of houses in the Netherlands in the period from January 1993 to May 2009. It continues with a comparison of price indices from the LLT repeat sales model to indices based on the frequently used models of Case and Shiller (1987) and Goetzmann (1992). Price indices are compared for different subsets, varying from all residential selling prices in the Netherlands to a small subset in a specific area code. Finally, the impact of revision in repeat sales price indices is examined for both models. Section “Conclusions” concludes.",61

F. Sirmans,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The importance of research on corporate governance has its roots in the work of Jensen and Meckling (1976) who pointed out the potential for significant agency costs when the ownership and control of a firm are separated. Among the agency problems discussed by Jensen and Meckling is the tendency for managers to consume excess perquisites and to undertake expansion of the firm to enhance their reputations and compensation (empire building). Subsequent researchers have studied various governance mechanisms including, for example, management compensation programs and board monitoring structures that could be used to limit the agency costs identified by Jensen and Meckling (1976). Another important governance mechanism for dealing with these agency problems is the design of the capital structure.Footnote 1 For example, Datta et al. (2005) show that the use of short-term debt can serve as a valuable management monitoring mechanism limiting the over-consumption of perquisites while Hart and Moore (1995) show that long-term debt can be an effective deterrent to empire building. However, many of these standard capital structure prescriptions are silent about how to implement the optimal capital structure when the implementation depends on the very same management the structure is designed to control. Influential managers acting in their own self-interest may choose a capital structure that differs from that desired by absentee owners. The use of debt to deal with the agency problems identified by Jensen and Meckling (1976) is not costless; it creates two additional types of agency problems: 1) conflicts of interest between shareholders and debtholders and 2) conflicts of interest between shareholders and managers. The costs associated with the first type of agency problem are well documented in the literature. For example, Myers (1977) emphasized the potential for underinvestment resulting from the use of high leverage and long-term debt (debt overhang) because managers and shareholders may decide to forego positive net present value (NPV) projects when a portion of the benefits of the investment would accrue to the debtholders.Footnote 2 The second agency problem arises when the optimal capital structure from the shareholder’s perspective differs from the optimal capital structure from the manager’s perspective. The owners may want to increase leverage to maximize tax benefits and limit free cash flow available to the managers. However, from management’s perspective, the loss of free cash flow might reduce their overall compensation and also introduces the risk of bankruptcy and the loss of reputation and jobs. (See Fama 1980, for further discussion.) In such a case, managers may desire a lower level of leverage or different maturity structure than do the owners.Footnote 3 The resulting capital structure reflects a compromise between managers and owners. That compromise is influenced by the relative power (entrenchment) of the managers and by the effectiveness of the monitoring, control and alignment mechanisms put in place by the shareholders. Consequently, a firm’s observed capital structure is influenced by the owners’ objectives, the entrenchment and power of managers, the existing governance mechanisms as well as the normal financial variables that have been typically used to explain capital structure. As researchers have begun to investigate the interaction between existing governance mechanisms, managerial incentives and the firm’s capital structure, most research has focused narrowly on how management entrenchment and existing corporate governance mechanisms influence a single capital structure attribute (e.g., leverage or maturity) or how a small subset of these factors (e.g., management ownership) influence the joint choice of leverage and maturity. For example, Berger et al. (1997) study how selected corporate governance measures, managerial incentives and management entrenchment affect a firm’s leverage choice and Benmelech (2006) studies the impact of governance and entrenchment on a firm’s choice of debt maturity. Datta et al. (2005) and Jiraporn and Kitsabunnarat (2008) estimate a simultaneous system of equations for leverage and maturity, but focus exclusively on the maturity choice and consider only a limited number of governance variables. For example, Datta et al. (2005) only study the impact of managerial ownership on debt maturity while Jiraporn and Kitsabunnarat (2008) use the Investor Responsibility Research Center (IRRC) Governance Index, a single summary measure of twenty-four different governance provisions. None of these papers has fully explained how individual governance mechanisms influence the capital structure using a simultaneous equation approach to jointly model leverage and maturity. Barclay et al. (2003) provide the theoretical basis for the importance of modeling the simultaneity of firm’s capital structure decisions. Their theoretical development shows that leverage and maturity are “substitutes” which means that managers can “game” the system by offsetting the effect of high leverage on personal welfare by making a suboptimal choice (from the shareholders’ perspective) of maturity. For example, if managers are pressed by shareholders to undertake more leverage (and the resulting risk of default and liquidation) than they would individually prefer, they can partially preserve their ability to pursue empire building by keeping the maturity of the debt short.Footnote 4 In this paper, we estimate the full capital structure decision using a simultaneous equation system for leverage and maturity while including a full complement of governance and entrenchment measures in the set of independent variables. We use a sample of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) to study the capital structure decision and the relationship between capital structure and existing governance mechanisms. Although limiting the sample to a single industry has the drawback of making it harder to establish the generality of the findings, we believe that for this study, there are a number of offsetting benefits. One reason for focusing on REITs is that Benmelech (2005), Benmelech et al. (2005) and Giambona et al. (2008) have shown that asset liquidation value is an often overlooked significant determinant of a firm’s capital structure and that there are good proxies for asset liquidation value available for REITs.Footnote 5 Furthermore, REITs are well-suited for the study of agency issues related to capital structure because their tax-advantaged status, high required dividend payout, and uniform asset regulation eliminate or reduce the need to control for potentially confounding effects such as tax considerations or variations in dividend payout rates.Footnote 6 Previous studies that have used REITs to study corporate finance issues include Gentry et al. (2003), Ling and Ryngaert (1997), Damodaran and Liu (1993), Wang et al. (1992), Jaffe (1991), Shilling and Howe (1988), and Allen and Sirmans (1987). The results presented here provide new insight into the interaction between management entrenchment, managerial incentives, corporate governance and management’s capital structure choices. This paper fills a gap in the literature by controlling for the simultaneity of the firm’s choice of leverage and maturity while at the same time incorporating the potential influence of a large number of governance variables measuring managerial entrenchment, managerial financial incentives and internal corporate governance mechanisms. Specifically, we estimate a simultaneous equation system for leverage and debt maturity choices by REITs between 1997 and 2006. The results confirm previous findings with respect to the traditional financial influences on capital structure (e.g., that very profitable firms and firms with significant growth opportunities use less leverage) and the previous research on the effects of liquidation value (e.g., that firms with liquid, redeployable assets use higher leverage). With respect to the governance influences, we find a negative and significant relationship between measures of CEO entrenchment and both leverage and debt maturity. We find an offsetting positive relationship between CEO equity ownership and leverage and a positive relationship between an indicator that the CEO is the firm founder and debt maturity. The paper is organized as follows: the next section discusses previous literature that provides the theoretical basis for our findings and previous empirical studies related to ours. The section following that discusses the model specification, the variables used and the data. The estimation results and robustness checks are discussed in the following two sections. The last section provides a brief summary and discussion of our main conclusions.",35

Jansen,Edwin S. Mills,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Residential land use controls are mostly intended to and do limit housing densities. Restrictions to single family detached houses, minimum lot sizes, height limitations, floor/area ratio limits and restrictions on numbers of buildings per lot are examples. See Mills (2007) for a rogue’s gallery of controls. Such restrictions artificially limit housing supply and inevitably raise housing prices. It has been documented that land use controls raise house prices in at least some metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) that are extreme cases of controls, especially Boston, New York and large California MSAs. See Hamilton (1975), Ellickson (1997), Glaeser et al. (2005), and Ihlanfeldt (2007). If controls raise house prices, they presumably affect other MSA characteristics, although such effects have not been documented. This paper analyzes the above issues making use of a remarkable and comprehensive data set for which the profession is indebted to Gyourko et al. (2008) (GSS). GSS collected many measures of land use controls and calculated a summary index for a large number of local government jurisdictions and for MSAs in the US. The GSS MSA index of land use control stringency is carefully composed from 11 sub-indexes and is by far the best index of the stringency of land use controls available. Their measures pertain to 2006. Their MSA land use control stringency data are summarized in an index L, normalized to −2 ≤ L ≤ 4. See GSS for a detailed description of their data and index. An alternative and correlated index of a determinant of MSA housing prices is the Saiz (2010) index of restrictions on building from geographic interferences, specifically slopes in excess of 15°. See Glaeser et al. (2008). Steep slopes obviously make construction difficult or impossible. In some cases, including Denver and Los Angeles, steep slopes in one direction simply induce development in other directions. But such slopes may nevertheless cause higher housing prices. Why the presence of steep slopes should be correlated with stringent land use controls is a mystery. We presume that steep slopes would be correlated with less stringent controls on buildable land if residents’ welfare were the goal of such controls. Many papers during recent years have studied the endogeneity of local land use controls. See Fischel (1985), Quigley and Raphael (2005) and Wallace (1988) for fine examples. Of course, everything governments do is determined by actions of elected and appointed officials and by lobbyists. All are influenced by market conditions. Appointed zoning boards stand between elected officials and private parties. Whether that makes zoning decisions more nearly exogenous than other government actions is an open question. Some papers claim that causation may be the reverse of that assumed here, namely that stringent land use controls attract high income residents. See Nelson (1999), Carruthers and Gudmunder (2007) and references therein. That is undoubtedly correct at the neighborhood level, in which case higher house prices in one neighborhood are associated with lower house prices in nearby lower income neighborhoods. However, it is difficult to believe that stringent land use controls have significant effect in attracting high income residents to an MSA as a whole. If that was the case, our estimates would indicate that stringent controls were associated with high income residents, but our estimates show the reverse effect. We supplement these data with conventional data on population, employment, income and housing prices, all by MSA. Our data set includes observations for 268 MSAs. We estimate a conventional four simultaneous equation model in which MSA population, employment, per capita real income and real housing prices are the dependent variables. The basic hypothesis is that land use controls increase housing prices and the other three equations indicate how housing prices affect the other three endogenous variables. The model is an expansion and update of that in Mills and Lubuele (1995). We estimate the model for 2006, using 2001 values for the lagged dependent variables. The land use control index is for 2006. That is the appropriate year for our data set. Land use controls are assumed to be exogenous. Such controls are instruments of local governments in the US. It has been well documented that such controls have become increasingly and sometimes erratically more stringent during the 20th century (See Fischel 2004; Glaeser et al. 2005; Glaeser and Ward 2009; Schwieterman and Caspell 2006; Mills 2007). Scholars typically assume that exogeneity is a tolerable approximation for such actions. It is probably a better approximation for land use controls than for many other actions of local governments. Each of the four simultaneous equations contains its lagged dependent variable and its square, the other three endogenous variables and 10 census regional dummies, to capture amenities and other factors that vary regionally. The housing price equation also includes the land use control index, allowing land use controls to affect housing prices directly and the other three endogenous variables via the effects of housing prices on them. Our model is less ambitious than the pathbreaking work of Glaeser and Gottlieb (2009). They present and estimate a spatial equilibrium distribution of MSA sizes in the US. We simply take MSA characteristics as they were in 2006 and ask how their characteristics were affected by land use controls.",5

Estimating a Conservative Lower Bound,January 2017,Alexander N. Bogin,Stephen D. Bruestle,William M. Doerner,Male,Male,Male,Male,"House price movements are one of the primary drivers of the credit risk associated with mortgage assets (e.g., losses arising from defaults). Given this dependence, house price forecasts are an essential component of mortgage risk management in the United States. Over the last half century, real house prices have been characterized by decade long cycles around a positively sloped long-term trend. Because these prices tend to be mean-reverting relative to trend, as house prices rise, the credit risk associated with mortgage assets may increase.Footnote 1 To capture this aspect of credit risk it is necessary to consider (1) how far house prices are above long-term trend and (2) the extent to which they can fall below trend. This paper provides a technique for estimating the latter, a conservative lower bound for house prices relative to long-term trend. After the financial crisis last decade, there has been an increased interest in estimating the extent of potential losses on mortgage assets. This credit risk and the required capital associated with mortgage assets is often estimated through stress testing, which entails using a model to simulate future loan performance across a series of stressed inputs. These inputs vary across credit models but usually involve, among other variables, a house price path and an interest rate scenario. Since it determines the value of the underlying collateral, the house price path is a major driver of credit losses and an important determinant of the severity of the stress test. The house price path can be either static or dynamic in nature. A static path reflects a fixed decline in house price levels, typically based upon prior historical experience (e.g., a 20 % decline). When applied at different points in the housing cycle, a fixed decline yields different levels of effective stress (the depth of the house price shock relative to long-term trend). As a consequence, a static shock can result in an insufficient level of stress during periods of bubble formation (i.e., where house prices are well above their long-term trend), but an implausible level of stress during market downturns (i.e., where house prices are at or below their long-term trend). For example, the stress scenario employed by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) implemented a fixed house price shock, which proved insufficiently stressful in the lead up to the Great Recession. Alternatively, fixed house price shocks based upon the recent crisis but applied in the midst of the recovery (e.g., 2012–present) have resulted in stress scenarios that appear implausible by any historical standard. In contrast to a fixed house price shock, a dynamic path responds to current market conditions. A dynamic house price decline is typically governed by where house prices are relative to long-term trend and the extent to which they can fall below this trend (otherwise referred to as the depth of trough). All else equal, a more severe decline, or deeper trough, is associated with a more stressful scenario and higher projected credit losses. An appropriately designed dynamic path can reduce the likelihood of either under- or over-stating the severity of future house price shocks given current market conditions (Smith et al. 2014). An accurate estimate of the depth of future house price downturns is essential to dynamic stress testing and can be used to evaluate the reasonableness of static stress tests. Our proposed technique to estimate a conservative lower bound (CLB) has two attractive features: it (1) provides a leading indicator of the severity of future crises or the depth of future downturns and (2) allows estimates of trough to recover as markets return to baseline conditions. Both of these features allow for more effective stress testing, which can lead to a more accurate measure of the credit risk associated with all assets backed by single-family mortgages, including new acquisitions, seasoned loans, and all manners of mortgage backed securities.Footnote 2
 In estimating a CLB, we begin by examining previous house price cycles and the extent to which prices have fallen below the long-term trend. Fig. 1(a) shows three major cycles as real house prices increased over the last thirty years in the United States.Footnote 3 Note the relative constancy of the three national troughs (ranging from 7 % to 10 % below trend), which is striking given the asymmetry of the associated peaks. Whereas house price peaks are characterized by significant variation across cycles, house price troughs are relatively stable across cycles and can be modeled using a standard set of economic incentives. In brief, as house prices fall below trend, housing becomes an increasingly attractive investment—its well-known mean-reverting nature engenders higher expected returns. Investors are incented to enter the market, slowly reaching a critical mass of additional demand sufficient to cause house prices to rebound.Footnote 4
,
Footnote 5 This phenomenon naturally extends to the state level as illustrated in Fig. 1(b), which depicts the distribution of state level troughs across the last three cycles. Distributions are quite similar across cycles with state level troughs typically ranging between five percent and 20 % below trend.Footnote 6
 Similarities of historical troughs across cycles We have organized our design and tests of a CLB into several sections. The second section describes the recent literature related to house price movements. We focus on a specific area: the extent to which house prices can fall. The third section introduces a theoretical framework where investors allocate resources based upon a mean-variance optimization adapted from modern portfolio theory (Markowitz 1952; Freund 1956). Our empirical approach leverages this framework. The fourth section presents regression results and several measures of model fit. Because the CLB has a direct application in dynamic stress testing, we are particularly concerned with not understating the depth of future troughs. This is reflected in our diagnostics, which focus on the under-predictions. The final section offers concluding remarks.",1

More than 20 years after the inception of the Internet, the total head count of these virtual dwellers (Pop) is still expanding rapidly. While the exact amount of space demanded per dweller is difficult to quantify and also likely to change over time, it is safe to assume that Pop and total demand for virtual space are positively correlated: For instance, doubling the number of virtual dwellers is expected to lead to twice the demand for space (keeping all other factors equal). Second, the registration fees and other fixed costs (K

reg
) associated with owning a domain name are negatively related to total registration numbers. The fixed costs are comprised of the wholesale domain registration fees charged by the company that administers the domain registry, the markup added by competing middlemen re-selling domains to end users, and by additional costs for hosting and related services. While the direct costs of owning and hosting a domain have been falling year after year due to intense competition between service providers,Footnote 4 it is safe to assume that K is identical for all registrations in a cross-sectional study.Footnote 5
 Ultimately, each end user of a website needs exercise an effort E to access an online location. This commuting cost depends on domain specific factors like the recognizability and ease of recollection of a specific name and also on the general competitive position of domains versus other forms of virtual space. If the required effort of commuting to a location is low, owning this location is desirable as it is possible to attract end users easily. Locations with high required efforts are less attractive since fewer end users visit. New domains get registered as long as the utility gained from owning marginal domains given a marginal effort level E

marginal
 required by any user exceeds registration costs. In sum, the total number of registrations of domain names can be formalized as with a, b, c, d being scaling parameters accounting for the overall attractiveness of domain names versus other forms of virtual space (a) and the elasticities of registrations with respect to general demand (b), registration costs (c), and maginal efforts or commuting costs (d).
 The marginal effort E

marginal
 is assumed to increase in registration numbers. Domain name registrations exhibit a pecking order regarding domain quality: names that had been registered relatively early tend to be of higher quality than those registered later. Marginal domain registrations, on average, contain out of more characters, are less descriptive and more difficult to memorize than the existing stock, requiring higher efforts by end users as registrations increase. Those high quality and easy to access locations that are claimed first in land rush markets tend to trade for higher values in secondary markets subsequently. The marginal level of effort required by users as more and more lower quality domains get registered, can be generalized as where g and h are scaling factors. The choice of a power function is motivated by Zipf’s observation that the frequency at which a word is used is inversely proportional to this word’s rank in the frequency table (Zipf 1936) and that the rank is a particular power function of word frequency (Zipf 1949). If domains are registered along the rank suggested by the keyword frequency table, the marketing potential of domains will also follow a power law. This notion is supported by Cunha et al. (2011) finding that the frequencies of Twitter hashtags are governed by a Zipfian power distribution. Assuming identical registration costs for all domains, and plugging (2) into (1) can be solved for Registrations and simplified to where where m and n are products of earlier used constants (and therefore constants as well): m = (ab/cKg)– (1+h) and n = − (1 + h). This study assumes the same level of use intensity for all domains. While the classical, traditional monocentric model does include variable density, that is not a necessary feature of the monocentric model. All the essential elements of the monocentric model still come through with a fixed, constant density as shown in Geltner et al. (2001, Chapter 4). In addition, Lindenthal and Loebbecke (2014) have already documented that more valuable domains are more likely to be developed into more extensive websites, which represents a higher use intensity or “density” compared to registrations of lower quality domains without further development. Owner-operated websites are not the only form of cyberspace available to virtual dwellers. Alternatively, they can connect with their audiences through shared spaces like social media platforms, wikis, online market places or direct communications and marketing. For instance, the increasing role of social networks in connecting companies and its customers could weaken the demand for domains in general. A local business might find it more cost-effective to promote its Facebook profile instead of steering customers towards their website. Reversed, changes to search engine algorithms could make it easier for users to find relevant content on millions of individual websites, tilting the balance in favor of owning domains. The competitive position of domains versus other options is, among other factors, accounted for in factor m. This framework also allows investigating demand levels for segments of domains by employing subset specific values for E. For instance, the relative commuting costs for a domain under the COM Top Level Domain (TLD) could differ from the cost of accessing a NET or ORG domain, resulting in the different demand levels for each TLD, documented by Lindenthal (2014). The empirical part of the paper splits a cross-section of domain registrations into subsets for which the level of demand Pop is quantifiable and the number of registered domains is known. The fixed cost K is identically distributed for all domains in cross-section and can therefore be omitted. In a future study, the price sensitivity of domain registrations could be estimated by analyzing longitudinally different values for K. Figure 2 visualizes the approach: For each group of domains, the intersection of the demand curve D1 and D2 and supply curve S1 can be observed as the number of registered domains, R1 and R2. Demand for domains from group 2 is higher than demand for domains from group 1, as indicated by an upward shifted demand curve and higher values for R2 than for R1. This analysis is only feasible if data on fundamental demand levels and registration numbers per segment can be directly observed. Demand and Supply for Domain Names The relationship between the number of potential domain registrants Pop and actual Registrations can now be estimated empirically in the following log-log regression specification: The regression coefficient β estimates the elasticity of Pop and Registrations, α is a constant and ε
i
 an identical and independently distributed error term. Since the price for a domain registration is constant, the elasticity of registrations with respect to Pop should equal 1 by theory if the supply of domains was effectively unconstrained. The regression coefficient β would then have a value of 1. A coefficient estimate significantly below 1, however, would supports the hypothesis of virtual space scarcity: 
The relative increase in the number of registered domains is smaller than the relative increase in the number of potential domain registrants.
 Defining E at the domain level also allows accounting for any differences in linguistic quality between domains and the resulting differences in commuting costs and registrations. Zipf (1936) shows that shorter words tend to appear more frequently in natural languages than long expressions. Similarly, the length of Twitter hashtags is inversely related to their usage frequencies (Cunha et al. 2011). If his principle of least effort also holds true in domain space, shorter domains will be registered more often than long domain names. For instance, bearers of long surnames are less likely to register a domain containing their name than somebody with a relatively short name. To give a simplifying example, domains derived from the keywords “Pennington Associates Milwaukee” might be more tedious to type than any from “Carr Associates Miami”, making the former less likely to appear in registrations. If domain length is a valid proxy for the effort required by users to access a virtual location, then an inverse relation between the length of a string and the number of registrations containing this string can be expected. 
The likelihood of a character string being registered as a domain name decreases in the length of the string.
 To test H2, the variable domain Length is added to (4): A negative estimate for the regression coefficient β
2
 can be interpreted as evidence for different levels of effort required by users – or for the equivalent to commuting costs required by the monocentric city model. In a similar fashion, the number of keywords within a domain name can be interpreted as an additional measure for commuting costs, as more keywords require more effort when memorizing and recalling. However, combining multiple keywords results in a trade-off between brevity and descriptiveness. In case the domains “pizza.com” or “pizzaboston.com” are already taken, “tastypizzaboston.com” might still be available as the electronic storefront of a local pizza place. Theoretically, each additional keyword increases the number of potential domain names by several orders of magnitude: If the total number of viable single keywords is W, then W
2 two-keyword combinations, or W
3 three-keyword combinations are possible. Whoever is willing to accept the higher effort required to access a domain consisting of many keywords has plenty of choice. This trade-off between availability and domain quality reconciles the view of seemingly unconstrained domain supply and the observation that short, low-effort domains are not easy to come by: Just add a few more keywords and you can have any domain you want. This notion motivates one last hypothesis: 
Domain space is less constrained for combinations of multiple keywords than for single-keyword domains.
 To test H3 empirically, the domain registrations for each surname or MSA i are further subdivided into 4 subgroups k, where k denominates the number of keywords in each name. For instance, Registrations

Boston,2
 counts the number of COM registrations containing BOSTON and one additional keyword, Registrations

Boston,3
 is the number domains with two additional keywords, and so forth. The dummy variables D

n
 are defined as 1 if k = n and 0 otherwise. All β’s are regression coefficients:",

Dröes,Marc K. Francke,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"It is a well-established empirical fact that prices and turnover in housing markets are positively correlated. There are several explanations for this correlation ranging from credit constraints (Genesove and Mayer 1997; Stein 1995) and nominal loss aversion (Genesove and Mayer 2001) to hedging incentives (Sinai and Souleles 2005, 2009; Han 2008, 2010). Most previous literature on this topic has focused on the US (see Clayton et al. 2010). Although there have been several European-based studies on price-turnover dynamics, such as for Sweden (Hort 2000), the UK (Andrew and Meen 2003), and the Netherlands (De Wit et al. 2013), there has not yet been a cross-country European study on this topic. This paper aims to fill this gap. There are several key reasons why prices and turnover are positively correlated. First, there may be momentum in both prices and turnover. A market that is on the rise has a tendency to keep rising. There is quite some literature on such momentum effects in house prices (see Case and Shiller 1989, or more recently Lai and Van Order 2010; Beracha and Skiba 2011; Head et al. 2014; Kuang 2014). A common explanation is that housing market frictions (i.e. search frictions, transaction costs) results in a sluggish adjustment of housing markets (see Díaz and Jerez 2013; Merlo et al. 2015). Alternatively, there is also quite some literature that focusses on price expectations and speculative behavior (bubbles) in housing markets (e.g. Case and Shiller 2003; Himmelberg et al. 2005; Glaeser et al. 2008; Han and Strange 2014; Ling et al. 2015). There is, unfortunately, much less known about momentum in housing market turnover. Some notable exceptions are Piazzesi and Schneider (2009), who focus on households beliefs and momentum traders, Krainer (2001), who provides a model of hot and cold housing markets and explains liquidity, amongst others, by the functioning of rental markets, and Anenberg and Bayer (2013) who argue that the cost of simultaneously holding two homes results in a strongly procyclical pattern of residential mobility within the Los Angeles metropolitan area. A second reason that prices and turnover are correlated is because of a lagged feedback mechanism between prices and turnover. A good example of such a feedback mechanism is given by Ortalo-Magné and Rady (2006) (also see Ortalo-Magné and Rady 1999). They show in a life-cycle model setup that increases in income (especially of starter households) can result in price increases and subsequent increases in transaction volume. This effect propagates through the housing market, strengthening itself across the property ladder, and resulting in a positive correlation between prices and transaction volume. The positive correlation in this type of model is typically the result of financial constraints. Other models along this line are those of Wheaton (1990), Stein (1995), Goetzmann and Peng (2006), and Bajari et al. (2013). A related strand of literature also adds behavioral considerations, such as nominal loss aversion, to explain the price-turnover relationship (i.e. Genesove and Mayer 2001; Engelhardt 2003). A third reason for the price-turnover correlation is that there are common (macro-economic) factors that determine both prices and turnover. De Wit et al. (2013), for example, find that especially the mortgage rate explains the price-turnover relationship in the Netherlands. Clayton et al. (2010) argue that also labor market conditions and stock markets are important determinants in the US and that their impact depends on the supply elasticity of housing markets. Andrew and Meen (2003) document a change in the price-turnover relationship in the UK in the early 1990s. They argue that this change is, at least in part, the result of a change in the behavior of first-time buyers. Hort (2000) actually finds a negative contemporaneous correlation in Sweden. Buyers respond to demand shocks while the reservation prices of sellers remain the same. As a result, transaction volume declines but the prices of successful transactions increases. Follain and Velz (1995) also find a negative correlation due to a decrease in the importance of downpayment constraints in the US in the 1990s. Finally, there may be fixed institutional differences across countries that can explain the heterogeneity in price-turnover correlations. In the US, for example, down-payment constraints play an important role in the transaction process. By contrast, there are no such formal down-payment constraints in many European countries, although loan-to-value (LTV) ratios can still be interpreted as a measure of informal constraints imposed by banks (see Chiuri and Jappelli 2003). Other institutional differences across countries include the tax treatment of owner-occupied housing, whether mortgage loans are recourse or non-recourse loans, and the extent to which there are zoning regulations. Although it is out of the scope of this text to provide a full overview of such differences, the fact that we will use cross-country (panel) data at least allows us to control for ‘fixed’ institutional factors that determine prices and turnover. A specific contribution of our paper is that we examine all of the aforementioned determinants of the price-turnover relationship for a set of European countries within a single estimation framework. In particular, we use data on prices and turnover of 16 European countries over the period 1999–2013. The dataset is based on several statistical publications of the European Mortgage Federation and on Eurostat data. The dataset contains information about some key macro-economic and housing market indicators, such as the amount of outstanding mortgage balance to GDP, the interest rates on new mortgage loans, and the housing stock. More importantly, besides data on house prices, the dataset contains information about the number of transactions. Although there have been several OECD/IMF studies examining price dynamics (e.g. Hilbers et al. 2011; André 2010; Andrews 2010; Andrews et al. 2011; Sánchez and Johansson 2011), to the best of our knowledge there is no such study examining the relation between prices and turnover across European countries. A further interesting aspect of the dataset is that it contains data on both the pre-crisis and crisis period. This allows us to examine nominal loss aversion, especially since the timing of the financial crisis, and the extent to which prices declined, has been considerably different across European countries. We simultaneously model prices and turnover as two interdependent endogenous processes. We use a unrestricted panel VAR approach. Since we have 15 years of data we have to pool the data to estimate the VAR parameters. Since including lagged dependent variables in a panel data setup results in biased coefficient estimates (see Nickell 1981), we use an instrumental variable approach along the lines of Arellano and Bond (1991). A further complication is that some of the variables, including prices and turnover, appear to be non-stationary. We examine whether there is cointegration between those variables. We discuss what are the key determinants of prices and turnover for the European countries as a whole (on average) and we will highlight some key differences across countries (decomposition of house price dynamics). The results in this paper show that there is a considerable degree of lagged feedback between prices and turnover. A 1% increase in (real) house prices decreases turnover (normalized by the housing stock) by 0.74%, while a 1% increase in the turnover rate increases prices by 0.24%. There are also strong momentum effects in prices and turnover. Price increases in one year have an effect of 34% on house prices the next year. For turnover this autoregressive effect is even 60%. Jointly with GDP and (real) interest rates, momentum and lagged feedback are key in explaining the price-turnover relationship. In this respect, it is important to note that (lagged) price shocks have an opposite sign in the price and turnover equations and, thus, such shocks act to weaken the positive price-turnover correlation. Other factors, like the loan-to-GDP ratio, population growth, and inflation, do not seem to directly affect prices and turnover. However, a high loan-to-GDP ratio does seem to increase the effect of GDP and interest rates on prices and turnover, although the effects of GDP and interest rates mainly go through turnover. In addition, we do not find evidence for nominal loss aversion or cointegration. Further results based on a historical decomposition of house price changes in Europe show that especially shocks in turnover (contribution of 12.4%) and real house prices (contribution of 6.7%) explain house price dynamics. The key message of this paper is that it is essential to model the interdependency between prices and turnover when examining price (or turnover) dynamics. Our results indicate that there is considerable bias if this interdependency is not explicitly taken into account. In particular, the autoregressive coefficient on house prices is about 14% higher and the autoregressive coefficient on turnover 43% lower if the feedback between prices and turnover is not correctly specified. This is an important result because it implies that part of the (house price) momentum that is typically found in housing markets (i.e. Case and Shiller 1989; Lai and Van Order 2010) can be explained by the feedback between prices and turnover. Further results indicate that the bias in the real GDP coefficient ranges from 21% in the price equation to 3% in the turnover equation. The effect of real interest rates is severely overestimated in the price equation (although its effect is statistically insignificant) and it is underestimated by 21% in the turnover equation. In both equations the year-specific time trends are also underestimated. There is a growing literature suggesting that it is important to account for liquidity when calculating housing returns (Cheng et al. 2013) or property price indices (Fisher et al. 2003; Goetzmann and Peng 2006). We argue that this line of reasoning should be extended to include regression models that aim to explain house price dynamics. It is, therefore, essential that information on housing transactions is publically available. Although most national statistical institutes (besides house price indices) publish such information, the overarching European statistical institute (Eurostat) currently does not. It explains why many cross-country studies (i.e. OECD/IMF) have focused solely on price dynamics. Our results suggest that a proper cross-country comparison should also look at differences in housing market liquidity. This paper is not the first to examine the price-turnover relation in a panel data setup. A closely related paper is the paper by Clayton et al. (2010). Using a similar panel VAR setup, they examine the price-turnover correlation based on data from 114 metropolitan statistical areas in the US between 1990 and 2002. They find that house prices affect turnover, but that the effect is asymmetric. Only price decreases seem to have a (decreasing) effect on turnover. Turnover also has a positive effect on house prices, but only if supply is inelastic. Hence, they conclude that the price-turnover correlation is mainly the result of common factors (e.g. mortgage rate, income) that affect both prices and turnover. Although our results, to some extent, corroborate the findings by Clayton et al. (2010), albeit for a set of European countries, we also show some important new insights. First, we find that although common factors play a role in explaining the price-turnover correlation, the feedback between prices and turnover and the autoregressive component in prices and turnover are more important determinants of the price-turnover correlation in European countries. In part this reflect that the effect of GDP and interest rates, also from a dynamic point of view, goes through turnover and, to a lesser extent, through prices. We further contribute to the existing literature by showing the bias in case the interdependency between prices and turnover is not explicitly taken into account and, as mentioned, relating that bias to explain part of the momentum effect typically found in housing markets (i.e. Case and Shiller 1989; Lai and Van Order 2010). Second, we do not find much evidence for an asymmetric effect. Price decreases, ceteris paribus, seem to increase turnover, which is in line with classical demand theory and stands in contrast to the results of Clayton et al. (2010). Hence, it seems that in European markets the demand effect, at least on average, outweighs the potential negative effects due to nominal loss aversion (Genesove and Mayer 2001). We find this also using data from the crisis period, which was characterized by substantial price declines (Clayton et al. 2010, only use pre-crisis data). By contrast, we do find that the loan-to-GDP ratio acts to strengthen the price-turnover relationship by increasing the effect of GDP and interest rates on prices and turnover (also see Genesove and Mayer 1997). A third contribution is that we use the regression results (impulse response functions) to decompose house price dynamics in several European countries, showing some remarkable differences regarding the role of momentum and turnover in explaining house price dynamics. We focus the discussion on price dynamics, because housing is typically a considerable part of household wealth. So, variations in prices link to variations in wealth. Again, and in line with our earlier findings, shocks in turnover and real house prices, are key in explaining price dynamics in Europe. In a country such as Germany the contribution of turnover is twice as high as in Europe on average. In combination with a low volatility of turnover, this explains why Germany does not have a very price-volatile market. This is an interesting fact for real estate investors, again highlighting the important role of market liquidity in explaining house price dynamics. In France, the autoregressive component plays a more prevalent role. The housing market in France is also more volatile. And, finally, in the UK housing market, which is typically considered to be a highly volatile market, both turnover and momentum, but also unexplained macroeconomic shocks, are key determinants of price dynamics. House prices in the UK decreased considerably in 2008 and 2009, but also turnover decreased by 60% in 2008. This is key in explaining the price volatility in the UK market. In sum, we show that although the actual price dynamics has been different across countries, the underlying components have been largely the same. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section “European data on house prices and turnover” discusses the data used in this study. Section “Methodology” covers the empirical methodology. In Section “Results”, we present the regression results. Section “Conclusion and discussion” provides a conclusion.",10

Bogin,William M. Doerner,William D. Larson,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Mortgage risk management involves assessing credit risk at different points in the housing cycle. The goal is to estimate the extent of losses under a plausible yet stressful economic scenario. House price paths are a key input for determining how severe a scenario will be and how long it will last. Often, these paths are based on projected changes to national or state house price levels.Footnote 1 This paper provides evidence that additional granularity may be informative for risk management because house price cycles can vary significantly between and within cities. Leading up to the Great Recession, many areas of the country experienced rapid house price growth, yet we have observed substantial variation in post-boom price dynamics. How might we determine whether a rapid rise in house price is sustainable, or if price will eventually fall? As Case and Shiller (2003) make clear, price dynamics following a positive demand shock are dependent on the extent of new construction in the area. However, within a city, there is substantial variation in existing density and the supply of buildable sites, leading to different local supply responses. For example, in suburban locations where land is plentiful, it is often easier to expand residential development. If the housing supply is expanded too rapidly, it may exacerbate traffic congestion and increase the relative desirability of center-city housing. These differential supply and congestion effects can lead to unique price dynamics between and within cities, which are often masked at traditional levels of aggregation. This is emphasized by Mian and Sufi (2009), Guerrieri et al. (2013), and others who have examined house price movements since the 1990s, finding broad, differential patterns of house price appreciation rates within cities. We explore local dynamics using a new panel of house price indices (HPIs) between 1975 and 2016 which spans ZIP codes across the entire United States.Footnote 2 We then make two contributions. First, we document the incidence of acceleration episodes between and within cities beginning in the early 1980s. Given the earlier emphasis on tracking stressful conditions, accelerations are defined by increasingly large gains over a short period, or cumulative real house price growth in excess of 50% (log-difference of 0.4) over a 4-years period that is at least 22% (log-difference of 0.2) higher than the cumulative growth in the prior 4-years period. There are four main acceleration periods in the United States since 1980: the private equity boom of the late 1980s, the “dot-com” boom of the late 1990s, the subprime boom of the mid 2000s, and the oil boom of the early 2010s. In general, large cities (over 500,000 housing units in the metropolitan area) experience nearly twice as frequent price accelerations as small cities. Within the city, there is no clear pattern regarding which acceleration episodes occur first within a major cycle, with some time periods led by accelerations in the suburbs (1980s) and others by the center-city (1990s–2010s). Second, we analyze local price dynamics following a substantial acceleration. In the first four to 5 years after an acceleration episode, real house price decline, irrespective of location or time period. However, the speed and extent of adjustments fluctuate between areas. For instance, price in large cities fall less than in small cities, and areas near the centers of large cities fall by less than areas in the suburbs. Additionally, cities with an inelastic housing supply, including those with a highly regulated housing market or those in a state of long-run economic decline, experience less of a drop in price. Cities with declines in real price prior to the acceleration observe smaller price decreases relative to cities where the acceleration was preceded by a period of slow-but-steady increases. Finally, we provide evidence about recoveries across areas within cities, as well as between certain sizes and types of cities. Given the richness of our data, we can measure cycles over several historical periods of market volatility. We find evidence that the initial price declines following an acceleration overshoot, on average, as real price changes in years four through eight following an acceleration are generally positive. Overall, when taking into account the full 12 years of analysis (4 years of acceleration and the 8 years post-acceleration), real house price are, generally, at or above pre-acceleration levels in all city types for all locations within the city. These findings are consistent with a dynamic, rational expectations model with location-specific housing supply constraints, similar to Glaeser et al. (2014) and Head et al. (2014),Footnote 3 where a permanent demand shift leads to a sharp initial increase in price. This price response induces new construction, and price fall over the succeeding years as quantities absorb some of the demand change. Over the course of the next 4 years, price often fall back to pre-shock levels (or even more in supply-elastic areas) but, subsequently, recover. By 8 years post-acceleration, most areas are above pre-shock levels. It appears as though accelerations are initiated by changes to long-run perceptions of a location’s desirability, in the vein of Lee et al. (2015), who suggest that a high price level indicates strong current and future expectations of economic fundamentals. While some areas experience cumulative real appreciation that is positive, that is not always the case. In particular places, the real price level at the end of the 12 year window is below pre-acceleration levels. This reflects a temporary demand shock combined with a housing construction response, such as in the case of Favara and Imbs (2015). For instance, there is broad evidence that lending standards and credit constraints may be temporarily relaxed in a subprime boom (Dell’Ariccia et al. 2012). If there is no construction response, then real house price are more likely to be bounded below by the pre-shock levels (Ortalo-Magné and Rady, 2006). Combined, our results indicate an adjustment process where an initial demand shock leads to a period of price acceleration, real house price overshoot when supply is constrained in the short-run, and then price eventually adjust to a new equilibrium based upon changes in the housing stock as well as the persistence of the demand shock. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to provide broad evidence of both between and within-city variation in post-acceleration price dynamics. The localized nature of these price movements emphasizes the importance of studying more granular house price paths.Footnote 4 Our results also suggest that differential magnitudes and speeds of adjustment are predictable based on not just city-level characteristics, but sub-market characteristics as well using real estate location theory. While these estimates cover four major periods and may thus face issues of macroeconomic generalizability, patterns across areas are clear and robust. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. The next section defines how local house price data can be used to identify substantial acceleration episodes. The third section describes the incidence and location of such accelerations. The fourth section documents, after acceleration episodes, the extent to which real house price decline and whether they subsequently recover. We show significant variation in price dynamics both across and within cities. Concluding remarks are in the final section.",8

Munneke,Joseph T. L. Ooi,Geoffrey K. Turnbull,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Sequential sales of similar assets occur regularly in real estate, for example, in new residential subdivisions, industrial parks, and condominium developments. It is not surprising then, that there is a modest but growing literature examining asset pricing in such situations. Simply stated, the law of one price holds that identical assets sold sequentially sell at the same equilibrium price. Otherwise, it is argued, in frictionless markets speculators could buy in the low-price period and arbitrage potential gains. Nonetheless, the literature offers empirical examples of price-sales sequence anomalies that appear to deviate from this pattern. This paper offers new empirical evidence on the sales sequence-price relation for residential developments in a regulatory setting that minimizes consumption risk, completion risk, and agglomeration economies. The analysis uncovers underlying non-monotonic sales sequence-price relations that differ systematically for high-rise and mid-rise developments when correcting for unit selectivity effects. The results represent price anomalies in that they become evident after removing the consumption risk, completion risk, and unit selectivity effects previously identified in the literature as likely factors driving sales sequence-price patterns. The auction literature provides much of the early motivation for studying price-sales sequence anomalies. Ashenfelter (1989) first observed the so-called “afternoon effect” of declining prices over the sequence of sales in wine and art auctions. He attributes this pattern to risk-averse buyers who are willing to pay a higher price in early periods because the opportunity to buy later is increasingly uncertain as the sales sequence proceeds (Ashenfelter 1989; McAfee and Vincent 1993). On the other hand, prices may rise over the sales sequence because relative demand increases when sold units and the buyers of those units are no longer potential participants as the sequence of auctions proceeds (Van Den Berg et al. 2001). In a different vein, Milgrom and Weber (1982) show that later buyers in the sequence of sales draw information from earlier sales to reduce their valuation risk, leading to different bidding strategies as the sales sequence progresses. While the auction literature provides early examples and motivation for studying price-sales sequence relations, most real estate in the U.S. is sold in open (non-auction) markets. The extent to which insights from auction markets apply in open markets is not clear. Nonetheless, there is evidence of persistent price effects for lots or housing sold in sequence by developers. Theoretical explanations for these patterns emphasize the role of prices capitalizing the declining consumption risk as new residential developments are completed or the increasing agglomeration economies as new industrial parks or commercial developments fill in (Rauch 1993; Sirmans et al. 1997). The empirical study by Fu and Qian (2014) concludes that speculators do not stabilize prices but instead reinforce momentum effects driving prices from fundamental values. Munneke et al. (2011) find statistically significant increases in selling price over the sales sequence in a low consumption risk environment, although the magnitude of the increases is economically insignificant. The pattern persists even when controlling for differences in sales momentum across development projects. This paper provides new evidence on the sales price-sales sequence pattern for real estate, controlling for two possible price anomaly sources largely ignored thus far in the real estate literature, namely development scale effects and possible self-selection bias. The data cover market transactions for new condominiums in Singapore. The Singapore condo market has several advantages for studying the relation between selling price and sales sequence. It is standard for developers to offer condo units on the open market (i.e., non-auction) before the development project is completed. The government strictly regulates developers and their handling of buyers’ payments in order to minimize the risk of project failure and to ensure that projects fulfill all of the detailed requirements spelled out in the approved development plan, from development amenities and architectural features to individual unit floor plans. These regulations mean that consumers should not be subject to the types of consumption risk that Sirmans et al. (1997) argue explains rising prices over the sequence of sales observed for single family houses in new developments in the U.S. The condominium product sold under these regulatory constraints more closely resembles a commodity than do heterogeneous units of detached single family housing. The sale of new condominiums in Singapore therefore yields an excellent opportunity to examine whether the phenomenon of increasing prices observed for single family homes in the literature also holds when housing consumption risk is minimal and invariant through the entire sequence of individual condo unit sales for each development. Applying the theory offered by Sirmans et al. (1997), developers need not sell the first units at a discount to compensate households for greater consumption risk in the Singapore market because consumption risk is unlikely to vary over the sales period. Thus, any price-sequence relation observed in this market is not likely driven by consumption risk effects. The sample of transactions covers about 20,000 new condominium units sold in Singapore over 1996–2005. The hedonic models include the usual characteristics, controlling for differences in observable features across development projects and individual units as well as broader real estate market conditions. The models include an additional variable indicating the order in which individual units sell within each development. The pooled sample OLS estimates reveal a statistically significant negative relation between sales sequence and price of about 2% in annualized terms, qualitatively similar to Munneke et al. (2011) for a different sample of development projects. In addition, though, our analysis shows that the scale of the development project influences the price-sequence relation. While the pooled sample and high-rise developments (greater than 10 stories) show declining prices over the sales sequence, mid-rise developments (defined as 10 and fewer stories) show the opposite pattern of rising prices over the sales sequence, evidence of development scale effects. Nonetheless, the OLS estimates do not account for one possible explanation of changing prices over the sales sequence, that buyers respond to subtle differences in quality across condo units that are not observed in the data. Or, more informed buyers may arrive earlier in the sales process.Footnote 1 Additionally, developer marketing efforts may also generate self-selection effects in the data to the extent that they systematically release blocks of units for sale, which may lead to quality differences in units offered at different points in the sales sequence.Footnote 2 The auction literature provides a similar rationale for selection effects that may drive observed price-sales sequence relations (Ashenfelter and Genesove 1992; Beggs and Graddy 1997; Burguet 2005). Hollans et al. (2013) find rising prices over the first half of the sales sequence of newly developed subdivision lots (4%) but falling prices near the end and attribute the discounts to lower quality lots being developed last; they do not, however, formally test for lot quality selection effects. Therefore, we also introduce a multinomial selection correction to control for price effects that can arise when choice units tend to sell earlier than less desired units in the sales sequence, regardless of the source of this pattern. The selection-corrected results indicate that the negative price-sales sequence effect observed in our initial OLS estimates are systematically biased as suspected. The selection corrected pooled sample estimates reveal a U-shaped sales sequence-price pattern of declining prices in the early part of the sales sequence followed by rising prices up to project completion. Prices of sales after project completion are stable. With respect to scale effects, the high-rise and mid-rise subsamples yield distinct price patterns. The high-rise sample of development projects exhibits a U-shaped pattern similar to the pooled sample with the addition of slight increases in prices during the post-completion phase. In contrast, the mid-rise sample of development projects exhibits surprisingly stable prices across all development phases except for significantly higher prices in the relatively short period phase before project completion, a pattern that yields a modest inverted U-shape. As stated at the outset, these patterns represent true anomalies in that they are only evident after controlling for the effects thought to drive sales sequence-price relations observed in earlier studies.",4

Exploring Cross-Border Investor Preferences in US Gateway Cities,October 2019,Steven Devaney,David Scofield,Fangchen Zhang,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Financial reforms across many developed economies in the 1970s and 1980s ushered in an era of liberalized capital markets that facilitated large scale cross-border investment in both financial and real assets. This presaged tremendous growth in global real estate investment in the decades that followed. Cross border investment in real estate may be motivated by push factors such as economic policies in the home nation and comparatively fewer opportunities for investment in the home market, and pull factors such as expectations of returns from the host market and potential diversification benefits. However, such activity is typically selective when it comes to the countries, cities and assets that are chosen for investment. Geurts and Jaffe (1996) and Holsapple et al. (2006) draw attention to institutional factors, risks and costs that influence the destination of cross-border real estate investment, something that has been studied empirically at a country level, but which also applies to choices of locations and assets within target countries. It is the latter aspect that this paper seeks to explore further. McAllister and Nanda (2015) suggest that certain cities act as gateway markets for foreign real estate investment in their countries. These are often the largest cities in which a critical mass of investors, advisors and information exists that serves to enhance liquidity and reduce information, search and transaction costs for cross-border investors. Moreover, in such cities, the distribution of foreign investor activity is unlikely to be uniform across areas or types of assets. We anticipate that the properties targeted by cross-border investors will be larger, newer and located in the best researched (CBD) submarkets where the perceived advantages of quality, transparency and the ability to deploy significant capital are likely to be greatest.Footnote 1 Yet there are very few studies to date that examine the revealed preferences of cross-border investors at a micro-level. Hence, this study examines six important gateway cities for cross-border real estate investment in the United States to determine the asset and submarket preferences of non-domestic investors in such cities. We analyze real estate acquisitions in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and Washington DC over 2003–2016. These were the largest cities for domestic institutional investment in our study period and were among the top destinations for cross-border investment in commercial real estate. We use multilevel logit techniques which reflect that the probability of choosing particular types of assets might be conditional on selection of a particular metro at an earlier stage of investment decision making. The modelling uses an array of property characteristics, control variables and lagged total return rates for different property types in each area to understand the factors that might be driving investment choices. We find that cross-border investors prefer larger properties, newer properties and CBD locations regardless of nationality. This is consistent with our expectations. However, we find that German and Chinese investors exhibit distinct preferences for specific property types, while there are also differences in trend chasing behavior among cross-border investors, this being particularly evident for the Canadian investors in our sample. The study of individual national groups is an important innovation in this study, as prior research typically treats foreign/cross-border investors as a single entity. This is problematic if preferences for certain attributes vary between investors from different nations. Cultural and institutional factors may influence the risk and return preferences of different investor groups, and hence the preferences for those attributes that influence asset performance, leading to different outcomes regarding asset acquisition.",6

Cohen,Michael LaCour-Little,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"On October 21–22, 2018, Fannie Mae hosted a Symposium on Real Estate Valuation in Washington, D.C. The event was developed in conjunction with the Appraisal Foundation, and the University of Connecticut’s Center for Real Estate and Urban Economic Studies. Dozens of manuscripts were submitted and, after Program Committee Review, fifteen papers were accepted for presentation during the two-day event. After receiving comments from a discussant on the program, authors were invited to submit revised manuscripts for consideration at the journal. Jeffrey Cohen of the University of Connecticut and Michael LaCour-Little of Fannie Mae served as guest special issue editors. In order to avoid the appearance of any conflict of interest, papers with University of Connecticut co-authors were handled by Michael Lacour-Little and papers with Fannie Mae co-authors were handled by Jeffrey Cohen. After a blind peer review process for those papers submitted for consideration in this special issue of the journal, a total of eleven manuscripts were accepted for publication. These papers are now published in this two-volume special issue of the Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics. The papers in this volume can be classified in two sub-areas within valuation: appraisal and assessment. While valuation is the underlying theme of both appraisal and assessment, the papers in this special issue follow quite different approaches, including some that focus on novel innovations in econometric techniques, others with an international focus, and one using popular machine learning techniques. Together these papers provide important insights into real estate valuation, both for multifamily and single-family segments of the market. We would like to thank the additional members of the Program Committee, which included Robert B. Avery, Federal Housing Finance Agency; John Brenan, The Appraisal Foundation; Daniel McMillen, University of Illinois; Raven S. Malloy, Federal Reserve Board of Governors; and Peter M. Zorn, Freddie Mac. The views expressed are the authors’ alone and not those of Fannie Mae or the Federal Housing Finance Agency.",3

Some of the main regulatory reforms which have been introduced at the international level include Basel III, the Alternative Investment Fund Management Directive (AIFMD) and the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR). Whereas Basel III extends the regulations for depository institutions imposed by Basel II, the AIFMD is a new regulation that targets non-UCITS funds, which are regarded as alternative funds including private equity, hedge funds and real estate funds in order to increase the transparency of that market and better protect investors. The EMIR is another regulation whose aim is to increase the transparency of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivative markets. The above regulations potentially could have strong direct or indirect effects on real estate companies. We could observe indirect effects stemming from Basel III given the high credit intensity of direct real estate as an asset class. Real estate companies purchase assets for investment purposes and in order to do so, they operate with high leverage – tapping into the debt markets. Bank credit is still the predominant source of financing for listed real estate companies investing in income-producing properties. Hence, companies strongly relying on bank loans can be affected if banks are subject to new regulations. This could happen through the bank lending channel (Gambacorta 2005; Milcheva 2013a). Banks may change the funding costs for real estate companies in response to the financial regulation and this can have effects on the valuation of the companies and hence their performance. Other types of regulation such as AIFMD target directly real estate companies and funds. They can be associated with increases in the cost of compliance or increases in operating costs therefore having a direct impact on the cash flows of real estate companies. Finally, given that real estate is a lumpy asset requiring long-term financing, real estate companies may decide to hedge interest rate risk using derivative products. The instruction of EMIR could thus have strong effects on real estate companies which are trading such securities and may have indirect effects on the cost of hedging and hence their performance. Overall, there is scarce research assessing the impacts of the recent financial market reforms. The lack of empirical research in this area thus far is due to the dearth of data and the uncertainty surrounding some of the regulatory reforms. Most of the research that has assessed the relationship between regulation and asset prices has looked at the role of bubbles on financial institutions. Schleifer and Vishny (2011) discuss the effect of real estate bubble bursts on leveraged financial institutions and a subsequent deleveraging and fire sales. Crowe et al. (2013) argue that real estate booms which are financed through credit and involve leverage would lead to more pronounced regulatory actions associated with macroprudential regulations. Allen and Carletti (2013) develop a model of real estate pricing in two regimes accounting for borrowing and agency problems and use it to analyze the effects of macroprudential policies. Some of those regulatory measures include loan-to-value (LTV) restrictions and capital requirements. Basett and Blake Marsh (2016) look specifically at the effects of financial market regulations on banks with high exposure to commercial real estate loans. They show that such banks reduce the provision of commercial real estate lending and substitute it with housing lending when faced with higher regulation. Such macroprudential regulation can affect the bank behavior and hence real estate loan provision. Cronin and McQuinn (2016) show for the Irish housing market that regulations targeting LTV ratios for bank loans would lead to higher demand for rental accommodation and higher rents. Overall, we see that there is a relationship between asset prices and in particular real estate prices and regulation – but most of it from a macroeconomic perspective. Although we still cannot assess the long-term welfare implications without awaiting the full implementation of the regulations, this study provides a first assessment of the contemporaneous effects of financial regulations on the listed real estate sector. Our main focus is on analyzing the impact of regulation on the value of equity as well as market risk of listed real estate companies in selected European countries with well-developed listed real estate markets (France, Germany and the U.K.). We assess whether announcements about regulatory reforms post-GFC affect those companies and what are the channels of transmission of the news. We assess the channels through which regulatory news affect the performance of listed real estate companies distinguishing between type, size, leverage, and location of the companies. As our focus will be on news about financial regulation, we use an event study methodology to assess the implications of stock returns. Event studies have traditionally been used to evaluate the impacts of regulatory news and go back to Schwert (1981). They have mainly been used to assess the effects of changes in the market value of equity since it is most sensitive to information given the residual-claim nature for investors of the asset class. More recently, this methodology has been applied to assess the impacts of policy and regulatory actions associated with the GFC. For example, Schäfer et al. (2015) look at the effects of press announcements of major country-level banking regulations post-GFC on stock returns in Germany, Switzerland, the U.K. and the U.S. They find that the largest implications for returns stem from the Dodd-Frank reform enacted in the U.S. and in particular from the Volcker rule. Bongini et al. (2015) conduct a case study to investigate the effects associated with the publication of a list of systemically important financial institutions (SIFI) and new regulation for too-big-to-fail (TBTF) banks. They find that only the returns of institutions which are poorly capitalized respond significantly negatively to the announcements. Fratianni and Marchionne (2013) use an event study to assess the effects of government intervention announcements to inject capital in troubled banks and the banking industry as a whole following the GFC. They find that the effects of announcements to help individual banks have negative effects on the stocks of those banks. Announcements about government support for the entire financial sector have however no significant effects on bank valuations when controlling for time and bank fixed effects. The authors conclude that such announcements were either not credible or not appropriate to address the problems in the financial markets. Veronesi and Zingales (2010) find that the effect of the Paulson Plan on the valuation of banks had a positive effect decreasing the probability of bankruptcy, providing benefits for bondholders of major investment banks. Georgiadis and Graeb (2016) show that announcements about the asset purchase program by the European Central Bank (ECB) have significant effects on equity indices across different countries, government bond yields and exchange rates. The use of event studies requires the correct identification of the regulatory events or event periods. An investigation of large-scale financial market regulations such as Basel can present a challenge since the reform is subject to a complex negotiation process over several years and has been phased out several times already. Such large-scale regulations involve a lot of parties, such as consultants, lawyers, politicians, governments, regulated institutions (i.e., banks and fund managers), investors, who meet to discuss the reforms which can affect the likelihood of one or another outcome. This means that financial market participants continuously adjust their expectations with regards to the regulation following unexpected announcements. Therefore, markets would react only if the outcomes differ from their expectations. If, for example, there is news about regulation becoming more lax, markets would respond positively, and vice versa. However, the reforms can be a predictable process and could already have been reflected in the prices of stocks prior to the official announcement. Therefore, we want to identify the true impact of the regulatory event, not when the reform has officially been introduced, but when, for the first time, news about the regulatory reform has become available. We follow the methodologies in O’Hara and Shaw (1990) and Schäfer et al. (2015) to identify events by looking at major newspapers. In particular, we follow a three-step approach. First, we search for news containing the name of the regulatory reform in the Financial Times. We select as news associated with Basel III those articles which have been published on the front page. The reason is that Basel III is a major international financial market reform and information representing real news should appear as a headline of a major international financial newspaper. Regarding the identification of the AIFMD and EMIR, a front page search is problematic, as these are more specific regulations which do not necessary feature on front pages. For them, we consider articles across all pages which contain the name of the regulation. Second, the ultimate choice of the events is made by screening all identified articles and assessing if it is considered news or not. Third, we double check if the dates identified feature in other media such as other newspapers, regulatory bodies’ websites or news agencies (i.e., Bloomberg). Our results show large differences across the three regulations. Basel III and EMIR have overall small aggregate effects on the performance as they do not directly regulate real estate companies. However we find some support for the regulatory burden hypothesis of the bank lending channel. We document that the banking regulation negatively affects small firms and firms with low debt-to-equity ratios. This may suggest that the strongest effect is observed for firms who cannot diversify their funding sources and are thus hit strongest by Basel III. The direct channel through the AIFMD supports rather the profit-based reaction hypothesis. Mainly large firms are affected positively by the regulation which can be due to identified regulatory arbitrage opportunities for real estate companies if they do not have to comply with AIFMD. Overall, we see that different regulation can have opposite effects on companies and it is important to look at them separately as well as assess the impacts of tighter regulation news and loosening regulation news separately. We find strong evidence for asymmetric effects with negative news more frequently leading to significant responses.",7

Sousa,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"The burst of the technological bubble in the early 2000s propelled interest rates to historically low levels, setting the pace to housing price booms in a large number of developed countries. As the subprime mortgage market collapsed in the Summer of 2007, prices sharply fell, a long and persistent slump in the housing market began and the world economy witnessed the Great Recession. These developments prompted a great deal of attention about the relevance of the housing market in explaining business cycle fluctuations (Mallick and Mohsin; 2016; Dufrénot and Malik 2012) and its close links with the financial sector (Granville and Mallick 2009; Sousa 2010a, b). Most importantly, the severity and persistence of the Great Recession - and its roots on the sub-prime mortgage segment of the housing sector lending - highlighted four major aspects: 1) the importance of assessing the intricate effects of securitization and mortgage market development and transformation on the duration of housing booms and busts;Footnote 12) the relevance of integrating the impact of housing finance characteristics and institutional mortgage market differences on the likelihood of housing booms (busts) ending in a way that is informative for the design of a preventive macro-prudential toolkit; 3) the pertinence of a thorough calibration of government participation in housing finance to avoid the potential exacerbation of housing price swings; and 4) the general need to better understand the characteristics of the different phases of the housing cycle and the specific factors underpinning them (Loungani 2010a, ; Igan et al. 2011, 2012). These are the key goals of our paper. Using quarterly data for a group of 20 OECD countries and relying on continuous-time and discrete-time Weibull models, we show that being part of the group of countries where the degree of securitization of the housing market is high does not significantly affect the length of housing booms. However, there is evidence, albeit weak, that reveals that a move towards a more liberalized mortgage sector is associated with longer housing booms: a one unit rise in the degree of mortgage sector liberalization reduces the likelihood of the end of a housing boom by, approximately, 68.5%. In contrast, when the degree of securitization or the degree of development of the mortgage sector is high, housing busts tend to be shorter, with the hazard rate of a housing bust ending rising by a scale factor of close to 1.5. We also find that the length of housing booms and busts is particularly sensitive to some housing finance characteristics. For instance, mortgage equity withdrawals tend to make housing booms longer and to reduce the duration of housing busts. Thus, when households can borrow against accumulated housing equity, credit can be boosted in the context of a rise in house prices. By keeping debt service-to-income ratios affordable, high average typical terms (in years) can also help to prolong the duration of housing booms. There is also some evidence showing that longer housing booms and shorter housing busts emerge when: (i) the issuance of covered bonds increases; (ii) the typical loan-to-value ratio is high; (iii) households have the possibility of refinancing; and (iv) there is some flexibility in the adjustment of the interest rate. Thus, high loan-to-value ratios propel borrowers to take out more debt and the absence of early repayment fees ease the ability of households to refinance their mortgage debt when interest rates fall. Greater development of the secondary market for mortgage loans goes in tandem with easier tap funding for lenders in the capital markets. All in all, the economic significance of specific housing finance characteristics is of first-order magnitude: 1) a higher average typical term or a higher loan-to-value ratio reduces the likelihood of the end of a housing boom by 5.7% or 2.5%, respectively; 2) mortgage equity withdrawals allow a two- to three-fold increase in the odds of a housing bust ending; 3) a one percentage point increase in the issuance of covered bonds (as percentage of residential loans outstanding) raise the hazard rate of a housing bust ending by nearly 2%; and 4) a one percentage point in the mortgage debt to GDP ratio raises the likelihood of a normal time spell ending by close to 1%. Finally, in what concerns government involvement in housing finance, our results show that some support measures can influence the length of housing market cycle phases. In particular, while tax deductibility of mortgage interest is associated with longer housing booms, capital gains tax deductibility is linked with shorter episodes of fast house price appreciation. Additionally, the provision of guarantees or loans from state-owned or state-sponsored financial institutions and finance agencies can prolong the duration of housing booms. As for housing busts, the empirical evidence corroborates the idea that greater participation of the government in the mortgage market is not necessarily a shield against such phases of the housing market cycle. However, early withdrawals (for house purchase) from provident funds - as a way of providing liquidity to the mortgage sector - can be effective at reducing the duration of housing busts. From a policy perspective, our work emphasizes that housing finance regulation can help mitigating undesirable “boom-bust” house price fluctuations. It also shows how monetary policy can crucially complement it (Granville and Mallick 2009; Mallick and Mohsin 2010, 2016; Sousa 2010b; Castro 2011; Arslan et al. 2015a). Finally, it reveals that government participation in housing finance should be carefully designed to avoid unintended consequences (such as, an amplification of house price fluctuations). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section “Review of the Literature” reviews the existing literature on housing market. Section “Modelling Approaches” presents the econometric model, while “Data” describes the data. Section “Empirical Analysis” discusses the empirical results. Finally, Section “Conclusions” concludes.",16

With money of their beneficiaries at stake, high variability of PERE returns coupled with a low liquidity of PERE investments, makes picking the “right” fund increasingly important. At the same time, fund selection is complicated by the opaqueness of the asset class, which leaves investors with relatively little information about potential investments. In these circumstances conventional wisdom among institutional investors is to select funds by those PERE fund management firms (also known as general partners, GPs) whose previous funds were successful. Industry data corroborates this: according to Preqin (2018), 69% of interviewed institutional investors indicated that successful management team track record is the most important factor when selecting a new fund. Apparently, investors believe in performance persistence i.e. that performance of successive funds by the same GP is correlated. Another piece of information that may be available to institutional investors during a fund-picking process is limited partner (LP) reinvestment. If current fund investors decide to stay with the GP and reinvest their capital in the GP’s next fund, the outside investors may use it as a signal of satisfaction with the manager and of high anticipated returns. The importance of LP reinvestments is underlined by the fact that in private equity the information about the quality of different GPs is often inaccessible and restricted to existing investors (Lerner et al. 2007). This way, in the situation of information deficit, LP reinvestment serves as an additional aid in the investor’s decision-making process. Either of these rationales implicitly assumes that GP firms vary in their ability to lead a fund to success. Such intrinsic ability is often referred to as managerial skill and can manifest itself through a number of outlets, for example, by picking the right markets and investments (Diller and Kaserer 2009; Fuerst and Matysiak 2013; Axelson et al. 2009; Anson and Hudson-Wilson 2003; Baum and Farrelly 2009), market timing (Diller and Kaserer 2009; Alcock et al. 2013), negotiation skills, ability to source and execute more complex deals (Baum and Farrelly 2009), successfully deploying leverage (Alcock et al. 2013) and avoiding losses (Bollen and Pool 2009). Despite the limited empirical evidence on managerial skill in PERE, the expectation that managerial skill affects PERE performance is not unreasonable. Information asymmetries inherent to PERE lead to systematic differences in knowledge about investment opportunities, and good deals tend to concentrate in the portfolios of the skilled management teams (Diller and Kaserer 2009). Additionally, better GPs may have proprietary access to particular transactions, thus being able to access better investments (Kaplan and Schoar 2005). These notions are indirectly confirmed by the recent findings of negatively skewed PERE returns, indicating that only few GPs deliver high returns (Fuerst et al. 2014; Delfim and Hoesli 2016). Finally, value-added and opportunity investment styles explicitly rely on skills of the managers for adding value. Overall, PERE serves as a favorable setting for manifestation of differences in skill among GP firms, and it is possible that PERE returns are affected by managerial skill – at least to a certain extent. Traditional way of analyzing managerial skill in the setting of private equity, mutual and hedge funds has been through performance persistence, as repeating successful performance is believed to be attributed to the existence of skill (Gompers et al. 2010; Acharya et al. 2013; Braun et al. 2017) and allows distinguishing skill from luck (Bollen and Pool 2009). The logic is that if funds of the same firm consistently outperform their peers, this serves as an indication of skill. Performance persistence as an evidence of managerial skill has been documented by e.g. Grinblatt and Titman (1992), Elton et al. (1993), and Elton et al. (1996) for managing firms of mutual funds, Agarwal and Naik (2000) and Kosowski et al. (2007) for hedge fund managing companies, and by Kaplan and Schoar (2005) and Harris et al. (2014b) and Braun et al. (2017) in non-real estate private equity GPs. In PERE, Hahn et al. (2005), Tomperi (2010) and Aarts and Baum (2016) study performance persistence among successive funds by the same GP, however, they do not explicitly establish the link between managerial skill and performance persistence, but rather analyze performance persistence as an independent phenomenon. Indeed, as they analyze either raw (Tomperi 2010) or normalized (Hahn et al. 2005; Aarts and Baum 2016) returns, the documented persistence can be driven by the funds’ risk profiles rather than the skill of the GPs. Existing evidence by Fuerst and Matysiak (2013) and Delfim and Hoesli (2016) shows that fund-specific characteristics such as investment style, vintage and size affect PERE returns, thus indicating that persistence in non-risk-adjusted performance cannot be readily taken as an evidence of managerial skill. Farrelly and Stevenson (2016), on the contrary, find that fund characteristics have little statistically significant effect on fund performance, however, they conjecture that performance is rather driven by exact real estate investment decisions, which, based on the above examples, is also related to the skill of the GP. Focusing on the effect of investment style on performance, Fisher and Hartzell (2016) demonstrate that there is no difference in performance between value-add and core PERE funds, while combined together they outperformed core assets in the ODCE index during the time period of 1980–2003 and under-performed it in the 2004–2008 vintages. This paper contributes to the understanding of managerial skill of PERE GPs in two respects. First, unlike existing PERE literature, we analyze persistence in realized risk-adjusted returns by successive funds of same GP, and thus capture performance driven by skill. In particular, we use after fee cash flow, valuation and descriptive data of 261 European PERE funds sourced from three major data providers covering vintages from 1997 to 2013 to, first, calculate each fund’s realized IRR and, second, to risk-adjust the IRRs on the effect of style, geography, size and vintage, to obtain abnormal returns, which we use for our performance persistence analysis. This approach allows us to capture the persistence borne by skill, rather than persistence in the risk profile of funds by the same GP.Footnote 1 Our evidence suggests that abnormal performance persists between focal and previous, and focal and second previous funds of the same GP, in contrast to Hahn et al. (2005) and Aarts and Baum (2016), who discover persistence only in a short-term. Further, we find that persistence is not uniform among poorly performing and successful funds. In particular, persistence is stronger for pairs where predecessor is a winner compared to persistence found in the overall sample. On the contrary, performance does not persist in the pairs with loser predecessor. We confirm our results using an alternate methodology. Using a probit model, we document that the probability of winning performance is higher for winners than it is for losers, while probability of losing performance is not predicted by the loser predecessor funds. Our results suggest that skilled GPs consistently deliver successful risk-adjusted performance, while for inept GPs performance does not persist. Puzzled with the lack of persistence in abnormal performance of loser funds, we hypothesize that this result could be driven by the random events outside managers’ powers. PERE funds’ assets and local markets they operate in are highly heterogeneous, and hence bear high idiosyncratic risk. If some of the skilled GPs’ funds were affected by such random events, abnormal performance could be a noisy indication of skill. In order to capture the underlying skill in such scenarios, we turn to analyze managerial skill from the perspective of LP reinvestment. Fund LPs, as fund insiders, should be able to gather “soft information” about the managers, as opposed to the fund outsiders who have access to only “hard information” such as realized returns (Hochberg et al. 2014). In other words, LPs should be able to perceive managerial skill of their GPs, despite negative effect of random events. Having learnt about skill of their GPs, LPs react rationally by making full use of this information and thus reinvest their capital in the GP’s next fund (Berk and Green 2004; Phalippou 2010). We then conjecture that if incumbent LPs decide to reinvest their capital in the GP’s follow-on fund, it can serve as an indication of skill observed by the investors.Footnote 2 The second contribution of this paper is extending the analysis of GP skill in PERE to LP reinvestment. Although the idea of associating reinvestment with GP skill is not new, it has mostly appeared in LP performance studies (e.g. Lerner et al. (2007) and Phalippou (2010) for non-real estate private equity). To our knowledge, it has not been used in the context of GP performance. We show that, firstly, reinvested funds overall are more probable to become winners, indicating that reinvested funds are funds by skilled GPs. Secondly, reinvested loser and non-winner funds have a higher probability of winning than non-reinvested ones, confirming our hypothesis that some of the loser fund GPs, too, possess skill. We conclude that reinvestment has a signaling value that can be used in a fund-selection process and is a more robust managerial skill indicator than performance persistence, as it registers skill in spite of the effect of random events. The remaining of the paper is structured as follows. The next section provides an overview of the existing literature on the topic. Section 3 explains the empirical strategy. Section 4 describes the data used in this study. Sections 5 presents the results of model estimations. Section 6 contains the results of the robustness test. The last section concludes.",1

Such behavior under various economic environments is not straightforward to examine as outcomes may change for different types of agents at different points of economic cycles. While there is a robust theoretical understanding of this process, the empirical evidence is rather thin with mixed outcomes. Therefore, our objective is to examine if buyers and sellers behave differently when the same information is available in the market and their asymmetric responses to returns that reflect both demand- and supply-sides trends. We do so by analyzing various phases of upturns and downturns in economic cycles. In this paper, we particularly focus on the real estate sector because it provides some unique features such as market imperfections and precautionary savings that lend support to the rational expectations permanent income hypothesis (Hall 1978). In real estate, volume of investment tends to be lumpy and long-term commitments are required to hold assets i.e. mortgages, debt structures. Therefore, real estate funds hold cash as a cushion in phases of the liquidity to avoid fire sales when property prices are falling. Furthermore, funds do not always spend according to rational expectations and tend to retain cash to create available resources in times when funding is not available. Finally, the distributed lag of past actual income determines a timing mismatch between the investment decision and the deployment of money (i.e. 6–9 months trading period; see Ling et al. 2009). Consideration of these market features in understanding how sellers and buyers respond variously to changes in economic condition is particularly important. Therefore, using several proxies derived from a survey of institutional investors, we explore (and find evidence for) demand-supply mismatches and the existence of feedback loops, which follow asymmetric patterns over the market cycle. We study several real estate sectors over 1995–2010 and test our hypotheses variously using within a structural panel VAR framework and analyzing impulse response functions. We have organized the rest of the paper as follows: firstly, we discuss relevant literature in detail, and we identify testable hypotheses within the literature; we then describe the data and empirical framework used in this study in “Data Description” and “Empirical Framework” sections. Finally, we present an in-depth analysis of the empirical evidence, robustness checks and provide conclusions in the last two sections.",2

Anderson,Scott Gibson,Michael J. Seiler,Male,Male,Male,Male,"When returns are associated with specific probabilistic outcomes, risk aversion describes a person’s insistence on requiring additional return when taking on an additional unit of risk. This approach to decision making is appropriate when operating in understood environments with clearly defined outcomes. However, this does not describe real world situations people find themselves in for the first and possibly only time, when even experts are unsure how laws will be applied, and when the actions of other parties are untested and uncertain. In these cases, it is nearly impossible to assign to any reasonable degree the probability of a particular outcome, much less identify the potential outcomes themselves. Instead, these situations can best be described as ambiguous, leading researchers to differentiate between Risk Aversion and Ambiguity Aversion. The seminal work of Kahneman and Tversky (1979), known as prospect theory, finds that losses hurt roughly twice as much as gains feel good, and as such, people will take reasonable measures to avoid the loss domain. The extant literature has found that people are generally Ambiguity Averse over gains and small losses, and that this is an important region to examine in a world where financial leverage is limited, and investments represent a small portion of an investor’s overall wealth. But, this poorly describes the environment surrounding a typical mortgage borrower. Even high quality, conforming loans have a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of 80% at origination. And many have an LTV of 0.97, a leverage ratio unheard of in other areas of finance and economics. Add to this that a home is the largest investment a person will typically ever make, and we can quickly understand that borrower behavior can change when homeowners find themselves substantially underwater (i.e., negative equity) due to sharp home price declines as they did during the 2008 Great Financial Crisis (GFC). When borrowers defaulted during the 2008 GFC, the system was ill prepared to handle the crisis, resulting in a level of uncertainty like no other investment. Collectively, the high percentage of a person’s overall wealth tied up in a mortgage, the extreme financial leverage used in mortgages, and the high degree of uncertainty surrounding how defaults would be handled, combine to create a unique laboratory to examine Ambiguity Aversion in the loss domain. Golman and Loewenstein (2018) explain that Ambiguity Aversion is context specific. Chen and Chang (2019) examined the role of Ambiguity Aversion in insurers’ pricing of mortgage insurance; however, no study has applied Ambiguity Aversion to the extremely uncertain environment of borrower decisions surrounding mortgage defaults. We view this as a unique opportunity to understand decision making in an understudied region of the loss domain - extreme losses. We employ a large, non-student sample and assess participants’ willingness to pay (WTP) to successfully resolve either a risky or an ambiguous mortgage default situation in both the gain and loss domains. To measure Ambiguity Aversion, we employ the multiple price listing instrument developed by Gneezy et al. (2015). We are careful to control for financial history and literacy, factors known to be related to the frequency of mortgage defaults (Harrison et al. 2020). We also include personality traits identified in the psychology literature that explain decision making behaviors.Footnote 1 We find that Ambiguity Aversion is negatively related to the amount participants are willing to pay to resolve the mortgage default proceedings and that Risk Aversion is not significantly related to the amount participants are willing to pay in either the gain or loss domains. We also find that participants who are most financially literate and those who have not previously defaulted on a loan tend to have a stronger relation between Ambiguity Aversion and the amount willing to pay to resolve the settlement. The result is consistent with the most Ambiguity Averse engaging in costly efforts to increase literacy, but not the most Risk Averse. The difference highlights the distinction between the measures. Ambiguity inherent in a financial decision is associated with literacy, but the systematic (i.e., nondiversifiable) risk inherent is immutable. With respect to personality traits, extraverts - regardless of their ambiguity and risk preferences - are willing to pay more to ensure positive outcomes in both the gain and loss domains, but only for participants with low financial literacy. Personality had little influence on the decision of the highly financially literate. This finding that feelings about a subject may influence behaviors controlling for ambiguity and risk preferences highlights the need to conduct further research at the intersection of the economics and psychology literature. That financial literacy may reduce the influence of personality on mortgage default settlement decisions underscores the importance of financial education. Additionally, understanding the role ambiguity plays in mortgage default behavior is critically important to help policymakers manage borrower behavior when facing economic challenges like the GFC or the more recent COVID-19 pandemic.",1

Kelley Pace,Raffaella Calabrese,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"Financial distress, such as experienced during the Great Recession and now as a result of the novel coronavirus, requires servicers and lenders to make decisions on new lending (refinancing or new purchases), forbearance, loan extensions, and foreclosure in the presence of a number of state laws and changing regulator guidelines. Most of these decisions require some estimate of collateral value. Financial institutions in the real estate market usually rely on experts, called appraisers, to estimate the value of the collateral. Because appraisers have substantial freedom in creating their estimate (Agarwal et al. 2015), the estimate is ultimately subjective. Automated valuation models (AVMs) provide an alternative approach (Pender 2016; Demiroglu and James 2018). An AVMFootnote 1 is a computer program that can use property characteristics, past house prices, and neighboring comparable sales in a statistical model to value property. The Great Recession raised questions about the accuracy of appraisals and AVMs. Using a large sample of nonagency securitized loans originated between 2002 and 2007, Griffin and Maturana (2016) show that AVMs are more accurate than most appraisers as 44.9% of residential properties show appraisal values that are 5% higher than an AVM. Agarwal et al. (2015) examine the appraisal bias for residential refinance transactions. Particularly, they compute the valuation bias as the difference between the appraisal of the refinance transaction and the consecutive purchase price. On a US national sample of conforming loans, the authors find that the appraisal bias for residential refinance transactions is more than 5%. Ding and Nakamura (2015) compare the appraised value of the property with the agreed contract price between the buyer and the seller to analyse the impact of the Home Valuation Code of Conduct (HVCC) in 2009 on the appraisal practice. They find that appraisal valuations are on average higher than the contract price both before and after the financial crisis, even if the HVCC has led to a decrease of the over-estimate of the property value. For the accuracy of AVMs, Demiroglu and James (2018) provide evidence that AVMs show high pricing errors of between 12% and 15% of the actual sale price for a median quality home. The variability is even higher for properties below median quality. The authors also show that high pricing errors can be the cause of an apparent appraisal bias even when the AVMs are unbiased. Krugery and Maturanaz (2020) analyze appraisals and AVMs on a large sample of US non-agency securitized loans originated between 2001 and 2007. They highlighted that the potential sources of the errors for AVMs and appraisals are different. AVM errors are statistical errors or due to model miscalibration, whereas moral hazard could potentially generate the appraisal errors. The authors obtain empirical evidence of high appraisals relative to AVM valuations over time and across different types of loans. Specifically, appraisals are almost 5% higher (on average) than AVM valuations and appraisals exceed AVM valuations 60% of the time. The main contribution of this paper is to explain why AVMs may yield accurate predictions with highly non-normal errors. Specifically, this manuscript examines the relation between increasing the goodness-of-fit of housing models and the need to model the house price distribution of the disturbances. AVMs mainly rely on house price models that often show highly non-normal errors (Young and Graff 1996; Gu 2002; Pontines 2010; Schindler 2013) and high levels of spatial dependence (Bourassa et al. 2007; Liu 2013; Pace 1997; Osland 2010). Using both Monte Carlo simulations and empirical data, we show that addressing spatial or spatiotemporal dependence could lead to an increased precision of the house price prediction which, in turn, could unmask non-normal disturbances. Consequently, more sophisticated approaches, such as spatial regression models (LeSage and Pace 2009), can lead to non-normal disturbances with a lower magnitude. Leading AVM companies are Zillow, Collateral Analytics and CoreLogic, among others. For example, Griffin and Maturana (2016) analyse data provided by Collateral Analytics. Although all of the providers of AVMs give some statistics on their accuracy, we will use Zillow as a motivational example as Zillow provides the most visible automated valuation model available to the general public with over 100 million price estimates (known as “Z-estimates”) provided on their website at no pecuniary charge. We assume that Zillow has adequately modeled house prices using accurate explanatory variables as well as handling various forms of temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal dependence known to affect house prices (Aquaro et al. 2021; Can and Megbolugbe 1997; Pace 1997).Footnote 2 Therefore, the Z-estimate residuals should convey some information about the underlying distribution of the disturbances. Zillow reports nationally that their models have a median absolute percentage error of 4.5%. Moreover, 89.7% of the Z-estimates exhibit absolute percentage errors of 20% or less. Under the assumption that the percentage errors are symmetric, a Student t distribution would provide a common way of capturing the kurtosis that empirical residuals often display (Pontines 2010). Fitting a Student t distribution to the Zillow reported statistics results in an estimate of 1.37 degrees-of-freedom, which means that the variance and kurtosis are infinite. Compare this to a Cauchy distribution (Student t with 1 degree-of-freedom) which for a median absolute percentage error of 4.5% would have 86% of the absolute residuals within 20% (as opposed to the 89.7% in Zillow). If the true innovations in house price models follow a Cauchy-like distribution, this means that large errors are not particularly rare and this has implications for financial risk management, assessment, and regulation. In the context of finance, such rare events have been labeled “black swans” (Taleb 2010). In this paper we show both theoretically and through Monte Carlo simulations that disturbances in house price models which ignore spatial-temporal dependence can appear more normally distributed. Using US census data from 2000 we obtain a strong linear relationship between the accuracy of a house price model and the tail heaviness (indicated by the level of leptokurtosis) of the residuals. We can sum up that assuming non-normal distribution for the disturbances could provide at least one way to address the issue of “black swans.” In contrast, simple models that ignore spatial or spatiotemporal dependence may lead to “normal” residuals that mask non-normality. In other words, not modeling spatial and spatiotemporal dependence can make “black swans” appear grey. We begin with “The Zillow Example” where we analyze the kurtosis of the residuals in the Z-estimates. “The Kurtosis in Regression Models with Spatial and Temporal Dependence” documents the kurtosis present in the residuals from house price models and how this makes the risk assessment process more difficult. We motivate why residuals from non-spatial models may mask non-normality and provide both theoretical and Monte Carlo evidence to support this statement. In “An Empirical Example” we set forth an example based on housing data, where we show a very strong empirical relation between the house price accuracy and the leptokurtosis of the residuals. We finish in “Conclusion” with a summary of the key findings and discuss the implications of this research for housing models and other areas of application.",1

The existing literature has focused upon the normative implications for housing and mortgage decisions, providing a theoretical basis for discussion, and informing specifications in empirical studies (Duca and Rosenthal 1994; Ioannides and Rosenthal 1994; Leece 2004). Theoretically, households’ excessive valuations and expectations of future price increases result in temporary elevation of house prices (Shiller 2007). This is because overestimation of house value and the expectation of future price increases have a strong impact on demand when households believe any increased value of their home would compensate for investment risks and improve their housing wealth and liquidity position (Case and Shiller 2003; Attanasio et al. 2009). In reality, however, the key question that still needs to be answered is whether the accuracy in subjective dwelling valuations (in addition to changes in fundamentals) has the potential to motivate households’ incentives to maximise housing size and mortgage debt. This paper addresses this question by exploring whether the bias in subjective valuations and level of housing services demanded are jointly determined, being driven by several interrelated factors. This is with the aim to empirically demonstrate the imperfect nature of the housing market, reflected by the inseparability of households’ expectations and housing decisions. Importantly, given the lack of efficiency in the housing market and the downward momentum in prices associated with overvaluation tendencies, the potential for a significant downward trend in house prices following rapid growth requires attention, while also accounting for regional differences in house prices, the varying degrees of restrictions on new housing supply, land use planning regulations, and local socio-economic conditions (Meen 2008; Shiller 2007; Portnov et al. 2016). This is especially relevant in the Israeli case, where regional deviations across socio-economic clusters, and the various degrees of planning constraints, reflect significant differences in incomes, education, the labour force, housing conditions, house prices and housing supply constraints. The important point to consider is that regional deviations arising from subjective valuations and house price expectations might trigger instability in the housing sector, entrenching regionally differentiated responses to recession. To explore this issue, the current paper accounts for regional effects by including regional dummies and regionally differentiated variables in the empirical estimates. The empirical modelling framework comprises two consecutive phases. In Phase 1, a separate hedonic model equation was estimated on the base of sale transaction data (2013) provided by the Israeli Tax Authority (ITA), which, in addition to prices of dwellings sold during a given period, provide an assortment of property characteristics. The model’s estimates were used to calculate the market value of dwellings from the Longitudinal Panel Survey (LPS) incorporating data on properties’ physical characteristics. Then, the ratio between subjective dwelling valuations and estimated market value of the same dwelling (bias in subjective valuation), was calculated. In Phase 2, employing the results of the previous phase and applying the household-level data extracted from the second wave of the LPS files (2013), estimation takes the form of a system of two simultaneous equations. The main novelty of the analysis performed herein is the consideration of the imperfect nature of housing markets based on the explicit investigation of simultaneous relationships between bias in subjective dwelling valuations and housing demand, also accounting for supply side factors and the regional perspective. It is worth noting that the current paper is written at the time when Israel is in national lockdown as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, which is likely to have significant impact on Israeli housing market, in terms of housing demand, households’ expectations and house price dynamics. As in most other countries, the Israeli government has taken contemporary measures aiming to diminish Covid 19’s impact,Footnote 1 also warning of a significant recession to follow in 2020/21 and beyond, with rising unemployment likely to be pronounced. In the context of the current study, an obvious question to ask is whether understanding of that influencing one of the co-joint determinants of housing demand may simultaneously affect other factors, may contribute in mitigating unexpected consequences associated with the challenges of homeownership decisions. The paper is structured as follows. The next section analyses the relevant literature; while the third section describes the research data sample. The fourth section details the econometric methodology applied in the paper. The fifth section discusses estimation issues; and the sixth section presents empirical specification. The seventh section provides the descriptive statistics, while the penultimate section presents the findings and interpretation of the results. The final section forms the conclusion.",3

Anderson,David M. Harrison,Michael J. Seiler,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In the first quarter of 2020, the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) spread from Asia throughout most of the world and unleashed its devastating impact on the United States in terms of both human casualties and economic consequences. To combat the spread of COVID-19, individual states adopted various levels of social distancing mechanisms, ranging from “shelter-in-place,” to “stay-at-home,” to full “lockdown” in the hopes of “flattening the curve.” While millions of employees were forced into a variety of remote working arrangements, for many industries working from home was simply not an option. As a result, the economy experienced mass layoffs, furloughs, and assorted other job, wage, and hour reductions. Unemployment filings rose dramatically, stock market volatility increased, equity values plummeted into bear market territory, and it soon became apparent something had to be done quickly to stave off further economic catastrophe. In response, on March 27, 2020, an overwhelming bipartisan consensus in Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act amid growing concerns the spread of COVID-19 would keep businesses closed and the populace unemployed for an extended period. To prevent the economy from further deteriorating, the CARES Act authorized the direct injection of over $2 trillion into the economy. The Federal Reserve System (FED) subsequently provided additional support to financial markets through a variety of policy initiatives including asset purchases, credit facilities, and liquidity SWAPs. These combined stabilization activities increased the size of the FED balance sheet by over $3 trillion between the end of February and middle of June 2020.Footnote 1 Despite this well intentioned, openly transparent, and massive intervention, conventional wisdom maintained that many borrowers would not be able to make their required mortgage payments. To address this concern, the CARES Act made specific provisions to allow for all residential mortgages owned by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Veteran’s Administration (VA), and the Federal Housing Authority (FHA) to go into forbearance with significantly reduced (or entirely eliminated) negative consequences for both borrowers and lenders. As of early 2020, the U.S. residential mortgage market consisted of approximately 50 million loans with a total outstanding mortgage balance of roughly $11 trillion (Hebron, 2020). CARES Act covered mortgages represent approximately 62% of that total. The average mortgage payment (principal, interest, taxes, and insurance) across these loans was roughly $1250 per month. Because servicers of these loans lack the labor force to receive, process, and evaluate the financial need of millions of forbearance applicants, the Act calls for borrowers to follow the “Honor Code” and only ask for mortgage forbearance if their income was adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. To alleviate borrower hesitancy to participate, “no fees, penalties, or interest beyond the amounts scheduled or calculated as if the borrower made all contractual payments on time and in full under the terms of the mortgage contract, shall accrue on the borrower’s account” (The CARES Act: P.L. 116-136 §4022) during an initial forbearance period of up to 6 months, which may be extended another 6 months. To engage in this mortgage forbearance program, all a borrower must do is stop paying their mortgage and notify their servicer. Lenders must (1) apply no penalties, late fees, or interest to the forborne payments,Footnote 2 (2) halt all evictions and foreclosure sales of borrowers, and (3) suspend reporting to credit bureaus of delinquency related to forbearance.Footnote 3 From a policy perspective, one major concern with this opportunity is that with such a low borrower cost, the game theoretic optimal solution is for nearly every borrower, including those who are not experiencing a COVID-19 related financial hardship, to self-select into the program, thus resulting in a moral hazard problem. One mechanism to help combat this potential free rider problem is to require forbearing borrowers to sign a 1-page document stating they are “experiencing a COVID-19 related decline in income.” After the pandemic is over, the servicer/lender may then perform a post-mortem review of all mortgage forbearance cases, and if the borrower is found to have participated without experiencing a COVID-19 related decline in income, stiff penalties could be enforced.Footnote 4 To assess the potential efficacy of such an approach, we conducted an experiment into whether a single page attestation to financial hardship with recourse would curb participation in the CARES Act forbearance program by those who do not need payment assistance. Our results document a statistically significant reduction in the forbearance program take-up rate conditional on such a required binding attestation. Alternatively stated, when borrowers know their feet will be held to the fire through a simple acknowledgement that free riding will not be tolerated and economic consequences will be imposed, we find a statistically significant reduction in people inappropriately receiving benefits from the CARES Act. Moreover, it is instructive from a policy perspective to understand where this “extra” money gets allocated by those who misuse the program. If all such money is used in a manner consistent with what the government wants out of all the assistance programs, perhaps the misuse is not of great concern. If the uses were inconsistent with the overall policy design, it would suggest the programs are less effective than desired. While it is beyond the scope of our study to discern whether certain types of spending or investing are consistent with the Act, the results remain instructive to policymakers and academics as future programs are conceived and administered. Thus, we further explore questions such as whether some borrowers might choose to invest these funds into a potentially undervalued, yet highly volatile stock market in the hopes of making up for losses in other areas of their balance sheet. If such a gamble proves effective, the borrower reaps all the benefits and pockets any gains. On the other hand, if the market declines and the gamble does not pay off, the borrower simply defaults and walks away from (or modifies) the mortgage they can no longer afford, and the costs of the resulting bailout to lenders and/or taxpayers could potentially be many times greater. Here, the evidence reveals many borrowers would be willing to use their forgone mortgage payments to invest in the stock market (7.48%). Some indicated they would select low risk investments like TIPS/CDs (5.24%), while others reported they would use the money to pay down various consumer debts including student loans (3.80%), auto loans (4.00%), and credit cards (8.77%), which is analogous to using the CARES Act as a government sponsored debt consolidation program.Footnote 5 Interestingly, the largest shares of the forgone mortgage payments would purportedly be spent on “needs” like food and clothing (31.31%) or be stockpiled in cash (21.15%). While these are not the specifically designated uses of the bailout funds, they do represent allocations which strengthen the safety net of distressed borrowers, and in particular, the cash holdings may well act as precautionary savings and provide an important buffer against short-term income disruptions, while likely remaining readily available and accessible for when the forbearance period ends and all the monies must be repaid – or the loan modified.Footnote 6 Finally, we also demonstrate that a simple 1-page attestation can significantly reduce free-riders from using the program, while leaving it to policymakers to decide if these outcomes are consistent with overall policy goals.",3

Li,Helen X. H. Bao,K. W. Chau,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"The residential property market is characterized by cyclicality and long development lead-time. Hence, ascertaining the optimal time to sell properties is challenging for developers due to such an immense level of uncertainty. One method to mitigate the risk is to delay the listing of properties, such that the opportunity cost caused by underpricing could be reduced. This “option to wait” can be exercised by holding the completed stocks off the market (Wang et al., 2016).Footnote 1 Alternatively, developers can also sell properties in the early stages of the development to reduce the opportunity cost caused by the long investment lead-time (Bar-Ilan & Strange, 1996; Tse, 1998). When presale (i.e., selling before completion) is allowed, selling considerably early could even provide financial benefits to the developers with deposits from the agreed buyers and meanwhile share the price uncertainty risk with buyers. However, once the listed prices are fixed, future price adjustments to market changes are likely to be insufficient because of tacit collusion and the anchor effect (e.g., Bucchianeri & Minson, 2013; Leung & Tsang, 2013; Wu et al., 2014). Moreover, the cost of “underpricing” may offset the benefits of recovering early expenses. The existing literature analyzes the two tools (i.e., waiting or presale) in isolation and the method of identifying their net effects remains unclear. Accordingly, we investigate the role of both strategies in one unified framework. Our analysis is based on a well-established line of literature on real option analysis. Such analysis has been applied extensively to model sale decisions by individual sellers in the secondary property market (e.g., Cauley & Pavlov, 2002; Qian, 2013), and investment decisions by real estate developers (e.g., Bulan et al., 2009; Capozza & Sick, 1991; Cunningham, 2006; McDonald & Siegel, 1986; Schwartz & Torous, 2007; Titman, 1985; Williams, 1993). We focus on price uncertainty because it crucially affects future demand and ultimately determines the success of a project (Holland et al., 2000). In general, high price uncertainty signals considerable risk and subsequently influences developers to delay the listing in an effort to capture the option values attached to future higher prices (Grovenstein et al., 2011). Nevertheless, if developers could share the price uncertainty risk with buyers through presale contracts, then they may not delay the listing (Lai et al., 2004). Given buyers’ option to default on a presale contract, developer’s presale strategy can be treated as a real option, which becomes valuable when the underlying market is uncertain. Lai et al. (2004) provided a theoretical framework to support the risk-hedging function of presale and Li and Chau (2018) provided the empirical evidence. We extend their analyses to investigate how real estate developers choose between the two tools to mitigate the risk of price uncertainty. We test our hypotheses using data from Hong Kong for two reasons. First, the unique presale scheme of the Hong Kong property market offers great flexibility for investigating our research question. Presale allows developers to start sales well before the project is completed. This strategy is prevalent in Asia in general and in Hong Kong in particular. The Hong Kong property market is volatile and has relatively restricted financing options for real estate developers. With presales, Hong Kong developers can finance through prepayment gathered from buyers at early development stages and lock-in buyers to mitigate the price uncertainty risk. Meanwhile, buyers of presale units can also gain housing price security or default on the presale contract if the Hong Kong property price dropped considerably when the property is completed. This unique market setting provides us with the opportunity to investigate how developers choose between waiting and preselling. Second, the Hong Kong property market is characterized with short, but unstable cycles. Our sampling period is between 1995 and 2015, thereby covering a full market cycle (see Fig. 1). During this time, the Hong Kong government adjusted its policies on presale schemes in order to regulate the market. This situation provides us with a natural experiment field to study the impact of government regulations on the effectiveness of presales as a hedging tool and thus developers’ listing strategies. In addition, our findings will bridge a gap in the literature because previous studies rarely have the opportunity to cover a full cycle in their sampling periods. Price index in Hong Kong property market (1984–2016). Source: Raw data from Rating and Valuation Department of HKSAR Our dataset includes over 500 residential development projects completed between 1995 and 2015. This dataset contains comprehensive information of market conditions, the characteristics of developers, and property attributes. This material enables us to effectively and reliably test our hypotheses. We estimate a fully parametric hazard model to identify the determinants of the listing for sales and consider the endogeneity of the presale choices. The results show that the presale option substantially impacts the developer’s sale decision. In particular, developers show considerable inclination to delay the listing in uncertain market conditions when the presale option is unavailable. This outcome confirms the role of the “waiting tool” as verified by Qian (2013). Conversely, if the option to presell is available, then developers are less likely to implement the “waiting tool” but seek to accelerate the sales when the underlying market is uncertain. The reason for this circumstance is that the value of the presale option increases with the volatility of the underlying asset prices, which subsequently reduces the necessity to implement the “waiting tool”. Moreover, consistent with the studies by Wang and Zou (2006) and Yao and Pretorius (2014), the flexibility of presale schemes is a strong moderator of the aforementioned presale effect. Developers facing limited presale schemes are less likely to presell when the expected future price volatility increases because the “preselling tool” is less effective in hedging the price risk. Our results highlight the importance of considering alternative tools (i.e., presale) to deal with demand uncertainty and the role of government regulations in this line of research. Overall, the study follows the idea of Maniadis et al. (2014) to replicate the previous findings utilizing new empirical evidence. Given the size of the market and the proportion of real estate development in local economy, empirical evidence from Hong Kong provides important insights understanding the real estate developers’ supply strategy. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief overview of the property development and presale schemes in Hong Kong. Second 3 introduces the analytical framework and testable hypotheses. Section 4 describes our empirical methods and data to test the predictions. Section 5 discusses the empirical results. The last section concludes.",1

In the first, “Past Experiences and Investment Decisions: Evidence from Real Estate Markets,” Brent Ambrose and Lily Shen examine the price dynamics of homes located near fracking wells in Pennsylvania. Because the shale boom began relatively recently, researchers can assume that information regarding a homeowner’s risk of exposure to negative fracking externalities is imperfect. Motivated by a Bayesian learning framework, they test if familiarity with risks from conventional gas drilling impacts the perception of risks associated with proximity to fracking activities: i.e., does past experience alter the value of new information. They report that houses in fracking areas with existing conventional wells sell for less than similar homes in fracking areas that lack prior drilling activity. This, the authors indicate, “suggests that despite the public fear of fracking-related environmental risks, house price dynamics reflect realized fracking risks instead of perceived threats.” They also show that while fracking accidents lower house prices, the effect disappears within two to three months if no additional accidents occur, suggesting that buyers rely heavily on recent information while discounting historical data. In the second paper, “The Impact of Distant Hurricane on Local Housing Markets,” Lu Fang, Lingxiao Li, and Abdullah Yavas consider whether property prices in Florida are affected by Hurricane Sandy, which made landfall in New Jersey in 2012. Hurricane Sandy embodied public concerns that the effects of global climate change were exposing new areas to flood risk and increasing property risk in existing flood-prone areas. The authors examine if the arrival of this information affects market perceptions of the latter hazard by raising awareness and concerns about possible similar events in a distant, unimpacted area considered vulnerable to hurricanes. Using data from 2004 to 2014 from Miami-Dade County, they report that this major hurricane event at a distance raises home buyers’ perceptions of flood risk, relative to base expectations, but only for a short period (i.e., one-quarter). That they find no persistent effect of Sandy for the US metro area already most at risk of experiencing a hurricane impact still leaves open the possibility that property owners in other areas, especially along the northeastern seaboard, may have updated their risk perceptions based on Sandy.",

This decentralized market is characterized by complex assets trading infrequently with high transaction costs. Because the market is thin for units in any particular feature space, researchers can reasonably assume that trading occurs in an environment of imperfect information. And within this setting, one party to the transaction commonly has superior information. Consider these close parallels between real estate trading and parables drawn from classic articles. Similar to the market for used cars in Akerlof (1970), homeowners know more about their properties than prospective buyers. Landlords, like firms hiring workers in Spence (1973) and Stiglitz (1975), do not know the traits of potential tenants. And certain groups of participants in real estate markets, such as locals and real estate agents, hold information advantages in a manner analogous to the grain traders with insider information in Milgrom and Stokey (1982). This paper reviews research on information frictions as part of the Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics special issue on real estate market efficiency. (We use the term “frictions” as a catchall to describe information that is imperfect, costly, or asymmetric, and also strategies that market participants pursue to profit on, or even out, asymmetries in information.) The content is organized into three parts that span the real estate marketplace: “Part 1: Private Markets,” “Part 2: Public Markets,” and “Part 3: Brokerage Markets.” Although we focus on empirical research, each part begins with a description of sources in economic theory for the testing we cover. Beyond giving context to the articles in the special issue, the purpose of this review is to provide a resource for researchers that compares recent results with influential earlier findings and suggests areas where more work is needed. The real estate market has been the subject of sustained research effort on information frictions for over thirty years. Due to the scope of the literature, especially in recent years, our coverage is extensive by nature and selective by necessity. Although the reference list of about 400 works includes over 70 from just 2019 and later, the treatment of a particular topic may still highlight only a representative subset of papers. And we do not cover several information topics that are important and interesting enough to merit entire reviews of their own. Noteworthy omissions include time-series tests for the information content of past prices, housing search, property market cycles, real estate development and debt markets, and behavioral real estate.Footnote 1 The policy implications of the research in this review are profound. The literature shows that real property never trades with full information and “even small information costs can have large consequences,” in the words of Stiglitz (2000, p. 1443). Real estate is the largest asset class in the world (Savills World Research, 2017). By examining the effects of information frictions on real estate transactions, researchers have improved our understanding of potential market failures and corrections that can improve the functioning of this important market.",1

Clapp,Jeffrey P. Cohen,Thies Lindenthal,Male,Male,Male,Male,"This paper proposes new methods for valuing urban land which we define as land in urban areas where substantial usable structures are present on the land. We use the terms “land” and “urban land” to refer to land under a substantial usable structure. We use the term “vacant land” for urban land with small structures, parking lots, raw land without improvements or land in some stage of preparation for construction. We always use the “vacant” qualifier if we refer to this less common type of urban land. The value of urban land as separated from the value of structures is highly relevant to the dynamics and volatility of commercial and residential real estate. This was highlighted recently by Knoll et al. (2017): “We show that real house prices stayed constant from the nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century, but rose strongly and with substantial cross-country variation in the second half of the twentieth century. Land prices, not replacement costs, are the key to understanding the trajectory of house prices. Rising land prices explain about 80 percent of the global house price boom that has taken place since World War II. Our findings have implications for the evolution of wealth-to-income ratios, the growth effects of agglomeration, and the price elasticity of housing supply.” Knoll et al. (2017) use an influential land valuation method, the land residual model which assumes that land value and structure value are additively separable (i.e., each component of total value may evolve independently of the other) and that structure value can be estimated from the cost to rebuild the structure less depreciation due to aging.Footnote 1 We think that it is implausible that the value of urban land can evolve independently of the value of structures because urban land value depends on accessibility to nearby land uses, implying that infrastructure and the slowly changing built environment are the most important components of land value. Think of a (future) urban area composed of raw land which has no roads, utilities or structure. The value of this raw land will be very low; it might plausibly be traded for a few trinkets and some cloth.Footnote 2 After substantial capital investment in infrastructure and surrounding structures the same parcel of vacant land will have value based on the potential for a structure that is well suited to surrounding structures and land uses. In the event that the parcel already has a structure – likely since urban land is typically densely developed – then its value will be based on the existing structure and on its potential for substantial renovation or redevelopment to better match the surrounding built environment. These considerations mitigate a framework designed to separate the dynamics of land and structure.Footnote 3 The residual land value method developed by real estate appraisers was popularized in the academic literature by Davis and Palumbo (2008). The land residual method has been applied and developed by an extensive literature discussed below and recently extended to geographies as small as zip codes by Davis et al. (2019). The literature includes contributions by Diewert et al. (2011) and by Landefeld and Hines (1985) who discuss the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) treatment of land value. The land leverage hypothesis which holds that the risk inherent in real estate is an increasing function of the ratio of land value to total value (hereafter, “land value ratio” or “land share”) uses land residual methods: see Bostic et al. (2007) and Bourassa et al. (2011). While academics have used the land residual approach for all properties, practitioners are typically quick to note that the cost approach is either not calculated at all or just not relied on for properties past a given age. In the real-world, adjustments are often needed to reconcile costs, sales comparisons, and income valuation approaches, all of which may lead to disparate estimates of property and land valuations. We develop a framework for better land valuation practices. Our alternative land valuation methods are based on irreversibility and option value theory. The theory says that, once a structure is built, the structure and land become a bundled good for an extended period of time. For a typical real estate market where values are stable or changing by modest amounts, we show that the land value ratio estimated with option value theory changes much more slowly than the one estimated by the land residual theory. In a rising (falling) market the land residual method predicts that land value ratio will rise (fall) whereas option value methods predict no change except for the depreciation and obsolescence of structures in a rising market and the depreciation of structures in a falling market. We provide a simple model with numerical examples of these differences in a rising market. In addition to modelling the disparate valuations of the land residual and option value theories, we empirically compare the two models using a new database provided by the Maricopa county, Arizona tax assessor to a group of researchers working with the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy. The data provide rich source of information on vacant land sales (2000–2018) and single family residential (SFR) sales (2007–2018) along with many characteristics of these sales and of all properties in Maricopa County. Figure 1 motivates our study with Maricopa county data for quarterly SFR sales since 1995. The home price index, land price index (the “Lincoln land price index”) and land share are obtained from the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy website and Davis and Palumbo (2008). Land residual methods were used to produce Lincoln land indices and shares. For the purposes of this paper, we are most interested in the close association between the home price index and the land share index. This follows from the assumptions of the land residual model, which we illustrate by adding an annual construction cost index for Maricopa County. In the land residual method, structure value for any existing structure increases at the rate of construction costs less depreciation and obsolescence. In Maricopa County, construction costs have increased roughly linearly. Almost all of the differences between changes in house value and construction costs are allocated to land by the land residual method, and this is reflected in Fig. 1.
 Home Price, Land Price, and Construction Cost Indexes (Left Axis), and Land Share (Right Axis) Figure 2 plots the Lincoln land price index (annualized) since 2000 in order to compare to an index we produced based on Maricopa County vacant land sales and Phoenix house prices estimated by the FHFA. All three indices use SFR sales data or sales of land zoned SFR. In general, we observe the expected positive correlation between house prices and the two land price indices. In the case of the Lincoln index this follows from the assumption that most of the variation in house prices is transferred to land value. In the case of the vacant land index this follows from the fact that urban land has little value except for its potential to be developed with a structure, i.e., vacant land value derives from the value of the structure. Option value theory applied to vacant land says that the option value component of vacant land is leveraged by the relatively constant cost to build, implying that the timing of land value changes will follow those of SFR values, but that land will have higher volatility. This is what we observe in Fig. 2, strengthening our belief that option value theory is relevant to urban land valuation.Footnote 4 House Price and Land Price Indexes Notes: We calculated the Vacant Land Price Index for Market 5. The Lincoln Home and Land Price Indices were distributed by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy (ending in 2016) using AVM and land residual methods developed by Davis and Palumbo (2008). The FHFA House Price Index is available by MSA for most of the US. The Phoenix Construction Cost Index is calculated by the authors from Marshal Valuation Service Manuals The FHFA index is for the Phoenix-Mesa-Chandler Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). Similarly, the Lincoln Land Price Index is also at the MSA level. Maricopa County, which had a population of 4.5 million in 2010, is a subset of the Phoenix MSA. The other major county in the Phoenix MSA is Pinal County, which had a population of 376,000 in 2010, and most of the area in Pinal is very rural. Therefore, Maricopa County is a reasonably close approximation to Phoenix. In Fig. 2, the Lincoln price index is relatively volatile and peaks early compared to vacant land transactions The Lincoln land price index is more volatile than the vacant land price index with a difference between trough and peak of about 3.0 versus about 2.5 for the vacant price index. The timing of the Lincoln index is not as well matched with the SFR index. These observations cast some doubt on land residual estimates and on associated land leverage risk evaluation, motivating research on alternative estimates based on option theory. In our empirical analysis, we focus on data from Maricopa county, AZ during a time period of appreciation (2012–2018) to estimate land values with both the land residual and option value approaches. We find that the marginal structure value per square foot is undervalued by land residual estimates. These marginal effects support predictions from option value theory, as represented by our simple theoretical model of option value in a rising market. We also directly demonstrate the strength of the option value approach by revealing empirically that land shares for high option value neighborhoods, where vacant land sales are more relevant, increased by about 11% over six years compared to nearly 24% under land residual assumptions. These findings are consistent with the evolution of vacant land prices that we observe in Fig. 2. Option value also requires that the neighborhoods classified as existing with deep out of the money options – neighborhoods typical of a large share of urban real estate – demonstrate low growth in the land ratio (about 2% over six years) due to depreciation only. The rest of this paper is focused on comparing the land residual method with methods based on irreversibility, the main assumption of option value theory as applied to estimating urban land values. The next section surveys literature, followed by our theory and methods for land valuation. We then describe the data, followed by our empirical results which we compare with FHFA estimates using a land residual method, but with a very different source for depreciated cost to replace the structure. Finally, we offer some concluding remarks.",5

Goodman,Brent C Smith,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Since the 1990s numerous studies have focused on the determinants of office rental rates (see, for example, Clapp, 1980, Glascock et al., 1990, Sivitanidou, 1995 and Bollinger et al., 1998). In many instances the research examines the influence of location amenities in determining rent differentials. Much of the work implicitly treats all office rental spaces as similar, and there has been little work in segmenting the office market according to tenant type. We refer specifically to the factors that influence rental rates for medical-specific office space, typically referred to as the medical office building (MOB). These properties have special design and location features (discussed below) that differentiate them from more homogeneous office space. There is a paucity of research on MOBs due largely to the lack of available and accessible data (Wei, 2012 and Goodman & Smith, 2020 represent the few academic works).Footnote 1 Further, there has been little observed distinction in the literature on the tenants and space requirements for the MOB asset; thus, there has been little incentive to segment MOB from the larger office market. The MOB is not an insignificant segment of the overall office market. Since 2015 MOBs have attracted on average over $11 billion dollars per year in investment with peak transaction volume in 2017 at $14.5 billion (Revista, 2020). As healthcare delivery evolves, outpatient service space is expected to continue to grow. Since 2005 outpatient centers have grown over 66% to nearly 70,000 units (CBRE, 2018). The US demand for medical office space will continue to increase because during the next ten years, the 65-plus age cohort will grow by 17 million individuals (O’Hara & Caswell, 2013), accounting for over 20% of the population by 2030. While the non-elderly populace will grow at a more modest pace during the same period, ACA-induced Medicaid expansion, and the mandated utilization of insurance exchanges is expected to increase health care coverage by an additional 27 million people. The office market over the past 20 years has seen extremely low cap rates through 2005–06 when credit and liquidity were extensive, the inverse in 2008–10 with the recession and evaporation of credit, and a moderate period since then with a stabilizing economy and relatively “cheap” money.Footnote 2 Because liquidity and credit availability are global factors, this cyclical trend has been national in scope rather than locally focused. With this growth comes an increased interest in performance measures for subsets of the office market, more specifically the medical office building market. Additionally, there has been increasing interest in subsets of the office market as institutional investors attempt to offset the volatility of office investments on an operating basis (i.e. sharp declines in net operating income during recessions) leading them to alternatives such as MOBs that may exhibit more stability in the income profile. Similarly, the literature on health service quality is expansive. However, few studies have observed links between service quality and profitability of hospitals or their affiliates. Adelino and Lewellen (2019) examines the relationship between financial constraints and health service quality standards. Their analysis tests whether hospitals shift towards more intensive and more profitable treatment options as a result of a financial shock, such as the financial crisis. They conclude that for the sample of nonprofit hospitals they observed, the organizational form combined with the hospitals’ internal governance structures shield patients from undesirable shifts in quality in response to financial shocks. In the following analysis we seek to measure spillover effects from hospital service quality ratings. Such location amenities are a common theme in real estate and urban economics research, yet no such test has been done on hospital reputation and the demand by providers for proximate office space. Relying on secondary data from the CoStar Group (CoStar) and public sources in developing the models, our results indicate that although the real estate capital markets are international in scope, the local space market still prevails in the pricing of real property assets. As anticipated, base rents decrease as the distance from a hospital increases and, measures of quality are capitalized into the willingness to pay of tenants. Tenants appear to pay premiums for locations near hospitals with higher quality ratings. We hypothesize that hospitals with strong reputations for high-quality service (provided in part by high-quality affiliated physicians) will represent an opportunity for physicians (broadly referred to as providers) to benefit in the form of a reputation spillover, thereby increasing potential revenue.Footnote 3 Further, this increase in potential revenue is capitalized into the practices’ willingness to pay for proximate office locations, thereby driving the rental rates for nearby space. In the remainder of this article we provide support for segmenting medical office markets from the more general professional office sphere, and we briefly review the literature on office rent determinants. We then provide a conceptual model that the provider (potential tenant) faces when considering space in a metropolitan area. Description of the data and the analysis follow along with the results obtained from the models. The conclusion summarizes the outcomes and the implications from the analysis.",
