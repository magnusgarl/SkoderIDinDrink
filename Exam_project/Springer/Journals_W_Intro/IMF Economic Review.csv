There is a consensus that causality in this relationship may run from events in oil markets to monetary policy as well as from shifts in monetary policy to the supply of oil and the demand for oil in global markets. Barsky and Kilian (2002), for example, discuss in the context of the experience of the 1970s and early 1980s how an exogenous shift in the global monetary policy regime may cause a shift in the demand for crude oil and hence in the real price of crude oil. Kilian (2010) and Erceg, Guerrieri, and Kamin (2011) explain why this explanation does not fit the more recent data, and indeed much of the literature since the 1990s has focused on the reverse direction of causality from oil prices to monetary policy. Notably, Bernanke, Gertler, and Watson (1997) in an influential empirical paper attributed the severity of the 1974 and 1982 recessions to the Federal Reserve's direct response to the preceding oil price shocks. Recent research has cast doubt on their empirical analysis and on the theoretical premise of their analysis (see, for example, Kilian and Lewis (2011) and the references therein). There is no compelling evidence that the Federal Reserve was responding mechanically to oil price shocks beyond the response to the inflation and real output fluctuations associated with such shocks. 
Bernanke, Gertler, and Watson's (1997) empirical work has stimulated a large DSGE model literature on the normative question of how monetary policymakers should respond to oil price shocks. Much of this optimal monetary policy literature has focused on models in which the policymaker follows a conventional interest rate policy rule within a closed economy (see, for example, Leduc and Sill, 2004; Carlstrom and Fuerst, 2006). One of the key questions in this literature has been what inflation measure the central bank should focus on. Another key question has been the existence, or not, of a trade-off between stabilizing inflation and the welfare relevant output gap. For example, Bodenstein, Erceg, and Guerrieri (2008) and Natal (2012) largely agree that dual mandate instrument rules based on core inflation measures come close to replicating welfare maximizing policies, as long as they are not overly aggressive in stabilizing core inflation. In related research, Plante (2009a) finds that optimal monetary policy should stabilize a weighted average of core and nominal wage inflation. Winkler (2009) considers anticipated and unanticipated (deterministic) oil price shocks and also finds that optimal policy cannot stabilize at the same time prices, wages, and the welfare-relevant output gap; indeed, following an oil price shock, optimal policy requires a larger output drop than under a traditional Taylor rule.",117

Time is discrete and denoted by t=0, 1, 2,…,∞. Two final goods can be internationally traded, one of them produced at home and the other produced in the rest of the world. The home economy faces a downward-sloping demand for the final good it produces but is unable to affect any other international price. International trade takes place in two commodities that are used in the production of intermediate goods. Home is inhabited by households, the government, competitive firms that produce the final good, competitive firms that produce one of the tradable commodities, and a continuum of firms that produce differentiated intermediate goods. A representative household has preferences over contingent sequences of two final consumption goods, C

h and C

f, and labor N

f) is a function homogeneous of degree one and increasing in each argument, and U(C, N) is increasing in the first argument, decreasing in the second, and concave. Financial markets are complete. We let Bt,t+1 and Bt,t+1* denote one-period discount bonds denominated in domestic and foreign currency, respectively. These are bonds issued at period t that pay one unit of the corresponding currency at period t+1 on a particular state of the world and zero otherwise. The household's budget constraint is given by where S
t
 is the nominal exchange rate between domestic and foreign currency, W
t
 is the nominal wage rate, τ
t
n is a labor income tax, τ
t
* is a tax on the return of foreign-denominated bonds (a tax on capital flows), and Qt,t+1 is the domestic currency price of the one-period contingent domestic bond normalized by the probability of the state of the economy in period t+1 conditional on the state in period t. Likewise, Qt,t+1* is the normalized foreign currency price of the foreign bond.Footnote 13 In this constraint, we assume that dividends are fully taxed and that consumption taxes are zero (we explain these choices below). Using the budget constraint at periods t and t+1 and rearranging gives the no-arbitrage condition between domestic and foreign bonds: Working with the present value budget constraint is convenient. To that end, for any k>0, we let Qt,t+k=Qt,t+1Qt+1,t+2…Qt+k−1,t+k be the price of one unit of domestic currency at a particular history of shocks in period t+k in terms of domestic currency in period t; an analogous definition holds for Qt,t+k*. Iterating forward on Equation (2) and imposing the no-Ponzi condition gives where we have assumed that initial financial wealth is zero, or  The household maximizes Equation (1) subject to Equation (4). The optimality conditions are given by The government sets monetary and fiscal policy and raises taxes to pay for exogenous consumption of the home final good, G

 or the nominal exchange rate S

f, respectively; taxes on returns of foreign assets τ

d. The two sources of pure rents in the model are the dividends of intermediate good firms and the profits of commodity producers—equivalently, one can think of the latter as a tax on the rents associated with a fixed factor of production. Throughout the paper, we assume that all rents are fully taxed so that τ
t
d=1 for all t. The reason for this assumption is that if pure rents are not fully taxed, the Ramsey government will use other instruments to partially tax those rents. We deliberately abstract from those effects in the optimal policy problem. Note, in addition, that there are no consumption taxes. This assumption is without loss of generality because, in the current setting, consumption taxes are a redundant instrument: anything that can be done with consumption taxes can also be done with appropriately chosen labor taxes and taxes on capital flows. Perfectly competitive firms produce the domestic final good Y
t
h by combining a continuum of nontradable intermediate goods indexed by i∈(0, 1) using the technology where θ>1 is the elasticity of substitution between each pair of intermediate goods. Taking as given the final good price, P
t
h, and the prices of each individual variety of intermediate goods, P
it
h for i∈(0, 1), the firm's problem implies the cost minimization condition for all i∈(0, 1). Integrating this condition over all varieties and using the production function gives a price index relating the final good price and the prices of the individual varieties, Two tradable commodities, denoted by x and z, are used as inputs in the production of intermediate goods. The home economy, however, is able to produce only the commodity x; the commodity z must be imported. We denote by P
t
x and P
t
z the local currency prices of the commodities. Total output of commodity x, denoted as X
t
, is produced according to the technology where n
t
x is labor, A
t
 is the level of productivity, and 0< ρ≤1. Implicit in this technology is the assumption of a fixed factor of production (when ρ<1), which we broadly interpret as land. Profit maximization then requires Because the two commodities can be freely traded, the law of one price holds: where P
t
x* and P
t
z* denote the foreign currency prices of the x and z commodities.Footnote 15 Each intermediate good i∈(0, 1) is produced by a monopolistic competitive firm which uses labor and the two tradable commodities with the technology where x

MC

*, where MC
t
*, the marginal cost measured in foreign currency, is given by That is, the marginal cost in foreign currency depends on the international commodity prices, on technological factors, and on the equilibrium allocation of labor in the commodities sector. In addition, cost minimization implies that final intermediate good firms choose the same ratio of inputs, where we have used Equation (11) in the second equation. Introducing Equation (14) into the production function gives Each monopolist i∈(0, 1) faces the downward-sloping demand curve represented by equation (8). We follow the standard tradition in the NK literature and impose Calvo price rigidity. Namely, in each period, intermediate good firms are able to reoptimize nominal prices with a constant probability 0<α<1. Those that get the chance to set a new price will set it according to where The price level in Equation (9) can be written as A monetary policy that successfully stabilizes the domestic price of the final good must stabilize the marginal cost. Indeed, note that if then But so stabilizing marginal costs implies that Thus, the volatility of the nominal exchange rate depends on the volatility of the exogenous shocks (P
t
x*, P
t
z*, A
t
, Z
t
) and on the allocation of labor in the commodity sector. Furthermore, if η3=0 or if ρ=1, the previous equation shows that the correlation between S
t
 and P
t
x* will be negative, as in Table 2. Moreover, in all of the numerical exercises that we have performed, the endogenous movements of n
t
x when η3>0 and ρ<1 never change the negative correlation between S
t
 and P
t
x*. Therefore, a small open economy that follows inflation targeting will experience fluctuations on the exchange rate that depend on movements in commodity prices and productivity shocks, as well as on the properties of the input-output matrix (the parameters ρ, η1, η2,η3). We assume an isoelastic foreign demand for the home final good of the form where γ>1, P
t
h* is the foreign currency price of the home final good, and K
t
* is a stochastic process that transforms units of foreign currency into domestic consumption goods.Footnote 17 The government imposes a tax (1+τ
t
h) on final goods exported to the rest of the world and a tariff (1+τ
t
f) on final good imports. The law of one price on domestic and foreign final goods then requires where P
t
f* is the foreign currency price of the foreign final good. Net exports measured in foreign currency are given by Thus, the net foreign assets of the country, denoted by Bt,t+1*, evolve according to Solving this equation from period 0 forward, and assuming zero initial foreign assets, gives the economy foreign sector feasibility constraint measured in foreign currency at time 0: In addition, market clearing in domestic final goods requires and labor market feasibility is given by",11

Our interest is in studying the macroeconomic effects of a resource-revenue-financed public investment scaling-up in low-income or lower-middle income countries. We examine later alternatives involving greater reliance on tax finance, and explain why in practice the scope for nonresource tax increases to finance public investment is generally limited. Also, we abstract from debt-financed scaling-ups. Most governments in low-income and lower-middle-income countries have limited access to external commercial funds, particularly before the discovery of natural resource reserves.Footnote 8 Moreover, reflecting financial development conditions in these economies, the model is assumed to have a closed private capital account, as a first approximation.Footnote 9 A representative household chooses consumption c

61.0,2.0,IMF Economic Review,26 June 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/imfer.2013.12,Systemic Banking Crises Database,June 2013,Luc Laeven,Fabián Valencia,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Dating the start of banking crises is a complex matter because they vary in how they develop. Some crises evolve gradually, gaining speed as the ripple effects from a seemingly small shock propagate forward in time and throughout the economy until the effects reach systemic proportions (as was the case in the recent crisis in the United States). Other episodes happen more abruptly and are often the result of a sudden stop (as was the case in Mexico after the 1994 devaluation of the domestic currency). Outcomes associated with such banking crises may differ substantially as well. Some crises are characterized by the collapse of an important fraction of the banking system (as was the case in Indonesia in the late 1990s), while in other crises, regulatory forbearance and government support keeps most banks alive without leading to significant bank closures (as was the case in Argentina in 2001). Moreover, some banking crises are associated with a collapse in aggregate demand while others can be linked to poor lending decisions and management failures at the bank level. Identifying crises based on the evolution of credit and bank liabilities is fraught with difficulties as well. The stock of credit may decline with a delay and may decline more slowly than GDP. This may be the case if currency depreciation at the onset of the crisis increases the domestic currency value of foreign-currency-denominated outstanding loans, as in many emerging market crises, or because loans are rolled over and held at book values in banks’ balance sheets for several years before they are written off (as was the case with the “zombie” banks during the 1990s crisis in Japan). The evolution of deposits and other bank liabilities may be affected by similar problems, and additionally may be sticky in the presence of deposit insurance arrangements or credible government guarantees on bank liabilities. For these reasons, the dating of banking crises has traditionally relied primarily on the identification of “events” or subjective criteria to determine when a banking crisis takes place (for example, Caprio and Klingebiel, 1996; Caprio, Klingebiel, Laeven, and Noguera, 2005; and Reinhart and Rogoff, 2009). The advantage of such an approach is its flexibility, given the very different manifestations of a banking crisis. The disadvantage is that it may be seen as arbitrary. To make progress toward a definition that is less subject to such criticism, we define a banking crisis as an event that meets two conditions:
 Significant signs of financial distress in the banking system (as indicated by significant bank runs, losses in the banking system, and/or bank liquidations). Significant banking policy intervention measures in response to significant losses in the banking system. We consider the first year that both criteria are met to be the year when the crisis became systemic. This is to ensure that we date the crisis at the first signs of major problems in the banking system. The first criterion is a necessary and sufficient condition. It is sufficient because a banking crisis may well result in the collapse of the banking sector without any government intervention. Yet, such cases are very rare, at least over the period we cover.Footnote 2 Relying exclusively on the first criterion, however, is problematic because it is not always straightforward to quantify the degree of financial distress in a banking system. For instance, in advanced economies with well-functioning interbank markets, financial distress may be readily observed in jumps in the volatility of interbank rates. However, in less developed financial markets, shocks to banks’ balance sheets, such as those derived from heightened pressures on the currency, may either appear with some delay or be absorbed by offsetting positions at banks. As a result, it is hard to quantify the degree of financial distress in the banking system at a given point in time. Furthermore, bank runs and credit crunches are only partially captured by the evolution of credit and deposit series, as highlighted earlier. Because there are cases where the first criterion fails to measure financial distress in a timely and precise manner, we add the second criterion on policy interventions as an indirect measure of financial distress. Clearly, policy intervention as captured by the second criterion is not random and follows from perceived distress in the banking sector. Therefore, the second criterion is a sufficient condition for identifying a banking crisis, provided it meets the requirement of being significant, as explained next. We consider policy interventions in the banking sector to be significant if at least three out of the following six measures have been used:Footnote 3
 deposit freezes and/or bank holidays significant bank nationalizations bank restructuring gross costs (at least 3 percent of GDP) extensive liquidity support (5 percent of deposits and liabilities to nonresidents) significant guarantees put in place significant asset purchases (at least 5 percent of GDP) In essence, all policy interventions to resolve a banking crisis can be classified into the above six categories (see Honohan and Laeven, 2005, and Laeven and Valencia, 2008). However, not all six are resorted to in all crises, but some are used only when there is a crisis. Deposit freezes and bank holidays have been used only in the context of crises, but are not that common over the time period considered (only a handful of countries used them in our sample and more recently Cyprus). Bank nationalizations and restructuring costs, which involve mostly recapitalizations, are also most likely to occur during a crisis, but not necessarily during a systemically important crisis. Liquidity support and guarantees can be used preemptively without a crisis materializing, as in several countries during the recent wave (Laeven and Valencia, 2010), and asset purchases may also take place in the context of unconventional monetary policy. To avoid labeling a nonsystemic event or the preemptive use of some of these policies as a systemic banking crisis, we require that at least three measures have been put in place. We chose three policies as our threshold because in several instances, in particular during the recent wave of crises, several countries used both liquidity support and guarantees preemptively. Therefore, a minimum of three measures is needed as a threshold not to label these cases as systemic banking crises. For interventions that can be quantified more easily, such as liquidity support, asset purchases, and financial restructuring costs, we also adopt quantitative thresholds to determine significant intervention. The reason for doing this is to minimize type-I errors in the dating of banking crises because some of these interventions occur during nonsystemic events as well. There are cases, however, where countries intervened in their financial sectors using a combination of less than three of these measures but did so on a large scale (for example, by nationalizing all major banks in the country). Therefore, we consider a sufficient condition for a crisis episode to be deemed systemic when either (i) a country's banking system exhibits significant losses resulting in a share of nonperforming loans (NPLs) above 20 percent or bank closures of at least 20 percent of banking system assets or (ii) fiscal restructuring costs of the banking sector are sufficiently high, exceeding 5 percent of GDP. Additional criteria could in principle be included in our dating approach. However, for consistency purposes it is important to ensure that all cases are judged by the same metric. This implies the requirement to come up with a definition that can be applied over the whole sample period and across a wide array of countries. For instance, relying on stock market data or interbank rates would limit the sample primarily to emerging and advanced economies, because such data are generally not available in less developed economies. Our definition satisfies this requirement. In implementing this definition of systemic interventions, we consider liquidity support to be extensive when the ratio of central bank claims on the financial sector to deposits and foreign liabilities exceeds 5 percent and more than doubles relative to its precrisis level.Footnote 4 We also include any liquidity support extended directly by the Treasury. This measure of liquidity captures the impact of currency swap lines among central banks, as the amounts swapped and extended to the financial sector will generally be included in central bank claims on the financial sector. However, it does not include liquidity that subsidiaries of a multinational bank receive in a foreign country. For instance, liquidity provided by the U.S. Federal Reserve to U.S. subsidiaries of Swiss banks would not be measured as liquidity support in Switzerland, but would be included in U.S. liquidity support. However, this limitation has no impact on the identification of systemic crises in our sample. A broader related aspect is that some crises do not originate domestically but are imported from abroad when foreign subsidiaries of domestic banks get in trouble. One concrete example among recent crisis cases is Austria, where most of the problems originated in Austrian banks’ foreign subsidiaries. The policy variables we used in our crisis definition are more specifically defined as follows:
 Deposit freeze and bank holidays: indicates whether or not the authorities imposed a freeze on deposits or declared a bank holiday. If implemented, we also collect information on the duration of the deposit freeze and bank holiday, and the type of deposits affected. Significant nationalizations: takeovers by the government of systemically important financial institutions and includes cases where the government takes a majority stake in the capital of such financial institutions. Significant bank guarantees: a significant government guarantee on bank liabilities, indicating that either a full protection of liabilities has been issued by the government or that government guarantees have been extended to nondeposit liabilities of banks.Footnote 5 Actions that only raise the level of deposit insurance coverage are not included. We also collect information on whether or not a previous explicit deposit insurance arrangement was in place at the time of the introduction of the blanket guarantee. Liquidity support: indicates liquidity support from the central bank, measured as the ratio of central bank claims on deposit money banks (line 12 in IFS) and liquidity support from the Treasury to total deposits and liabilities to nonresidents. Total deposits are computed as the sum of demand deposits (line 24), other deposits (line 25), and liabilities to nonresidents (line 26). We report two measures, the peak and the change between the peak and precrisis levels. Bank restructuring costs: defined as gross fiscal outlays directed to the restructuring of the financial sector, with the most important component being recapitalization costs. We exclude liquidity assistance from the Treasury because we include this in our measure of liquidity support. We consider restructuring costs to be significant if they exceed 3 percent of GDP. We base our definition on gross fiscal costs instead of net because the gross amount reflects the intensity of the intervention. However, wherever data on recoveries were available we report also net fiscal costs. Asset purchases: It includes asset purchases from financial institutions implemented by the central bank, the Treasury, or a government entity (such as an asset management company). We define significant asset purchases as those exceeding 5 percent of GDP.Footnote 6 To examine how small changes to our definition affect the list of crises episodes, we also create an additional list of “borderline cases,” corresponding to cases where our definition of a systemic crisis is almost met. Table 1 provides the list of countries that meet our definition during the recent episode as well as the borderline cases. The table indicates that lowering our requirement to only two (instead of three) policy interventions would increase the number of systemic crises by 8 during the recent wave of crises.Footnote 7 To generate significant further changes to the list of crises, a much more drastic relaxation of our definition would be required. Table 1 shows for each case the exact criteria that are met. We do not include a separate column for deposit freezes and bank holidays because no episode during this recent wave of banking crises made use of banking holidays, while deposit freezes were used only for Parex bank in Latvia.Footnote 8 In total, we identify 13 systemic banking crises and 8 borderline cases since the year 2007. Cyprus, which meets our banking crisis definition starting in 2012, is not included in our sample which ends in 2011. Table A1 presents more detailed information about the policy interventions in these cases. For each crisis, we report the date when the crisis started, corresponding to the first signs of significant distress, as well as the date when the crisis became systemic, which we define as the date when our definition of a systemic crisis was first met. The starting dates for the recent crises are as follows: the United States and the United Kingdom start in 2007, Nigeria in 2009, and all the other cases in 2008. In each of these cases, banking systems showed significant signs of distress followed by government intervention during the starting year of the crisis. However, the crisis reached systemic proportions according to our definition only in 2009 in Denmark, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Mongolia, and Ukraine, in 2010 in Kazakhstan, and in 2011 in Nigeria and Spain. For some of these countries, however, the dates would alter slightly if our thresholds are relaxed. For instance, Spain crosses our 3 percent threshold for bank restructuring costs in 2011. If we were to reduce this threshold to 1 percent, then Spain's crisis would be labeled as systemic starting already in 2009. However, such changes are rare in our sample. This is primarily because the requirement that three policies be in place reduces the sensitivity of our dating to the use of these quantitative thresholds. For instance, Germany does not cross our significant bank restructuring costs threshold of 3 percent of GDP, but even if we were to choose a much lower threshold, the dating for Germany would not change. This is the case because it already qualifies as a systemic crisis given that a sufficient number of other policies have been put in place. Of course, the sample of crises would increase more substantially if we were to lower the three thresholds all at once. To validate our crisis dating more systematically, we conduct the following experiment: We construct an alternative definition of a crisis that corresponds to the first year before two conditions are simultaneously met: negative real GDP growth and a slowdown in nominal credit growth (IFS line 22d). The rationale for this alternative definition is straightforward. Banking crises disrupt the supply of credit (Bernanke and Gertler, 1987, Van Den Heuvel, 2006, Valencia, forthcoming, and others) and these disruptions to the supply of credit can have important real effects because some borrowers cannot substitute bank loans with alternative funding sources (Peek and Rosengren, 1997; Ashcraft, 2005; Laeven and Valencia, 2013, and others). In essence, by looking at declines in credit growth in conjunction with negative GDP growth, we look for evidence of the two main implications of banking crises. We use nominal credit growth rather than the level of credit because the stock of outstanding loans measured in domestic currency need not decline during crisis times even if there is no new lending. This is the case because of exchange rate valuation effects or because preexisting credit lines are drawn upon. Table 2 compares our dating with what would result from the simple alternative methodology discussed above based on observed realizations of negative real GDP growth and a slowdown in nominal credit growth. Out of the 147 episodes we report in this paper, in 62 episodes or in 42 percent of cases, our crisis dates coincide with a decline in real GDP and a slowdown in credit growth. But many of the cases for which we obtain conflicting results are developing countries where the reliability of the data is an issue. When we split our sample according to income level, the matching is much better for advanced and emerging economies, especially for advanced economies where our crisis dates coincide with the dates generated based on the alternative approach in 18 out of 24 (or 75 percent) of cases (Table 3). To illustrate graphically how this alternative methodology compares to our dating approach, Figure 1 shows the evolution of real GDP growth and nominal credit growth for a selected number of crises. Our dating method coincides precisely with the outcome of the alternative methodology in each of these crises. And although the alternative methodology often points to the occurrence of multiple crises following the start of the crisis according to our dating approach, such “false positives” typically correspond to the same crisis episode as indicated by our dating approach. Alternative Dating Methodology for Selected CrisesNotes: Solid vertical lines denote the year before two conditions are met: negative real GDP growth and a slowdown in nominal credit growth (that is, crisis dates per the alternative dating methodology). Dashed vertical lines denote the start of the banking crisis per our dating methodology. Our dataset also includes the corresponding month for the reported dates as well as the month when liquidity support peaked, allowing for an analysis of banking crises at a monthly frequency.Footnote 9 Figure 2 depicts the frequency of banking crises by month of all banking crises since the 1970s. An interesting pattern emerges: banking crises tend to start in the second half of the year, with large September and December effects. However, the September effect is primarily driven by the 2008 crisis wave, around the time of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. Frequency of Starting Month of Banking CrisesSource: Authors’ calculations. Banking crises are a worldwide phenomenon. Figure 3 shows the regional distribution of crises, highlighting countries that experienced multiple systemic banking crises during 1970–2011. Many countries experienced more than one crisis over this period, but only two countries, Argentina and the Democratic Republic of Congo, experienced more than two systemic banking crises. Frequency of Systemic Banking Crises Around the World, 1970–2011Source: Authors’ calculations. In total, we count 147 banking crises since 1970, of which 13 are borderline events, including those reported in Table 1. The complete dataset is available from the Palgrave website at www.palgrave-journals.com/imfer. Consistent with earlier work (for example, Reinhart and Rogoff, 2009), we find that crises occur in waves. Figure 4 presents the number of banking crises that start in a given year, showing a marked pickup in crisis activity in the early 1980s. During the 1990s, there were three clusters of crises in the transition economies, in Latin America during the Tequila crisis, and in East Asia during the Asian financial crisis. The early 2000s were a relatively calm period, but ended with the most recent wave, consisting of the largest number of crises since 1970. These crisis cycles frequently coincide with credit cycles. Out of 129 banking crisis episodes for which credit data are available, 45 episodes (or about one in three) were preceded by a credit boom.Footnote 10 Banking Crises CyclesSource: Authors’ calculations.Notes: Number of systemic banking crises starting in a given year.",764

The paper thus shifts the focus of empirical analysis to the design of large fiscal adjustment plans, and the comparison of ex ante plans vs. ex post outcomes. More specifically, it looks at deviations from targets in revenues or expenditures and the factors underlying such deviations—including deviations of macroeconomic variables such as economic growth and interest rates from assumptions under the plans. The analysis is applied to both individual country cases and a cross-country statistical sample. Before turning to the main analysis, a few words on methodological aspects—including what we do not do, as well as differences from related literature. First, we do not seek to assess the impact of fiscal adjustment on economic growth. A recent contribution to, and thorough summary of, that large literature is in Chapter 3 of October 2010 World Economic Outlook. Second, we do not analyze the effects of the external environment, monetary policy, or the exchange rate on the degree of implementation of the fiscal adjustment plans. The reason is that we focus on deviations of fiscal outcomes from initial plans. External factors and the likely monetary policy stance would be taken into account by the authorities when drawing up their fiscal adjustment plans. Moreover, to the extent that such factors turn out different from assumptions in the plans, the main channel through which they affect fiscal outcomes is via surprises in economic growth and, to a lesser extent, interest rates, both of which we take into account explicitly. These focus on each of the G7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States). The sample size and its composition were selected on various grounds: (i) the fact that the need for fiscal adjustment is currently more acute in advanced economies; (ii) the availability of at least two large medium-term fiscal adjustment plans, with a reasonable degree of specificity, available to the public, and with a horizon of at least three years; and (iii) the desire to provide details on the motivation for fiscal adjustment, the constraints faced by policymakers, and the real-world choices they had to make given the information that was available to them at the time. The specific ex ante consolidation attempts in each country were selected based on the large size of planned adjustment, formal and public commitment to adjust, detailed formulation, and medium-term perspective. The choice of adjustment plans for a given country was relatively easy in some cases (for example, Canada, where only two medium-term plans were presented in recent decades) but required more elaborate criteria in others. For instance, for Germany, where medium-term fiscal adjustment plans have long been prepared each year (on a rolling basis), the four most ambitious plans were selected (on a purely ex ante basis) by the targeted improvement in the cyclically adjusted primary balance (computed using only real-time data that would have been available to contemporaries). In the case of Italy, where the public debt has been chronically high and medium-term fiscal adjustment plans have been published every year, but governments have been short-lived, the most important and ambitious fiscal adjustment plan (to meet the Maastricht criteria for euro entry) and the only plan designed and fully implemented by the same government were looked at. In what follows, we provide a few key facts distilled from the case studies, highlighting those that seem to provide insights whose significance applies beyond the specific circumstances of the country in question. Table 1 summarizes the individual plans analyzed and their main features. From an ex post perspective, Canada is ultimately the most successful case among the G7, going from the second-largest net debt-to-GDP ratio in the 1970s to the lowest one beginning in the late 1990s. It is also a relatively simple case, as there were only two prominent fiscal adjustment plans, which relied on contrasting approaches, yielding substantially different results. The first attempt (1985–91) was relatively unambitious, as it sought to reduce the overall deficit by 3½ percent of GDP over six years and would not, even if fully implemented, reverse the rise in the debt-to-GDP ratio. The plan consisted mainly of across-the-board cuts and freezes. The second attempt (1994–97) was far more ambitious, seeking to reduce the overall deficit by 3 percent of GDP over three years. This plan involved a major restructuring of spending, including reforms of unemployment insurance, transfers to provinces, and pensions. In the event, both plans attained their intended objectives, but the second plan stands out in accomplishing a durable turnaround in the debt dynamics. Most important, the study reports that, based on surveys, the public's attitudes were much more favorable to fiscal adjustment prior to the launch of the plan of the 1990s than was the case in the 1980s, and that the government carefully explained the rationale for the adjustment and its composition to the general public. The case study begins with early plans not set in multiyear frameworks (Plan Barre, 1976–77; Virage de la Rigueur, 1982–84). These were essentially austerity packages aimed at curbing inflation and current account deficits, through a combination of tax hikes and spending curbs. They were relatively effective in containing aggregate demand, but their impact was short-lived. More formal, multiyear planning really begins with the drive to meet the Maastricht criteria, especially the 1994–97 plan. Three-year plans were subsequently prepared every year as part of France's commitments vis-à-vis the European Union. Among them, the 2003–07 plan is analyzed in detail, as it envisaged a sizable consolidation under the Excessive Deficit Procedure. Two results stand out from this case study. First, difficulties in controlling expenditures: ultimately, the Maastricht criteria (first plan) and the commitments under the EDP (second plan) were met partly through last-minute revenue measures. Second, gradual improvements in the ability to control expenditures were associated with increasingly legally binding targets for spending. Among the many plans put forward by Germany over the years, the case study analyzes in depth the four plans that, on an ex ante basis, targeted the largest improvements in the structural fiscal balance. Several characteristics distinguish the more successful (ex post) plans of the 1980s (1981–85) and 2000s (2003–07) from the less successful plans of the 1970s (1976–79) and 1990s (1991–95): first, strategic reforms that reflected a change in the view on the appropriate role of the state; second, accompanying reforms beyond the fiscal area (notably, labor market reforms in the 2000s); and third, greater support of the need for fiscal consolidation among the general public. The case study on Italy leverages the fact that (rolling) three-year plans have been prepared annually over the past couple of decades. By analyzing all the plans and their ex post outcomes, it finds that a steady source of slippages was the “base effect,” that is, upward revisions to the initial deficit data, typically emerging only a few months into the implementation of each given adjustment plan. The study then delves into more detailed analysis of two prominent plans, as follows. First, the 1994–97 plan, motivated by the drive to enter the euro. This plan met the 3 percent deficit Maastricht criterion (partly through last-minute efforts, particularly on the revenue side) and attained a reasonably-lasting reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio, albeit at high levels. Second, the only plan that was designed and fully implemented under one government (2002–05). This plan envisaged an improvement in the fiscal balance by 1 percent of GDP, together with a 2 percent of GDP reduction in the revenue ratio, thus implying the need for a 3 percent of GDP expenditure cut. In the event, the revenue ratio remained unchanged and sizable overruns took place on both expenditures and the fiscal balance. The takeaway from this second plan is that government stability in itself is no guarantee that fiscal objectives will be achieved. In the case of Japan, formal medium-term planning is a relatively recent phenomenon, and only two plans (beginning in 1997 and 2002, respectively) were identified with a sufficient degree of specificity, for this study's purpose. In both instances, the main findings relate to the powerful adverse impact of negative surprises in economic growth, with both plans going quickly off-track as a result of unexpected economic downturns. Another result relates to difficulties in attaining envisaged increases in revenues when the plans leave the actual revenue measures to be spelled out at a later stage. Beginning in the 1980s, each incoming Chancellor of the Exchequer presented a four-year plan, and the case study analyzes those that envisaged a sizable (ex ante) improvement in the fiscal balance (Howe, FY1980–FY1983; Lawson, FY1984–FY1988; Clarke, FY1994–FY1998; and Darling, FY2008–FY2012). Plans that involved reforms to the key drivers of cost in the public sector (social security, health, education—by function; payroll, transfers, subsidies to public enterprises—by economic classification) met or even improved upon their objectives. In contrast, excessive reliance on cuts to infrastructure or to local authorities eventually resulted in spending overruns, as the need to maintain infrastructure or provide basic services ultimately prevailed. Although the United States has not traditionally prepared formal medium-term fiscal plans, the case study analyzes prominent initiatives aimed at keeping the fiscal variables in check: the 1985 Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act and the 1990 and 1993 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Acts. Key takeaways include the following. As in other countries, the powerful impact of economic growth is evident, especially in the major improvement in the state of the public finances associated with the boom of the 1990s. At the same time, the initiatives to keep expenditures in check played a helpful role in reducing the extent to which extra revenues resulted in additional spending. Indeed, as expenditure limits were gradually made more legally binding over the years, they became increasingly effective. This said, the comparison between Canada and the United States is especially revealing, because while these two countries experienced remarkably similar economic growth developments—notably, booms in the mid- and late 1990s, Canada undertook reforms that resulted in a long-lasting improvement in the debt and deficit, whereas the United States experienced a temporary improvement in the fiscal variables that was reversed in the 2000s. The case studies are complemented by a systematic cross-country statistical analysis of large fiscal adjustment plans. Again, the sample was selected on an ex ante basis. The set of countries consists of the members of the European Union, which have to produce fiscal adjustment plans as part of their obligations as EU members. Specifically, a comprehensive database was constructed consisting of all the three-year “convergence” or “stability and growth” programs produced by each European Union country every year over the past couple of decades. The complete database consists of 229 three-year plans for 25 countries, covering 1991–2007: the pre-1998 plans were gathered from various archival sources, entering the data from hard copies, whereas the post-1998 plans were drawn from an existing EU database. As the time span of plans published in 2006 and later overlaps significantly with the global financial crisis—whose impact would unduly dominate and skew the results of any systematic statistical analysis of this type—we focus on the 178 plans published before end-2005. Starting from these and defining as “large planned fiscal adjustments” those that envisaged a cumulative adjustment in the headline fiscal balance of more than 1 percent of GDP in the following three years, we identified a total of 100 large fiscal adjustment plans. Finally, for each country, plans with more than two overlapping years were dropped, yielding our sample of 66 large planned headline balance improvements. The plans include both fiscal variables (including revenues, primary and interest expenditures, fiscal balances, and the public debt, all at the general government level) and underlying macroeconomic assumptions (real and nominal GDP levels and growth rates, inflation, interest rates, and so on) for the next three years. More specifically, from each plan, we collected the estimates for year t (the year of the plan's publication), reported outcomes for year t−1, and projections for years t+1, t+2, and t+3. We also recovered plan information on cyclically adjusted balances for the plans for which it was available (about one-half of the plans), and supplemented that information with our own computations of the cyclically adjusted balance, which we undertook using “real-time” output gaps—that is, using only the information that would have been available to contemporary observers. We drew final ex post data for the same variables from the European Commission's annual macroeconomic (AMECO) database. This rich data set permits a comparison of expectations and outcomes not only for the fiscal variables, but also for several macroeconomic variables that are relevant for fiscal outcomes. Thus, using real-time data, plan implementation errors and ratios (actual adjustment vs. planned adjustment) and their economic and political determinants were analyzed. A few more technical points regarding two key steps involved in defining fiscal adjustment and tracking implementation:
 Defining fiscal adjustment. We define the ex ante planned adjustment as the projected percentage point increase in the fiscal balance-to-GDP ratio between years t and t+3 as reported in the year t plan. The corresponding ex post adjustment is defined as the actual percentage point increase in the fiscal balance-to-GDP ratio between years t and t+3 as reported in the final data (the 2009 AMECO vintage). In addition to the overall fiscal balance and its revenue and expenditure components, we also track the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance, subdivided into cyclically adjusted revenues and primary expenditures. Measuring implementation. We use two measures of plan implementation: (a) an implementation ratio which, for each plan, scales the actual observed three-year cumulative improvement in the fiscal balance-to-GDP ratio to the corresponding planned improvement; and (b) an implementation error, which, for each plan, subtracts the planned three-year cumulative improvement in the fiscal balance-to-GDP ratio from the corresponding actual improvement. Perfect implementation would be implied by an implementation ratio of 1 or, equivalently, an implementation error of zero. Of course, overperformance of plans (implementation ratio greater than 1, or implementation errors greater than zero) is also feasible. An advantage of using the implementation ratio is that it appropriately scales actual performance to the plan's fiscal adjustment ambition (planned improvement in the fiscal balance) and is thus comparable across plans in a nonregression framework, that is, where ambition is not otherwise controlled for. An advantage of using the implementation error is the ease of interpretation it affords in a regression framework, as its units are percentage points of GDP. We therefore use this measure in our formal regressions (see Section III), where ambition is appropriately controlled for.",6

Beginning with the research by Piketty (2001, 2003) of the long-run distribution of top incomes in France, a succession of studies has constructed top income share time series over the long run for more than 20 countries to date. These works have generated a large volume of data, which are intended as a research resource for further analysis. This is by far the largest historical inequality data set available so far. The WTID aims to providing convenient online access to all the existent series (see topincomes.parisschoolofeconomics.eu). This is an ongoing endeavor, and we will progressively update the base with new observations, as authors extend the series forwards and backwards. The first 22 country-studies have been included in two volumes (Atkinson and Piketty, 2007, 2010). As the map below shows, around 45 further countries are currently under study. Although the present paper chooses to focus on the findings obtained for developed countries (and particularly for the United States), the database aims to include a growing number of emerging economies. The basic methodology used in the WTID follows the pioneering work of Kuznets (1953). That is, we use income tax data to compute top income series, and national accounts to compute aggregate income. The key advantage of these data sources is that they are available on a long run, annual basis for a large number of countries. In addition, administrative tax data are generally of higher quality than household survey data, which often suffer from severe sampling and self-reporting biases. This is particularly problematic at the top of the distribution, which is unfortunate, given the large share of aggregate income going to the top decile, and given that this is where a lot of the action has been taking place in historical evolutions. However, there are limitations with our approach, in particular, owing to the exclusion of tax-exempt income (either tax-exempt capital income or transfer income), as we shall see below. We start by presenting the updated version of what is probably the most spectacular result coming from the WTID, namely, the very pronounced U-shaped evolution of top income shares in the United States over the past century (Piketty and Saez, 2003), series updated to 2010). The share of total market income going to the top decile was as large as 50 percent at the eve of the 1929 Great Depression, fell sharply during the 1930s and—most importantly—during World War II, and stabilized below 35 percent between the 1940s and the 1970s. It then rose gradually since the late 1970s to the early 1980s, and is now close to 50 percent once again (see Figure 1(a)). (a) The Top Decile Income Share in the United States, 1917–2010; (b) The Top Decile Income Share in the United States, 1917–2010 (Including Capital Gains and Excluding Capital Gains); (c) Decomposing the Top Decile US Income Share into Three Groups, 1913–2010Source: Piketty and Saez (2003), series updated to 2010. Note: Income is defined as market income including realized capital gains (excludes government transfers). Several remarks are in order. First, the interesting new finding here is that the Great Recession of 2008–09 seems unlikely to reverse the long-run trend.Footnote 1 There was a sharp fall in the top decile share in 2008–09, but it was followed by a strong rebound in 2010. We do not have full income tax return data for 2011–12 yet, but all the preliminary tax tabulations that we have—as well as external evidence regarding corporate profits or financial bonuses—suggest that the rebound might be continuing in 2011–12. This would be consistent with the experience of the previous economic downturn. That is, top income shares fell in 2001–02, but quickly recovered and returned to the previous trend in 2003–07. Another piece of evidence that is consistent with this interpretation is given by Figure 1(b). If we take away capital gains—unsurprisingly the most cyclical component of income—one can see that the upward trend has continued since 2007. This strongly suggests that the Great Recession will only depress top income shares temporarily and will not undo any of the marked increase in top income shares that has taken place since the 1970s. Indeed, excluding realized capital gains, the top decile share in 2010 is equal to 46.3 percent, higher than in 2007. Next, it is worth stressing that the orders of magnitude are truly enormous. More that 15 percent of US national income was shifted from the bottom 90 percent to the top 10 percent in the United States over the past 30 years. In effect, the top 1 percent alone has absorbed almost 60 percent of aggregate US income growth between 1976 and 2007 (see Figure 1(c) and Tables 1, 2). The fact that so much action has been taking place at the level of the top 1 percent, and relatively little at the level of the next 9 percent, is probably the most staggering evolution. These results illustrate why it is critical to use administrative tax data to study trends in income distribution. With standard surveys based on limited sample size and self-reported income (such as the Current population survey or the surveys used in the Luxembourg Income Study and standard international inequality data sets), one can measure adequately the evolution of the 90:10 threshold ratio—but one cannot measure properly incomes above the 90th percentile, and therefore one largely misses the magnitude of the trend that has been going on.Footnote 2 Next, it is striking to see that a similar—although smaller—trend has been going on in the United Kingdom and in Canada, but not in Continental Europe and Japan, where the long pattern of income inequality is much closer to an L-shaped than to a U-shaped curve (see Figure 2(a)–(c)). (a) Top 1 Percent Share: English-speaking Countries (U-shaped), 1910–2010; (b) Top 1 Percent Share: Continental Europe and Japan (L-shaped), 1900–2010; (c) Top 1 Percent Share: Europe, North vs. South (L-shaped), 1900–2010Source: World Top Incomes Database, 2012. It is particularly striking to compare the evolution of the top decile share in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France over the past century (see Figure 3). The United States seems to be heading back toward 50 percent of total income going to the top decile, the United Kingdom seems to be following this trend, whereas Germany and France appear to be relatively stable around or below 35 percent—not too much above the low levels observed in the 1970s–80s, and very close to those prevailing in the 1950s–60s. To us, the fact that countries with similar technological and productivity evolutions have gone through such different patterns of income inequality—especially at the very top—supports the view that institutional and policy differences may have played a key role in these transformations. Purely technological stories based solely on supply and demand of skills seem not to be sufficient to explain such diverging patterns. Changes in tax policies—which indeed vary a lot across countries—look like a more promising candidate. We return to this below when we discuss optimal tax policies. Top Decile Income Shares, 1910–2010Source: World Top Incomes Database, 2012.Note: Missing values interpolated using top 5 percent and top 1 percent series. Another interesting lesson emerging from our historical perspective is the comparison between the Great Depression and the Great Recession. Downturns do not seem to have long-run effects on inequality, even when they are very large. The reason why the Great Depression was followed by huge inequality decline is not the depression, but rather the large political shocks and policy responses—in particular the tremendous changes in institutions and tax policies—which took place in the 1930s–40s. The Great Recession is likely to have a large long-run impact only if it is followed by significant policy changes. Finally, the composition of top incomes has changed between 1929 and 2007. In both years, the share of wage income declines and the share of capital income rises as one moves up within the top decile and the top percentile of the income distribution. However, in 2007, one needs to enter into the top 0.1 percent for capital income to dominate wage income, whereas in 1929 it was sufficient to enter the top 1 percent (see Figure 4(a)–(b)). Also note that the composition of capital income itself has changed markedly—it is today largely made up of capital gains. If one takes away capital gains, then wage income now dominates capital income at the very top (see Figure 4(c)–(d)). Income Composition of Top Groups within the Top Decile in 1929 and 2007: Panel A: 1929; Panel B: 2007; Panel C: 1929; Panel D: 2007 (Excluding Capital Gains)Note: Wage income includes wages, bonuses, exercised stock options, and bonuses. Capital income includes rent, dividends, interest, and realized capital gains. Entrepreneurial income includes business income and income from partnerships and from S-Corporations. One should be cautious, however, about the tax reporting rate (that is, the ratio between fiscal income, as reported in tax returns, and full economic income, as estimated by national accounts) that is today much lower for capital income than for wage income (see Table 3). If we were to correct for this downward trend in the capital income tax reporting rate, which we did not do in our published series so far, then the US level of top income shares today would probably be significantly higher than in 1929, and the composition would look closer. This would follow mechanically from the fact that capital ownership—and hence capital income—is much more strongly concentrated than labor income. In the United States, the top decile of the wealth distribution currently owns over 70 percent of aggregate wealth (according to the Survey of Consumer Finances, which understates the importance of top wealth holders; see Kennickell, 2009). In contrast, the top decile of the income distribution receives less than 50 percent of aggregate income. However, one difficulty is that we do not know whether the reporting rate is the same at all levels of capital income. In case low and middle wealth holders have a lower reporting rate (for example, owing to the fact that a larger fraction of their wealth takes the form of tax-free saving accounts), then this force might push in the opposite direction. This is an important limitation of our series that also applies to other countries (the share of tax-exempt capital income has increased pretty much everywhere during the past decades), and which should be kept in mind.Footnote 3 Another related limitation is that we did not attempt so far to include estimates for capital incomes originating from assets located in tax havens (which are typically not well recorded in resident countries, and which have grown considerably in recent decades; see Zucman, 2013). Presumably this is particularly important for very top capital incomes. Another important limitation is that our series do not take into account tax-exempt transfer income. That is, all top income shares series presented in the WTID relate to pretax market income. Given the rise of transfers since the 1970s, this is likely to affect the trends. Ideally, one would like to extend our series in order to take into account all forms of missing incomes, that is, both missing capital income (this would tend to raise top income shares) and missing transfer income (this would tend to reduce top income shares). It is unclear which effect would dominate. Also there are difficult issues related to the measurement of transfer incomes. For example, in the United States, a big part of the rise of transfers took the form of in-kind transfers, especially through Medicaid/Medicare soaring costs (with unclear value added for those exploding costs). In any case, the main—and robust—lesson from our US series is that bottom 99 percent cash market incomes have grown at a much smaller rate than aggregate per capita GDP since the 1970s, owing to the large rise in income concentration.",105

Stein,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In the decade since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), there has been an outpouring of research on the topic of “credit cycles,” meaning macroeconomic fluctuations that are driven in significant part by variations in credit supply. With this work as a backdrop, my goal in this talk is threefold. First, I will provide a very brief and selective survey of a handful of papers that highlight some of the key empirical facts about credit cycles. Second, I will try to interpret these facts through a conceptual lens, asking what theoretical mechanisms appear to be most consistent with the data. And third, I will pose the question of what policies, if any, can be helpful in moderating these credit-driven fluctuations in real activity. In this regard, it is important to stress that credit-supply shocks are relevant for understanding more than just crises. As will become clear, they play an important role in garden-variety recessions and slowdowns as well. And to the extent that any form of policy, be it regulatory or monetary, aims to moderate the business cycle, it also needs to attend to these less dramatic, but more frequent kinds of credit-induced fluctuations. One caveat at the outset: I am going to spend some time dwelling on the limitations of financial regulation. However, this does not at all imply that I am not a supporter of the general thrust of the financial regulatory reforms that were undertaken in the wake of the GFC. Quite to the contrary: I believe that these reforms have been both necessary and valuable, and in many cases—e.g. with respect to increases in bank capital levels—I would have preferred to go even further than what has been done to date. At the same time, and especially in a capital-markets-dominated economy like the USA, it is important to recognize that regulation is unlikely to be a panacea in taming the credit cycle. Given the gaps in regulatory coverage of different types of financial institutions and markets, and the inexorable forces of regulatory arbitrage, it may be asking too much to hope that regulation alone can achieve the degree of financial stability that is optimal for macroeconomic performance. This observation then raises the question of whether, in a second-best world, monetary policy should also be implemented with financial stability in mind.",6

During the global financial crisis, the US administration implemented a sizable fiscal stimulus, which supported the recovery in the USA; in contrast, during the Euro area debt crisis many countries in Europe introduced tax increases and spending cuts as a way to restore confidence in the sustainability of public debt. More recently, the US Congress has adopted a major overhaul of the tax code, embracing tax cuts and increases in military spending. Finally, in response to the ongoing Covid-19 crisis, most advanced economies around the world are making major fiscal policy interventions to limit the economic impact of the pandemic. The renewed interest in fiscal policy has spurred considerable academic research on its effects on economic activity. However, with much of the debate concentrated on the domestic effects, much less has been said on the international dimension of fiscal policy and its spillovers. We take up this issue by focusing on spillovers from tax policy that, differently than spillovers from government spending, have been mostly disregarded in the fiscal policy literature. We evaluate the domestic and spillover effects of an expansionary tax rate shock in the USA, focusing on the international channels of transmission. Our analysis provides answers to some relevant policy questions, such as: does a fiscal expansion in the US increase output abroad? Is there heterogeneity in the transmission across recipient countries? Are spillovers driven by real or financial channels? Also, we provide evidence on how the impact of fiscal policy depends on the specific instrument adopted, comparing specific components of tax policies. Are corporate and personal income tax shocks both effective? Are their effects equally persistent? Do they propagate through the same channels? We answer these questions within a global vector error correction model (GVAR), the framework developed by Pesaran et al. (2004), in which each country model features domestic and foreign variables. Target variables are real GDP, inflation, real equity prices, interest rates, real exchange rates and exports. In the US model, we also include fiscal variables and identify tax rate shocks following the proxy-SVAR methodology. For this purpose, we use the narrative series of Mertens and Ravn (2013) as instruments for personal and corporate income tax rate shocks. The main results of the paper are the following. First, the domestic effects of tax rate shocks are strong, with multipliers consistently above unity 1 year after the shock. This result is in line with Ramey (2019), showing that tax shocks have an impact on output that is even stronger than that of a spending shock.Footnote 1 Moreover, personal income tax rate shocks seem to activate demand-side effects, while corporate income tax rate shocks trigger supply-side ones, at the domestic level. Second, spillovers are positive and, in most cases, statistically significant, albeit of a small size. Third, in terms of geographical distribution, US tax shocks have a stronger impact on advanced than emerging countries; moreover, economies that are geographically close to the USA are not impacted in the same way, with Mexico benefiting less than Canada from the US fiscal expansion. This paper also sheds some light on the international transmission mechanism of US fiscal policy. The main channel through which fiscal shocks propagate is international trade. Independently of the type of shock, following a fiscal expansion the USA increases its imports from the rest of the world, stimulating output in foreign countries. This occurs via both a price and a quantity effect. Indeed, for some countries real exchange rates depreciate vis-à-vis the US dollar, improving their price competitiveness (expenditure switching or price effect); for other countries, higher US output stimulates demand for imports without significant exchange rate variations (expenditure boosting or quantity effect). In our results, this latter propagation mechanism seems to dominate quantitatively on the former. Moreover, financial channels (through interest rates and equity prices) also play a role in the international transmission, although a smaller one than the trade channel. Foreign long-term interest rates generally increase following the US fiscal shocks, acting as a drag on economic growth; only in a few cases, they fall on impact reinforcing expansionary effects. Concerning equity markets, a US fiscal expansion may lead to an increase in foreign equity prices, generating positive wealth effects which, in principle, could support consumption and investment; in our framework, we find equity prices reacting significantly to fiscal shocks only in some cases, suggesting that wealth effects are of minor importance in channeling fiscal shocks across the board. This paper contributes to the recently growing literature on fiscal spillovers in several ways. First, it is one of the first studying empirically the international transmission of fiscal shocks originating in the USA, in particular for what concerns tax shocks. As we model the world economy in a single framework, we are able to take into account the indirect effect of shocks arising from the economic linkages among recipient countries (third-party effects) and obtain more accurate spillover estimates than those delivered by widely used bilateral models (such as two-country VARs or local projections à la Jorda 2005), as highlighted by Georgiadis (2017). Second, the paper highlights the differences in the international propagation among the implemented tax policy tools, i.e., personal and corporate income tax policies. Third, it is the first paper quantifying spillovers in terms of fiscal multipliers for each type of tax shocks and at different points in time. Fourth, fiscal policy shocks in the US are identified using narrative series, which allow for the identification of tax rate shocks, as opposed to the more endogenous measure of tax revenues usually adopted in the literature on fiscal spillovers. As far as we know, this is also the first time that a proxy-SVAR identification strategy is employed in a GVAR framework.",30

Four years before the Covid-19 pandemic, global debt reached a record peak of 225% of world GDP, an increase of 12% points of GDP compared to the previous peak at the onset of the 2007 financial crisis (IMF 2018). But as the pandemic spread, median debt in 2021 is projected to increase by about 17% of GDP in advanced economies, 12% in emerging economies and 8% in low-income countries compared to pre-pandemic expectations—as countries face higher spending to combat the pandemic and lower revenue due to automatic stabilizers (IMF 2020). High government debts expose countries to rollover risks and to a sudden tightening of international financial conditions—and therefore to increased risk of subsequent default. An important policy question is whether the Fund, in its mandate of providing financial support mechanisms to member countries that are experiencing actual or potential macroeconomic problems through bailout mechanisms, can help mitigate the occurrence of such subsequent crises. In this paper, we study the role of bailouts in mitigating the likelihood of subsequent sovereign defaults in developing countries, taking IMF-supported programs as an example.
 In theory, the mechanisms through which IMF-supported programs can affect sovereign debt crises are not obvious. IMF loans may affect sovereign defaults through conflicting channels (Jorra 2012). A first mechanism may arise from the consequences of liquidity provisions, particularly in the context of an illiquid government. If a government is facing a temporary liquidity shortage, having a rescue from the Fund may ease its liquidity constraints and help avoid a potential self-fulfilling crisis (Fisher 1997). In addition to mitigating liquidity constraints, the Fund’s support may also catalyze investor participation through improved confidence—thus helping to mobilize capital from other sources (Dhonte 1997; Fisher 1997; Bird and Rowlands 2002; Tirole 2002; Morris and Shin 2006; Saravia 2010). However, the catalytic effect on private lenders could come at a cost in the long run if the government ends up accumulating a higher level of private debt (Fink and Scholl 2016). Second, IMF-supported programs may affect debt crises through the policy adjustment channel. If countries do not pay for the consequences of their policy actions because of insurance provided by the Fund—on account of emergency loans that are somewhat cheaper than market conditions—this may create a moral hazard as countries may be (more) reluctant to undertake necessary but painful fiscal adjustments. A moral hazard may particularly arise if the Fund fails to differentiate between temporary liquidity crises and permanent ones (Vaubel 1996; Dreher 2004). Finally, a third mechanism, linked somewhat to the previous channel, is the role of conditionalities in IMF programs. Conditionalities, if properly tailored and implemented, may help rebuild a stable and sustainable macroeconomic position, including an improved fiscal position. Consequently, the question of whether IMF-supported programs have a positive or a negative effect on the likelihood of occurrence of debt crises is an empirical one. The paper’s empirical assessment relies on a large and representative panel of 106 developing countries over the period 1970–2016. We address the common issue of identification in IMF program evaluation using different strategies. In our benchmark approach, we employ the entropy balancing methodology, a generalization of conventional matching methods proposed by Hainmueller (2012), and recently used by Neuenkirch and Neumeier (2016) to study the impact of U.S. sanctions on poverty, and by Balima (2017) to analyze the effect of domestic sovereign bond market participation on financial dollarization. While the relative performance of entropy balancing—compared to alternative methods—will be closely discussed in detail in the methodological section, this method allows us to identify the impact of Fund-supported programs by comparing program and nonprogram countries that are as similar as possible in terms of observable characteristics, after purging for country- and time-specific factors. In robustness checks, we also employ an instrumental variable approach and conventional matchings. Our instrumental variable strategy uses two political variables—borrower’s ties with the Fund’s major shareholders at the United Nations General Assembly and previous executive elections—as external instruments for a country decision to sign a program with the Fund. The matching approaches employ propensity scores matching and bias-corrected matching to deal with the selection bias in Fund program adoption. The main finding in this paper indicates that IMF-supported programs significantly reduce the likelihood of subsequent sovereign defaults by around 1.3% points. This estimated coefficient is economically meaningful given that the unconditional probability of experiencing a sovereign default is about 3.5% points in our sample. We demonstrate that our finding is particularly robust to different specifications of the entropy balancing and the use of additional identification strategies including an instrumental variable approach and conventional matchings. Moreover, we find that a country that signed a program with the Fund experienced a slight improvement in its sovereign credit rating and a decrease in both government debt-to-GDP and fiscal deficit-to-GDP during the program period compared to the period before. This suggests that (i) the liquidity provision channel and catalytic role, (ii) the role of government adjustment effort, and (iii) the conditionality channel may be at work. Our results are in line with the theoretical model of Corsetti et al. (2006) that shows that a lending support not only has an impact on the likelihood and the possible incidence of a crisis, but also prompts the borrowing government to implement desirable policies and reforms. The rest of the paper is as follows. Section 2 discusses the existing literature. Section 2 presents our benchmark empirical methodology. Section 4 describes the data. Section 5 reports the baseline result while Sect. 6 follows with the robustness checks. Section 7 provides some potential explanations of the result. Finally, a summary is presented in Sect. 8.

Timmer,Bart Los,Gaaitzen J. de Vries,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"How can we track cross-border supply chain fragmentation and its impact on the global trade elasticity? The contribution of this paper is twofold. We first introduce the supply chain fragmentation (SCF) ratio. This is a novel measure of fragmentation that sums the volume of imports by all countries that participate in a particular supply chain. It takes account of imports by the country in which the product is finalised as well as imports by other countries in upstream stages of production. The new fragmentation measure is interesting in itself, and has a concrete application in analyses of the global trade elasticity. We embed the SCF ratio in a within-between decomposition framework to account for the elasticity of trade to world GDP in the vein of Bems et al. (2010, 2011). We quantify and compare the effects of changes in cross-border fragmentation of production (""within supply chain"" effects) as well as asymmetric demand shocks in final demand (leading to ""between supply chain"" and “final trade” effects). Our SCF ratio can be thought of as a “trade multiplier” associated with production of final output in a specific supply chain. A chain is defined by the industry (and country) in which the good is finalised. The SCF ratio is different from, and complements, a wide set of other measures that capture the effects of cross-border production fragmentation. This literature is generally geared towards a characterisation of the (upstream or downstream) position of individual firms, industries or countries in global value chains and their value added contributions to trade, as reviewed in Johnson (2018). Instead, we focus on the total of trade flows in the overall supply chain. Importantly, and different from the other indicators, the SCF ratio is measured in volume terms. This novel feature makes it suitable for tracking real changes in fragmentation as it does not confound price changes for intermediates with changes in volumes. We show how the measure can be derived from a newly constructed set of world input–output tables expressed at previous year prices. Applying the data, we find that the pace of cross-border fragmentation slowed down after 2008 for most goods, but we find no evidence of a widespread reversal. Notable exceptions are supply chains of electronics and wearing apparel that required fewer imports in 2014 than in 2008. Supply chains of services continued to fragment internationally, also after 2009. In addition, we demonstrate the importance of using data on trade and production volumes alongside nominal values in analysing fragmentation trends over longer periods. Our second contribution is in embedding the SCF ratio in a within-between decomposition framework to account for the elasticity of trade to world GDP in the vein of Bems et al. (2010, 2011; BJY hereafter). The BJY framework assumes a fixed nominal input–output structure that allows for different levels of supply chain fragmentation across products, but ignores the effects of changes in fragmentation. This shortcut is suitable for their analysis of trade over short time periods, such as the global trade collapse of 2008/2009. It is less suited, however, for analysis over the longer run as substitution of intermediate inputs across and within countries will occur as a response to relative price movements, changes in trade policies as well as technological advances. The decompositions provided in BJY also had a residual that was not accounted for because of their use of fixed input–output structures. We show that this residual is sizeable in analyses of trade over longer periods and that it contains useful information on changes in fragmentation. Put otherwise, our decomposition is exact: the sum of the decomposition elements matches the actual trade data. We thus add to a stream of work that focuses on the role of supply chains in the dynamics of world trade (Yi 2003). This literature aims to explain the low elasticity of world trade to global GDP in recent years relative to its strong historical performance. Between 2012 and 2017, world trade barely kept pace with the volume growth of global GDP. A prolonged period of near unitary trade elasticities is exceptional, and has not been observed since the mid-1970s (Escaith and Miroudot 2015; Constantinescu et al. 2020). A large literature has tried to explain the decline in trade elasticity. Aslam et al. (2018) provide estimations of import demand functions (in the vein of Bussière et al. 2013) and simulations in a multi-country general equilibrium model (in the vein of Eaton et al. 2016). Their findings suggest an important role for asymmetric demand shocks, in particular as spending on investment goods declined in the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2008–2009. Investment spending is generally more trade-intensive than spending on services that are typically domestically produced. Fragmentation trends were also found to be important for global trade. Constantinescu et al. (2020) showed that the decline in the long-run trade elasticity in the 2000s correlates strongly with a waning pace of fragmentation (see also IMF 2016). In this paper, we provide for the first time a (nonparametric) decomposition framework that allows for a quantitative comparison of the effects of demand shocks as well as the pace of fragmentation of supply chains. We use our framework to analyse the decline in the world trade elasticity during the period from 2000 to 2014. The elasticity dropped from 2.16 points before the crisis (during 2000–2007) to 1.03 points after the crisis (during 2011–2014). We find that changes in final demand mix and in fragmentation trends both accounted for a sizeable part of this decline. Supply chain fragmentation (""within supply chain"" effects) boosted the global trade elasticity by 0.44 points before the crisis but only 0.05 points after. The declining pace of fragmentation thus accounted for more than a third of the decline in the trade elasticity: 0.39 (= 0.44–0.05) out of the 1.13 (= 2.16–1.03) points. Changes in final demand were also important for the high trade elasticity pre-crisis: global demand shifted in particular towards investment goods. This boosted trade in intermediates as these supply chains were more intensive in intermediates trade (""between supply chain"" effects), contributing 0.19 points to the trade elasticity pre-crisis. Increased trade in final products (“final trade effects”) contributed 0.54 points pre-crisis, in particular as local production was replaced by imports from China. Both effects petered out, contributing − 0.06 and 0.04 points, respectively, during 2011–2014. In conclusion, changes in the structure of global final demand no longer pushed the trade elasticity above one after the 2008–2009 crisis. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. In Sect. 2 we outline our new measure of supply chain fragmentation, and compare with related measures. In Sect. 3 we discuss data required for its measurement. Section 4 presents our findings on levels and trends in supply chain fragmentation. In Sect. 5 we present our accounting framework for the global trade elasticity. Section 6 provides empirical results. Section 7 concludes, arguing the need for joint analysis of final demand and fragmentation trends in future studies of world trade dynamics.",16

Davis,Dingqian Liu,Xuguang Simon Sheng,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Stock markets around the world cratered after mid-February 2020, as the coronavirus pandemic spread beyond China. Value-weighted prices dropped 40% from 17 February to 23 March in the advanced economies (Fig. 1). Emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) saw an even steeper drop. This period also exhibits historically high levels of intraday, daily and implied stock market volatilities against a backdrop of extreme economic uncertainty.Footnote 1 Globally, the market recovered more than half its losses from 23 March to late May. The US market recovered 73% of its losses by the end of May 2020 and 95% by 22 July.Footnote 2 Global stock prices, percent deviations from 17 February 2020. Notes: We plot the cumulative percent deviation in average equity prices from 17 February 2020 to the indicated dates. In computing averages, we weight each country’s deviation by its market capitalization on 31 December 2018. Before averaging, we linearly interpolate country-level values between nearest trading dates to fill in missing values. The sample for this figure contains 20 advanced economies (89% of overall market capitalization) and 14 EMDEs according to IMF’s classification. We omit China in this plot but show it separately below Recent stock market behavior is also remarkable in other respects. Using text-based methods to characterize the drivers of stock market jumps and volatility, Baker et al. (2020a) find that previous pandemics, including the Spanish Flu, had modest effects on the US market. In one exercise, they examine all 1143 daily US stock market moves greater than 2.5%, up or down, since 1900. Next-day newspaper accounts attribute not a single jump before 2020 to pandemic-related developments. In glaring contrast, newspapers attribute 24 of 27 daily US jumps between 24 February and 30 April 2020 to COVID-19 and policy responses.Footnote 3 Our first goal in this paper is to document some striking patterns in the temporal relationship of stock prices to economic activity in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. We do so by examining daily movements in national stock prices and economic activity in 35 countries around the world. Stock prices and workplace mobility (a proxy for economic activity) trace out clockwise paths in daily data from mid-February to late May 2020. Global stock prices fell 30% from 17 February to 12 March, before mobility declined. Over the next 11 days, stocks fell another 10 percentage points as mobility dropped 40%. From 23 March to 9 April, stocks recovered half their losses and mobility fell further. From 9 April to late May, mobility rose modestly and stocks recovered further. The same dynamic plays out across the vast majority of the 35 countries in our sample, with a few notable exceptions that we highlight and discuss.
 Common global dynamics are a pronounced feature of our data. Thus, we also ask whether national stock prices have predictive value for own-country economic activity in the early stages of the pandemic, conditional on global developments. They do. Another natural question is whether stock prices responded too slowly to information that presaged a pandemic-driven downturn. While we cannot rule out this possibility, we make several observations that suggest it was reasonable, as of early and mid-February 2020, for investors to anticipate a modest impact of COVID-19 on economic activity and asset prices. After establishing that stock prices foreshadowed the pandemic-related drop in economic activity, we ask whether the size of the market crash is proportionate to the pandemic’s prospective economic impact. We show that the market crash was many times larger than a standard asset-pricing model implies. In this light, the dramatic recovery of USA and global stock prices from late March onwards can be seen as correcting the market’s initial overreaction to news about fundamentals, as gauged by the implications of a standard model. We also consider China’s distinctive pandemic experience in comparison with that of the USA and in relation to countries with successful early-stage responses. Perhaps because COVID-19 erupted first in China, the dynamic between stock prices and mobility played out differently there. In particular, China experienced coincident drops in stock prices and mobility during the early phase of its pandemic recession. Unlike most other countries, our mobility measure for China returns to its pre-pandemic baseline by late April, and Chinese stock prices surpass pre-pandemic levels by the second half of April. We also show that the COVID-19 pandemic had much smaller effects on stock prices and return volatilities in China than in the USA. The US market shows greater sensitivity to pandemic-related developments well before it became evident that its early containment efforts would flounder. Using next-day newspaper accounts, we also classify the (perceived) reasons for large daily moves in Chinese stock markets from 1990 onwards. Before COVID-19, leading Chinese newspapers attribute not a single such move (out of hundreds) to pandemic developments or news about infectious diseases. From 2 January to 30 April 2020, Chinese newspapers attribute all 6 daily stock market moves greater than |3%| on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and all 8 daily moves greater than |3.8%| on the Hang Seng to the economic fallout of the pandemic or policy responses to it.Footnote 4 These results closely parallel findings in Baker et al. (2020a) for the USA, but the incidence of large daily moves in the US stock market during the coronavirus pandemic is about four times greater. Our study relates closely to a growing literature on the dynamics of stock prices, economic activity, and policy actions during the coronavirus pandemic. In addition to papers mentioned above, notable contributions include Caballero and Simsek (2021), Cox et al. (2020), Deb et al. (2020), Giglio et al. (2021), Gormsen and Koijen (2020), Landier and Thesmar (2020) and Zarembra et al. (2020).Footnote 5 Relative to this literature, we contribute in several ways: First, by documenting the predictive content of national stock prices for near-future economic activity in the early stages of the pandemic. Second, by showing that the market crash in reaction to the pandemic is too large to be rationalized by a standard asset-pricing model. Third, by developing several pieces of evidence on the distinctive character of the Chinese stock market reaction to the pandemic, highlighting both contrasts and similarities to the US case. Fourth, by identifying other countries with distinctively favorable early-pandemic experiences and contrasting key aspects of their COVID-19 policy responses to that of China.",9

Eichenbaum,Sergio Rebelo,Mathias Trabandt,Male,Male,Male,Male,"It is widely believed that the COVID epidemic disproportionately affected the economic well-being and health of poor people. Authors like Chetty et al. (2020) show that during the COVID recession employment fell the most for low-income workers. We show that there is a strong, robust correlation between pre-COVID measures of income inequality and COVID deaths across US states. This relation holds even when we control for differences in demography and access to health care. Taken together, these findings support the view that the COVID epidemic created more inequality in life and death. To interpret these statistical findings, we develop a quantitative model of the COVID epidemic. The model articulates a simple mechanism by which COVID exacerbated preexisting inequality in income and health. The basic idea is that low-wage workers are disproportionately employed in occupations that require a high level of social contact, making them susceptible to becoming infected. The demand for the types of goods produced by these workers fell dramatically relative to the goods produced by high-income workers. The net effect was that many low-wage workers lost their job. Those who retained their job were more likely to become infected than high-wage workers. An exacerbating factor is that low-wage workers, at least in the USA, have more limited access to high-quality health care than high-wage workers. In our model, these forces generate the strong, positive relation between ex-ante income inequality and COVID deaths observed in the data. A key challenge in designing our model is the requirement that it be consistent with the fact, documented by Chetty et al. (2020), that low-income workers suffered larger drops in employment than high-income workers but expenditures by low-income workers fell by  less than those of high-income workers. This task is challenging because conventional business cycle models generally embody strong consumption smoothing behavior.Footnote 1 The reason our model can account for these facts is as follows. The behavior of high-income people is governed by two key considerations. First, they are much less prone to becoming infected at work than low-income people. Second, they have a higher lifetime utility than low-income people which makes them more sensitive to the dangers of becoming infected through market activity. In conjunction with our other assumptions, these considerations imply that employment falls by less for high-income people than for low-income people. But high-income people cut their consumption by more than low-income people. The behavior of low-income people is governed by the following considerations. Consistent with the data, we assume that the goods produced by low-income people are more infectious that those produced by high-income people. So, the decline in consumption demand is concentrated in sectors that employ low-income people. As a result, the employment of low-income people falls disproportionately. Low-income people are closer to the subsistence level of consumption, so they reduce their consumption by less than high-income people. Moreover, consistent with the data, low-income people receive government transfers during the pandemic. Taken together, these forces imply that the employment of low-income people falls by more than that of high-income people, but their consumption falls by less. To articulate these mechanisms in a transparent way, we focus our analysis on the first wave of the epidemic (from March to July 2020). After the first wave, expectations about possible vaccinations and changes in fiscal policy associated with the presidential election arguably played a larger role in affecting people’s behavior. By focusing on the first wave, we are able to abstract from these complications. We show that our model is consistent with three key features of the data. First, it accounts reasonably well for COVID deaths during the first wave. Second, it accounts for the facts document by Chetty et al. (2020). Third, it accounts for the strong statistical relation between pre-COVID income inequality and COVID deaths that we document. We then turn to the question: How was inequality in life and death during the first wave of the epidemic affected by containment policies and government transfers to low-income people? According to our model, containment disproportionately reduced the employment and income of low-income workers, magnifying income disparities. Containment also dramatically reduced mortality rates for all income groups. Evidently, containment policies involve sharp trade-offs between health and income inequality. Turning to fiscal policy, we find that government transfers during the first wave of the epidemic increased employment and income of low-income workers, reducing income inequality. But it did not substantially increase the death toll from the epidemic. So, in the context of the COVID epidemic, government transfers do not involve sharp trade-offs between health and income inequality. To focus our analysis, we abstract from three important issues that have received extensive attention in the literature. The first is the impact of ethnicity and racial background per se on COVID infections and death (see, e.g., Benitez et al. 2020 Desmet and Wacziarg (2020) and McLaren 2020). The second is the impact of the COVID recession on gender equality (see, e.g., Alon et al. 2020; Jin et al. 2020). The third is the differential impact of COVID on young and old (see, e.g., Acemoglu et al. 2020; Brotherhood et al. 2020; Eichenbaum et al. 2020; Giagheddu and Papetti 2020 and Glover et al. 2020). The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the economics literature on the impact of the epidemic in models with heterogeneity. Section 3 contains the empirical evidence we use as the background for our analysis. Section 4 describes the model. Section 5 discusses the quantitative properties of our model and its implications for the impact of containment measures and fiscal transfers. Section 6 concludes.",7

The reasons why it started in Japan are not completely clear. Some have argued that it was a combination of limited natural resources, a lack of physical space to hold the inventories, and financial constraints that the Japanese industry faced at the end of the war.
Footnote 1 The cost reduction and efficiency gains of JIT became well known worldwide. Indeed, it became the standard of excellence in a short period of time and was adopted by many corporations. In fact, the globalization of the manufacturing of goods and services that started in the 1980s was, for the most part, inspired by JIT premises. Interestingly, even from the very beginning, Toyota suggested that the main risk of this strategy was its excessive reliance on suppliers – which could be less resilient and flexible than Toyota itself. Hence, a successful JIT implementation required a large emphasis on supplier development. Toyota argued that the JIT’s biggest weakness was this vulnerability.
 In response to those risks and seeking resilience, companies have explored other alternatives. These strategies, dubbed “just-in-case,” usually recommend actions such as larger inventories, diversification of the production network, and harmonization of parts. In the end, the advice is simple: to develop flexibility and redundancy in the supply chain. Regardless of all these efforts, the world’s supply chains proved to be unreliable during the COVID-19 pandemic. Either international trade frictions, quarantine restrictions, large shifts in demand (such as protective equipment), or even panic demand purchases of some products (such as toilet paper and disinfectant wipes in the USA) highlighted the fragility of supply chains in the world. As a result, many countries experienced supply disruptions for various products during the pandemic. We believe this collapse is due to a design flaw: While the just-in-case approach might be appropriate for idiosyncratic shocks, it seems to have failed in the presence of an aggregate shock.
 Many have argued that the solution is to have greater resilience and robustness.
Footnote 2 However, what exactly does it mean to have a robust supply chain? How does it differ from assuming a more severe shock? In this paper, we argue that a robust supply chain is one that addresses uncertainty instead of risk. The presence of uncertainty requires a decision maker to solve a minimax optimization problem, in which they optimize the worst case of a set of outcomes – see, for instance, Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989) for an axiomatic treatment. In this sense, robustness means more than just assuming larger shocks; it means considering the worst possible outcome of a set of models; it means shifting to “Just-in-Worst-Case.”
 In this paper, we present a very simple model. It introduces the idea that, in the pursuit of efficiency, a decentralized supply chain could become vulnerable to aggregate shocks. In other words, our setup reflects the well-known trade-off between efficiency and robustness. In particular, a design with greater resilience to shocks will sacrifice efficiency during normal times. We are interested in understanding the consequences of natural disasters, environmental shocks, and pandemics on the global supply chain. These shocks tend to be substantial and infrequent, but also widespread – affecting many countries and regions at the same time. Just-in-case’s standard supply chain analysis studies firms facing large, frequent idiosyncratic shocks with known distribution. We study a different problem, one in which the shocks are infrequent, aggregate, and with unknown distribution. The simple model analyzes the survival of a multinational firm that purchases from small global suppliers. The suppliers decide where to locate, and locations are subject to aggregate shocks – which for simplicity are correlated with location.
Footnote 3 We compare two types of global supply chain arrangements and two different types of shocks. First, the small suppliers individually decide their location, and the multinational purchases the surviving suppliers’ products. Second, we study the case when the multinational can choose all its suppliers’ locations, thereby internalizing the location decision (i.e., the suppliers are subsidiaries of the multinational firm). From the perspective of the shocks, we compare the situation of risk versus uncertainty through two settings of random aggregate shocks. In the first case, we assume the distribution is given, while in the second case, only the distribution’s support is known.
 Our setup replicates many well-known results: just-in-time, a multinational internalizing an externality, etc. The purpose of reproducing those results is to compare them to the strategy implied by robust control. The robust strategy is in the spirit of a behavioral result known in psychology as probability matching. A rational individual facing a choice between two options should always choose the option with the higher payoff probability. For example, consider an individual with two choices: Option A delivers one dollar 70% of the time (zero otherwise), while option B pays one dollar only 30% of the time (and zero otherwise). A rational agent should choose option A in all instances – whether they are playing once or many times. However, experimental research has shown that this is not the case. When participants are faced with a series of these choices, they often choose by replicating the probabilities. In other words, they would pick option A 70% of the time and option B 30% of the time. Hence, the strategy is called probability matching. Several possible explanations of this phenomenon have been offered. First, one may describe the behavior as irrational. Another explanation appeals to bounded rationality. Intuitively, because it is costly for humans to process information, they will recur to heuristics when making decisions.
Footnote 4 A heuristic allows for a fast resolution and in fact replicates many of the (seemingly) irrational behaviors observed in sports and gambling. For example – the fallacy that an event must occur because it has not happened for a while: “a coin has flipped four heads in a row, it is very unlikely that another one will occur,” or thinking that a batter will get a hit because they have failed to do so for a while. In this case, the heuristic is to match the decision to the representativeness of choices. The last explanation for probability matching comes from evolutionary psychology.
Footnote 5 Observation of foraging species documents that the allocation of individuals matches the distribution of resources and that this behavior maximizes the survival probability of the species while also reducing the possibility that competing species invade the resource.
Footnote 6 In this paper, we present a model in which a fully rational agent who is ambiguity averse and internalizes the survival probability will replicate the probability matching behavior.
 Our basic model has two locations: the Mountain and the Valley.
Footnote 7 The two locations differ only in the probability that an aggregate shock hits. We will assume the shock is extreme, such that all suppliers in the affected location perish.
Footnote 8 Without loss of generality, we also assume that the shock is more likely to occur in the Mountain than in the Valley. Formally, if an aggregate shock occurs in our model, then the conditional probability of the shock affecting the Mountain (or the Valley) will be \(\theta\) (or \(1-\theta\)), where \(\theta >1/2\). Each supplier produces a single unit, or a “part.” Both the cost of production and the sell price per part are held constant: in both locations, for all producers, and in any state of the world. In particular, the prices are independent of both the realization of the aggregate shock, and the number of surviving suppliers.
Footnote 9 However, in canonical macroeconomic and international models, this would not be the case. The demand is usually chosen such that when quantities tend to zero, prices increase and can even tend to infinity. Models based on Cobb–Douglas or CES functions have this feature, and the pricing system reflects scarcity. Nonetheless, if firms are concerned about the consequences of increasing their prices after natural disasters, or there is a law that does not allow prices to increase after such an event, then the price required to achieve the efficient allocation may never be realized. If this were known ex-ante, then it would affect the willingness of suppliers to diversify into risky locations. Our model takes an extreme assumption – prices are fixed – to capture this feature of regulations and institutions. Moreover, below we include some anecdotal evidence of law enforcement and consumers’ negative reactions to price gouging during the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of suppliers grows and depends on the number of surviving suppliers. We treat each suppliers’ part as a different intermediate good, and the multinational purchases as many parts as possible to sell the final product internationally. The product is more desirable the more parts it has – but it can be manufactured with a subset of the parts. This setting is equivalent to assume that the quality of the item increases with the number of parts it has.
Footnote 10 The parameters in the model are such that each supplier’s location decision has a dominant strategy, which is not collectively optimal when the probability of global survival is taken into account. This discrepancy comes from the inability of the pricing system to compensate firms properly for moving into the Mountain. In this setting, the multinational wants to ensure its suppliers survive. Putting this differently, the multinational cares about survival, while the suppliers do not. This difference implies that the multinational might be willing to set production facilities in the Mountain to insure itself against an aggregate shock in the Valley. This part of the model captures a simple externality and the need for a diversified supply chain, but not yet a robust one. This is where the nature of the shock matters. When the shocks have known distributions – what is known as risk or the nominal model – the multinational will exhibit behavior that takes into account all the sources of risk. This setting implies a desire for diversification, and one of the implications, for example, is that the multinational’s optimal allocation of firms to the Mountain depends on the number of suppliers that have survived. There is both a marginal benefit and cost of diversification, and in general, an internal solution is found (at least under our assumptions). The multinational’s policy changes dramatically when the shock has bounded uncertainty – meaning that the distribution is unknown – in the robust model. In this setting, an ambiguity-averse multinational will perform a robust control optimization. As we will see, with sufficient uncertainty the optimal allocation of firms is independent of the number of surviving firms. The robust supply chain decision, therefore, looks very different from the nominal model. This paper includes several theoretical results worth highlighting. First, we compare the centralized and decentralized solutions to the model. We show a corner solution of the decentralized allocation (all firms locate themselves in the Valley) – exposing the multinational to an aggregate shock to the Valley. This result contrasts with the internal solution (a proportion larger than zero of firms in the Mountain) of the centralized allocation. Individual suppliers maximize efficiency (or productivity), while the multinational maximizes survival. This result is known and simple to understand – the multinational internalizes the survival externality. Second, we study the implications of risk and uncertainty in the probability distribution of the aggregate shock. We depart from the assumption of the first part of our paper: that the value of \(\theta\), the conditional probability that the aggregate shock affects the Mountain, is known. We first study what occurs when \(\theta\) is risky; for example, we assume it is distributed between \([ {\bar{\theta }}-\Delta , {\bar{\theta }}+\Delta ]\) according to some a priori known distribution. This exercise represents a risky setup – the nominal model. We compare it to the uncertain setup where the multinational only knows that \(\theta \in [ {\bar{\theta }}-\Delta , {\bar{\theta }}+\Delta ]\), but the distribution is unknown. This is the case of uncertainty, and the optimal control problem requires a robust approach. Being averse to ambiguity, the individual suppliers and the multinational maximize the expected profit assuming the worst-case value of \(\theta\). For example, if \({\bar{\theta }}>1/2\) but the support of \(\theta\) contains 1/2, then the optimal robust control will optimize as if \(\theta = 1/2\). The diversification resulting from robust control replicates probability matching and is very different from the diversification obtained in a traditional expected utility maximization problem with large variance or risk aversion. In traditional supply chain literature of just-in-time and just-in-case, most of the analysis concentrates on idiosyncratic shocks of suppliers. As a result, building a supply chain with a precisely calculated amount of inventory can maximize efficiency and profit. Since the COVID-19 outbreak and the consequently supply chain disruptions, it is evident that aggregate shock on macroeconomic situation matters. In macroeconomics, the analysis of aggregate shock relies heavily on mathematical models, which are subject to modeling assumptions and model calibrations. Recently, some macroeconomic research starts to consider model uncertainty and robustness.
Footnote 11 With model uncertainty, robust decision rules seek to maximize the payoff in the worst-case scenario of a set of potential models.
 This modeling choice is also supported by theoretical and empirical literature in ambiguity aversion. Ambiguity aversion refers to the behavioral phenomenon where people prefer variations with known distribution over unknown distribution. This phenomenon can be explained by people maximizing their utility for the worst-case scenario when the distribution is unknown, as in Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989). Since global supply chain disruptions have catastrophic impacts on social welfare, and the probability of such disruptions is not accurately known, uncertainty and robust decision rules are the proper tools for analysis and policy recommendations. In our case, the diversification implied by robust decision rules is very different from the diversification that could be obtained in a standard risk-averse model by either increasing the variance or the risk aversion to infinity. Finally, we study what happens when prices and costs of production differ across locations. We compare three settings for the global supply chain: (i) the decentralized myopic setting that always chooses a corner solution, except when prices and costs are at the knife-edge when the value of both locations is the same; (ii) the probability matching heuristic where the allocation of firms coincides with the probabilities of survival in each location; and (iii) the optimal allocation by the multinational. We show that the decentralized solution can replicate the centralized solution when the value in the Mountain is equal to the value in the Valley. Our model justifies why governmental subsidies can help the decentralized economy achieve a robust solution. Our discussion was motivated by Japan’s policy actions during the summer of 2020, where Japan set up a fund to compensate firms that diversify out of China.
Footnote 12 Of course, the decision could have been driven by political aspects not considered in this paper, but our model at least rationalizes economically why such an industrial policy makes sense. For each simple model, we draw policy implications motivated by the recent experience with the pandemic. Summarized in the end, all of these policy implications have a simple message: Robustness is under-supplied. This paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 introduces some empirical evidence of supply shocks and price gouging restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Section 3 presents our simple model of optimal control of a supply chain, with accompanying simulations. In Sect. 4, we introduce risk and uncertainty and discuss the differences between the optimal solutions of these settings. Next, Sect. 5 studies the impact of different costs in the Mountain and the Valley, and finally, Sect. 7 concludes with policy implications and future research. Probability Matching Our model provides a control problem rationalization of probability matching. When a game similar to ours is presented to individuals, experiments show that individuals tend to locate at the Valley roughly with probability \(\theta\), and locate at the Mountain roughly with probability \(1-\theta\). This experimental result is known as probability matching in the literature.
Footnote 13 Many different theoretical approaches to behavior are developed to explain this phenomenon that humans prefer probability matching over rational expected utility maximization. Some early work suggests that it is a behavioral limitation due to bounded rationality, but more recent literature attributes that to learning strategies. Vulkan (2000) and Gaissmaier and Schooler (2008) argue that people would consistently try to learn patterns of the outcome series in a repeated game even when they are informed that the series is completely i.i.d. As a result, if the outcome series is truly i.i.d. as many of the earlier models assume, then probability matching seems irrational. On the other hand, if there is, in fact, a pattern in the series, probability matching claims a higher expected reward in the long run by gradually learning the patterns. Other literature suggests that probability matching is related to the growth pattern of a group of individuals. For example, Brennan and Lo (2011) conclude that if two choices result in similar growth rates, then deterministic decision rule prevails. On the other hand, if two choices result in drastically different growth rates, then probability matching gives an evolutionary advantage over the deterministic decision rules. In our model, the intuition of the mechanism is simple: What is individually optimal is not collectively optimal. The reason is that the survival of firms in our model has a global externality from the inability of firms to coordinate – the increase in the number of firms that could produce – that given our setup the decentralized market does not take into account. When the multinational solves the model, however, it internalizes this effect, and it forces firms to do something that looks locally irrational. As said before, locating firms in the Mountain provides insurance to the multinational when an aggregate shock to the Valley takes place. That insurance is extremely valuable when uncertainty is present. Supply Chain The literature on the supply chain is extensive and impossible to summarize in a few paragraphs. There are, however, aspects that have been discussed in the literature that are relevant to the model we present here. Aggregate shocks like COVID-19 has a significant implication of global supply chain risk management. Earlier empirical research describes this as supply chain flexibility, see Vickery et al. (1999). That paper defines flexibility as the ability to adapt to aggregate shocks. It shows through correlation analysis that supply chain flexibility is critical to the long-run survival of an organization. On the other hand, flexibility may affect the immediate competitiveness of the firm in the short run. The vulnerability of the global supply chain to identical suppliers has already raised some concerns in the industry. Wagner and Bode (2006) studied questionnaires from company executives in Germany and concludes that a firm’s dependence on single-type customers and suppliers is the largest contributor to a firm’s exposure to supply chain risk. In recent years, the question of whether to integrate suppliers or not has been receiving more and more attention to supply management. The existing empirical literature has been studying this issue by looking at the elasticity of substitution of produces, see Antràs and Chor (2013) and Alfaro et al. (2019). When the demand for the final product is elastic, and inputs are not substitutable, firms choose not to integrate upstream suppliers. On the other hand, when the demand for the final product is inelastic, and inputs are substitutable, firms choose to integrate upstream suppliers. This finding shows that firms’ supply chain decisions are optimal for the deterministic case, but not necessarily when an aggregate shock hits. Apart from the works highlighted above, two groups of the literature align with the spirit of this paper. First, there is ample literature discussing the organization of the supply chain. Following Antràs (2020), global supply chains can be viewed through different lenses. First, the value-added approach where firms allocate production internationally, and each stage of production contributes to the final product. In general, this literature concentrates on countries and industries as the unit of analysis. Second, the firm-level perspective – started by Melitz (2003) – offers an alternative to the aggregate view of the first approach. In this literature, the firms are the unit of analysis, and they are the ones that decide whether or not to participate in global supply chains. Both of these approaches assume there is no informational problem. This is relaxed by the relational view of supply chains. In this view, firms and suppliers face contracting problems – moral hazard or incomplete contracts – and therefore enter in relation to solve the informational problem. The main question it addresses is the organizational structure of the firm. The boundary of the firm in the global supply chain started with the seminal contribution of Antras (2003). The author discusses how incomplete contracts determine whether a firm should be integrated internationally versus enter into arms-length negotiations.
Footnote 14 Finally, Yeaple (2003) studies the vertical and horizontal integration of multinationals. Second, the literature on supply resilience highlights that resilience can be obtained by organizational robustness or organizational flexibility. See, for instance, Ambulkar et al. (2015), Töyli et al. (2013), Zhao and You (2019), Saenz et al. (2015), Durach and Machuca (2018), Helpman et al. (2004), and the references therein. Most of this literature, however, has two features. One is very related to our model – the literature advises that a robust supply chain can be achieved by working closely with the suppliers. In the spirit of our model, that is equivalent to when the multinational decides the global allocation problem. The second aspect is that most of these papers think about the robustness of a supply chain in response to shocks to the firms – i.e., the robustness to idiosyncratic shocks.",9

Tax increases and spending cuts aimed at reducing soaring government budget deficits, but in many cases they exacerbated losses in household incomes, undermining fiscal stabilization effects. This paper is the first to investigate the effects of fiscal expansions during the Great Recession and subsequent fiscal consolidation measures (often labeled “austerity”) in Europe on automatic stabilizers. In the post-COVID-19 recovery, public debt levels have risen again all throughout Europe, and monetary policy is near or at the zero lower bound. In this situation the right balance between fiscal support for the economy and fiscal consolidation is again of key importance (McKay and Reis 2016; Blanchard and Summers 2020). Automatic stabilizers are those elements of the tax and transfer system that mitigate fluctuations in output without discretionary government action. Previous work on automatic stabilizers has mostly relied on macro data (see, e.g., Fatás and Mihov 2001; in’t Veld et al. 2013; Di Maggio and Kermani 2016) or structural models (McKay and Reis 2016). Traditional approaches based on macro data typically used aggregate variables on government revenue and spending as proxies for automatic stabilizers.Footnote 1 However, these variables are endogenous to changes in household incomes as tax payments decrease (for a given progressive tax system) or (unemployment) benefits increase when households earn lower incomes or become unemployed. To circumvent the problem of endogeneity, we follow the approach of Auerbach and Feenberg (2000) and Dolls et al. (2012) in using micro data and counterfactual simulation techniques for our analysis of automatic stabilizers.Footnote 2 Specifically, we analyze how changes in tax-benefit systems over the period 2007–2014 have affected the workings of automatic stabilizers in the EU member states. Our analysis allows to disentangle automatic effects from those that take place after explicit government legislature (discretionary policy changes). This is important in order to assess the shock-absorption capacity of the tax and transfer system and the interaction between discretionary policy measures and automatic stabilizers. We build on the income stabilization coefficient proposed by Dolls et al. (2012), which is an extension of the normalized tax change (Pechman 1973, 1987; Auerbach and Feenberg 2000). Following Dolls et al. (2012), this measure of the stabilizing effect of the tax and transfer system is calculated for a stylized proportional shock of 5 percent to household gross incomes (income shock). The shock is the same in all countries and affects all households equally, thus enabling us to construct a comparable measure across countries.Footnote 3 We compute how direct taxes, social insurance contributions as well as transfers change in response to the simulated income change. Relating the change in taxes and benefits to the income change yields the income stabilization coefficient under constant policy as a measure of automatic stabilization. In addition, we propose and derive a novel measure the income stabilization coefficient under time-varying policy that indicates to what extent governments let automatic stabilizers play out taking discretionary changes of the tax-benefit system into account. Our results show that automatic stabilizers are heterogeneous across EU countries. Income stabilization coefficients range from 20 to 30 percent in some Eastern and Southern European countries to around 60 percent in Belgium, Germany, and Denmark. Changes in tax-benefit systems in recent years have led to a slight reduction in the dispersion of income stabilization coefficients. That is, countries with relatively low (high) stabilization coefficient in 2007 tended to be more likely to raise (reduce) taxes and social insurance contributions. Our analysis shows further that automatic stabilizers could operate freely in the early phase of the financial and economic crisis. Notable exceptions are Ireland and Estonia where the functioning of automatic stabilizers was hampered by discretionary policy changes. Automatic stabilizers have been constrained in several EU countries by subsequent fiscal consolidation measures. Especially in countries like Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, the counter-cyclical effect of automatic stabilizers has been partly or completely offset by pro-cyclical benefit cuts or tax hikes, in particular during the euro-area debt crisis. A comparison of our estimates of automatic stabilizers inherent in tax-benefit systems with changes in the cyclically adjusted budget balance reveals that micro-based estimates provide more precise information about the degree of household income stabilization. In Ireland (2009) and Spain (2013), for example, tax-benefit reforms and other budgetary measures had opposite cyclical properties. We make four contributions to the literature. First, we extend the work of Dolls et al. (2012), who assess the effectiveness of automatic stabilizers for 19 EU countries, by using more recent data and a larger set of countries and policy years. Second, we analyze the effects of tax-benefit policy changes on automatic stabilizers over time during and after the Great Recession.Footnote 4 Third, we make a methodological contribution by introducing the income stabilization coefficient under time-varying policy to shed light on the effects of discretionary policy changes on household income stabilization. This new measure takes into account that the actual stabilization provided by the tax-benefit system can be weaker (stronger) than in steady state if tax hikes or cuts in benefits (tax reductions or benefit extensions) coincide with macroeconomic shocks. It may provide important information for governments designing fiscal consolidation policies as macroeconomic effects of changes in the tax-benefit system may differ from other fiscal policy measures such as cutting government consumption. Fourth, our paper provides new evidence on the relationship between our micro-based estimates of automatic stabilizers and more conventional macro measures which are used in the EU fiscal governance framework (Mourre et al. 2014). We show whether and to what extent automatic stabilizers in the tax-benefit system could operate freely over the period under consideration and that this information cannot be inferred from cyclically adjusted budget balances. We therefore conclude that micro-based estimates provide valuable complementary information to macroeconomic indicators. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical framework. In Sect. 3 we discuss the data and our empirical approach. Section 4 presents the results and Sect. 5 concludes.",1

Proponents of a so-called global financial cycle, beginning with Rey (2013), argue that the observed cross-country co-movement in asset prices cannot be fully explained by co-movement in real variables alone and therefore must have a finance-specific component to it, such as some measure of global risk aversion. Others, such as Cerutti et al. (2017), argue against the very notion of a ‘global financial cycle’. Within that debate, there is an asset class that stands out from the rest: exchange rates. Being relative prices, the scope for them to co-move at the global level is limited by construction. Moreover, the relationship between exchange rate movements and overall financial conditions in a country is not a priori obvious, as a given exchange rate move can have heterogeneous effects across different sectors. For example, an exchange rate depreciation can ‘tighten’ access to finance for agents with net balance sheets exposures in foreign currency (as their net worth falls and interest payments become more expensive in domestic currency terms), while ‘loosening’ access for exporters (as their external demand prospects improve). Against this backdrop, we study how different exchange rates co-move with global financial conditions. Given that exchange rates typically exhibit ‘fat tails’ (i.e. non-negligible chances of a large depreciation and/or appreciation), we put a special emphasis on studying such occurrences, which are of great importance to both policy makers concerned about financial stability and investors seeking ways to quantify the value-at-risk of their strategies. In order to do so, and unlike most of the existing literature, we go beyond mean-based approaches and instead study the behaviour of the entire distribution of different currencies’ returns in the face of changes in global financial conditions. We begin by constructing a new measure of global financial conditions, a principal component-based index that has two main advantages over existing alternatives. First, it is truly ‘global’ in nature, drawing from financial asset prices in more than 40 countries. Second, the within-country coverage across asset classes is broad, including information from a range of public and private spreads as well as equity markets. The resulting index closely co-moves with a number of other commonly used proxies such as the VIX or the indices proposed by Miranda-Agrippino and Rey (2015), Bekaert et al. (forthcoming) and Chari et al. (2020), among others, but its ability to fit the tail behaviour of exchange rates is typically somewhat better. Nevertheless, many of our key results still hold when using proxies of global financial conditions previously studied in the literature, and reinforced when such proxies are used jointly with the one we propose. We then study the co-movement with global financial conditions of a broad set of currencies. Our point of departure are ‘market narratives’ and earlier contributions (Ranaldo and Soderlind 2010; Habib and Stracca 2012, among others) that typically label currencies as ‘safe havens’ or ‘risky’, depending on their performance in the face of a tightening of global financial conditions. For example, the Japanese yen (JPY) is typically regarded as a ‘safe haven’ currency as it tends to appreciate on such occasions, while the Australian dollar (AUD) tends to depreciate, and is therefore typically placed in the ‘risky’ camp. In this paper, we go beyond this narrative characterisation and provide a quantification of the (tail) risks facing particular currencies under different scenarios for global financial conditions. In order to provide quantitative insights, we exploit several novel possibilities afforded by quantile regression (Koenker and Bassett 1978). Figure 1 shows the typical output of our regressions for the JPY and AUD, with quantile-specific coefficients in blue and standard regression coefficients in black. The two panels show the very different effects of a one standard deviation tightening in global financial conditions on the two currencies: for the JPY, most of the conditional distribution shifts to the right, increasing the chances of an appreciation, while the pattern for the AUD indicates an increased risk of a sharp depreciation. Moreover, the pattern of quantile coefficients highlights that the strongest effects are concentrated in the tails of the two distributions, which tends to hold across our panel of currencies, and is a feature that cannot be uncovered using standard regression. These estimates allow us to provide interesting insights, such as the shift in the probability of a currency experiencing a depreciation/appreciation of a given magnitude in the face of different scenarios for global financial conditions. So for example, when global financial conditions tighten by one standard deviation, the chance of the AUD experiencing a depreciation of 2.5-5% increases by 5 p.p., while the corresponding chance of a similar appreciation for the JPY increases by 7 p.p. (see Table 4). One practical application is the ability to assess the extent to which some of the large currency moves observed at the height of the COVID-19 crisis were ‘warranted’ by the concomitant tightening in global financial conditions (see Sect. 3.4). We also propose intuitive metrics for cross-currency comparisons and rankings based on tail behaviour. Impact of global financial conditions on the conditional quantiles of exchange rate returns, JPY and AUD. Note The figure shows the coefficients resulting from estimating our baseline specification for the Japanese yen and the Australian dollar (separately). The blue lines plot the values of \(\beta _h(\tau )\) across quantiles, while the black lines show OLS estimates of the same specification. Light blue areas are 68% confidence intervals are computed from 1000 overlapping block bootstrap draws. (Color figure online) We also revisit the existing literature on the macro-financial determinants of currency behaviour (see Fratzscher 2009 and Habib and Stracca 2012, among others) in light of our expanded focus on the tails. Specifically, we conduct portfolio sorting exercises based on several macroeconomic fundamentals, and study the responses of the resulting returns series to a tightening in global financial conditions to identify potential macro-financial risk factors associated with different currencies’ tail behaviour. This methodology allows both to introduce a degree of time variation in the exposure of currencies to a given risk factor and to estimate the effect of these risks from the entire cross section of currencies in our sample. We find that currencies of countries displaying high interest rates, low levels of international reserves, larger fiscal deficits, lower current account balances and smaller net foreign asset positions display a significantly higher likelihood of depreciating in response to a tightening in global financial conditions. However, only the first three of those risk factors are associated with a larger ‘crash risk’.Footnote 1 This exercise also yields a simple tabular mapping from changes in risk factors to shifts in currencies’ tail risks. For example, a country that experiences an 8.2 p.p. increase in its interest rate differential with respect to the rest of the world should see approximately a 25 p.p. increase in the probability of its currency depreciating by more than 2.5% in the event of a sharp tightening of global financial conditions. For practitioners, our results provide further empirical motivation for a close scrutiny of the identified risk factors when assessing countries’ financial stability prospects and the risks of investment strategies. Our paper is related to several literature strands. First, and most directly, it is related to papers that study the occurrence of tail events in exchange rate markets. On the negative returns side, there is a large literature that documents the existence of ‘crash’ or ‘disaster’ risk in popular FX strategies. Brunnermeier et al. (2009) find that carry trade strategies perform particularly poorly during periods of heightened risk aversion (as proxied by the VIX index), while Menkhoff et al. (2012) show similar results but focusing on periods of high FX volatility. Relatedly, Farhi and Gabaix (2016) and Farhi et al. (2009) study disaster risk embedded in option prices. In principle, the poor performance of carry trades could be the result of both a sharp depreciation of high-interest-rate currencies and/or a sharp appreciation of low-interest-rate currencies. In that vein, some papers study the dynamics of particular currencies, namely those usually labelled as safe havens, which, according to market narratives, tend to appreciate sharply during periods of high risk aversion. Ranaldo and Soderlind (2010) and Habib and Stracca (2012) study the safe haven property of a series of currencies, and do indeed find robust evidence of substantial appreciation during periods of market stress. Fratzscher (2009) also looks at the dynamics of individual currencies under stress conditions in the context of the global financial crisis. A common feature of these papers is that their empirical strategies focus on the (conditional) mean returns of currencies or trading strategies. In contrast, our approach allows for a detailed study of the entire distribution of exchange rate returns, including the tails, which are at the core of our analysis. Moreover, we propose a novel way of characterising periods of heightened (global) risk aversion, avoiding popular but imperfect proxies (e.g. the VIX index), or FX-based proxies which can become somewhat circular (e.g. FX volatility). Moreover, we study a large panel of exchange rates, facilitating a direct analysis of particular currencies. The paper is also part of a recent wave of contributions drawing on insights from quantile regression, originally introduced in economics by Koenker and Bassett (1978), in both macroeconomics and finance. These include Cenedese et al. (2014) for exchange rates, Gaglianone and Lima (2012) for unemployment, Korobilis (2017) for inflation, Crump et al. (2018) for equity returns, Eguren-Martin et al. (2020) and Gelos et al. (2019) for capital flows, among several others. Most closely related to our study, Adrian et al. (2019) rely on quantile regression to characterise the tails of the GDP growth distribution conditional on domestic financial conditions.Footnote 2 We build on similar ideas, but focus instead on the distribution of exchange rate returns conditional on global financial conditions, with many parallels to the analysis of capital flows’ push factors in Eguren-Martin et al. (2020). The last strand of literature we draw and build on deals with measurement of financial conditions. We follow Arregui et al. (2018) in constructing country-specific financial condition indices that exploit a broad set of market-based indicators for a large panel of countries, which then allows us to extract a global financial conditions index. This exercise is related to earlier attempts to characterise a ‘global financial cycle’, most notably by Miranda-Agrippino and Rey (2015), but in the finance literature it also overlaps with various proposals to measure global risk aversion and other factors commonly used to price exchange rate rates (see e.g. Menkhoff et al. (2012) and Lustig et al. (2011)).Footnote 3 More recent attempts to characterise financial conditions drawing from a range of different financial instruments include Chari et al. (2020) and Bekaert et al. (forthcoming). The rest of the paper is organised as follows: in Sect. 2, we describe our measure of global financial conditions. In Sect. 3 we discuss quantile regressions of nominal effective exchange rate returns on global financial conditions. In Sect. 4 we introduce a currency portfolio sorting approach based on macroeconomic fundamentals that allows us to identify potential factors associated with currencies’ differential tail behaviour. In Sect. 5 we run a series of robustness checks on our results. In Sect. 6 we conclude, while the Appendix includes details about our data and methodology. An online appendix provides additional results and robustness checks.",

Evidence from Tele-workability Measures Across Countries,September 2022,Mariya Brussevich,Era Dabla-Norris,Salma Khalid,Female,Female,Female,Female,"Social distancing policies implemented to contain the COVID-19 pandemic affected a large share of workers across the world. Millions of workers lost employment and countless jobs remain at risk as variants of the virus keeping economies from fully reopening.Footnote 1 Workers in occupations requiring physical presence in the workplace or whose jobs  require a high level of personal proximity have limited scope for working from home. Some of these workers face commensurately higher risk of reduction in hours or pay, temporary furloughs, or permanent layoffs. On the other hand, the pandemic accelerated the shift toward a hybrid workplace—a mixture of in-office and remote work— that provides more flexibility to both employers and employees. Which jobs are most at risk? How does the level of “tele-workability” depend on worker characteristics, such as age, educational attainment, gender, employment status, and earnings? Which jobs are more likely to benefit from hybrid work arrangements going forward? How does the feasibility to work remotely vary across advanced and emerging economies? Answers to these questions can inform the social protection and labor market policies needed to support workers both during and after the pandemic and curb rising income inequality. We construct a new index of “tele-workability” for 35 advanced and emerging market economies using a task-based approach. We use two sources of data to develop a measure of tele-workability: occupation-level classification of feasibility of working from home derived by Dingel and Neiman (2020) for the United States (US) and individual-level data from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) produced by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD 2016). The latter has the advantage of measuring task or skill content at the worker level for a large sample of countries. Our estimation approach relies on an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to map occupation-level measures of the feasibility of working at home to individual-level observations in the PIAAC dataset and derive predicted tele-workability scores for each worker. Individual-level scores allow us to conduct a more nuanced analysis of worker characteristics at the task level for a large group of countries. Given that PIAAC surveys are representative at the national level, we are able to capture differences in the ability to telework that are driven by underlying differences in job tasks, sectoral mix, demographic composition, and access to technologies necessary for teleworking across countries. We find that workers least likely to work remotely are concentrated in the sectors hit hardest by the crisis (ILO 2020): accommodation and food services, transportation, and retail and wholesale sectors. Vulnerable workers tend to be young, without a college education, in less secure work arrangements (e.g., in part-time employment), and employed in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Workers at the bottom of the earnings distribution are most at risk of earnings loss, suggesting that the COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated inequality. Cross-country heterogeneity reflects differences in the structure of production (e.g., size of manufacturing versus services sectors), use of technology, and occupational selection, and thus differential distribution of workers across jobs. Workers in emerging market economies are likely to face significant challenges during strict lockdowns given limited access to technology. Interestingly, differences in earnings and the ability to work remotely are less stark for those at the top and bottom of the earning distribution in emerging market economies compared to some advanced economies. This paper contributes to the literature examining workers’ ability to perform their jobs from home and the labor market consequences. Evidence from the US (Dingel and Neiman 2020; Mongey et al. 2021; Hensvik et al. 2020) and several advanced European countries (Boeri et al. 2020; Fadinger and Schymik 2020; Office of National Statistics 2020) suggests that about 40% of jobs can be performed at home, ranging from 24% in Italy to 42% in Germany.Footnote 2 In developing economies, up to 20% of urban population can work from home (Saltiel 2020; Gottlieb et al. 2020); this number is much smaller if rural populations are taken into account. These studies, with the exception of Saltiel (2020), use occupation-level data to examine labor market implications of social distancing policies. A drawback of this approach is that it assumes that tasks performed within occupations across countries, sectors, firms, and individuals are identical. Under this assumption, differences in levels of tele-workability across countries only stem from variation in the occupational distribution. In this paper, we go beyond occupational classifications of feasibility of teleworking and leverage information on  specific job tasks and socio-economic characteristics of workers, using comparable data for a large set of countries. A common approach in the literature that examines cross-country differences in the feasibility of working from home is to apply the index developed by Dingel and Neiman (2020) at the 6-digit SOC level using Occupational Information Network (O*NET) survey data from the US to 1- or 2-digit ISCO occupational level for other countries. This methodology assumes that all narrowly defined occupations within the single-digit occupational classifications have the same level of tele-workability which can substantially over- or under-state the level of tele-workability for a given individual. However, differences in tele-workability levels within a given occupation across countries depend crucially on the task content of  work and the level of access to and use of information and communication technologies (ICT). Since our estimation approach accounts for heterogeneity of worker tasks within a given occupation, it sidesteps the assumption of equal tele-workability scores within each broadly defined occupation. For instance, compared to Gottlieb et al. (2020) who find that over 70% of managers and professionals can work from home when only occupation-level tele-workability is considered, we show that these occupations have a significantly lower level of tele-workability at about 42% when worker-level differences within occupations are accounted for. Our paper is related to studies using worker-level data, including Saltiel (2020), Espinoza and Reznikova (2020), Hatayama et al. (2020), and Gottlieb et al. (2021). Our methodology and sample are most closely related to Espinoza and Reznikova (2020) and Hatayama et al. (2020) who also use worker-level data from the PIAAC survey to create indices of tele-workability. Our methodology has advantages over these studies since we use a richer set of information to derive our index for the PIAAC country sample. First, our approach relies on a broader set of variables at the worker level, accounting for not only work tasks but also differences in workers’ education, income, gender, age, and immigration status. These demographic characteristics have meaningful implications for the division of work responsibilities between individuals in similar occupations which can be teased out using the EM algorithm. Second, while we leverage the work task variables from the PIAAC survey in a similar fashion as these papers, we capture a wider range of tasks. One key drawback of the PIAAC survey is the limited coverage of physical tasks.Footnote 3 The intensity of physical work, however, is a critical determinant of ability to telework since such work is less likely to be carried out remotely. The O*NET data used by Dingel and Neiman (2020) include a wider range of questions to capture information on work responsibilities related to physical work, interpersonal interaction, and the use of specialized equipment pertinent for determining ability to telework. Hence, combining information on feasibility of teleworking from the O*NET occupational titles with the PIAAC survey allows us to leverage more detailed information regarding occupational characteristics and relate them to work task descriptions and demographic characteristics at the individual level. Finally, in the same vein as Hatayama et al. (2020), we argue that a continuous measure of probability of tele-working contains more information than binary measures used by Espinoza and Reznikova (2020). A comparison of our index with the index derived by Espinoza and Reznikova (2020) shows that our composite index of tele-workability performs better at predicting actual employment outcomes in the aftermath of COVID-19 lockdowns in the US. In addition, a validation exercise shows that show that our index is highly correlated with changes in employment in 2020, even when controlling for sector and country characteristics and the effect of mitigating economic policies taken by governments during the pandemic. This paper is structured as follows. The next section presents the data and methodology. Section 3 presents the aggregate index across countries, occupations, and sectors. Section 4 examines the role of individual characteristics; Section 5 presents a validation exercise, using realized employment and GDP data. Section 6 concludes.",2

With climate change, the frequency of disasters is expected to increase, and their likelihood will significantly influence economic decisions. One aspect is the risk associated with the interconnected nature of global production and trade. The reliance on foreign inputs can lead to a disruption of production when source countries experience a negative shock. Firms may respond to such a shock by reconsidering the balance between efficiency and resilience in production, leading to long term changes in the structure of global value chains (GVCs) through reshoring, nearshoring and diversification.Footnote 1 The nature of the long-term impact of natural disasters on global value chains and their organization is an empirical question on which there is so far limited evidence. To understand how firms behave when faced with new risks, we examine the 2011 earthquake in Japan. The earthquake off the Pacific coast of Tōhoku was the most powerful ever recorded in Japan. It triggered a tsunami that swept the Japanese mainland, causing devastation of physical infrastructure and approximately 16,000 deaths. The earthquake also severely disrupted supply chains. For example, a shortage of over 100 parts left Toyota’s North American operations operating at 30 percent capacity for several weeks (Canis 2011). Boehm et al. (2019) show that Japanese multinationals in the United States lost access to intermediate inputs and experienced severe reductions in production as a result. In the short run, the effects were highly disruptive because there were few substitutes for Japanese suppliers. For Japanese firms operating in the US, the elasticity of substitution across material inputs was estimated to be only 0.2 in the short run. Most of the existing literature on natural disasters focuses on how GVCs transmit shocks, domestically (Carvalho et al. 2016) or internationally (Boehm et al. 2019).Footnote 2 In this paper, we study instead the longer-term impact of the 2011 earthquake in Japan on trade patterns. We focus on the automobile and electronics industries, for which Japan is a key supplier, especially of parts and components. According to the World Development Report (World Bank 2020), these are also the two largest GVC sectors globally. For instance, as the shock severely affected production of Japanese automotive equipment, it had cascading effects on global auto producers such as Honda, Opel, Nissan, and General Motors which froze production lines in several factories worldwide (Automotive News 2011). In electronics, the problems were similar, as many specialized inputs such as connectors, microphones, and sensors were produced in Japan and had few or no substitutes (World Bank 2020). To motivate the analysis, we identify certain patterns in the data. We examine imports of auto and electronics in the 15 largest auto producing countries as of 2010 and in the 15 largest exporters of final electronics products to gauge the longer term effect of the earthquake on suppliers.Footnote 3 The left panel of Fig. 1 shows the average shares of products imported from Japan for importers where Japan is not a prominent supplier (less than 15 percent of total imports of that product by the country). The right panel focuses on importers largely dependent on Japanese suppliers (more than 15 percent of total imports in a product line). The figure shows that reliance on Japan dropped sharply following the 2011 earthquake for the countries most dependent on Japan. The drop was more than 10 percentage points for the auto industry, while in the case of electronics the earthquake appeared to accelerate pre-existing declining trends. This is prima facie evidence that large shocks do lead to a partial reconfiguration of supply chains: while less exposed importers return to near pre-crisis operations after the shock, it is the more dependent producers that tend to change production structures.Footnote 4 Source: 6-digit HS 1988/92 import data from United Nations Comtrade. Notes: The figures plot Japan’s average market share for auto and electronics for country-products in which Japan had an average market share below 15 percent (left panel “Low Share”) and in country-products in which Japan had an average market share greater than 15 percent (right panel “High Share”) calculated over the 2004-2010 period. The sample for auto is restricted to the 15 largest auto producers and for electronics to the 15 largest exporters of final electronics; in both cases Japan is excluded Country share of imports from Japan in auto and electronics (average). The analysis relies on a simple identification strategy. We use detailed international trade data for automobile and electronics components and final goods to study whether in the aftermath of the 2011 earthquake, importers more dependent on Japan before the earthquake behaved differently from importers less dependent on Japan. Apart from the change in imports from Japan, we also investigate whether the 2011 earthquake led to a diversification of imports away from Japan and to reshoring or nearshoring of production by more dependent importers. We find that the earthquake led to a sharp decline in imports from Japan of auto parts and finished vehicles of countries more dependent on Japan before the shock. Electronics shows a similar pattern to the auto industry, but the decline was less pronounced. For both automobiles and electronics, intermediate imports were less affected than final imports. Using a continuous measure of dependence, we find that the decline in imports for both auto and electronics is more severe the higher the importers’ dependence on Japanese suppliers in the period preceding the earthquake. We find, somewhat surprisingly, that while diversification increased overall in the auto industry due to a shift away from Japan, importers more exposed to Japan before the 2011 earthquake did not increase import diversification across non-Japanese suppliers in either automobiles or electronics. There is also no evidence that countries re-shored production. In fact, importers more exposed to Japan before the 2011 earthquake increased total imports, which is consistent with an intensification of offshoring rather than reshoring. An important question relates to which countries picked up the slack as supply chains reorganized in the aftermath of the 2011 earthquake. We perform a difference-in-differences analysis, comparing shifts in trade patterns of high Japan-dependent products with other products while controlling for importer and product specific time-varying shocks. We find that in the years following the shock, production relocation decisions were largely driven by fundamentals rather than policy. Developing countries, rather than top exporters, were the primary beneficiaries and production tended to relocate in larger countries. There is no evidence that supply chains were increasingly regionalized or that importers sought nearby suppliers, except for final autos where transport costs are especially high. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a simple framework to think of the effects of natural disasters and the reshaping of supply chains. Section 3 studies the impact of the Japanese earthquake on the reconfiguration of supply chains. Section 4 takes a closer look at where production moved after the shock. Section 5 concludes.",6

Maury’s lecture started with a sweeping journey through much of the postwar intellectual developments in international macroeconomics. The journey reached a first milestone in the early 1960s with the separate analytical contributions of J. Marcus Fleming and especially Robert Mundell (Fleming 1962; Mundell 1961a, b, 1962, 1963). From this high vantage point, Maury’s lecture took in the vast expanse opened up by what came to be known as the ‘Mundell–Fleming’ model, what was accomplished then, and what remained to be done. Thanks to major breakthroughs in the treatment of dynamic models, of rational expectations and of nominal rigidities, the journey continued and reached a second milestone in the mid-1990s, with the ‘New Keynesian Open Economy’ (NOEM) synthesis.Footnote 1 As highlighted by Maury’s inaugural lecture, this synthesis yielded a bounty of major new insights, well beyond the original lessons of the Mundell–Fleming framework. Most importantly, it allowed for rigorous welfare-based policy evaluation in a general equilibrium framework and lent itself to serious quantitative analysis. Not surprisingly, this synthesis quickly became an essential part of the policymakers’ toolkit in international financial institutions and central banks around the world. Stepping on the shoulders of giants, I will start where Maury stopped and aim to cover some of the major intellectual developments of the last twenty years. Beyond the internal intellectual trajectory of the field, that leg of the journey has been strongly influenced by the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2008 and its powerful aftershock, the 2010 Eurozone crisis. One can already anticipate that the second major economic convulsion of the new century, the COVID-19 pandemic, will also have long-lasting effects on the intellectual development of the field. Like the major financial crises that preceded them, both crises provide, in the words of Obstfeld, ‘the inspiration for new explorations’ (Obstfeld 2001, p2). Financial frictions and linkages were always an important determinant of economic and financial outcomes in emerging and developing countries. The GFC powerfully highlighted their importance for advanced economies as well. The intellectual consequences of the COVID-19 crisis still lie ahead of us. Yet this crisis has already powerfully brought another important insight to the fore: the growing role of production frictions and linkages, both domestically and internationally. These two insights—the growing importance of both financial and production frictions and linkages—require fundamental adjustments to the NOEM synthesis, or, for that matter, the Mundell–Fleming framework. They matter for the propagation of shocks, the effectiveness of stabilization policies, and offer new perspectives on the required policy instruments. This lecture will proceed in two steps. I will start with a review of the NOEM synthesis and discuss four important dimensions of progress: (a) on international pricing and invoicing; (b) on sectoral trade and production frictions and linkages; (c) on the cross-border allocation of capital and the role of global financial intermediaries; and (d) on externalities and prudential policies. I will then turn to three specific areas where I think significant further progress can be made: (a) I will explore the role for what I will call ‘basis control’ in the implementation of optimal capital flow management in Emerging Markets with shallow currency markets; (b) I will review recent developments regarding the US external position and discuss whether the historical ‘exorbitant privilege’ that the USA has enjoyed is coming to an end; (c) finally, I will offer some remarks and suggestions for strengthening the International Monetary and Financial System (IMFS). Specifically, I will argue that the IMF should play an important role as an elastic provider of global liquidity and offer a blueprint on how to do so.",2

In this paper, we investigate how and why the pandemic’s macroeconomic consequences have differed (so far) across the world income distribution. We focus in particular on variation in output and excess mortality across three broad groups of countries: low-income economies, emerging markets, and advanced economies, as classified by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). As we detail below, data from a variety of sources reveal that the pandemic’s cost in terms of lives and livelihoods was roughly U-shaped in national income, with emerging markets experiencing the worst public health and macroeconomic consequences. On average, GDP per capita in emerging markets declined by 6.7% from 2019 to 2020, compared to 2.4% in advanced economies and 3.6 percent in low-income countries. Excess mortality exhibits a similar pattern. According to estimates by The Economist, excess mortality was 75 percent higher in emerging markets than in advanced economies. While credible excess mortality data for low-income countries are still largely unavailable, the few existing estimates point to lower mortality rates. We assess the extent to which variation in policy or preexisting economic and demographic characteristics can explain the cross-country GDP and mortality outcomes in the data. In part, these outcomes could stem from differences in government policy responses to combat the coronavirus pandemic. While most countries enacted similar “lockdown style” policies and expanded social insurance programs, the scope of such efforts varied substantially. According to the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker, the stringency of lockdown policies aiming to restrict individual behavior (such as school and workplace closures) was somewhat stricter in emerging markets. The generosity of social insurance programs, in contrast, was substantially higher in richer countries. Accounting for these differences in policy is important because they can directly affect both fatalities and growth during the pandemic. The cross-country variation may also arise from stark underlying differences in economic and demographic characteristics that predate the pandemic. For instance, low-income countries may face very different public health risks than wealthier ones, as they have substantially younger populations but also less developed healthcare systems. Moreover, systematic differences in the sectoral composition of employment make some countries better able to preserve income while mitigating health risks through social distancing or lockdowns. Low-income countries may benefit from their large agricultural sectors and rural populations, which provide a resilient source of income that can be sustained while limiting social contacts. On the other hand, Gottlieb et al. (2020) show that in urban areas, the ability to work from home is far more limited in lower income countries. Combining their estimates with data on urbanization rates, we can measure the total share of labor in social sector employment, as in Kaplan et al. (2020), to capture cross-country differences in the ability to work from home or with limited in-person interactions. The composite measure shows that emerging markets have the highest share of workers in social employment, due to their large urban workforce concentrated in high-contact sectors such as manufacturing and retail trade. In contrast, low-income countries have the smallest social employment shares, due to the predominance of rural agricultural work. To investigate the extent to which these factors can explain observed differences in mortality and output, this paper follows the newly emerged literature on the macroeconomics of pandemics by combining a variant of the SICR model standard in epidemiology with a workhorse macro model. In particularly, our framework builds on the heterogeneous-agent incomplete-markets model of Aiyagari (1994), Bewley (1977) and Huggett (1996), which allows us to capture the individual-level trade-offs between consumption and health that have been the focus of most economic analysis during the pandemic. The model distinguishes between social and nonsocial jobs, differentiating individuals by their ability to work from home or while socially distancing. We incorporate age heterogeneity following Glover et al. (2020) and allow death rates to depend on a person’s age, consistent with a vast medical literature. Our model also allows for a time-varying infection rate that captures, in a reduced-form way, the various other non-modeled determinants of disease progression, such as seasonal conditions, improved treatment, or virus mutation. Finally, we include constraints on peak healthcare capacity which represent limits on the ability of certain healthcare systems to treat many patients at once, due to factors like the availability of protective equipment, hospital beds, or supplemental oxygen. In the model, the propagation of disease depends in large part on individual decisions to stay home during the pandemic or continue working in the market. The model therefore features a public health externality that creates space for welfare improving government interventions. We model lockdown policies in a simple way that is consistent with policy variation observed during the pandemic. Specifically, we feed in time-varying lockdown measures that replicate the changing stringency of government policies over the course of the pandemic, as measured by the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT). In the model, lockdown stringency corresponds to the fraction of susceptible individuals who are confined to their home, where they are less likely to become infected but incur income losses depending on their job type. While we do not allow households to disobey lockdowns, individuals can voluntarily elect to work from home at any point in time. Households also receive time-varying public transfers to support or replace lost income. As with lockdowns, we set the level of public financial assistance to match the time-path reported in the OxCGRT financial support index. To evaluate the quantitative importance of these channels in explaining the facts at hand, we parameterize the model to match key pre-pandemic economic and demographic characteristics of the USA. Parameters governing the epidemiological process are set using estimates from the relevant medical literature. We compute the model’s equilibrium response to the COVID-19 pandemic as a surprise “MIT shock,” where a small exogenous fraction of the population becomes infected with the virus, and then allow the disease to spread endogenously through the populous. We feed in the time series of vaccination rates, as reported by OxCGRT, allowing a random fraction of the population to be vaccinated in each period, consistent with rates we observe in the data. We set the nonparametric component of the infection probability so that the model’s endogenous disease path (nearly) exactly replicates the time-path of fatalities from COVID-19 in the USA during the pandemic. We calibrate the productivity penalty incurred during lockdowns to match the cumulative 2019–2020 year-on-year employment loss in the USA. We also allow for a one-off shock to aggregate total factor productivity (TFP), which is calibrated to match the cumulative 2019–2020 year-on-year decline in US real GDP per capita. We use the calibrated model to simulate how the USA would have fared during the pandemic if it counterfactually had the characteristics of emerging market or low-income economies. Comparing the model’s predictions to the actual outcomes allows us to assess the importance of each characteristic in explaining cross-country differences in GDP declines and mortality rates. Including all characteristics, the model is able to generate the U-shaped pattern in output losses and mortality rates observed across the world income distribution. The model can fully account for the relatively larger GDP declines and higher fatalities in emerging markets compared with advanced economies. Similarly, the model correctly predicts the more modest output losses and mortality in low-income countries, albeit to a quantitatively greater extent than what is observed in the data. Simulating the contribution of each factor in isolation, we find that variation in the sectoral composition of employment is the most important factor in accounting for cross-country GDP declines. Emerging markets suffered the greatest output losses in large part because they had high employment shares in close-contact occupations. In contrast, output declines in low-income countries were substantially moderated by their large agricultural sector. The sectoral composition of employment also plays an important role in explaining cross-country mortality outcomes, along with variation in age demographics and the size of social insurance programs. In both low-income and emerging markets, low levels of public financial assistance during the pandemic substantially amplified fatalities by leading many economically vulnerable individuals to continue working in the market rather than sheltering at home during times of peak infection. Our counterfactuals predict that if the USA had implemented the more limited transfer programs in low-income and emerging market economies, cumulative fatalities from the pandemic would have been 50 percent greater. In low-income countries, these higher fatalities were avoided largely thanks to their substantially younger populations with greater natural immunity to infection and serious illness. High agricultural employment shares, where transmission is lower while working, also reduces mortality in low income countries. In contrast, emerging market economies experienced much greater mortality because they do not benefit from favorable age demographics and also have high social sector employment shares. Following the counterfactual simulations, we conclude the analysis by reporting multiple correlations between cross-country changes in GDP per capita during the pandemic and covariates representing the various channels embodied in our model. Consistent with our findings, the data show that the agricultural employment shares are highly correlated with GDP changes during the pandemic, while lockdown stringency exhibits a strong negative correlation. Median age and indices of government economic support show weaker correlations. Altogether, the covariates greatly reduce the observed U-shape pattern in GDP declines across the world income distribution. The result suggests that this parsimonious set of variables, and the economic mechanisms they represent, are empirically relevant in explaining cross-country macroeconomic outcomes during the pandemic. Taken together, our analysis suggests that the comparatively worse outcomes in emerging markets, and comparably better outcomes of low income countries, were in large part predetermined by underlying economic and demographic conditions, rather than specific policy decisions. This is especially true for cross-country output losses following the pandemic. In particular, differences in quasi-fixed features like age structure, the sectoral composition of employment, and ICU capacity alone can over-account for all output losses in low income and emerging markets economies. In contrast, if all countries adopted the lockdown and transfer policies of advanced economies, GDP declines would be 1.4 and 1.0 percentage points larger in emerging market and low-income countries, respectively. Policy differences also appear to play a modest role in explaining cross-country mortality differences, with the exception of transfer policies in emerging markets. The quasi-fixed features of age, employment composition, and ICU capacity can over-account for the lower fatalities in low-income countries, but only explain roughly one-third of the higher fatalities in emerging market economies. The smaller and more limited public transfer programs in emerging markets can quantitatively account for much of their remaining variation in excess mortality. While not explicitly modeled, the result suggests that financial constraints which limit the ability of governments to enact large scale public transfer programs may be an important determinant of mortality globally and across countries. A valuable goal for future research would be to help refine the quantitative importance of different policy decisions across countries in determining macroeconomic outcomes during and after the pandemic. Our work builds on the first generation of papers addressing the aggregate effects of COVID-19 in the developing world, which were largely written in the early months of the pandemic (Loayza and Pennings 2020; Alon et al. 2020; Alfaro et al. 2020; von Carnap et al. 2020; Djankov and Panizza 2020). The current paper differs in its efforts to explain observed macroeconomic outcomes through the first year and a half of the pandemic, in particular the larger declines in GDP and employment in emerging markets. Sanchez (2021) also notes the larger decline in GDP middle-income countries, but does not attempt to explain this finding. We also emphasize the inability of individuals in emerging market economies to work from home, following Gottlieb et al. (2020, 2021a), though we argue that low-income developing countries, on account of their large agriculture sectors, are better able to work without social interactions. As in Ma et al. (2021), we emphasize the stark difference in the age structure of the population across countries and the role this difference plays in quantitative impact of the pandemic and pandemic policies. On the modeling front, our study most closely follows the structural macro work on the pandemic using models of heterogeneity in income, age, and occupation/sector of employment (e.g., Acemoglu et al. 2020; Bairoliya and Imrohoroglu 2020; Kaplan et al. 2020; Glover et al. 2020; Brotherhood et al. 2021; Chopra et al. 2021). Our model of disease dynamics features endogenous behavioral responses to changes in infection rates, even in the absence of government intervention, as in Greenwood et al. (2019), Alvarez et al. (2020) and Krueger et al. (2020) and other studies. To our knowledge, ours is the first to evaluate the quantitative predictions of a model of this sort for how the experience of emerging markets differed from richer (or poorer) countries. Our study abstracts from many important features of reality that may also be relevant for the effects of the pandemic outside of the world’s advanced economies, such as negative impacts through shocks to global supply chains (Cakmakli et al. 2020; Bonadio et al. 2021), the ability to issue sovereign debt (Arellano et al. 2020), or the ability to test and trace infections (Berger et al. 2020). We also abstract from differences in the prevalence of co-morbidities, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and differential ability or willingness or ability to mask or get vaccinated. These issues would be valuable to consider in future studies trying to explain cross-country differences in the macroeconomic effects of the pandemic.",3

Mano,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Around the world, COVID vaccines are being rolled out. The aim of these vaccination programs is to counter the spread of COVID-19 and put an end to the pandemic. This will ultimately save millions of lives. At the same time, vaccination programs can allow economies to restart as consumers and workers feel confident to return to their previous routines. This has led some observers to conjecture the return of the “roaring twenties” as consumers go back to the shops and workers to their offices.Footnote 1 A first-order question currently facing economists is thus how powerful vaccines are in helping relaunch the economy. This paper asks the question, “What is the economic effect of vaccines?”. Vaccines are proven to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, which can affect economic activity both directly, as consumers and workers feel confident they can shop and go to work without catching COVID-19, or indirectly, by allowing governments to relax restrictions that hamper economic activity. Vaccines may also raise spending through increased confidence. If vaccines are successful in restarting the economy, it is likely to show up in higher spending, higher workplace mobility, and lower unemployment claims. We estimate the effect of higher vaccination rates on these variables using high-frequency data at the county level in the United States. We tackle this question using U.S. county variation across time and space. In the United States, the vaccination roll-out started in December 2020 and accelerated over the winter and spring of 2021 before decelerating in the early summer. By August 13, 2021, the average U.S. county had a share of initiated vaccinations (i.e., first doses taken) of 56.0 percent (Panel A, Fig. 1).Footnote 2 There was, however, substantial variation around this average, with the 10th and 90th percentile standing at 40.4 and 71.7 percent initiated vaccination rates, respectively.Footnote 3 During the same period, the economy continued rebounding. Panel B of Fig. 1 shows how average credit card spending increased during the same period, while Panel C illustrates how new unemployment insurance claims declined further. Panel D depicts how workplace mobility also rose in the same period. Vaccinations and economic activity, 2021 Notes: Initiated vaccinations are first doses of vaccines taken. Spending is seasonally adjusted
credit/debit card spending expressed relative to Jan 431, 2020. Workplace mobility is compared
to its median value for the same weekday in the period of Jan 3 Feb 6, 2020. UI claims is
initial unemployment insurance claims in percent of the 2019 labor force. See Section 2 for more
details. Vaccination rates across US counties We rely on an instrumental variable approach to identify the causal effect of vaccinations. Specifically, we instrument county-level vaccination rates with pre-determined pharmacy densities at the county level (number of pharmacies per square mile) interacted with weekly allocated vaccines at the state level. That way, the approach exploits variation in the extent to which economic activity picks up in counties with higher pharmacy density when vaccines are allocated to the given state. We believe this is a good instrument for two reasons. First, counties with higher pharmacy densities can deliver vaccines more easily to their population when more vaccines are allocated to the state. Empirically, this is reflected in a strong first stage. Second, our instrument arguably also satisfies the exclusion restriction as pharmacy density is pre-determined and does not directly impact economic activity except through vaccination. Indeed, we show that the relationship between the pre-determined pharmacy density and the level of spending before vaccination is insignificant. We find that vaccinations are a significant and substantial shot in the arm for the economy. Specifically, the impact after 8 weeks of a 1% point increase in (initiated) vaccination rates is (i) an increase of credit card spending by 1.3 percentage points over the spending level in January 2020, and (ii) a reduction of weekly initial unemployment claims by 0.09 percentage points of the 2019 labor force (around 2 percent of the average ratio of weekly unemployment claims to the labor force). We also find evidence that vaccination increases workplace mobility. Importantly, these effects vary across counties, with larger effects of vaccinations in urban counties and in counties with worse social-economic conditions. This way, vaccinations are also a fair shot in the arm for the economy, which highlights that equitable distribution of vaccines is important to reduce inequality. Our results are specific to the United States but also hold important lessons for other countries. First, the United States rolled out vaccines early and at a large scale. The U.S. case thus holds important lessons for the economic impact that other countries can expect from rolling out vaccines. Second, our results highlight that ensuring an equitable distribution of vaccines is critical to reducing inequality, either pre-existing or pandemic-induced. Literature review. Our paper contributes to the emerging literature assessing the economic impact of COVID-19 vaccination programs. Sandmann et al. (2021) study the health and economic impact of mass vaccination in the United Kingdom using an epidemiological model. They measure the impact of vaccines on COVID-19 epidemiological outcomes and then convert those into economic costs. Deb et al. (2021) investigate the effect of COVID-19 vaccinations on economic activity as measured by high-frequency emissions and workplace mobility. They use a comprehensive cross-country sample and identify effects based on unexpected increases in vaccinations. Ganslmeier et al. (2021) study the impact on economic activity, as measured by nighttime lights, emissions, and workplace mobility using 326 regions in 17 countries. They employ an instrumental variable approach using previous vaccine procurement interacted with region-time fixed effects. We make a conceptual, methodological, and data contribution to the existing literature. Conceptually, we contribute by studying more direct measures of economic activity - credit/debit card spending and unemployment claims - unlike existing papers that use more indirect measures such as emissions, nighttime lights, and workplace mobility. Methodologically, we exploit the pre-determined and arguably exogenous variation in pharmacy density to identify the causal effects of vaccines. We also use more granular county-level data. This strengthens the identification strategy and allows us to go beyond the estimation of average effects. Indeed, we show how the impact of vaccination differs across urban-rural counties and other socioeconomic variables that vary significantly within U.S. states. This paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 introduces our data, Sect. 3 details our approach, and Sect. 4 discusses results. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes.",1

Industrialization in the Developing World,June 2023,Hagen Kruse,Emmanuel Mensah,Gaaitzen de Vries,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Historically, the reallocation of workers from craft to modern activities has driven sustained improvements in living standards. It was the industrial revolution that initiated a long period of economic growth in Europe and the USA (Mokyr 1990). More recently, industrialization has been central to the success stories of Asian economies catching up and converging to income levels in the West (Herrendorf et al. 2014; McMillan and Rodrik 2011; Rodrik 2013). Indeed, a dynamic modern sector that absorbs workers is crucial for economic development and poverty reduction. However, nowadays the phenomenon of “premature de-industrialization” appears prevalent among middle-income countries, who experience declines in manufacturing at lower peak levels of industrialization and per capita GDP compared to the past (Atolia et al. 2020; Felipe et al. 2019; IMF 2018; Rodrik 2016). On the other hand, low-income countries appear to have opportunities for industrialization, especially since labor costs are rising in China and it is moving to more sophisticated manufactures (Hanson 2021).Footnote 1 This paper introduces the open access GGDC/UNU-WIDER Economic Transformation Database (ETD), which provides consistent time series of employment, real and nominal value added by 12 sectors in 51 economies annually from 1990 to 2018. The ETD includes 20 Asian, 9 Latin American, 4 Middle-East and North African (MENA), and 18 sub-Saharan African (SSA) economies at varying levels of economic development. The ETD has been constructed from an in-depth investigation of the availability and reliability of statistical sources on a country-by-country basis. We use the ETD to examine trends in the manufacturing employment share. We find that the share has been increasing for many low-income countries in Asia and SSA, which suggests an industrial naissance is taking place. In addition, several developing countries that had seen peak industrialization in the 1970s or 1980s, such as Ghana and Nigeria, are experiencing a manufacturing renaissance since the 2000s. Manufacturing employment in SSA increased from 6 million to more than 20 million from 2000 to 2018, raising the share of employment in manufacturing from 7.2 to 8.4%. The significance of these trends are confirmed in regressions which control for income and demographics as well as country fixed effects. For SSA, the coefficient estimates suggest a recovery of the manufacturing employment share by more than half the downward shift during the period 1960–2011 found by Rodrik (2016). The regressions also reveal substantial cross-country heterogeneity in industrialization, indicating that regional findings cannot be generalized to all countries within the region. We explore whether industrialization involves the expansion of modern activities, which we approximate using data on registered firms in industrial surveys. For Asian economies we find that industrialization does not appear to be dominantly driven by employment expansion in either registered or unregistered firms. In contrast, for SSA the findings suggest an absorption of workers by unregistered firms, which confirms recent evidence for Ethiopia and Tanzania by Diao et al. (2021). Hence, the industrial naissance in SSA appears characterized by unregistered firms that expand employment to meet local demand for basic manufactures (Gollin et al. 2016; Pahl et al. 2019). Lewis (1979) noted that such an expansion of small-scale activity in manufacturing could be an initial phase in the development process.Footnote 2 This paper is related to the literature on industrialization and economic development (Herrendorf et al. 2014), in particular the empirical research on (de-)industrialization (Felipe et al. 2019; Rodrik 2016).Footnote 3 Our analysis centers on employment industrialization, because the expansion of manufacturing jobs is a strong predictor for higher levels of economic development (Felipe et al. 2019). We contribute to the literature with new data and findings that challenge the notion that de-industrialization trends are a generalizable phenomenon in developing countries. The paper also relates to an emerging literature that theorizes lower peak levels of industrialization. This includes the technology gap model by Fujiwara and Matsuyama (2020), the closed economy model by Huneeus and Rogerson (2020) and the dynamic open economy model by Sposi et al. (2021). These models emphasize the role of sectoral productivity gaps, differences in technological progress across sectors and trade integration in driving industrialization. The ETD may prove useful to calibrate structural models and thereby help to link driving forces to structural change outcomes. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the content and main characteristics of the ETD. Section 3 documents trends in manufacturing output and employment shares. Section 4 examines the significance of industrialization conditional on income and demographics. Section 5 examines cross-country heterogeneity in industrialization. Section 6 explores employment expansion in registered versus unregistered firms. Section 7 provides concluding remarks.",1

Hashem Pesaran,Alessandro Rebucci,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"The COVID-19 pandemic has claimed millions of lives and brought about very costly government interventions to contain it, with unprecedented and widespread economic disruption worldwide. China responded to the outbreak with strict policies, including binding and mandatory social distancing. These policies have initially proved successful in containing the epidemic in China, but later became much harder to sustain. At the other end of the spectrum, for example, Sweden initially attempted to let its epidemic run its course with only minimal interventions from the government. Other countries responded by adopting a mixture of policies, either by deliberate choice or due to popular opposition to the implementation of lock-downs or even milder forms of social distancing. What drives heterogeneity across countries in outcomes? As the COVID-19 pandemic evolved into a an endemic infectious disease in the midst of heated debates on the pros and cons of social distancing, what lessons do we learn for the management of future epidemics? In this paper, we contribute toward answering these questions by providing estimates of COVID-19 effective reproduction numbers and explain their evolution for selected European countries since the start of the pandemic in early 2020, taking account of changes in voluntary and government mandated social distancing, economic support to comply with isolation, vaccination, and the emergence of new mutations.Footnote 1 Although the European countries we focus on had similar patterns of transmissions at the beginning of the pandemic, they end up with quite different outcomes. We show that familiar factors such as social distancing, incentives to comply, or people’s voluntary responses to the epidemic on their own cannot account for the heterogeneity of outcomes that we document across selected European countries over the period 2020-2021. Vaccine uptake, however, clearly becomes the dominant factor accounting for country differences in outcomes in 2021. Reproduction numbers are epidemiological metrics to measure the spread of an infectious disease. The basic reproduction number, denoted by \({\mathcal{R}}_{0}\), is the number of new infections expected to result from one infected individual at the start of the epidemic, assuming no interventions. Computation of the reproduction number is inherently model specific. Within a classical susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model, the basic reproduction number is given by \({\mathcal{R}}_{0}=\beta _{0}/\gamma\), where \(\beta _{0}\) is the initial (biological) transmission rate, and \(\gamma\) is the recovery rate. Since the transmissibility of a disease will vary over time due to changes in immunity, mitigation policies, or voluntary precautionary behavior, the effective reproduction number, which we denote by \({\mathcal{R}}_{et}\), measures the \({\mathcal{R}}\) number t periods after the initial outbreak. As we show in the paper, in the classical SIR model, we have \({\mathcal{R}}_{et}=\left( 1-c_{t}\right) \beta _{t}/\gamma\), where \(c_{t}\) is the per capita number of infected cases at time t. As a result, conditional on this particular epidemiological model, one can separate changes in \({\mathcal{R}}_{et}\) due the extent to which the susceptible population is shrinking, \(1-c_{t}\) (which we call herding), or due to changes in the transmission rate, \(\beta _{t}\). Social distancing, either voluntary due to precautionary behavior or mandatory due to non-pharmaceutical interventions (which we also call mitigation or containment policies for brevity), compliance with mandated measures, and immunity changes due to virus mutations or vaccination all lead to time-variation in the transmission rate. We obtain estimates of time-varying transmission rates, \(\beta _{t}\), using a moment condition recently derived by Pesaran and Yang (2021), henceforth PY from an agent-based stochastic network model of the epidemic diffusion. We extend the PY model to allow for time variations in underlying drivers of the aggregate transmission rate \(\beta _{t}\), which in this model can approximately be written as \(\tau _{t}k_{t}/\mu _{t}\), where \(k_{t}\) is the mean number of contacts during day t among the population, \(\tau _{t}\) is the mean exposure intensity to the virus given contact, and \(\mu _{t}\ge 1\) captures the mean immunity level in the population. Our estimation method only requires data on infected cases, thus complementing estimation methods that make use of death statistics. Both the reported number of infected cases and deaths are subject to important measurement issues, with different countries adopting different concepts and standards. In a number of countries, COVID-19 death statistics have undergone major revisions on several occasions. For example, the UK death toll was revised downward by 5377 on August 12, 2020, after a review concluded that daily death figures should only include deaths which had occurred within 28 days of a positive COVID-19 test. We follow the medical evidence in Gibbons et al. (2014), and introduce a multiplication factor (MF) to allow for under-reporting of infected cases, and investigate the robustness of our results to different choices of MF. To understand the potential factors behind the heterogeneous evolution of effective reproduction numbers in Europe, we separate the herding component (given by shrinking share of the susceptible individuals in the population) from the transmission rate, and empirically model the latter conditional on our chosen epidemiological model. In our set up, the transmission rate depends on the average number of contacts, individual-specific susceptibility to becoming infected, and the average exposure intensity given contacts, which in turn depends on wearing of face masks, and other recommended precautions, as well as the average degree of immunity in the population. Accordingly, in our empirical analysis we assume that a country’s time-varying transmission rate potentially depends on five factors: mandatory and voluntary social distancing, economic support to comply with mandatory polices, vaccine uptake and virus mutations. Consistent with a simple decision theoretic model of voluntary social distancing presented in the paper and a large body of empirical evidence, we consider both government-mandated social distancing policies and voluntary self-isolation. We also control for government economic support that affects the incentive to comply as reported in survey data (e.g., Papageorge et al. 2021; Hamermesh 2020). To proxy mandated-social distancing and incentives to comply with these policies we use the stringency and support indices compiled by Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker project.Footnote 2 To assess the potential impact of voluntary social distancing, we allow for threshold effects capturing the impact of fear of becoming infected arising from news of rising cases on individual precautionary behavior.Footnote 3 The importance of these factors in controlling the effective rate of transmission is jointly estimated within the context of the epidemic model. In 2021, virus mutations and vaccine availability and uptake became more prominent. Thus, we add to the baseline model the population share of vaccinated people and the Delta share of the confirmed sequenced cases, and we re-estimate the model through November 2021. We focus on nine European countries with similar starts to the epidemic outbreak in March 2020, but with differing outcomes subsequently. In a pre-vaccine sample, we find that all determinants of the transmission rate considered in the paper are statistically highly significant and have the expected signs, and have been important in bring downing the effective production number, \({\mathcal{R}}_{et}\), below unity over sustained periods. However, in the post-vaccine sample ending in November 2021, we find that vaccine uptake is the most important contributor to the decline in the effective transmission rate. In both samples, we estimate model-consistent basic reproduction numbers to lie between 5 and 6 for all the European countries that we consider, somewhat higher than the early estimates of around 3 reported in the literature and documented below. In conclusion, our empirical analysis shows that mandatory and voluntary social distancing and incentives to comply were critical in bringing the reproduction number below one. Similarly, vaccine uptake in 2021 is estimated to be the most important factor contributing to the reduction in effective transmission rates, but the other factors continued to be salient. Related Literature A very large body of research investigates the COVID-19 outbreak and the policies to contain its spread.Footnote 4 For example, Fang et al. (2020) analyze efforts to contain the COVID-19 outbreak in China, measuring the effectiveness of the lock-down of Wuhan and showing that these policies also contributed significantly to reducing the total number of infections also outside of Wuhan. Similarly, there is ample reduced form evidence on the impact of mandatory social distancing using state and county level data in the case of the USA and for a few other countries. However, there are not many studies on the relative importance of mandatory and voluntary social distancing, especially comparative across countries. Caselli et al. (2020) find that both lock-downs and voluntary social distancing helped contain the first wave of COVID-19, but mandatory interventions have been critical. Jinjarak et al. (2020) find that more stringent policies are associated with lower mortality growth rates in a large cross section of countries but with some heterogeneity depending on demographics, the degree of urbanization and political freedom, as well as the international travel flows. In general, however, countries with more stringent policies at the onset of the epidemic realized lower peak mortality rates and exhibited lower duration during the first epidemic wave. We distinguish not only between mandatory and voluntary social distancing, but also consider the incentives to comply and herd immunity in lowering the reproduction number, as well as vaccine uptake and mutations. To our knowledge, no study which considers voluntary or government-mandated social distancing also controls for the possibility of herd immunity and distinguishes its impacts on effective reproduction numbers from the influence of policy and/or behavioral factors. A number of studies consider the effects of different intervention strategies—such as isolating the elderly, closing schools and/or workplaces, and alternating work/school schedules—which should lower the average number of contacts of specific age groups, contact locations, or time windows relative to normal (pre-COVID) patterns using calibrated behavioral SIR or compartmental models.Footnote 5 We take an empirical/econometrics approach calibrating only the recovery rate, \(\gamma\); a parameter on which we have much more precise clinical information. Various methods are available in the epidemiological literature to estimate the reproduction numbers at the beginning and/or in real time during epidemics. Estimation of reproduction numbers based on different models is reviewed by Chowell and Nishiura (2008), Obadia et al. (2012), and Nikbakht et al. (2019). More recent contributions, focusing on estimation of reproduction numbers for the COVID-19 pandemic based on death statistics includes Atkeson et al. (2020b), Baqaee et al. (2020), Korolev (2020) and Toda (2020). As we noted earlier both death and case statistics are problematic, and we provide complementary evidence relying only on case statistics correcting for measurement errors and under-reporting. Other closely related papers are Fernández-Villaverde and Jones (2020), Atkeson et al. (2020a) , and Cakmakli and Simsek (2020). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses SIR model with time-varying transmission rates. Section 3 presents the method and estimation results for the transmission rates and reproduction numbers for selected European countries. Section 4 sets up the panel data model to assess the relative importance of the key factors driving the effective transmission rate over time and across countries and reports the estimation results. Section 5 concludes. “Appendix” presents an extension of PY model to allow for time variations in key parameters affecting the transmission of the virus.",1

While assessing the success of these fund-supported programs is a multi-dimensional exercise, an important backbone of a successful and credible program is a realistic set of projections for macroeconomic variables such as output and inflation. In this paper, we are—to the best of our knowledge—the first to document that financial variables observable at the time of program design are strong predictors of growth forecast errors in IMF-supported programs. The previous literature has evaluated the IMF’s program forecasts for accuracy, bias and efficiency, with some finding evidence of over-optimism (e.g., Kim et al. 2021). Over-optimism has been found to be most significant in samples of large programs (Musso and Phillips 2002), at longer horizons (Ho and Mauro 2016) and when planned policy adjustments were large (Ismail et al. 2020). Over-optimism in growth forecasts is problematic not only because it can undermine the calibration of macroeconomic policies, but also because it may itself cause future recessions by incentivizing the accumulation of public and private debt (Beaudry and Willems 2022). Figure 1 shows forecasts and outturns for real GDP growth surrounding the approval of IMF-supported programs. Over-optimism is a feature of the median forecast made in the context of both programs implemented in advanced and emerging economies and those programs made available on concessional terms to the IMF’s lower-income member countries.Footnote 1 Across 306 programs approved from 2000 to 2019, the mean annual growth rate over the next two years ended up being 0.76 percentage points lower than initially forecast at the time of the program request. That is, the level of output two years hence ended up being 1.5 percentage points lower than forecast. Evolution of real output growth surrounding the approval of IMF-supported programs. Sources: WEO, MONA and authors’ calculations. Figure shows median across 129 IMF-supported programs supported by GRA resources and 177 programs supported by PRGT resources that were approved between 2000 and 2019. Forecasts are those made at program request and accessed from the IMF’s MONA database, while outturns are from the October 2021 vintage of the World Economic Outlook Over-optimism of growth forecasts may reflect several factors, which are likely to be sample specific. Growth is affected by shocks that could not have been foreseen by the forecaster, such as a fall in the world price of an exported commodity, the emergence of a civil conflict or a global financial crisis (IMF 2019). To the extent that these unanticipated shocks do not have a zero mean in a particular sample, this can give rise to a biased forecast. Growth forecasts may also err because they are inefficient, in the sense that the forecaster did not make full use of the information that was available at the time of the forecast.﻿Footnote 2 This can arise because a planned policy change ends up not having the expected impact on future growth, because a planned policy change does not get implemented or alternatively because the forecaster did not correctly model the relationship between the past and future evolution of observable variables. We present forecast efficiency tests that check whether ex post growth forecast errors are correlated with characteristics of the financial system that were observable when a program was designed. Methodologically, our approach is similar to Blanchard and Leigh (2013), who document that the size of planned fiscal consolidation was a good predictor of growth over-optimism in IMF-supported programs in the euro zone following the global financial crisis. They conclude that this forecast inefficiency is suggestive that IMF forecasters had underestimated the size of the fiscal multiplier in this sample. A similar approach has more recently been adopted by Ismail et al. (2020), who additionally document a nonlinearity in the relationship between forecast optimism and the size of the planned fiscal adjustment. Our main contribution is to apply this approach to study the role of financial variables, specifically the evolution of credit to the private sector, which will allow us to infer whether macrofinancial analysis is being properly incorporated into the IMF’s program forecasts. Why might one suspect that inefficient use of financial variables could be driving forecast optimism? Figure 2 plots the evolution of the credit-to-GDP gap surrounding the approval of IMF-supported programs.Footnote 3 We have separated the sample based on the ex post error of the program’s growth forecast, splitting the sample at the top quartile of the empirical distribution. For those GRA programs that ended up being most optimistic, we notice a large swing in the credit cycle surrounding program approval. For the median program in this subsample, the credit-to-GDP gap increases by 6 percentage points in the three years prior to program approval and reverts sharply in the following years. This pattern is not observed in programs that featured little or no forecast optimism; nor is it observed in the sample of PRGT programs, whose low-income beneficiaries tend to have less developed financial systems. Evolution of the credit-to-GDP gap surrounding the approval of IMF-supported programs. Sources: WEO, MONA, BIS, IFS, BOP and authors’ calculations. Figure shows medians across programs for which the credit-to-GDP gap could be estimated using available data. “Most optimistic programs” in each panel are those in the top quartile of growth forecast errors \(\hat{g}_{i}\) defined in Eq. 1 Our motivation for testing the efficient use of financial variables originates in the large literature on their predictive power for forecasting output growth, prominently explored by Stock and Watson (2003) for the case of the G7 economies. Adrian et al. (2019) show that financial indicators are good predictors of the conditional mean and variance of future output growth in the USA, arguing that this feature is driven by amplification mechanisms between the financial sector and real economy. Schularick and Taylor (2012) show that financial credit expansions forecast declines in real activity in a sample of 14 countries over the past 130 years. Chen and Rancière (2019) present simple models incorporating financial variables including credit growth that provide good out-of-sample accuracy when forecasting output in a sample of 62 countries. Closely related to our work, they show that the models outperform the IMF’s World Economic Outlook (WEO) in an out-of-sample horserace of forecast accuracy for 85 percent of the countries they study. Kirti (2018) finds that strong credit growth is a good predictor of future growth and unemployment three years hence. He also documents that this relationship is compounded by the strength of lending standards: When strong credit growth is accompanied by a deterioration of lending standards, this is followed by even weaker growth and higher unemployment. But if the literature has documented that financial conditions are good predictors of future output growth, is this fact being fully incorporated into macroeconomic forecasts? Kirti (2018) tests this hypothesis on a sample of WEO forecasts for 38 countries and finds that the documented relationship between financial and real variables is not anticipated by forecasters, with past credit developments correlating strongly with ex post forecast errors. We believe our paper is the first to examine whether growth forecasts made in the context of IMF-supported programs efficiently use the information contained in observable financial variables. These programs offer an interesting context that may differ from forecasts produced in the IMF’s World Economic Outlook surveillance forecasts and those produced by professional forecasters in the private sector. A first way programs differ is that they are usually designed in a context where a negative shock has already materialized, creating a gap in the balance of payments and prompting the country’s authorities to seek financial assistance from the international community. There is an extensive literature documenting the failure of professional economists—including those at the IMF—to anticipate recessions (Loungani 2001; An et al. 2018). This stylized fact generates an optimism bias that is particularly pronounced in samples with many large negative shocks. Programs thus offer an interesting context because the accuracy of their forecasts relies less on ability to anticipate a negative shock, but rather from anticipating the depth of downturns and the strength of recoveries following a realized shock. A second way IMF-supported program growth forecasts differ is that they involve a unique class of agency issues and incentives. Programs must be jointly agreed between the fund and the member country’s government, and this process may involve political incentives to bias a forecast toward optimism or pessimism, as discussed by Musso and Phillips (2002). Rules established in IMF policy prevent the institution from lending if public debt is assessed to be on a unsustainable path, and require stricter policy conditionality when loans are made to countries that have vulnerabilities from existing debt. Since debt sustainability assessments are heavily influenced by growth forecasts, an incentive toward optimism may exist for the manager wishing to facilitate a loan to a country with vulnerabilities. Finally, forecasters may perceive a professional advantage from the prestige associated with managing a large program loan. This may create an incentive to overstate the growth forecast that underpins the borrower’s ability to repay a larger loan to the fund.Footnote 4 Our paper also relates to the literature on sources of bias and inefficiency in macroeconomic forecasts made by the IMF and by other forecasters (Timmermann 2007; Eicher et al. 2019). Blanchard and Leigh (2013) provide a prominent example of inefficient program forecasts: the underestimation of the impact of a planned fiscal consolidation on growth during the Euro area crisis of 2010–2011. Our paper confirms that misestimation of fiscal multipliers may have been a factor in explaining optimistic program forecasts, though the result is not statistically significant in our sample. Our main result is that financial variables observable during program design are reliable and strong predictors of growth forecast errors. A program preceded by a one-standard-deviation increase in the credit-to-GDP gap—approximately 8.1 percentage points in our sample—is associated with an annualized forecast error that is approximately 0.60 percentage points more optimistic, such that the level of output is over-estimated by about 1.2 percentage points at a two-year horizon. This result is about twice as strong among those programs whose growth forecasts turned out to be optimistic. While our analysis is focused on the credit-to-GDP gap, we also find evidence of inefficiency in the use of other financial variables, including the degree of liability dollarization and the recent growth of residential property prices. While we do not attempt to provide a comprehensive decomposition of the drivers of forecast errors, we explore plausible explanations for the inefficient use of information in financial variables. A plausible mechanism underlying this result is that a program’s policy adjustments are endogenous to the financial cycle, such that programs following a credit boom are calibrated to tighten financial conditions. This could give rise to inefficient forecast optimism if the impact of these tighter policies on growth was underestimated. Relatedly, more restrictive policies may be less likely to be implemented due to political resistance, making programs approved after a credit boom more likely to go “off track” with agreed policies not being implemented as planned. We present some evidence that these explanations are unlikely to explain our result. Rather, we deduce that forecasters do not correctly model the relationship between the past and future evolution of observable variables—possibly underestimating the tendency of credit to revert to its trend—and the interactions of the credit cycle and real economy. We show that our result also applies outside the context of IMF-supported programs, including in a large panel of WEO forecasts made in the IMF’s surveillance role and in forecasts made in the private sector by professional forecasters surveyed by Consensus Economics. However, the size of the effect appears to be smaller in these samples than what is estimated in our event study of IMF-supported programs. We take this external validity test as an indication that improved macrofinancial analysis could alleviate the optimism of growth forecasts across the profession. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we document stylized facts about growth forecast errors in IMF-supported programs and present our main empirical approach based on an event study. In Sect. 3, we test the validity of our result in other contexts using a broad panel of IMF forecasts that spans both program and non-program situations, as well as forecasts made by professional forecasters. Section 4 concludes.",
