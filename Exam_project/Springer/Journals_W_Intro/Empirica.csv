J. M. Gradus,J. Matthijs de Jong,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The literature discusses whether competition between schools increases the quality of educational outcomes. Friedman (1962) claimed that school choice policies promise to align the incentives of school management with demand. Positive effects on educational outcomes can occur if students choose schools with higher quality levels. This increases the incentives for schools to invest in the quality of the primary process to improve educational outcomes. From a theoretical point of view, a negative effect of competition on quality is also possible. In practice, many other characteristics influence school choice. If, for instance, students look more at their friends’ choices or at the attractiveness of sports programs, the link between school choice and quality might be very different. Schools might choose to invest time and money in characteristics appreciated by potential students which are not related to the (direct) quality of education and might see greater benefits in marketing themselves to prospective students than in improving their programs. In this case, the effect of competition on educational outcomes might become negative since less time and money are available for the primary process. In addition, measuring and interpreting quality might not be straightforward and costless for students and their parents. Which effect dominates is a matter for empirical analysis. In many cross-country studies differences in economic growth have been related to school attainment, years of schooling and school autonomy and decentralization and there is evidence for a significant positive relation between (cognitive) skills and economic growth [see for an overview Hanushek and Woessmann (2011)]. In addition, cross-country comparison indicates that students in countries with a larger share of privately managed schools (and public school funding) tend to perform better on average Woessmann (2009) and Maslowski et al. (2007). Recent macro evidence corroborates the conclusion that this seems due to a causal effect of private-sector competition measured by the share of students attending privately operated schools (West and Woessmann 2009). Nevertheless, the share of private students is only a weak proxy for competition. In addition, based on panel data empirical analysis of the effect of competition on the quality of educational outcomes is scarce due to the absence of micro data and large-scale competition in many countries. A few examples make this clear. Hoxby (2000) uses the concept of Tiebout choice, that parents choose between US school districts based on the quality differences between schools, to test this hypothesis. Her result suggests that competition enhances quality for elementary and secondary education. However, Rothstein (2007) shows that her results are sensitive to the construction of the competition variables and claims that alternative constructions yield insignificant results. Moreover, Rothstein (2007, p. 2034) finds that Hoxby’s specification is subject to selection bias because the sample excludes private school students. These criticisms are disputed in Hoxby (2007), but the discussion is still unsettled. More important seems the fact that Tiebout choice is only a weak indicator for the effect of free school choice. Parents have to move to another district in order to vote with their feet. Although there is evidence that parents actually do this (Barrow 2002), fully free choice results in much more competitive pressure as parents can choose other schools in and out of district without moving. Unfortunately, the only evidence available is for small-scale free choice or voucher programs as only a few countries in the world provide fully free choice for parents. Lavy (2010), for example, analyzes the effects of free school choice using an experiment in one of the districts of Tel Aviv (Israel) that allowed parents to choose between public schools both in and out of district. He finds significant positive effects of free school choice on the quality of public schools. Sandström and Bergström (2005) show that the increased parental choice in Sweden since 1992 as a result of a voucher program supports the hypothesis that school results in public schools improve due to competition with independent schools. However, if competition is measured by the commonly used Herfindahl–Hirschman concentration index, the effects are sometimes negative and sometimes insignificant. Also, the Swedish voucher program is small: only 7 % of students were enrolled in an independent school in 2004. Chakrabarti (2008) analyses the effects of a voucher program for private schools in Milwaukee. He finds a larger effect in the second phase of this program, suggesting that the larger availability of places resulted in more positive effects of competition on quality of public schools. He concludes that program characteristics might be important to explain effects of competition on quality. In addition, Hanushek et al. (2007) investigates the quality differences between charter and public schools using data for Texas. They find that quality differences are absent after the start-up phase, which is troublesome for most charter schools. Empirical studies for other US states have tended to find effects ranging from slightly positive to modestly negative on charter school students’ reading and math growth (see Bifulco and Ladd (2006) for North Carolina and Sass (2006) for Florida). Nevertheless, studies such as Hoxby and Rockoff (2005) and Hoxby and Murarka (2009) focusing on charters schools in relatively vibrant urban areas, and therefore with abundant choice, have found more positive effects. However, an important limitation of these studies is that they include only schools with oversubscribed lotteries, which are probably the most desirable schools in these areas. Therefore, in a US overview of the vouchers and chartered schools literature Loeb et al. (2011) claim that the empirical evidence of the effectiveness of vouchers in improving student’s achievement is decidedly mixed. Also Rouse and Barrow (2009, p. 22), after summarizing the literature on voucher programs, conclude that these small-scale experiments cannot be used to test Friedman’s hypothesis and thus that “many questions remain about the potential long-term impacts on academic outcomes and about both the public and private sector responses to a large, permanent, and well-funded voucher program.”Footnote 1 The Netherlands is one of the few countries in the world where such impacts can currently be measured as it has long experience with free choice, the role of both public and private schools is large and funding is the same for all types of schools. The other example might be Chile where 1,000 schools entered the market as a result of a voucher program open for all schools, more or less comparable to the situation in the Netherlands. Hsieh and Urquiola (2006) found no effects of competition on quality in this case. In the Netherlands, the model of free parental choice between different types of schools has been present since the historical national school dispute (“schoolstrijd”) came to an end in 1917 (Kossmann 1978).Footnote 2 Ever since, parental choice and equal opportunities for public and private schools have even been guaranteed in the Dutch constitution. Private primary and secondary schools are managed by independent non-profit boards, and they abide by practically the same rules as public schools. Many, but not all, private schools have a religious denomination. Private schools are fully financed by the government at exactly the same level as public schools, both based on the number of students. The Dutch system could, in fact, be characterized by a full voucher program with 100 % funding. Parents are free to choose any public or private school in the country. Schools are in principle obliged to accept all students. The only exception the law permits is for religious schools to ask that parents agree with their denomination. In practice, only a few, especially Protestant, schools use this exception. Selection with respect to the a priori quality of students is never allowed. This is an important difference from voucher programs in other countries, where schools can often select the students they want. Free choice is used very often: in 2006, 71 % of students are at private schools. Since the introduction of free parental choice, a large number of private schools entered the market. However, currently, new schools are created only very occasionally. The reason for this is that parents can start up a new school siteFootnote 3 as long as they prove that the denomination (or educational method, such as Dalton or Montessori) they present is not yet represented in their surroundings and that there are enough students who want to attend a school with such a denomination. Given the long history, nearly all types of schools already exist.Footnote 4 This means that competition in the Netherlands occurs between existing school sites and not with entrants. This is a very important institutional characteristic which allows us to use the number of school sites as an instrument for competition in the market to test for endogeneity problems. Thus, competition between school sites measured by concentration indices based on market shares (in our case, the Herfindahl–Hirschman index) might be endogenous with respect to quality as lower quality might lead to changes in market shares if higher-quality schools attract students. The number of school sites, however, is not endogenous in the Netherlands, as low quality in a market is not a possible reason for getting permission to start a new school site. The number of school sites in the Netherlands is therefore exogenous with respect to quality. This is a major difference from US markets, where entry is very often the result of dissatisfaction with existing school quality (Hoxby 2000). Given the long history of competition between schools in the Netherlands, one would expect effects on quality, if present, to be visible. However, the effect of competition on quality has never been systematically analyzed for the Netherlands. In this paper, we fill that gap based on data for secondary schools for the period 2002–2006. We use datasets from the Dutch Ministry of Education and the national monitoring agency for education (“Onderwijsinspectie”). We measure school quality by three achievement variables: the average score in the nationwide final exams, the percentage of students who obtain a diploma and the percentage of students graduating on time. For all three measures, we find evidence of a negative effect of competition on quality, which is quite small. This effect is robust for alternative specifications and sensitivity analyses, including endogeneity-correcting instrumental variable (IV) estimations. We show that the effect is dominated by small and medium-sized schools and by schools that do not have a Protestant or Catholic denomination. The article is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the methodology and the available data. The estimation results are presented in Sect. 3 and the robustness of the results is discussed in Sect. 4. Section 5 draws some conclusions.",4

All of this has caused huge political and social upheavals. Countries have been in conflict over the appropriate policies to adopt; new anti-austerity political parties have ousted traditional parties; immigration has lept as people have searched for work which has raised social tensions everywhere. None of this was envisaged when the euro was introduced in 1999 yet, as argued in this paper, its introduction is the source of the crisis. The paper explains why this is. It then considers how the euro might be saved. Current discussion has centred on greater central control of policy: having common fiscal as well as monetary policies, and even greater political integration through a more federal structure. This paper asks whether there might be a market solution that does not require more central control. At present the eurozone has a common monetary policy that enables all countries to borrow cheaply irrespective of risk, and does so even when the crisis has revealed the risks involved. The failure of markets to price risk correctly seems to be a major contributory factor. The market solution proposed to address the long-term problem simply requires borrowing rates to reflect the risks involved. (In the short term other measures are required.) The paper shows that this did not happen in the lead up to the crisis. As a result, both private and public borrowing were excessive, which led to the crisis. In supporting these arguments this paper draws on a number of published technical articles of the author which examine individual aspects. The contribution of the current paper is to examine their implications for the eurozone crisis. The paper is set out as follows. In Sect. 2 the origins of the eurozone crisis are examined and in Sect. 3 the policy implications are discussed. The puzzling failure of financial markets to correctly price credit risk prior to the crisis is examined in Sect. 4. In Sect. 5 an independent measure of credit risk for eurozone countries is described. Some conclusions are drawn in Sect. 6.",6

While it was over by 2010 in most parts of the world, Europe was hit in a particularly hard way and is still struggling with its consequences. This is due to the specific problems of the European Economic and Monetary Union, in particular the Euro Area. Most observers blame the political architecture of the monetary union for this prolonged crisis. It has at least two dimensions: an asymmetry of competitiveness and an asymmetry of sovereign debt within the union. Both phenomena were acerbated by the initial period of the monetary union, with its equalized interest and inflation rates in spite of these asymmetries and with its consequently distorted price signals. This led to further drifting apart during the Great Recession, when these distortions were noticed by the financial markets. The Greek Crisis is the most obvious manifestation of this development, but several other countries (most explicitly those on the so-called periphery of the union) suffered (and are partly still suffering) from similar problems to Greece. In this paper we concentrate on the sovereign debt crisis and its macroeconomic consequences. Many observers think that the piling up of public debt in countries like Greece calls for austerity measures to secure the solvency of their governments. However, during periods of low or even negative growth such a policy conflicts with the stabilization function of fiscal policy, which calls for an expansionary policy stance especially in those countries with relatively high public debt. Although there are different estimates about the extent of this trade-off between fiscal prudence and stability requirements on the one hand and stabilization goals for output and employment on the other, there is a lot of evidence that in the short run, debt reductions by restrictive government expenditure and tax policies have adverse effects on aggregate demand and unemployment. Several ways out of this unfortunate situation have been proposed by politicians and economists, especially in the context of the Greek Crisis. Some proposals call for debt reductions through transfers from the countries with sound finances in order to support those countries which are threatened by government insolvency. This may temporarily prevent state bankruptcy in the overindebted countries, but the medium and long run consequences are less clear, and the acceptance of such transfers by taxpayers in the donating countries is certainly limited, in spite of appeals to European solidarity. In a previous paper (Neck and Blueschke 2014), we have shown in a dynamic game model of a monetary union that such a “haircut” for indebted countries may lead to disadvantages, not only for the donors but also for the receiving countries due to their subsequent exclusion from financial markets and increased risk premiums for the interest on their public debt. The development of Greece since the first debt relief seems to corroborate this prediction. Another remedy for the asymmetry of the government debt situation proposed by many European policy makers is the centralization of fiscal policies in the Euro Area, from a mechanism enforcing prudent government debt policies to the institution of a fiscal union with additional competences for the union-wide institutions in fiscal matters. Notwithstanding the political obstacles to such a centralizing institutional move, it is of obvious interest to know whether its economic consequences will be advantageous or not. This question will be examined in the present paper. Due to the complexity of the decision mechanisms in the Euro Area, we can only provide a very partial answer. First, we concentrate on macroeconomic effects, abstracting from possible allocative and distributive consequences and from political problems such a massive restriction of national decision-making bodies would possibly create. Moreover, we use a fairly simple model with only two countries (or blocs) in the monetary union to deal with the asymmetry between high and low government debt countries. Policy conclusions must therefore be drawn with a lot of caution. On the other hand, by using a dynamic policy game approach we can capture some of the strategic interactions between high and low public debt countries and between monetary and fiscal policy makers which are often neglected in the literature on the macroeconomics of a monetary union. To do so, we introduce a model of a monetary union with three decision makers: two governments (blocs), named core (bloc 1) and periphery (bloc 2), which differ with respect to their initial debt level and their preferences in the debt-output/employment trade-off, and a central bank responsible for monetary policy in the entire union. While the central bank cares about price stability and other targets in the whole union, the governments are assumed to be only interested in their national targets (and may have preferences about the Phillips curve trade-off which differ from those of the central bank). We calibrate the model so as to mirror some macroeconomic aspects of the Euro Area and calculate (approximate) optimal policies for these policy makers under different assumptions about fiscal-monetary policy interactions. A non-cooperative scenario is compared to several versions of a “pure fiscal union” (without coordination with the central bank) and a “complete monetary and fiscal union” where all policy makers cooperate. One result is that a higher degree of centralization in the institutional setting of the monetary union may but need not necessarily yield better results than non-cooperative decentralized policy making.",1

This distinction, however, is rather arbitrary and has been challenged by recent theoretical models and by empirical evidence that points to long-run performance being explained in part by business-cycle behavior and output variability. The aim of this paper is to empirically investigate the relationship between economic growth and output volatility. The earliest theoretical argument for a relation between economic growth and the business cycle dates back to Schumpeter (1939), who argued that recessions provide a cleansing mechanism for the economy, where old technologies get replaced by newer technologies, and will be better adapt to economic growth thereafter. In a similar spirit Black (1981) argues that the average severity of a society’s business cycle is largely a matter of choice. His idea was that economies face a positive risk-return trade-off in their choice of technology, as economic agents would choose to invest in riskier technologies only if the latter were expected to yield a higher return and hence, greater economic growth. A series of papers have subsequently focused on the relationship between volatility and growth in exogenous growth models. On the one hand, the focus was on the impact of volatility on uncertainty, precautionary savings and hence accumulation of capital (cf. Boulding 1966; Leland 1968; Sandmo 1970). On the other hand, Bernanke (1983) and Pindyck (1991) argue that if there are irreversibilities in investment, then increased volatility will lead to lower investment and hence lower capital accumulation. More recently, within an endogenous growth model, Aghion and Saint-Paul (1998) show that the sign of the relation depends on whether the activity that generates growth in productivity is a complement or a substitute to production. In the case where they are substitutes, since the opportunity cost of productivity-improving activities such as reorganizations or training falls in recessions, larger variability leads to higher long-term growth. This idea has recently been formalized in an endogenous growth framework by Jovanovich (2006). He claims that the choice of a growth rate leads to a positively correlated stochastic cost, generating volatility. A number of empirical studies on the relationship between growth and volatility have been conducted. Campbell and Mankiw (1987) were among the first to report permanent effects on the level of GDP from shocks to output growth, first for the US and later on for a selected sample of various countries (Campbell and Mankiw 1989). Hall (1988) and Burnside et al. (1993) show that the Solow residual is correlated to economic variables, and can therefore not be purely exogenous, as suggested by the real business cycle literature, suggesting that trend and fluctuation of output should be investigated jointly. Whilst it provides a confirmative test for models of exogenous growth and volatility, these studies fail to provide a test for models of endogenous growth and volatility. The first empirical study that can be applied to endogenous growth models was done by Zarnowitz (1981). He identified periods of relatively high and relatively low economic stability by reviewing annual real GDP growth rates in the US between 1882 to 1980 and accounts found in the literature on economic trends and fluctuations. He then calculated the yearly growth rate and the variance of the periods with high economic stability (group A) and low economic stability (group B). Though the mean growth rate of group A was higher, he could not reject the null hypothesis that the difference between the mean growth rates for groups A and B was due to chance. The first econometric study investigating the link between growth, output variability—as measured by the standard deviation of the growth rate—and further macroeconomic variables was conducted by Kormendi and Mequire (1985). By averaging each country’s time series experience into a single data point and estimating a cross-section of forty-seven observations, they found that higher output variability leads to higher economic growth. Grier and Tullock (1989), who used a pooled structure (five-year averaging) to account for both between- and within-country effects, confirmed Kormendi and Meguire’s results. The paper closest to this is by Mills (2000). He applied various filters that are explicitly designed to capture movements in a time series that correspond to business-cycle fluctuations in twenty-two countries. Subsequently, he calculated the standard deviation of the output (filtered) series and visualized the bivariate relationship between growth and volatility by superimposing robust nonparametric curves on scatter plots. He found a positive relationship. In contrast to our paper, Mills (2000) suppresses all fluctuations of output at frequencies higher than his filter. When analyzing the relationship between economic growth and output fluctuations, we are essentially investigating the first moment of the time series in first differences, and its corresponding second moment, i.e. the variance of the differentiated time series. There exists a standard econometric tool to analyze this relationship, the generalized auto-regressive conditional heteroscedacity (GARCH) class of models. And indeed, several authors have employed this methodology to analyze the relationship of output and volatility. 
Ramey and Ramey (1995), using a panel structure, measured volatility as the standard deviation of the residuals in a growth regression consisting of the set of variables identified by Levine and Renelt (1992) as the important control variables for cross-country growth regressions. Ramey and Ramey (1995) use the estimated variance of the residuals in their regression, under the assumption that it differs across countries, but not time. In such, it can be considered an early predecessor of GARCH models. They find a negative relation between long-run growth and volatility. By contrast, Caporale and McKiernan (1998) and Grier and Perry (2000) examined the issue from a pure time series perspective. Caporale and McKiernan (1998) ran an ARMA(1,2)-GARCH(0,1)-M model and Grier and Perry (2000) ran a complex bivariate GARCH(1,1)-M model for US GDP growth. The former found a significant positive relationship while the latter found an insignificant positive relationship between growth and volatility. The fact that these studies yield opposite results may come as a surprise. However, GARCH models were invented for financial time series, with a large number of observation. In Monte-Carlo simulations, we demonstrate in ""Appendix 1"" that the widely-used and highly-sophisticated GARCH-in-mean models are inappropriate for this purpose as they require the estimation of too many parameters for the short time series that normally confront macroeconomists. Using an interantional panel with quarterly data, and thus a sufficient number of observations, Trypsteen (2013) recently showed in a Garch-M model a positive relation between growth and volatility, if cross-country interactions of shocks are factored in. On the downside, quarterly data are less precise and prone to seasonal fluctuations. 
Imb (2007) studies the relationship between economic growth and business cycles at a sectoral level using GARCH methods. In a panel of 47 countries, 28 sectors, and a period from 1970 to 1992, he finds a positive relationsship between growth and volatility, in contrast to the findings of Ramey and Ramey (1995). This leaves us with the more conventional approach of separating the annual time series into a trend and a cyclical component, and then investigate their relationship. There is a large number of filters available, most of them developed by the finance literature. We have decided to adopt the HP-filter. Our measure of volatility is superior to any other measure of volatility we investigated due to its stability with respect to small changes in the data. This paper continues as follows. After this introdcution, we present the data and the methodology in Sect. 2. The empirical analysis presented in Sect. 3 is based on the growth experience of 25 OECD countries between 1960 and 2013. After calculating the trend growth rate for each country using the HP-filter, we divided the data for each country into several non-overlapping sub-samples. For each sub-sample, the average growth rate and the volatility—based on the squared deviations of the actual growth rate from the trend growth rate—was computed. This not only mitigated the effect of assuming constant volatility and constant growth rates, the technique also accounted for the within-country variation of the volatility in our subsequent regression analysis. We conclude that there is a significant positive relationship between output variability and growth. This relationship is robust against outliers and does not hinge on the sub-sample period chosen.",4

gives up its own currency and adopts a common currency, its central bank loses de-jure and de-facto independence in affecting the domestic money markets through adjustments in target interest rates. Instead, it has to follow or even execute the monetary policy of the common central bank. However, it would lose only little if the country’s money markets had already been affected by the monetary policy of the common central bank before the new currency had been adopted. In such a case, the national central bank would have already lost de-facto independence before giving up de-jure policy independence. Hence, giving up the own national currency would not mean very much in terms of monetary policy autonomy. In contrast, this national central bank could even gain influence on both the common and domestic money market if it could participate in common monetary policy decisions. This is precisely the EMU institutional setting: the central bank of any country considered in this study would enter the decision-making institution of the European Central Bank (ECB), the ECB council, when the government would adopt the common currency. This study intends to measure the degree or presence of de-facto monetary policy independence of a national central bank in its attempts to affect the national money market. This measurement might allow central banks to assess the gains and losses when the country’s own currency is given up and a common one is adopted. Few studies have addressed the problem of adopting a common currency from a perspective, which emphasizes a link between monetary policy autonomy and money market interest rates. I focus on the impact of volatility patterns of market rates on the degree of monetary policy independence by employing GARCH-class modeling. This modeling appears to be an appropriate analytical tool for non-efficient markets as they can often be found in monetary and financial economics. It allows mitigating the impact of non-efficiencies on the size and stability of estimated coefficients of independence, and it informs about the mean-reverting properties of the residuals of the variance after a shock. I am led to believe that the application of the GARCH methodology for assessing a central bank’s gains and losses in policy effectiveness when adopting the euro on the basis of money market stability constitutes a novel feature of the literature. The study applies a multivariate GARCH model (MGARCH) to six members of the European Union (EU) that are not members of the European Monetary Union (EMU), namely Sweden, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Romania. Sweden and the UK were already EU members when the EMU was established in 1999, and one may study the impact on their national money markets from the beginning of the monetary union. GARCH modeling will consider the institutional changes (EU accession and exchange rate system modification) of the four new EU members. The Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland became EU members and members of the European System of Central Banks in May 2004, Romania in January 2007. In the present situation, all countries considered have floating exchange rates according to the IMF classification system (Habermeier et al. 2009), although there are differences between a managed float (Romania) and a free float (all others). The central banks of the countries pursue some version of inflation targeting in order to comply with the EMU convergence criteria (inflation, interest rate and exchange rate criteria). This monetary policy concept may be successful only when the central bank is able to affect the national money market. Hungary’s exchange rate regime was a crawling peg with narrow margins until October 2001 and then a ±15 % fluctuation band around the central parity, which restricted monetary policy independence of the central bank. Continued appreciation forced freeing of the Forint against the euro in February 2008. Furthermore, the research question in this study addresses a sensitive political issue: the United Kingdom is a non-EMU member under the rule of the so-called opting out clause, which means that the country is not obliged to adopt the euro at all. The other countries must join the euro zone after fulfilling the necessary formal criteria during the mandatory test stage. Sweden, which is actually obliged to adopt the euro, managed to stay outside due to political resistance among the population; the Riksbank is not yet independent from the government according to the EMU rules. Governmental plans in the other four EU members from East-Central Europe aiming to adopt the euro between 2010 and 2013 (Gabrisch and Kämpfe 2013) failed because the countries were hit by the global financial crisis, which interrupted and delayed monetary convergence and compelled national central banks to pursue a more flexible monetary policy. Therefore, it seems necessary to assess a central bank’s ability to affect money markets against the background of both calm and turbulent market periods. The research question formulated above means that I abstract from the possible causes of absent monetary policy independence (e.g., low central bank credibility). These issues are the subject of a different strand of the literature. The study is organized as follows. Section II discusses the recent literature on the subject of monetary policy independence of non-EMU countries. Section III examines the properties of the data series and provides justification for using the GARCH testing. Section IV presents the model specification for testing the multivariate in-mean GARCH model with and without coefficient restrictions (IGARCH). Estimation results are presented and discussed in Section V. Section VI summarizes the analysis and contains some policy implications. I find that euro adoption would not impair de-facto policy independence of the central banks of Sweden, Poland, and Romania. Their central banks would gain more influence on the money markets through the monetary decisions of the ECB. I conclude for the UK, Czech Republic, and Hungary that their central banks would lose more influence than they would gain.",3

Price stability is defined by the ECB Governing Council as a growth rate in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) of close to, but below, 2 %. This is to be upheld over the medium-term. The two-pillar strategy refers to economic (Pillar 1) and monetary (Pillar 2) analysis that informs policy rate decisions made by the Governing Council.Footnote 1 Pillar 1 takes into account the main factors that affect price developments in both the short- and medium-term and its main emphasis is on real economic activity. Pillar 2 is mainly concerned with the long-run relationship between money and prices and, therefore, undertakes comprehensive analysis of monetary and credit developments in the Area. Since its relegation to pillar 2, the main emphasis of the monetary analysis has been on the fundamentals of the monetary aggregates, such as the role of cross-border portfolio flows. Many economic commentators have argued that central banks are partly to be blamed for the financial crisis, with allegations that short-term price stability was favoured at the expense of excessive debt growth. For example, in the Euro Area, despite the ECB’s Pillar 2 strategy, it has been argued that too little was done to curb credit growth prior to the crisis, and that the ECB as an institution focused too much on price stability. This alleged institutional bias was seemingly evident when the ECB raised its policy rate in the face of global financial panic in July 2008 and in 2011 in the face of the Euro Area sovereign debt crisis. However, the decisions had to be reversed in both cases. In contributing to the debate on the ECB’s behaviour in setting the policy rate, this paper focuses on analysis that provides quantitative insights into the aforementioned qualitative argument proposed by commentators by investigating the ECB’s monetary policy reaction function during the periods before and after the crisis. However, it is worthwhile to distinguish between monetary policy reaction function and monetary policy strategy. A central bank’s monetary policy strategy refers to analysis and criteria determining how monetary policy decisions are made to achieve the underlying stated objective(s). A monetary policy reaction function, on the other hand, outlines the response of the central bank’s policy decisions (short-term interest rate changes) to changes in economic variables such as the output gap and inflation. The monetary policy reaction function can thus be thought of as a way of modelling a central bank’s monetary policy strategy. Therefore, the focus of this paper is on the ECB’s reaction function vis-a-vis its two-pillar monetary policy strategy. Arguably, the most well-known reaction function is the Taylor rule, introduced by Taylor (1993). However, a similar reaction function was also proposed by Henderson and McKibbin (1993). Taylor’s (1993) rule was, specifically, for the US economy, which matches the Fed’s dual mandate for optimising both price stability and employment. Numerous variations of the reaction functions have been adopted that seek to provide a better fit based on economic theory, empirical works or based on different central banks’ mandates. Taylor (1999) discusses some earlier alternative rules, while Nikolsko-Rzhevskyy and Papell (2011) provide an updated discussion. From a European perspective, Peersman and Smets (1999) demonstrate that a Taylor style rule provides a good fit of an aggregated Euro Area model using data from the period 1979–1997. Other papers have sought to address the differences between the ECB policy and that of the European central banks before the introduction of the Euro, e.g. the Bundesbank. For instance, Faust et al. (2001) concluded that the ECB placed more emphasis on the output gap and less on inflation than the Bundesbank. Gerdesmeier and Roffia (2003) extended this work by incorporating different output gap definitions and a measure of monetary growth. They found that monetary growth is significant in an ECB reaction function and has the effect of reducing the coefficients of the output gap and inflation. Gerdesmeier and Roffia (2003) interpret this as the monetary variable contains additional insight that not fully reflected in forecasts, which is in line with the ECB’s cross-checking strategy. Carstensen (2006) identifies various works, which analyse the ECB’s behaviour and draw a significant conclusion that, unlike the Taylor-rule analysis of other countries, inflation is often found to be of little or no statistical significance.Footnote 2 Instead, the output gap variable is found to have a strong positive coefficient and statistical significance. In a same vein, Belke and Polleit (2007), who analysed the policy setting behaviours of the ECB and the US Fed, also came to the same conclusion that the ECB placed lighter weight on inflation than output compared to the Fed. Gerlach (2007) suggests that this is because the ECB viewed inflation over the period as of temporary nature, believing that the current output gap is a more important determinant of actual future inflation. However, this explanation might not be entirely satisfactory as the evidence on this is unclear. An alternative explanation was provided by Belke and Polleit (2007), who argue that the lighter weight placed on inflation by the bank might be due to the fact that inflation during the period was very low. This seems to be more plausible as the period prior to the financial crisis was known as the great moderation period due to the low inflation and output volatility recorded. Gerlach (2007) finds an important distinction between the ECB’s reaction function and those of other central banks, in that subjective measure of output such as the European Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) and the ECB’s own GDP forecasts have a higher statistical significance than statistically estimations of output gap. Gerlach (2007) also concurs with the findings of Heinemann and Ulrich (2005) that, in addition to other variables, the ECB also responds to the growth of the area’s nominal effective exchange rate (NEER). Reaction functions have also been applied to analyse the ECB’s response to the recent crisis. Gorter et al. (2009) compare reaction functions prior to the crisis with functions incorporating a full sample and report that the coefficient on inflation increases in the crisis years. Gerlach and Lewis (2010) look at the issue of setting policy rates in the face of the zero-lower-bound (ZLB). They conclude that rates were cut quicker in 2008 and 2009 than suggested by a pre-crisis reaction function. Furthermore, they note that the overnight rate, EONIA, which historically is correlated with the policy rate, was pushed much lower due to the unconventional monetary measures, such as liquidity support implemented by the bank. They conclude that this an evidence that the ECB was acting according to the literature relating to the monetary policy in the face of the ZLB.Footnote 3 Gerlach (2003) and Cukierman and Gerlach (2003) introduce the idea of ‘recession aversion’, suggesting an asymmetric reaction function in which deviations below potential output are treated more seriously than deviations above. The empirical analysis undertaken by this paper is concerned with a typical reaction function of the ECB and contributes to the existing literature in two ways. First, in addition to obtaining estimates for the full sample period, the sample is split into pre- and crisis periods using a structural break test. Estimates for the two sub-sample periods are carried out and compared with the whole period’s results. This enables us to separate the analysis into whether the ECB’s interest setting behaviour changed during the crisis or not, and which factors were more important in influencing the bank’s monetary policy strategy in each. Second, and in contrast to previous studies, the analysis includes both positive and negative rate changes as its dependent variable. This allows for a cross check on previous findings that suggest the ECB’s rate setting policy behaviour may be asymmetric, such as only considering the inflation variable during a tightening cycle. Similarly, by separating the dependant variable and the time periods, analysis can be made regarding the extent to which this asymmetry may also have changed. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses “new theory” on international monetary policy inter-dependence as a results of the financial crisis. Section 3 provides a detailed account of the model choice, specifications and the data used in the analysis. Section 4 presents the econometric estimates while Sect. 5 concludes.",2

Indeed the European Economic Community (EEC) was financed under a system of national contributions (Article 200 EEC) that was phased out by the Own Resources Decision of April 1970, which prepared the way for the enlargement of the EEC to the UK. In 2003, the Sapir Report called for a reduction in the ‘relative weight of national contributions … in favour of revenue sources with a clear EU dimension’ (Sapir 2003: 166). The intention was to move away from the concept of juste retour or net balances that had become gradually entrenched since the UK had joined the EEC. It is net balances that lead wealthier contributor Member States to limit the budget, while protecting clienteles that benefit from redistribution such as the agricultural sector. This means that the EU cannot prioritise policy to meet collective needs or to respond rapidly to changing or unforeseen eventualities, in other words to provide a Europe-wide budget other than to the limited extent that applies to research and development (R&D), education, or Connecting Europe (the programme for communications and other network infrastructures) under Heading 1a, which accounts for 13 percent of expenditure, to freedom, security, justice, and citizenship, which amount to 3 per cent of expenditure, and to foreign policy priorities which amount to a further 6 per cent. The view of Sapir (2003) was that changes to the form of the EU’s revenue away from contributions based predominantly on gross national income (GNI) would solve the problems of net balances and make the budget more responsive. In December 2013, the EU’s High Level Group on Own Resources (HLGOR), chaired by Mario Monti, was empowered to investigate and propose reforms to the EU’s revenue. Reforms have been achieved in the past, starting in 1970. This paper evaluates those reforms that were always passed as package deals and affected expenditure and other policy commitments such as enlargement of EU membership. They also saw division about what sort of revenue should be raised and who would have control over it. The findings apply to the current period, with particular reference to the HLGOR, and to net balances given the British decision to leave the EU. The historic experience of the British rebate provides a lesson on package deals and the management of national issues in the budget. The report of the HLGOR came at a time of challenge for the EU. The own resources agreements of 1970 and 1988 occurred when the bargaining power of the groups and states focused on the status quo came to be eclipsed by the power of a coalition for change, when the political and economic costs of the status quo exceeded those of the reform, and when small adaptive changes failed to ease pressure on the system (Lindner 2006: 169). The current state of health of the EU is one in which the political and economic costs of change may well be lower than perpetuating the net balance mentality. This paper traces the path of the reforms to the EU’s own resources from 1970 until 1988, and considers the current reform agenda. In doing so, it draws on process tracing (Checkel 2006, 2008), and the historical institutionalist approach used by Lindner (2006) for analysing the EU’s budgetary conflicts of the 1970s and 1980s. The paper applies these with regard only to the EU’s revenue, with respect also to the positions of the European Commission and the European Parliament. Although their influence on the EU’s revenue is limited, these latter institutions have the power to set agendas when revenue and expenditure reforms are linked. Finally, the paper explores the current reform agenda.",4

Unsurprisingly, much of the attention has been given to outcomes visible in the US labour market, considering primarily the effects of offshoring to such developing countries as Mexico (e.g., Sethupathy 2013), China or India (e.g. Liu and Trefler 2008), or to the results of occupational exposure to globalization due to rising import competition from China and other developing countries (e.g. Autor et al. 2013; Ebenstein et al. 2014; Acemoglu et al. 2014). Similar analyses have been performed to assess the offshoring response of labour markets in single advanced Western European countries (e.g. UK: Amiti and Wei 2005; Austria: Egger and Egger 2003; Belgium: Michel and Rycx 2012; Denmark: Hummels et al. 2014; Germany: Geishecker and Görg 2008; Baumgarten et al. 2013). Many factors can affect wages.Footnote 3 In this paper, we focus on the industry-level response of wages paid in domestic industries (in which imported inputs are employed) to offshoring, in particular to low-wage countries (LWC).Footnote 4 However, as will be explained, we adopt a much wider perspective than that taken so far. Before describing our contribution, we will shed some light on the existing related evidence. Given the scope of our paper, we leave aside country-specific analyses based on worker-level or firm-level micro-data—as surveyed in Crinò (2009) or Castellani et al. (2015). Focusing on industry-level studies, most papers address the impact of the international sourcing of inputs on industry-level outcomes in terms of reduced employment/overall labour demand (e.g. Amiti and Wei 2005 for the UK; Acemoglu et al. 2014 for the US; Cadarso et al. 2008 for Spain; Falk and Wolfmayr 2005, 2008 for a small sample of EU countries; Hijzen and Swaim 2007 for 17 OECD countries; Michel and Rycx 2012 for Belgium). Overall, most of these studies tend to fail to support the view that substantial statistically significant job losses can be observed at the industry level directly due to offshoring. Import competition in industries exposed to foreign competition can have a stronger impact, as illustrated in a study by Acemoglu et al. (2014)—their estimates suggest net job losses in the US of 2.0–2.4 million stemming from the rise in import competition from China over the period 1999–2011. Additionally, the impact of offshoring on changes in the skill composition of labour demand has been analysed, pointing towards a negative influence on the demand for less skilled workers. Regarding wider panel data studies, Foster-McGregor et al. (2013) employ WIOD data (40 countries, 1995–2009) and find that medium-skilled workers suffer the most in terms of shrinking labour demand as a response to offshoring (similar effects are documented in Timmer et al. 2013). Offshoring of services also appears to raise the relative demand for high- and medium-skilled workers (see Crinò 2012, covering 20 industries and nine Western EU countries over 1990–2004). Is the source of imports important when assessing the labour market effects of offshoring? Egger and Egger (2003) introduced a crucial distinction between offshoring to low-wage and high-wage countries, while Bernard et al. (2006) distinguished between imports from high-income versus low-income countries. Since then, a division of offshoring by the source country has been employed in other studies too, including ones performed at the industry level. Despite conventional worries, Falk and Wolfmayr (2005) estimate that rising intermediate imports from low-wage countries may account for a relatively small reduction in manufacturing employment of only 0.25 percentage points per year in their sample of seven EU countries (1995–2000), while a study by Falk and Wolfmayr (2008) finds no significant effect of services purchased from low-wage countries on manufacturing employment. There is not so much broad evidence on the effects of offshoring on wages. The recent micro-level papers investigating the impact of international outsourcing on the wages of individual workers are country-specific and limited to countries with good access to micro-data (such as the US: Ebenstein et al. 2014; Autor et al. 2014; Germany: Geishecker and Görg 2008; Denmark: Hummels et al. 2014; UK: Geishecker and Görg 2013) or limited to very small samples of countries. Again, contrary to common fears, the estimated wage cuts due to outsourcing appear to be rather small in economic terms.Footnote 5 For instance, Geishecker et al. (2010) use data for Germany, the UK and Denmark (1991–1999) and find a small negative and weakly statistically significant effect of offshoring on wages in Germany, a positive effect in the UK and no statistically significant effect in Denmark. When they consider different skill categories of workers, a negative effect found only for Germany accrues to low-skilled workers (but it is smallFootnote 6) while for low-skilled UK and Danish workers they cannot identify any outsourcing effect. For the UK, a sizable negative and statistically significant wage effect stems only from outsourcing to CEEC but it vanishes when put in the perspective of real data.Footnote 7 In their industry-level study performed for a wide sample of EU27 countries, Parteka and Wolszczak-Derlacz (2015) also conclude that offshoring reduces the wage growth of domestic medium- and low-skilled workers. However, they show that this negative effect is economically small. Building upon the existing literature briefly summarized above, our aim is to provide worldwide evidence on the offshoring-wage nexus using industry-level data and hopefully complementing the existing studies performed at other levels of detail but limited along the country dimension. We aim to fill some important gaps in the related empirical literature. First, we consider a long panel of industrial data (13 manufacturing industries in 40 countries over the period 1995–2009Footnote 8) derived from the World Input–Output Database (WIOD—Timmer et al. 2015) which covers between 82 and 96 % of the international trade in intermediate goods (depending on the sector and year of analysis). We thus provide representative evidence on the global trends in offshoring and, in contrast to the many country-level studies, exploit its wage effects in a multi-country setting. Moreover, given the crucial heterogeneity of workers in international trade analysis (Grossman 2013), we consider the wages of three skill groups separately (low, medium and highly skilled), focusing on the effects on the workers who are potentially most at danger—the low and medium skilled ones. Even though WIOD has already been used (in a more restricted manner) in some related studies (e.g. Foster-McGregor et al. 2013; Schwörer 2013; Parteka and Wolszczak-Derlacz 2015), to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that the response of skill-specific wages to offshoring has been analysed in a worldwide cross-country perspective over a significant time period. In addition, while we correlate the wage levels of workers with offshoring intensity, we decompose the latter by country of origin.Footnote 9 This is done in order to explicitly check for the effects of offshoring to developingFootnote 10 and low-wage countries (LWC) on domestic wages. In particular, we use four alternative LWC classifications.Footnote 11 Importantly, we go beyond standard very rough groupings of LWC based on comparisons of income per capita or an arbitrary attribution of countries to the low-wage category. Due to the use of industry-level wage data, we obtain flexible classification of LWC over time and by industry. Moreover, drawing on bilateral input–output tables, we directly split imported inputs according to the country of origin of the imports (rather than using a proportional method based on shares of total imports, which is employed instead of using tables of imports by country of origin, as in Falk and Wolfmayr 2008; Hertveldt and Michel 2013). We also allow for changes in the relative positions of LWC over time, and the existence of industry-specific wage advantages. Finally, we adopt a decomposition of conventional overall offshoring measures (calculated—in the spirit of Feenstra and Hanson 1999—as the sum of imported inputs related to the total value of production of the industry in which they are used) into purely international and domestic components. As Castellani et al. (2013) argue, typical measures of offshoring tend to overestimate the role of international components (imported inputs) and neglect the role played by structural changes and flows of intermediates within the domestic economy. Consequently, the adopted decomposition allows us to distinguish between the wage effects of the international component of outsourcing and the effects of domestic outsourcing practices. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In Sect. 2, we present the data used in our empirical analysis, and in Sect. 3 we present some crucial facts concerning the trends in offshoring and wages in the period analysed. Section 4 focuses on the estimated empirical model. Results are presented in Sect. 5 starting from the most general setting and then taking into account specificities of source countries and destination countries. Endogeneity in the wage-offshoring relationship is addressed through the use of a gravity-based instrument. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes. In a nutshell, the main results of our analysis are the following. We document that in the period analysed the intensity of manufacturing offshoring to LWC rose (on average) from 0.025 to 0.075 of the industry value added. However, we find that increasing offshoring (in particular to LWC) is related to a decrease in the industry-level wages of domestic low- and medium-skill workers, but this effect, albeit statistically significant, is relatively small. We estimate that, ceteris paribus, a rise in offshoring to LWC of 1 % can be associated with a decline in domestic low (medium) skill workers’ wages of approximately 0.08 % (0.07 %).Footnote 12

The debt crisis in the Eurozone alerted both policy-makers and economists to the fact that government defaults are not exclusively a problem of developing countries. With few exceptions, all major Western economies have seen their public debts rise faster than their national incomes and, if current demographic trends are to persist, a rise in age-related government expenditures will impose more and more pressure on public budgets in the future. Uncertainty about the future growth outlook adds to concerns about the ability of governments to service their debts. In addition, the Eurozone debt crisis has demonstrated that governments of high-debt nations who do not control the currency in which their liabilities are denominated are particularly vulnerable to swings in investor expectations. It is thus crucial to study debt sustainability through the lens of a model that incorporates both the historical record of fiscal policy and exogenous shocks related to the above concerns. Projections of future public debt face several uncertainties. First, there is policy uncertainty regarding the future development of the tax system and government spending. Second, even if one assumes no changes in tax and spending policies, there is economic uncertainty which must be taken into account. The growth rate of GDP, demographic changes as well as the interest rate at which the government can borrow are part of the economic environment which directly or indirectly affects a country’s public finances. Since this economic environment is subject to random influences, assessing the sustainability of a country’s debt requires an estimation of the (joint) probability distribution of the country’s economic fundamentals and its public debt level. This paper uses a model developed by Hall (2014) to characterize the long-run distribution of public debt and applies it to the case of Austria. This distribution is derived from a Markov chain model of the debt-GDP ratio and several key macroeconomic variables. The primary advantage of this method is that it generates not only a point prediction of the debt level but gives probabilities of tail events such as an abrupt increase in the debt-GDP ratio above a given threshold. It provides a theory-based empirical test of government debt sustainability insofar as the existence of a stable long-run distribution (a stochastic steady-state) rules out the possibility of an exploding public debt-GDP ratio which would violate the government’s intertemporal budget constraint. Our paper departs from Hall (2014) by proposing a novel way to estimate the transition probabilities of the underlying Markov chain. When the sample size of observed state transitions is small, “conventional” maximum likelihood methods may run into problems. We take a (partially) Bayesian approach that incorporates prior information about the transition probabilities obtained from observed state transitions in foreign countries which helps to alleviate the small-sample concerns. Having a convincing estimate of the transition probabilities is crucial since they heavily affect the stationary distribution of the Markov chain. Our estimation approach is not fully Bayesian, as we do not estimate all the unknown model parameters jointly from the data, but calibrate some of them relying on previous literature. The case of Austria is interesting for two reasons. First, Austria is in many respects a typical Eurozone country—both in terms of GDP growth and debt-GDP ratio—and can thus be seen as representative for the Eurozone. Second, Austria has had a fairly long tradition of “activist” fiscal policy which has raised concerns about long-run debt sustainability (Haber and Neck 2008). These concerns have been heightened during the recent financial crisis when the Austrian government stepped in to support the national banking sector leading public debt to exceed 80% of GDP. This raises the question whether the recent spike in Austria’s debt level implies a persistent threat to government solvency or should be seen as a transitory phenomenon instead. The main focus of this paper is to find and describe the stationary distribution of the debt-GDP ratio under different assumptions about the behavior of fiscal policy and future macroeconomic developments. The stationary debt distribution can be interpreted in two ways: It characterizes the uncertainty about the debt-GDP ratio in the long run conditional on present information about fiscal policy and the state of the economy. Alternatively, it can be viewed as the distribution of the debt-GDP ratio at randomly selected future dates. In addition to calculating the stationary distribution, we use our model to perform medium-run forecasts of the debt-GDP ratio based on various scenarios. The rest of the paper is in five sections. The next section provides a brief overview of the existing literature on testing debt sustainability. Section 3 describes and discusses the setup of our empirical model. Section 4 explains our estimation approach. In Sect. 5 we apply our model to the case of Austria and present the debt projections for different scenarios derived from our model. The conclusion summarizes the main findings of the paper.",4

From early classical trade theory on, where equalized factor prices follow from factors moving to the location with the highest marginal product (Samuelson 1948), the literature has created numerous strands on the possibility of migration’s ability to do so. Prominent examples which are still under investigation are differentials in wages levels, country and/or sector-wise, unemployment rates, or income per capita growth. Conclusions are ambiguous, depending on the data, theoretical foundation, and also econometric methods. Geographically, until some 30 years ago, research concentrated mainly on country-level data, perhaps mostly due to limited data availability and interest of policy makers. However, this interest also moved towards sub-national levels, probably for the same reasons. At the latest the establishment of the European Union created the necessity of investigating these questions sub-nationally, considering far-reaching regional policy targets with around one third of the total EU budget (approximately €352 billion from 2014 to 2020) spent on cohesion policy.Footnote 1 Relevant contributions dealing with the impact of migration on regional differentials are numerous. Dustmann et al. (2008) discuss the role of immigrants’ skills in determining the wage effects on native skill groups. Within the same skill group, if workers are seen as substitutes independently of their origin, immigration should naturally lead to falling wages due to increased supply, and may also exert pressure on natives to leave the labor market (Borjas 2003). In extent, migration from low- to high-wage regions/countries should let wage differentials clear out (Borjas 2001). As a counterexample, consider the evolution of relative real gross value added (GVA) per employee and movements in Austrian NUTS 3 regions, which form the base for the empirical part of this paper, depicted in Figs. 1 and 2. Even though the variation in GVA per employee declined from roughly 18.5% in 1980 to about 13% in the year 2001, it has since been steadily increasing until 2014. For the spread, the minimum lies in 2007, but paints a similar picture. Over the period from 2002 to 2014, thus, the distribution of real GVA per employee has become more unequal, despite a steady increas in within-as well as between movements.Footnote 2 Variation (SD) and the spread (maximum–minimum) of real relative-yearwise—GVA per employee in Austrian NUTS 3 regions Resettlements in Austrian NUTS 3 regions with and without inner-region resettlements On unemployment, Basile et al. (2012) detect a negative relationship between net-migration and unemployment rates for Italian NUTS 3 regions, a result which is also confirmed in a recent investigation that additionally accounts for human capital flows that come with migration (Basile et al. 2016). In contrast, Niebuhr et al. (2012) conclude that migration in fact reduces disparities for German NUTS 3 regions. Recently, Granato et al. (2015) find opposing effects of migration of high- and lower-skilled workers in German functional labor market regions, where high-skilled (lower-skilled) migration would lead to increasing (decreasing) disparities in regional unemployment rates. Still, the overall picture suggests that the impact of labor mobility on unemployment is negligible (Okkerse 2008). On regional income growth rates, Barro and Sala-i Martin (1992) in one of the most-cited contributions on this topic, conclude that ‘we showed that exogenous changes in migration seem to be unimportant in explaining the process of interregional convergence’ (p. 28). Fischer and Pfaffermayr (2017), though, find accelerated \(\sigma\)-convergence across European NUTS 2 regions through migration. Looking again at regions within particular countries, Fratesi and Riggi (2007) find that similar to unemployment, migration increases disparities regarding income per capita in Italian regions. Opposingly, Kırdar and Saracoğlu (2008) conclude that migration in fact promotes convergence. These examples should clarify that labor mobility is a reoccurring, widely discussed, and also disputed topic. The majority of contributions also recognizes concerns of possible endogeneity of migration as explanatory factor. Contradictory conclusions may also indicate a mere unrelatedness between migratory flows and economic indicators, especially considering a possible publication bias. Finding and defining the determinants of regional migration is a branch of literature on its own, and will be reviewed in the next section. Since it is well known that the majority of movements happens within national borders, an exploration of what makes more people take off to one particular region than to another when facing a set of possible destinations seems vital. This study attempts to raise attention towards two rather neglected questions in the discussion. First, an elicitation of regional migration costs is currently unattainable to the best of the author’s knowledge. Second, this study provides support to the notion that (aggregate) regional migration flows appear detached from economic disparities. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, the literature on the determinants of migration will discussed, broken down into international and regional investigations. Bilateral studies predominantly follow gravity-type approaches, and therefore the focus is on that branch of the literature. Section 3 introduces a simple multi-regional dynamic discrete choice model leaning on Artuç (2013). Section 4 explains the estimation strategy and presents the case of Austrian regional migration. Sections 5 and 6 present estimation results and concluding remarks.",4

European policy still struggles with the economic crisis in the south of Europe, and the crises of the Euro and sovereign debt have not yet been solved. Fiscal policy has been in the center of the debate then and now. On the one hand, with the state controlling or directly affecting about 40% of GDP, the budget certainly affects GDP and its fluctuations. Moreover, fiscal policy is also likely to affect long-run growth prospects within an economy. On the other hand, the budget is heavily affected by GDP, since both sides—realized government revenues and government expenditures—depend on economic outcome, i.e., the GDP. The Kreisky period is interesting to study in this respect, because during Kreisky’s reign strong external shocks sent the Austrian economy into its first severe crisis in 25 years. These short-run shocks were coupled with long-run structural changes, i.e., the end of the catching-up growth period after World War II and the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system. While the set of problems today is of course not identical with those in the 1970s and early 1980s, with the virtue of hindsight, there is much to learn from this period. An examination of this economic era might sharpen the view on the current challenges, especially since the current malaise has again put fiscal policy at the center of the debate. We focus in our study on GDP forecasts and forecast errors as well as changes in GDP, something that is hard to harness for insights regarding optimal responses of fiscal policy to today’s challenges. We do this nevertheless because it is important to separate “policy failures”Footnote 1 and incomplete information about the future path of the complex economic system from each other. That is necessary in order to give justice to the policy makers at the time and to their decisions about the policy-driven part in the process that resulted in public deficits. Moreover, discussing the complex system of several macroeconomic variables even in such a reduced form as we do it here has a value in itself. With respect to the current situation in Austria and Europe, we argue that simple debt-over-GDP measures are not very helpful to judge the “success” of fiscal policy.",2

This, however, depends at the same time on the state of health the individuals of working age have achieved. Poor health depresses productivity and earnings, good health improves both. This matters on a societal as on an individual level. Poor health affects the financial resources available to the household and it reduces the contribution the population of working age can make in terms of gross value added to the economy at large. The aggregate impact of poor health, or for that matter of good health, has been analysed in the context of comparative studies (Weil 2007) and national accounting analyses (Atkinson 2005). The individual impact has been looked at in empirical studies on the relationship between the incidence of a morbidity (or an accident) and the resulting change in labour market behaviour: participation, wages, earnings (Garcia-Gomez et al. 2013; Halla and Zweimüller 2013). Such studies use an unforeseen event of medical relevance as the “cause” for explaining observable changes in individual labour market results (compared to a control group). Once you move from the incidence of a morbidity to its prevalence as the unit of observation, a “causality” issue arises: An unfavourable socio-economic position could be the “cause” of an accumulating individual burden of morbidity; the so called “gradient” of the prevalence of morbidities (Cutler et al. 2011). Our paper addresses the gradient issue in two ways: First, we control for the level of education of the individual; education as the major determinant of socio-economic status in adult life. Since we restrict our analysis to age groups for whom the level of education is already fixed, it is (as a proxy of socio-economic status) exogenous to our analysis. Second, we have run our equations additionally in a way that would reflect “reversed causation”. This is documented in the appendix. The “reversed causation” specification is rather poor and has little explanatory power in a descriptive sense. There are several ways to conceptualize and measure the “state of health” of an individual. The household production perspective looks at “health” as a stock, in which individuals invest and which depreciates as a function of age (Bolin 2011, originating from Grossman 1972). Studies using survey data base their concepts of health on the self-assessment of the person asked; further validation of this assessment can be gained from survey items on health related behaviour. (Jäckie and Himmler 2010; Ben Halima and Rococo 2014) Our analysis takes a different approach. It looks at the frequency and intensity of healthcare interventions by general practitioners, specialists, hospitals; it makes use of leaves of absence and prescriptions. This is done for a population of permanent residents of Lower Austria. Each individual is assigned an index value for the interaction with the health care system. This index for the interaction with the health care system is used to augment the standard wage/earnings function. The advantages and limitations of this index will be discussed in Sect. 3 below. The paper proceeds from a description of the data, to the construction of the Health Care Interaction index, to the estimation methods chosen, and to a discussion of the empirical results (Table 1).",

Already in the 19th century, such an association had been founded, the Gesellschaft österreichischer Volkswirte (that is, Association of Austrian Economists), which remained active well into the 1950s. The majority of its up to 300 members came from industry and banking, and it mainly focused on contributions to the economic policy debates of the time. Consequently most of its presidents were both luminaries of the Austrian economics community and involved in economic policy-making: Lorenz von Stein (1888–1890), the statistician Theodor Inama von Sternegg (1891–1896), the economist Eugen von Philippovich (1897–1909), Ernst von Plener, a liberal politician and minister of finance (1910–1925), Richard Reisch, minister of finance and president of the Austrian central bank (1925–1937), and finally the banker Ernst Mosing (1945–1956).Footnote 2 Somewhat in contrast, the bylaws of the NOeG identified as its fields of activity the fostering of theoretical economics by organizing lectures and discussions and by publishing papers. Apparently, the NOeG aimed at a smaller audience and at discussion within the group of acadamic economists rather than public recognition. This differed markedly from other Viennese societies, like the Vienna Soziologische Gesellschaft or the Österreichische Politische Gesellschaft (see e.g. Müller 2018; Morgenbrod 1994). The composition of the newly elected board also mirrored this emphasis. Besides the president Joseph Schumpeter, it consisted of Hans Mayer (vice-president), Karl Pribram (secretary), Ludwig von Mises (treasurer), and the ordinary members of the board Alfred Amonn, Moritz Dub, Viktor Grätz and Othmar Spann.Footnote 3 Most of the board members belonged to the younger generation and were to some extent affiliated with what had become to be known as the “Austrian School of Economics”. This is noteworthy insofar as German-language economics in the interwar period has been characterized as lacking a dominant paradigm (see e.g. Köster 2011). Rather, the economists teaching at the universities propagated a variety of approaches, ranging from adherence to the remnants of the German Historical School or mere eclecticism to the propagation of “autochthonous messages” (Schumpeter 1954, 1154). (Spann may be mentioned as a typical example of the latter.) This diagnosis certainly applied to the Austrian economics community, too. In particular, in the postwar period outside Vienna, at the Universities of Graz and Innsbruck, the Austrian School played only a limited role. The Austrian School as a distinct theoretical approach to economic and social phenomena derived from Carl Menger’s Grundsätze der Volkswirtschaftslehre (1871). Its main pillars consisted in a subjectivist theory of value and the explanation of social institutions as the (unintended) result of individual action. However, the school’s success was as much based on Menger’s foundation as on its development by Friedrich von Wieser and Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, its second generation. While Wieser integrated Menger’s approach into a general analytical framework, Böhm-Bawerk developed a theory of capital based on the notion of time-consuming production. Menger had taught at the Faculty of Law of the University of Vienna until his early retirement in 1903. Wieser had been appointed to a chair in Prague before he moved to Vienna to fill Menger’s vacancy. Böhm-Bawerk after teaching for some time in Innsbruck served as Minister of Finance in various Austrian cabinets and eventually was appointed professor of economics at Vienna, where he taught and led the famous “serminar” until his death in 1914. Another important figure teaching in Vienna was Eugen von Philippovich, who combined the Austrian approach in economic theory with policy views more in line with the German “socialists of the chair”; he deceased in 1917. When, in the same year, Wieser left the university for the position of Minister of Trade in the last cabinets of the Monarchy, the only professor to represent economics at the faculty was the Austromarxist and economic historian Carl Grünberg. Thus a change of the guard appeared to be imminent. It fits this picture that the members of the Austrian School active in the NOeG all belonged to its third generation. (Moritz Dub, an economic journalist at the Neue Freie Presse, and Victor Grätz were the sole members of the NOeG board from outside academia.) The most prominent was certainly Joseph Schumpeter. At the time, he occupied an economics chair at the University of Graz and was the author of two books that had provoked his colleagues: In his habilitation thesis Schumpeter (1908) argued for a positivist methodological foundation of economics instead of introspection. And in his path-breaking theory of economic development (Schumpeter 1911), by introducing the notion of entrepreneurial innovation as the engine of progress, he attempted to shift the focus of economic analysis from statics to dynamics. In this sense, Schumpeter from the very outset was something like an outsider to the Austrian School. In 1918 he was busy in political activities in Vienna, and after the demise of the Monarchy became for a short period Secretary (that is, Minister) of Finance in the First Republic. Hans Mayer studied in Vienna under the supervision from Wieser. He concentrated in his research on special problems of Austrian value theory, e.g. on imputation and on the substantive laws of marginal utility. He planned to apply for a venia legendiFootnote 4 in Vienna, but accepted a call at a chair in Fribourg, before he had finished his thesis—in effect he never finished it. In 1914 he was appointed professor at the Technische Hochschule in Prague. Like his colleagues, Spann, Amonn and Mises, he was transferred during the war to Vienna to serve at the Scientific Committee for the War Economy at the Ministry of War (see Pinwinkler 2003, 84–89). Soon after the war, when Schumpeter had left academia for the banking business, he succeeded him in Graz. Of the remaining members Ludwig von Mises’s main occupation at the time was that of a secretary of the Vienna Chamber of Commerce; Karl Pribram and Viktor Grätz also had been associated with the Chamber for some time. Pribram and Mises held the positions of Privatdozent at the University of Vienna. In particular, in his thesis Mises (1912) applied the Austrian approach to the problems of money and thus laid the basis for “Austrian business cycle theory”, later on developed by Friedrich Hayek and others. Moreover, Mises—in contrast to Wieser—represented the liberal wing of the Austrian School and propagated this view from his position in the Chamber. Amonn and Spann were teaching at outposts of the Monarchy. Amonn, after his habilitation in Vienna on a subject in the methodology of economics, had taught like Mayer in Fribourg and then succeeded Schumpeter in Czernowitz. Spann had studied in Vienna, done work in empirical sociology in Frankfurt, and then taught at the Technische Hochschule in Brno (Brünn) where he succeeded his teacher Friedrich Gottl-Ottlilieneld. Originally both, Amonn and Spann, regarded themselves as critics within the wider ambit of the Austrian School. However, Spann increasingly fell under the spell of the 19th century economic romantic Adam Müller, and started to put forward his own program of “universalism” in opposition to the Austrians’ “individualism”. In the course of the 1920s this was to become a full-blown, if also obscure system in opposition to the “modernist” views of political and economic liberalism as well as the Marxist idea of class struggle. Spann propagated a corporate state resting on a regulated economy instead of competition, autarky instead of free trade, hierarchy instead of equality, and the rule of the elites instead of the rule of the masses—votes must be weighed, not counted, as Spann maintained. When the NOeG came into existence, Spann was just contemplating the prospect of his move from Brno to Vienna. Amonn, who had to leave Czernowitz after the war, taught for some years at the German University of Prague. Eventually, in the postwar period, the vacancies at the Vienna faculty were filled: While there was no successor to Böhm, after a short guest performance by Max Weber, in 1919 Spann succeeded Philippovich, Grünberg was raised to a full professorship, and Wieser returned to his chair for five more years.",4

One may recall papers by Ludwig Mises on socialist calculation, by Gottfried Haberler on international trade theory, by Adolf Löwe, Oskar Morgenstern, Friedrich Hayek and others on business cycle theory, or by Paul Rosenstein-Rodan, Karl Menger and Oskar Morgenstern on the role of time, uncertainty, and expectations (Klausinger 2016). In the present paper, I want to draw attention to three outstanding NOeG presentations on the laws of costs and returns and the construction of long-run industry supply curves. In the early 1930s this was a topical theme because of the criticisms that the treatment of these issues by Alfred Marshall had drawn in the so-called “cost controversies” of the 1920s. These debates, which took place mainly in the pages of the Economic Journal, had been completely ignored in the German-language area until Oskar Morgenstern took up this issue in a long review article which he presented at two consecutive NOeG meetings in January and February 1930 (Morgenstern 1931). On Morgenstern’s initiative, Jacob Viner then delivered his famous paper on “Cost curves and supply curves” at a further NOeG meeting in September 1930. Viner’s seminal contribution, which Morgenstern managed to secure for the Zeitschrift für Nationalökonomie (ZfN), provided a rigorous geometrical derivation of industry supply curves from the firms’ cost situations in competitive conditions, and became the springboard for numerous further contributions. In December 1935, the mathematician Karl Menger then severely criticized the axiomatic acceptance of the law of diminishing returns by showing that the existing a priori “proofs” of this alleged “law”, put forward by authors such as Böhm-Bawerk, Wicksell, Mises and others, were invalid. Menger was instigated to his contribution by discussions in the NOeG following the presentations of Morgenstern and Viner, and it was Morgenstern also who channeled the resulting (two-partite) paper into the ZfN for publication (see Menger 1936a, b; the two parts were later published together in a revised English translation as Menger 1954 and, in a slightly revised version, as Menger 1979).Footnote 1 The connecting link between the contributions of Morgenstern, Viner, and Menger is their common concern with the role of diminishing returns in the explanation of long-run industry supply curves with increasing costs. Accordingly, the present paper has been organised as follows. Section 2 briefly summarizes Morgenstern’s review article, focusing attention in particular on the problems relating to the construction of long-run industry supply curves with rising supply prices.Footnote 2 In Sect. 3, Viner’s 1931 article on “Cost curves and supply curves” is re-examined, with the main focus being, again, on the construction of upward-sloping industry supply curves in a partial equilibrium setting. Section 4 then turns to the discussion of Karl Menger’s “Remarks on the law of diminishing returns” (1979 [1936a, b]), and Sect. 5 offers some conclusions.",4

This is especially true for those Austrian scientists who belonged to the large group of people persecuted by the Nazis for “racial”, political or other reasons. This period also contributed to the intellectual demise of Austrian academia, which had already started at the end of the Habsburg monarchy, continued in the First Republic with a lack of recognition by its right-wing governments and intensified under the Dollfuss-Schuschnigg dictatorship (“Austrofascism” or “Ständestaat”). However, the emergence of the Nazi regime brought about an even more devastating effect for science in Austria. The persecution of “Jewish”Footnote 1 academics started immediately the Nazis came to power (the Anschluss) on March 12, 1938, already prepared by (officially illegal) Austrian Nazi party officials and supporters. While the terror of the new rulers directed at the “Jews” and other minorities was prepared and approved of by too many Austrians, persecution intensified still further on the arrival of the SS and the Secret State Police (Gestapo) following the Anschluss. Among academics, doctors and lawyers were especially victimized because of the relatively large numbers of “Jews” in these professions. Economists proper were but a small group as there was no degree programme in this field; those studying economics had to take a degree in law or political science. Nevertheless, there were a few hundred people trained in economics in Austria in the 1930s, in academia, public administration and business. Most (but not all) of those with scientific interests were members of the Austrian Economic Association (Nationalökonomische Gesellschaft, NÖG), which had been founded after World War I following in the footsteps of a similar organization in the Habsburg Monarchy. Lionel Robbins (1971, p. 91) wrote the following about the NÖG: […] on the morrow of the Anschluss when, to his eternal shame, Hans Mayer, the senior Professor of Economics in the University of Menger, Wieser and Böhm-Bawerk, whom I myself had more than once heard denouncing Hitler and all his works, instead of closing it down as he could honourably have done, expelled the Jewish members from the famous Nationalökonomische Gesellschaft of which he was president. It was the opinion of the writer of this paper, when president of the NÖG, that it constitutes a moral obligation for the organization to deal with the fate of Austrian economists under the Third Reich. He therefore applied to the Jubiläumsfonds of the OeNB (Oesterreichische Nationalbank, the Austrian central bank) for a research project entitled “Austrian Economists during the NS period”, which was funded for the period 2016–2019 and is still work in progress at the time of writing. This paper reports on some preliminary results of this research project on Austrian economists under the Nazi regime from 1938 to 1945. The final results are planned to be published in a book in German (Neck forthcoming), including contributions by Theodor Venus and Hansjörg Klausinger, who also worked on the project.",
46.0,3.0,Empirica,09 April 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10663-018-9403-0,Eliciting permanent and transitory undeclared work from matched administrative and survey data,August 2019,Péter Elek,János Köllő,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Undeclared employment—when the worker is not reported to the authorities and neither the employer nor the employee pay taxes or contributions in the relationship—is notoriously difficult to measure. Survey-based methods rely on information directly provided by the population, but these tend to underestimate the true magnitude of black work, and are strongly affected by cultural differences. For instance, according to the Eurobarometer Survey, only 4% of the EU population responded in 2013 that they had undertaken undeclared paid work in the preceding year (European Commission 2014); the highest rates were recorded in Latvia, the Netherlands, Estonia and Denmark (9–11%), while Southern European countries reported very low rates (1–3% in Malta, Portugal, Cyprus, Italy and Greece).
 Indirect methods estimate total employment with observable proxies, and compare these with reported employment figures to obtain a measure of undeclared work. A wide range of techniques fall into this category,Footnote 1 the most promising being the discrepancy or labour input method, which was advocated by a task force as a methodologically appropriate tool for EU-wide measurement of undeclared work (GHK/FGB 2009). This technique assumes that labour force surveys register most of the undeclared work because individuals are not motivated to conceal their true employment status in an unofficial interview. Hence undeclared work can be approximated by comparing Labour Force Survey (LFS) employment with registered employment figures, which may come from administrative sources or enterprise surveys. This method—in line with other indirect techniques (Schneider 2012)—yields considerably larger estimates of undeclared work than do survey-based methods: e.g. 16–17% of total employment in Hungary between 2001 and 2005 (Elek et al. 2009; Benedek et al. 2013) and 8–30% of various macroeconomic aggregates in European countries.Footnote 2 These estimates do not suffer from the underreporting bias of surveys, but they are generally not suitable for multivariate analysis, because only group-wise comparisons are possible, across dimensions that are available in both data sources. Hence, most analysis using the labour input method provides only sectoral, regional or gender-specific breakdown (GHK/FGB 2009). In this paper, we exploit a unique panel dataset from Hungary that matches self-reported and administrative employment data at the individual level. The data relate to workers who reported at least 2 years of uninterrupted tenure in the jobs they held in January–March 2008, when they were interviewed for the LFS. We assess the pensionable years they accrued in 2001–2006, using quality-checked administrative data provided by the National Pension Insurance Directorate (NPID). The matched data enable us to combine the strengths of the ‘labour input’ method and survey-based methods by analysing the determinants of undeclared work in a multivariate setting. We examine the data with regard to biases stemming from non-random sampling, recall bias on the part of LFS respondents, and technical failures and negligence on the part of employers, the NPID or the postal service. Methodologically, we estimate random-effects (RE) linear and probit models as well as a RE probit model with endogenous selection to account for non-random sampling in the matched panel dataset. These models are estimated with maximum simulated likelihood. As a further advantage, the dataset allows us to separate permanent and transitory non-reporting. We build a two-regime model, where both permanent and transitory non-reporting probabilities depend on the observables, and where transitory non-reporting follows a Markov chain. This model is estimated with maximum likelihood. We find that of those workers who were observed in the sample for 6 years, around 6–7% were never reported; around 3–4% were unreported only once; and around 4% were unreported between two and five times. The econometric estimates (especially those relating to permanently unreported workers) offer support for the hypothesis that the bulk of non-reporting reflects informal employment: in line with other studies, they predict lower reporting rates in, for example, agriculture and transport, various forms of atypical work, among males and in small firms. The two-regime model allows us to examine the consequences of undeclared work on access to health care and pensions. We estimate that about one in ten workers are at risk of receiving only emergency treatment in health care, and about 6% foresee a substantial loss (of 15% or more) in terms of old-age pensions. Our analysis relates to two strands of existing literature. According to the traditional economic approach (Slemrod and Yitzhaki 2002), economic actors make decisions about tax evasion by comparing expected fines and the amount of tax that can be evaded. Therefore, tax evasion is reduced by higher individual risk aversion, stronger deterrence and lower tax rates (Buehn and Schneider 2012). However, it is difficult to explain willingness to pay taxes using the standard economic model—considering the limited risk of being caught and the rates of potential fines—and therefore more recent literature incorporates the effect of the social environment, such as rule following, the need to belong to groups and other interactions (Feld and Larsen 2012; Pickhardt and Prinz 2014). The monopsonistic position of employers and the low bargaining power of employees may also be important (Cichocki and Tyrowicz 2010). Our estimates of differences in undeclared work across gender, level of education, work experience, occupation, place of residence, sector, size and ownership of the employer provide insight into how differences in risk aversion, the expected costs of cheating and social interactions influence the prevalence of undeclared work. These results complement already existing cross-sectional multivariate analyses, which are, however, mainly available from survey-based studies (Williams 2007; Feld and Larsen 2012; European Commission 2014). By giving a detailed description of the dynamics of non-reporting, our approach is also related to the literature that models measurement error in earnings using matched administrative and survey data (Pischke 1995; Abowd and Stinson 2013). A few papers focus specifically on tax evasion using matched microdata (Baldini et al. 2009; Paulus 2015). However, in contrast to our paper, that stream of literature does not concentrate on undeclared work (i.e. full income tax evasion) and also follows a different econometrics modelling framework, because earnings are continuous, whereas our undeclared work dummy is a binary variable.",4

Since its introduction and its adoption by original members in 1999, the euro appreciated first and depreciated next, in nominal and real terms. Figure 1 reveals the exact path that both rates have followed. Plot of Nominal (NEER) and Real (REER) Effective Value of Euro Although all members of the euro zone face the same exchange rate, they export to and import from different destinations that are subject to different trade rules and different trade elasticties. This makes it conceivable for euro fluctuations to have different effects in different member countries. In this paper, we seek to answer: Which euro zone member benefits from a euro depreciation in terms of an improvement in the trade balance? The link between the trade balance and the real exchange rate has its own extensive literature that has been reviewed twice and need not be repeated here.Footnote 1 From the two review articles, we gather that the approach to investigate the link between the trade balance and the real exchange rate must be based on error-correction modelling and cointegration techniques. Error-correction modelling reveals the short-run response and cointegration reveals the long-run response. Some examples that have applied these techniques are: Rose and Yellen (1989) for G7 countries, Bahmani-Oskooee and Alse (1994) for 19 developed and 22 less developed countries; Arize (1994) for nine Asian countries; Upadhyaya and Dhakal (1997) for eight developing countries, Boyd et al. (2001) for G8 countries; Lal and Lowinger (2002) for East Asian countries; Hacker and Hatemi-J (2003) for Nordic countries; Bahmani-Oskooee and Kutan (2009) for 11 transition economies, and Bahmani-Oskooee and Gelan (2012) for African countries. Bahmani-Oskooee and Fariditavana (2015) recently criticized the entire literature for assuming the effects of exchange rate changes on the trade balance to be symmetric. They argued that since traders’ expectations and hence their responses to currency depreciation could be different than their responses to appreciation, exchange rate changes could have asymmetric effects on the trade balance. There is now even more evidence to argue for asymmetric effects of exchange rate changes on the trade balance. Delatte and Lopez-Villavicencio (2012) and Bussiere (2013) have shown that domestic prices and traded goods prices respond to exchange rate changes in an asymmetric manner. If traded goods prices respond to exchange rate changes asymmetrically, clearly, trade volume and eventually the trade balance itself will follow the same pattern. Other studies that have recently supported asymmetric effects of exchange rate changes on the trade balance include Nusair (2016) who examined the experiences of 16 transition economies, Arize et al. (2017) and Bahmani-Oskooee and Kanitpon (2017) who extended the same analysis to Asian countries. Clearly, the literature is rather new and any study that considers the experiences of other countries is most welcome. In this paper, we add to the limited asymmetry literature by assessing the symmetric and asymmetric response of the trade balance of each of the 12 original members of the euro zone to changes in the real effective value of the euro to determine which member’s trade balance will benefit from a euro depreciation. For that purpose, in second section we outline the trade balance models and introduce the methods. Results are discussed in third section and a summary is provided in fourth section. Data definition and sources are cited in the Appendix.Footnote 2",5

Previous studies have focused on the effect of language proficiency on earnings of male immigrants. Recent examples are Bleakley and Chin (2004), Miranda and Zhu (2013a, b), Di Paolo and Raymond (2012) and Yao and van Ours (2015). However, it is not only language proficiency that affects labor market performance. Also, language speech patterns may be important, i.e. it may matter whether a worker speaks a standard language or a dialect. Though among linguists there is no common definition of dialects, a dialect is usually referred to a variation of a language used by a particular group. A dialect may associate with social class. As for example is apparent from the “My Fair Lady” lyrics of the song “Why can’t the English?”: “Look at her, a prisoner of the gutter, condemned by every syllable she utters (...). An Englishman’s way of speaking absolutely classifies him. The moment he talks he makes some other Englishman despise him.” A few studies investigated how speech patterns affect labor market outcomes. Gao and Smyth (2011) find a significant wage premium associated with fluency in standard Mandarin for dialect-speaking migrating workers in China. Carlson and McHenry (2006) presents the results of a small experiment on how speaking dialect affects employment probability. Bendick Jr. et al. (2010) using an experimental set-up studies the effects of a (mostly) French accent for white job applicants to New York City restaurants. These accents were considered as “charming” and they increased the probability of being hired as a waiter or waitress. To study the effects of speech patterns, Grogger (2011) uses NLSY data in combination with audio-information about how individuals speak. In the US labor market, black workers with a distinct black speech pattern earn less than white workers whereas black workers who do not sound distinct black earn the same as white workers. Grogger (2018) finds that lower wages of black workers are related to their speech pattern. These speech-related wage differences might be related to occupational sorting such that black workers whose speech is similar to white workers sort themselves into occupations that involve intensive interpersonal interactions. An alternative explanation mentioned by Grogger (2018) is employer discrimination, i.e. employers are prejudicial tasted against certain dialects. Grogger (2018) also finds that lower wages of US Southerners are not related to their speech pattern but are largely explained by family background and residential location. According to Das (2013) language and accents provide information about an individual’s social status. The spoken language may be a source of discrimination affecting earnings and promotion. In other words, a speech pattern may be a signal of unobserved productivity. It could also be that non-standard speech patterns reduce productivity at the workplace, for example because differences in language speech pattern between workers increase production costs (Lang 1986). Language skills and speech patterns are acquired at early ages up to the teenage years. After this period it is hard to pick-up a different related speech. Rickford et al. (2015) present an analysis of audio recordings of participants in the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) project. In the MTO project, participants were randomly assigned to receive housing vouchers providing an opportunity to move to lower-poverty areas. Exploiting this randomization, Rickford et al. (2015) find that moving to lower-poverty neighborhoods at a young age changes speech patterns while moving at a higher age does not. Also using MTO data, Chetty et al. (2016) find that moving when young (before age 13) to lower-poverty neighborhoods is beneficial in terms of college attendance and earnings. Grogger (2018) suggests that the combination of the two findings is consistent with the notion that speech patterns affect earnings. A dialect is a variation of the standard language, used in limited regions and different in mainly pronunciation, and sometimes vocabulary and grammar. Dialects can be acquired without training and play a role in informal communication, while the standard language is the instruction medium at schools. Speaking with a local dialect accent may signal lower language ability, limited education and lack of experience communicating with people from other regions. Moreover, a similar speech pattern can signal cultural affinity. People are more likely to trust those who speak the same dialect and conduct trade (Falck et al. 2012). All this implies that speaking the major languages results in an advantage in economic activities. Although in dialect-speaking areas dialect can be viewed as a separate skill, the return to dialects is somewhat limited in other areas in the country. Therefore, it is of interest to explore how dialect speech patterns affect labor market performance and whether it is premium or penalty in the labor market. Our paper studies the relationship between dialect-speaking and hourly wages. We study the Netherlands as an example of a country with a lot of commuting such that the spatial segregation is limited. This is not only because there are various dialects spoken, but also Dutch natives are more homogeneous in terms of culture, physical characteristics and economic wealth than natives from larger countries. Moreover, to compare native dialect speakers with Standard Dutch speakers, we obtain purer effects of speech pattern than comparing immigrants with natives. We focus on native Dutch individuals who indicated not having problems with reading or speaking Dutch. We perform simple regressions starting with daily-dialect speaking as the only right-hand side variable and gradually introducing personal characteristics, family characteristics and geographical differences. The difference in wages between dialect-speakers and non dialect-speakers becomes smaller as more explanatory variables are introduced. We find that the unconditional difference in hourly wages between Standard Dutch and dialect speakers is about 10% for males and 8% for females. If we take into account personal characteristics and province fixed effects male dialect speakers earn 4% less while there is no significant penalty on female dialect speakers. Our findings suggest a significant wage penalty of daily dialect-speaking behavior on wages of males. Moreover, in provinces with a higher share of dialect-speakers, the wage penalty is less severe. Nevertheless, although our results are robust to various sensitivity tests our analysis does no go beyond conditional correlations.Footnote 1 Our paper is set-up as follows. In Sect. 2 we provide a description of data and linguistic background of Dutch. Section 3 presents our parameter estimates. Section 4 discusses possible explanations for our main findings. Section 5 concludes.",6

In Central and Eastern European countries, including Poland, these changes intensified after accession to the European Union (EU). Additionally, a significant increase in the inflow of foreign direct investment to Poland has been observed since 2004, and approximately 900,000 Poles have migrated to the United Kingdom and Ireland with the opening of EU labour markets in 2006. Under such circumstances, the command of foreign languages is becoming one of the key competences on the global labour market. Hence, it is not surprising that substantial public and private funds are allocated to language education. Learning two foreign languages is obligatory in schools in Poland, which is similar to most European countries. Furthermore, private language schools are thriving in Poland. In the European context, language skills are promoted by initiatives such as the Erasmus programme, which is financed from public funds and individual financial contributions. As language education can be expensive, it seems interesting from an economic point of view whether this type of education brings any benefits—and in particular, wage benefits—to individuals in the labour market. Our purpose is to estimate the wage premium from foreign language skills (FLS) that is obtained by Poles. Poles seem to be a good case for this type of analysis because the Polish language is not used for international communication and as many as 58% of Poles declare the command of at least one foreign language.Footnote 1 I estimated an extended Mincer wage equation using OLS. The analysis was based on data from three waves (2012–2014) of the Human Capital Balance survey with a pooled sample of about 35,000 individuals. This study contributes to the literature on economic returns to FLS in the following ways. First, this is one of the few studies that identifies the wage premium from proficiency in many different languages—not only English (Di Paolo and Tansel 2015; Williams 2011). Second, my study is one of only a few examining Central and Eastern European countries (Toomet 2011; Fabo et al. 2017) and is the first for Poland. This paper is organised into seven sections. In the first section, I present an overview of the literature on the impact of language competences on wages. The second and the third sections present the data and method of analysis.

46.0,4.0,Empirica,21 September 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10663-019-09460-7,"Foreign language skills and employment status of European natives: evidence from Germany, Italy and Spain",November 2019,Michele Gazzola,Daniele Mazzacani,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"This article addresses the relationship between foreign language skills and the employment status of native Europeans, and it provides new, empirical results on this relationship. During the last decade, the official EU discourse about foreign language learning and teaching has gradually changed. While learning foreign languages was traditionally associated with an openness to other European cultures, nowadays the EU discourse on multilingualism emphasises the importance of foreign language skills for economic growth, competitiveness, mobility of labour, and employability. A working paper published in 2012 by the European Commission illustrates this trend: Europe’s vision for 2020 is to become a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy. Therefore, improving the outcomes of education and training and investing in skills in general—and language skills in particular—are important prerequisites to achieve the EU goal of increasing growth, creating jobs, promoting employability and increasing competitiveness. The ambition is to achieve better functioning of EU labour markets, to provide the right skills for the right jobs and to improve the quality of work and working conditions. In this context, foreign language proficiency is one of the main determinants of learning and professional mobility, as well as of domestic and international employability. Poor language skills thus constitute a major obstacle to free movement of workers and to the international competitiveness of EU enterprises. […] it is clear, however, that the benefits of improved language learning go well beyond the immediate economic advantages, encompassing a range of cultural, cognitive, social, civic, academic and security aspects (European Commission 2012: 4, italics added). The EU, therefore, does not intend to neglect the cultural or cognitive aspects of language learning; quite simply the scope of EU language policy has been broadened. This change has gradually emerged since 2000 in different important policy documents such as the Action Plan 2004–2006 (European Commission 2003), the communication A new strategic framework for multilingualism (European Commission 2005), and the communication Multilingualism: An asset for Europe and a shared commitment (European Commission 2008). The change in the official discourse on multilingualism must be linked to two factors. The first one is strategic. Language policy, and in particular foreign language teaching, is viewed as an element contributing to the achievement of the general socio-economic objectives of the EU defined in the Lisbon Agenda 2000–2010 (Krzyżanowski and Wodak 2011), and to the achievement of the goals of the Europe 2020 Agenda.Footnote 1 The second factor is reactive. After the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2008 and the European sovereign debt crisis in 2011, the unemployment rate in the EU increased and reached a peak in 2013. It was 7% in 2008 (6.6% for men, 7.5% for women), 10.9% in 2013 (10.8 and 10.9% for men and women, respectively), and then it decreased to 6.8% in 2018 (6.6% for men, 7.1% for women). Large differences among countries exist. For example, in 2013, the unemployment rate was 5.2% in Germany, 12.1% in Italy, and 26.1% in Spain. The youth unemployment rate is much higher than the average unemployment rate. The economic crisis severely hit the young. In 2008, the youth unemployment rate started to grow quickly peaking in 23.8% at the beginning of 2013, before receding to 15.2% in 2018. Against this backdrop, foreign language skills are viewed as a component of Europeans’ human capital that can generate benefits in the domestic labour market, such as higher wages, or better employment opportunities. Reducing unemployment also matters for equity, because employment can be viewed as a dimension of social inclusion. Although the European Commission, as shown above, asserts that “foreign language proficiency is one of the main determinants of learning and professional mobility, as well as of domestic and international employability”, few scientific papers address the question of the relationship between foreign language skills and employment, let alone employability. This article contributes to bridging this gap. To understand better why we focus on employment, a terminological note is needed. While the unemployment rate is clearly defined, the definition of what employability means is far from clear and many definitions coexist (McQuaid and Lindsay 2005). The official definition used by the European Commission is the: “ability to gain initial employment, to maintain employment, and to be able to move around within the labour market”, but it is not clear which indicators should be used to measure it. For this reason, the empirical studies available, as well as this article, concentrate on one dimension of employability only, that is, the employment status at a given moment. The rest of this article is organised as follows: Section 2 discusses the relevant literature. Section 3 presents the database and our estimation strategy. Section 4 provides an overview of the linguistic skills of native-born citizens (henceforth “natives”) in Germany, Italy and Spain, and it illustrates the characteristics of the sample. Section 5 presents the results of two econometric models. Section 6 provides a critical discussion of the results and an overall conclusion.",13

The world has always been a complex place, but people were on average less aware of this fact. In his famous book “Turbulence in World Politics: a Theory of Change and Continuity,” James Rosenau (1990) argues that, until the 50s, people were on average less educated and in general less concerned with global issues as a consequence of limited information availability. As education and access to information have both dramatically increased, people have become increasingly aware of global issues. This has led to the somewhat deceptive impression that, over the decades, the world has become a more complex place. Nevertheless, social systems have become arguably more complex, or at least more complicated. Indeed, they are much more interconnected today than they used to be in the past as a result of the massive progress in information and communication technologies. Dynamics inside and outside complex systems can (and often do) have unexpected repercussions in terms of “what is reacting to what” and “with what intensity.” Scholars in the management and economic sciences have been exploring the issue of complexity since the early 1990s. In what follows I will argue that complexity theory and agent-based modelling can provide a great support to the research on language issues. I analyse the features of communication within multilingual businesses to show that it is an intrinsically complex issue and that it deserves being studied by means of the tools and concepts of complexity theory. In particular, using the software NetLogo, I develop an agent-based model (ABM) that simulates different scenarios, with a view to detecting macro-dynamics generated by different individual micro-behaviours and corporate policies. First, I review the ideas of complexity and language problems. Then, I present multinational corporations as multilingual complex entities. Finally, I concentrate on the processes of knowledge sharing, knowledge creation and knowledge accumulation within a multilingual working environment.Footnote 1 In particular, I will focus on the unbalanced accumulation of knowledge across different language groups within corporations as a function of language skills. I shall point out that the objective of this article is first and foremost to explore the potential of agent-based modelling as a tool of complexity theory to study the dynamics of language systems. As a matter of fact, ABMs have been used extensively to explore all sorts of social phenomena in the past few years. Nevertheless, they were only very seldom applied to language issues, and virtually never to issues of language policy. My objectives are therefore to develop an AMB of communication in a multilingual context and to show that AMBs lend themselves very well to the analysis of language matters. Besides, I will discuss the limitations of such model and how they could be addressed in the future. In general, this article wishes to contribute to the fields of language policy and language economics by expanding its research methodologies. Although this is mostly a theoretical article, whenever possible, I will try to contextualize my analysis with examples from Europe or the European Union. In particular, I draw on several cases from the Swiss context to provide validation to the model. The reason behind this choice lies in the fact that Switzerland, being a multilingual country, provides numerous examples that match well the underlying assumptions of the model.",3
46.0,4.0,Empirica,04 September 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10663-019-09462-5,Martin Feldstein (1939–2019),November 2019,Karl Aiginger,Robert Holzmann,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Martin Feldstein was an unusual economist. Born in New York, he was endowed with the highest intellect and the best training for formal economic methods—he was a professor at Harvard University after studying there and in Oxford—and he was interested in issues far beyond economics. Over his professional career, he enjoyed invitations to places across the world, advised the OECD, was president of the American Economic Association, counseled a number of US presidents, including Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama, and was a board member of AIG. “Marty,” as he was called by many of his colleagues, did not preach, did not impose his personal beliefs and principles and was always open to new evidence. He leaned toward supply side economics but rejected the notion that tax reductions paid for themselves. He advocated climate taxes—if the money was returned as a lump sum to taxpayers. Like most US economists, he thought the Euro and the European Monetary Union would be a failure. But if all economists were as open to new ideas to shape the future as Marty was, economics would not be called the “dismal science,” would not be captured by mathematics, would not ignore social issues and external effects to the degree it still does. Martin Feldstein accepted an invitation as Schumpeter Professor at the University of Vienna in 1981. By then the university had offered a degree in economics for less than 2 decades only. The faculties of the University of Vienna had been dominated by world-renowned researchers such as Kelsen, Schumpeter, Freud, Lorenz, and others in law, medicine, and the natural sciences. Marty was welcomed in Vienna by only a small crowd of economists, gathered and empowered by Erich Streissler, a paleo-liberal economist. Streissler was also Vice President of the Austrian Institute of Economic Research, a think tank founded by Friedrich Hayek. We, the authors of this obituary enjoyed his teaching, and met Marty later in many professional occasions across the world. Both of our careers were strongly influenced by his efforts to bridge the gap between theory and empirical research, and between policy challenges and academic efforts. Streissler emphasized three reasons for honoring Feldstein with the Schumpeter Professorship. First, Feldstein was a mathematical institutional economist, which is a foundation for an economic faculty still dominated by lawyers, but trying to connect the concept of institutions with the concept of profit optimization. Second, neoclassic-based assumptions and conclusions were not common in 1981 in the Austrian economy setting, which Streissler then claimed could “not be described as a market economy” with its focus on price stabilization and collective bargaining. Feldstein’s research offered many leads how neoclassic economic thinking can be weaved productively into Austria’s economic setting. Finally, Streissler noted that Austria’s economic development had been extremely successful for 2 decades. But to continue doing so Austria might need to broaden and modernize the underlying economic concept and research. Revisiting Marty’s hypotheses and research he considered a promising approach on this way. This journal—Empirica—was founded by the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO), now called Empirica—Journal of European Economics, and co-owned by WIFO and the Austrian National Economic Association. It is proud to have published its issue no. 2 of volume 1 as a “Feldstein issue” in 1981. Here Feldstein addressed topics of inflation and growth and confessed to be much more optimistic about the US economy than Joseph Schumpeter 3 decades ago. He based this assessment on the ideas of another Viennese professor—Sigmund Freud—who concluded that an individual who understood the reasons for his apparently irrational and destructive behavior could conquer irrationality. His humor, interdisciplinary thinking, and intellect could not be proven better in one statement. In that same 1981 issue, we both published work that intersected with Marty’s: Robert Holzmann investigated the effects of social security on private saving in Austria, confirming Feldstein’s hypothesis for Austria; Karl Aiginger proved that accelerated depreciation on investment is not independent of the inflation rate, as suggested by a model of Feldstein. Feldstein’s Schumpeter Professorship was an inspiring and timely experience for Austrian economists, and particularly for us. We are grateful to him for his contribution to Austrian economic science and policy counseling and for stimulating years of research and discussion in this journal.

Panel A of Fig. 1 shows the evolution of the Gini coefficient of disposable (post-taxes and post-transfers) income for five selected OECD countries over the time period 1986–2014. It can be seen that income inequality in the US and in the UK has risen by several percentage points, while the trend also points upwards for Germany and Italy, with France being an exception, as inequality in France decreased over the time period covered. Furthermore, Panel B of Fig. 1 plots the evolution of the Gini coefficient of disposable income in a sample of 17 OECD countries; both the unweighted average and the population-weighted average exhibit a general trend of rising inequality. While researchers have found evidence that a growing divide in incomes may cause social cohesion to deteriorate and public health problems to become more significant (Wilkinson and Pickett 2009), recent research has also indicated that economies characterized by an unequal distribution of incomes may be subject to higher financial fragility and macroeconomic instability (e.g. Kapeller and Schütz 2014; Kumhof et al. 2015; Stockhammer 2015). Since the financial crisis of 2008, fiscal consolidation measures have been a central feature of crisis management in several OECD countries, as countries push for government spending cuts and tax increases in order to cut fiscal deficits and bring down public debt (e.g. Lane 2012; Blanchard and Leigh 2014; Alesina et al. 2015a). As the increase in income inequality and high public debt may be seen as two of the most pressing policy problems of our time, the consequences of fiscal consolidation measures on the income distribution are of high relevance. Past research has shown that fiscal policies have an important distributional role to play (e.g. Martinez-Vazquez et al. 2012; International Monetary Fund 2012); hence, well-informed policy-makers should be able to rely on robust estimates about how the income distribution develops in the aftermath of fiscal consolidation episodes. In this context, concerns about the (potential) effects of fiscal austerity on income inequality have grown over recent years (e.g. Rawdanowicz et al. 2013; International Monetary Fund 2014; OECD 2015). The evolution of income inequality in the OECD since the mid-1980s. Notes Data: SWIID (Solt 2016); own calculations. Panel B shows an unweighted average of 17 OECD countries (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America), which we will also include in the data set for the empirical analysis in the remainder of this paper While a substantial literature dealing with the effects of fiscal adjustments on economic growth and employment has developed since the outbreak of the global financial crisis (e.g. Holland and Portes 2012; in ’t Veld 2013; Blanchard and Leigh 2014; Guajardo et al. 2014; Alesina et al. 2015a; Yang et al. 2015; Alesina et al. 2015b; Jorda and Taylor 2016; Heimberger 2017), empirical research on the distributional effects of fiscal austerity measures has so far been comparatively underdeveloped. Researchers at the OECD and the IMF have intensified their work on the distributional effects of fiscal policy (Cournède et al. 2013; OECD 2015; International Monetary Fund 2012; Rawdanowicz et al. 2013; Ball et al. 2013; International Monetary Fund 2014; Furceri et al. 2016; Woo et al. 2017), and some peer-reviewed papers from recent years deal with different aspects of the distributional impact of fiscal consolidation measures (Agnello and Sousa 2012, 2014; Schaltegger and Weder 2014; Kaplanoglou et al. 2015; Agnello et al. 2016; Schneider et al. 2017; Woo et al. 2017). However, although Ball et al. (2013) and Furceri et al. (2016) have already done seminal work on the dynamic effects of fiscal consolidation episodes on income inequality, one of the major gaps in the existing literature concerns the lack of a large-scale and long-term analysis of the impact of fiscal consolidations on income inequality that also includes data for the years during and after the most recent global financial crisis. Furthermore, an in-depth investigation of the role played by the size, duration and the composition of fiscal consolidation episodes as well as the occurence of financial crises has so far also been missing when it comes to studying the dynamic effects of fiscal consolidation episodes on income inequality. This paper contributes to closing this gap in the existing empirical literature on the distributional effects of fiscal austerity. The aim is to formally analyze the dynamic impact of consolidation episodes on income inequality in a broad set of OECD countries over an extended period of time. For this purpose, we make use of an annual data set consisting of 17 OECD countries over the time period 1978–2013. Inspired by Jorda (2005), we estimate impulse response functions from local projections to obtain estimates about how the Gini coefficient (of market and disposable income, respectively) develops within eight years after the start of a fiscal consolidation episode. Our analysis covers data over more than three decades (1978–2013), as we also include data on the years after the outbreak of the global financial crisis. In comparison to past contributions (e.g. Agnello and Sousa 2014; Ball et al. 2013), our analysis delivers novel insights into how the dynamic effects of fiscal austerity on the income distribution depend on the size and duration of fiscal consolidation programs, the economic growth situation, and on whether consolidations are started in the aftermath of financial crises. Over recent years, questions regarding the effects of economic policy decisions on income inequality have gained importance both in the economic research community (e.g. Piketty 2014; Atkinson 2015; Milanovic 2016b) as well as in policy-making circles (e.g. Rawdanowicz et al. 2013; International Monetary Fund 2014; OECD 2015); hence, the results presented in this paper should be of interest both to a wider community of economists working on distributional and macroeconomic issues as well as to policy-makers. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a review on the literature dealing with the macroeconomic effects of fiscal consolidation measures. Section 3 explains the econometric approach used in this paper. Section 4 presents the main empirical results and a number of extensions. Section 5 provides several robustness checks. Section 6 discusses the main results against the background of the existing econometric literature. Section 7 concludes.",6

Therefore, it analyses the European income distribution and decomposes the Theil index in a within- and between-component. This approach is carried out by countries, demographic groups and country groups with similar socio-economic policies and institutions. The aim of this empirical analysis is to show the inequality within each of these groups and to illustrate their contribution to the aggregated inequality of the EU-28. One of the most relevant studies concerning the decomposition of income inequality at the European level is carried out by Beblo and Knaus (2001). Their results show a Theil index of around 0.185 by using income data of ten European countries for the year 1995. Moreover, they find that between-country inequality contributes 3.4%, for incomes before transfers and taxes, and 9.3%, for disposable income, to the aggregated income inequality. A more recent approach is carried out by Hoffmeister (2009). He refers to the EU-25 and detects a convergence of national income levels and within-country personal income inequality between 1994/1995 and 1999/2000. Furthermore, he states that inequality is rising in the Social-Democratic regime but decreasing in Mediterranean welfare states. Papatheodorou and Pavlopoulos (2014) analyse the development of inequality in the EU-15 between 1996 and 2008 by calculating Theil indices. They find that the contribution of between-country inequality decreases from 14.8% in 1996 to 4.9% in 2008. Moreover, Papatheodorou and Pavlopoulos (2014) find that southern and liberal European countries show the highest inequality and relatively contribute most to aggregated inequality, whereas Scandinavian countries show the opposite result. Eurofound (2017) measures aggregated inequality for the EU-28 between 2005 and 2013 and reports a decrease in between-country inequality and an increase in overall inequality since 2008. This paper contributes to the findings of Beblo and Knaus (2001). It illustrates how their results change by using income data for 2014 and including all member states of the EU-28. Moreover, an additional level of analysis is added. This paper shows also the composition of income inequality by clustering countries into groups with similar socio-economic policies and institutions. This approach should extend the results of Papatheodorou and Pavlopoulos (2014) who show how welfare state regimes could be used to explain differences in inequality among countries.Footnote 1 Based on the contributions the main research questions are the following: (1) What is the composition of income inequality in the EU-28? (2) How changes the composition of income inequality in the EU-28 after transfers and taxes? To answer the first research question, equivalised disposable household income is used to calculate Theil indices. This index is additively decomposed into a within- and between-component for countries, country groups and demographic groups. The second research question is analysed by comparing the differences in the composition of income inequality between disposable income and income before transfers and taxes. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the underlying data of this study and illustrates the decomposition of the Theil index. The composition of income inequality is analysed in Sect. 3. Section 4 discusses the changes of the results when using income data before transfers and taxes. Finally, Sect. 5 summarises the main findings of this study.",3

The share of goods and services traded via e-commerce amounted to 2.59% of the GDP of Europe in 2015 (North America: 2.55%, Asia-Pacific: 3.33%). The estimated share of online goods in the total retail of all goods was 8.0% for Europe (North America 4.2% and Asia Pacific: 5.4%).Footnote 1 The proliferation of price comparison sites or shopbots have resulted in very fierce price competition in e-commerce, therefore, a firm’s service characteristics have gained substantial importance. Retailers’ service characteristics have became a crucial determinant of firm competitiveness for two reasons: (i) As online shops trade essentially homogeneous factory-made products, the only way to differentiate them is the strategic choice of different service characteristics. While some retailers might set higher prices for outstanding service and, therefore, expect higher profits, other shops might hope for higher demand resulting from Spartan service and low product prices. (ii) Generally, a firm’s service characteristics make a major contribution to resolving problems of asymmetric information in e-commerce. Should consumers pay in advance if they cannot inspect the product that they get delivered (if at all), or should retailers send a commission in advance not knowing whether they will be paid? Information about the service quality of a shop can be very important in reducing uncertainty in the e-commerce business. Information about the firms’ service characteristics has the potential to build trust and reduce uncertainty about payment and delivery. Post-shopping services, including grievance procedures or redemption policies are other important pieces of information that potential customers would like to know. Having access to these service characteristics assigns a larger role to non-price marketing, which can usually consist of pre-and post-sale services. In the e-commerce business, strategic decisions on different customer services cost money. Hence, e-tailers are interested in the impact of different service characteristics on customer attention on their shops and sales volumes. Based on the behavior of visitors from a large Austrian price search engine (www.geizhals.atFootnote 2) covering most of the national (Austrian) e-tailing market, we provide evidence on the importance of different service characteristics in the e-commerce business. The firms’ service characteristics are predefined by www.geizhals.at and are based on costumer evaluation forms on the website of the price search engine. These data allow us to examine a broad range of 15 different service characteristics of individual e-businesses, such as accessibility, assortment, information and advice, convenience of the website, reliability of order fulfillment, and the delivery modalities provided by the evaluations of past shoppers. Customers judge the quality of the service characteristics following a school grade system. Hence, our analysis is based on the actual perceived service quality by customers. Using negative binomial panel estimations, we calculate the impact of the quality of different service aspects on customer attention for online shops and a proxy for estimated sales volumes. Sales quantities are approximated with the so-called Last-Click-Through (LCT) concept—a procedure that is used to estimate the shops’ conversion rate of visits into actual product sales. Our measurement of attention and the proxy for actual sales is based on the amount of referral requests from the www.geizhals.at-website to the webshop-homepage. A referral request is a click on a firm offer listed in the price search engine, resulting in a redirect to the e-tailer’s webpage.Footnote 3 Given the dominance of www.geizhals.at as the information broker, these clicks are an extremely important indicator of the attractiveness of an online shop; www.geizhals.at is the only price search engine in Austria, and is therefore, often visited.Footnote 4 Hence, the best-price offers listed in the price search engine also exert pressure on the other bidders and reduce their profit margins. On the other hand, online shops depend on www.geizhals.at, as the price search engine brings them many customers. The following quote from an Austrian e-commerce manager highlights the dominance of www.geizhals.at: “the first day we are no longer dependent on www.geizhals.at will be the best day of my life” (Source: personal conversation). Simultaneously, this quote reveals that our dependent variable (clicks) is an important indicator of success in the e-commerce business in Austria.Footnote 5 In our study, we systematically investigate the impact of service quality components in e-tailing on site visits, and therefore, indirectly on consumer demand. Previous research on e-tailers either has (1) identified dimensions of service quality (Zeithaml et al. 2002) or (2) studied how these dimensions/attributes influence perceptions such as satisfaction, purchase intentions, or trust (Bart et al. 2005). Our study bridges a gap by considering how these dimensions influence actual consumer purchases in online markets. Our study complements studies on price differences, by showing how reputation and different components of customer satisfaction have a direct influence on clicking behavior. These results allow for conclusions about the relative importance of different service characteristics in e-commerce. Furthermore, we will analyze product-specific differences on the importance of different components of customer service. Obviously, consumers of software products will have different expectations from e-tailer service quality (e.g. fast download) than those that buy a refrigerator (e.g. robust packaging). Similarly, we would expect different impacts of service quality for buyers of high- or low-priced products. As many online shops specialize in certain types and categories of products, it is important to know how the different aspects of customer service will impact their business. From a marketing perspective, these results enable the design of an optimal marketing mix which aligns the retailer’s individual cost structure for services with its impact on the market in the form of customer attention and demand (click data). Our results are corroborated when we observe informed consumers who gather specific information about shop quality. The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 discusses the literature on this topic. Section 3 presents the theoretical framework for service differentiation. The data are discussed in Sect. 4, Sect. 5 presents our empirical results, Sect. 6 contains a summary of the managerial implications, and Sect. 7 discusses conclusions.",2

Nevertheless, money and credit were largely neglected in monetary policy over the Great Moderation (Woodford 2008; Meyer 2001). The prevailing approach to model central banks behavior, were the interest rates and the Taylor-type rules. The Great Recession renewed interests in money and credit. The reason was that models without money or credit have neither predicted nor explained the crisis, while the role played by the financial sector in its propagation and origination is undisputed. Moreover, the unconventional responses of major central banks brought to the forefront the relevance of money and credit. The main goal of the article is to analyze the relationship between money and credit growth, the prevailing direction of the link and to disentangle the short-, medium- and long-run co-movements and changes of the relation across time with a wavelet methodology. In particular, I aim to find out if strength and significance of the co-movements, and the lead-lag properties of money and credit changed in time during the period from the liberalization of the financial sectors in the 1970s and 1980s to the unconventional responses of major central banks to the Great Recession. The analysis is performed for Australia, Canada, Denmark, the euro area, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, South Africa, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States to find common/diversified patterns among them. The existence, stability and causation of a relation between money and credit is relevant in its own right including the implications for policy (Goodhart et al. 2016). For example, real-time data on money growth are argued to contain information on the true level of current output gap (Scharnagl et al. 2010), on future inflationary pressures (Rua 2012), are historically associated with economic booms and busts (Gerdesmeier et al. 2010; Brunnermeier 2009; Adalid and Detken 2007; Bordo and Haubrich 2010; and Borio and Lowe 2004), while credit may amplify and propagate macroeconomic shocks in models with financial accelerators (Bernanke et al. 1999). However, and as noted by Schularick and Taylor (2012), the dynamics of money and credit have not been verified across a broad sample of countries over the long run, while the role of money and credit has changed apparently and substantially over time. When the frequency content of money and credit changes over time, it is important to have a measure of correlation or coherence in the time-frequency plane. Wavelet analysis allows a simultaneous assessment of how variables relate at different frequencies and how such a relationship varies over time. Since wavelets are efficient in identifying damping in dynamic systems, our results could be potentially helpful for post-Great Recession models where money and credit coexist (Gu et al. 2016; Ferraris 2010; Telyukova and Wright 2008; Mills 2007). The need for models augmented with money and/or credit became apparent after the Great Recession. The contribution of the article is twofold. First, we use a long-term dataset covering a period of almost half a century which enables the analysis of quite a long span and as such, this analysis can give us a more detailed picture of the historical interplay between money and credit. In particular, the existing literature falls short in analysing the dynamics between money and credit during the Great Recession of 2007–2009 and the 2010–2012 euro area debt crisis. Meanwhile, the unconventional scale of the intervention in response to the Great Recession and the importance of central banks that implemented quantitative easing (QE) comprise a natural background for the unresolved discussion on the relationship between money and credit. Second, the analysis is significant because it allows us to analyse the short-run and long-run relationships so that economic forecasters with different operational horizons could adjust their decisions accordingly. The co-evolution of money and credit over time and over frequencies as well as similar processes are hard to estimate with pure time-domain and pure frequency-domain methods (Hkiri et al. 2018). Finally, the diversified groups of countries constitute an interesting setup to discover the general and country-specific patterns. In particular, the wavelet transform allows us to check if the link between money and credit growth differs during normal times, and real house price boom episodes at given frequencies. The article is organized as follows. Section 2 contains the literature review of the few studies on the dynamics between money and credit. It discusses the diversified reasons for their decoupling after the 1970s. Section 3 presents the methodology applied and is followed by the description of the data in Sect. 4. The results of the continuous wavelet transform for the quarterly rates of M3 growth and bank credit growth are presented in Sect. 5.1. Section 5.2 concerns M3 and credit from all sectors. Section 5.3 briefly discusses a sensitivity analysis for M2 and robustness checks based on adjustments of M3 and M2 money growth rates for the real GDP rates of growth, and on the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform.",4

Productivity is considered as the ‘ultimate engine of growth in the global economy’ (OECD 2015) and belongs to those ‘two really great mysteries of economics’ (Krugman 1994a, b). Historically, continuous growth is a rather recent phenomenon that has emerged only after the industrial revolution. The ongoing growth of the Chinese economy and the expansion of the Asian Tigers are recent examples of this miracle (see Lucas 1993). Endogenous growth models (e.g., see Romer 1990) aim at explaining the Solow (1956) residual because capital accumulation cannot explain observed growth. They build on spillovers from capital, public goods, R&D, learning by doing, etc. in order to counter the law of diminishing returns on capital. North (1989) and later Acemoglu and Robinson (2012) emphasize the role of institutions. All these theories, however, fail to explain how the industrial revolution turned economies that had been stagnant for millennia (even after the agrarian revolution 8000 BC) into forever-growing ones, and Clark (2009) offers an evolutionary explanation leading to more patience (in England). Observing Europe’s industrialization in the 18th and 19th century, Gerschenkron (1962) introduced the idea of catching-up that ‘economic backwardness on the eve of [a country’s] industrialization’ has had a persistent effect on the ensuing development. Hence, late-coming, backward countries experienced a ‘sudden great spurt’ of manufacturing output, high growth rates, distinctive bigger plants and enterprises, etc., or have ‘a culture conducive to innovation, knowledge creation, and entrepreneurship’ according to Özak (2018) for countries ‘relatively more distant from the frontiers throughout the last two millennia’. Our investigation quantifies how total factor productivity (TFP) growth is affected by factors such as R&D, trade, and catching up based on a sample of 12 countries and 11 manufacturing industries from 1990 to 2006. Our contributions are: First, updating the widely quoted work of Griffith et al. (2004); second, introducing a different and nonparametric measure of TFP growth. Third, to decompose TFP growth into one for catching-up (moving closer to efficient frontier) and one for innovation (shifts of the efficient frontier) using the Malmquist index. Fourth, we address the role of information and communication technology (ICT) in TFP growth, which is ignored, quite surprisingly, in Griffith et al. (2004) and follow-ups. Gordon (2016) sees recent ICT advances as not comparable to the breakthroughs hundred years ago (electricity, combustion engine, telegraph, etc.). Solow’s remark that ‘you can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics’ (cf. Jorgenson et al. 2008) has become famous as the computer productivity paradox. However, Acemoglu et al. (2014) argue the opposite: ‘computers are now everywhere in our productivity statistics’. The most important of our findings is that large differences in productivity exist across countries, industries and time. Depending on time lags, R&D intensities affect both components; by contrast, imports have a weak positive impact on catching up but a negative one on innovation. Furthermore, an interaction of these two factors with the distance to the frontier does not add explanatory power. We find some indications that investment into information and communication technology accelerates productivity growth for an industry that occupies a larger distance from the technology frontier. In summary, catching-up effects are statistically important, frontier shifts tend to be smaller with increasing distance to the frontier, and many of our findings differ from those in Griffith et al. (2004). After a literature review, we outline our approach, data envelopment analysis and the Malmquist index, and the data in Sect. 3 including plots of (relative) productivity in different industries and countries across time based on the data envelopment analysis. The estimation results are given in Sect. 4 and their robustness is checked in Sect. 5. An Appendix documents additional robustness checks and plots TFP at country and industry levels.",14

In Slovenia, real GDP declined by as much as 7.8 percent in 2009. During the “Great Moderation” from the mid-1980s onwards (Lucas 2003), most economists and international organisations like the IMF or the OECD had more or less agreed that the optimal fiscal policy stance would be to refrain from discretionary policies and to only let automatic stabilisers operate. During the Great Recession, monetary policy reacted quickly, by introducing expansionary measures, and fiscal policies followed suit, letting automatic stabilisers work and also introducing discretionary tax reductions or increases in public expenditure. In the Euro Area, the only macroeconomic stabilisation policy instrument available to Euro Area members was fiscal policy. It is, therefore, of interest to investigate the effectiveness of fiscal policy in stabilising an economy like Slovenia’s. Such an analysis is even more interesting since in academia there is no consensus about the effectiveness of expansionary fiscal policy measures. While some authors (e.g. Taylor 2009) argue against discretionary fiscal policy, others are more in favour of tax reductions or expenditure increases and expect potentially large multiplier effects (e.g. Romer and Romer 2010). In view of the architecture of the Euro Area and the fact that most of its members are small open economies, it is important and of general interest to clarify the appropriate role of fiscal policy for small open economies in a monetary union which are constrained by the problem of high public debt. In this paper, we aim at contributing to this debate by empirically estimating fiscal policy effects for the Euro Area economy of Slovenia. We are particularly interested in the question as to whether demand-side (Keynesian) fiscal policies aiming primarily at supporting aggregate demand can contribute to stabilising this economy or whether policies primarily addressing the supply side are more successful. The debate between Keynesians and supply siders has been a hot topic since the second half of the 1970s, and (like many macroeconomic policy debates) it has not yet been completely settled. The prevailing opinion (albeit not a consensus) considers demand-side policies to be appropriate when combating an adverse demand-side shock but not necessarily when faced with a supply-side shock. In the Great Recession, even the IMF, which had been very cautious towards demand-side policies before, argued in favour of supporting demand-side policies. Nevertheless, for the medium and longer term in particular, the European Commission proposed (and in some cases prescribed to member states) structural reforms to enhance potential growth. This implies that fiscal policy should also include supply-side measures. Such prescriptions are still issued regularly by the European Commission and other institutions today. In contrast, many politicians and interest group representatives heavily criticised what they called the “austerity regime” of the Commission and advocated an expansionary fiscal policy stance in spite of already high public debt. Within academia, advocates of different macroeconomic theories still diverge in their judgment of the effectiveness of fiscal policies during a recession. In particular, the role of fiscal policy and the specific problems of countries within the Euro Area are the subject of ongoing controversies (see, for instance, Coenen et al. 2008; Cogan et al. 2010). It is well known that fiscal policy effects are smaller ceteris paribus in small and open economies than in larger and less open economies. Slovenia is an interesting case because it is the only small open transition economy which was already in the Euro Area before the Great Recession. Furthermore, an already high level of public debt is likely to undermine any positive effects of fiscal stimuli. Hence, a clear commitment to fiscal consolidation after overcoming a crisis is required (see, e.g., Spilimbergo et al. 2009; IMF 2008). Fiscal multipliers may not only depend on the openness of an economy, but also on its position in the business cycle. Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2013) conclude that in particular spending multipliers tend to be larger in recessions than in expansions. Furthermore, strict fiscal consolidation measures in a recession might contribute to a deepening of the recession (Blanchard and Leigh 2013). In this paper, we analyse the effects of different fiscal policy measures in Slovenia. We use the SLOPOL model, an econometric model of the Slovenian economy which we constructed, to simulate the effects of various tax and spending policies on important macroeconomic variables as well as on the public debt level. These simulations extend earlier simulations reported in Blueschke et al. (2019), Weyerstrass et al. (2020), and Neck et al. (2018) by focusing on some supply-side components of fiscal policies in addition to their demand-side effects. Here we examine the question as to whether Slovenia would benefit more from a demand- or supply-side orientation of its fiscal policy with the help of an econometric model. The plan of the paper is as follows: Sect. 2 describes the macroeconometric model SLOPOL10 which is used for the empirical analysis. Section 3 presents a forecast of the Slovenian macroeconomy for the years 2020 to 2030 obtained with the model and assuming no further exogenous shock in this period, which serves as the baseline solution for the policy simulation. In Sect. 4, we analyse fiscal policies in several model simulations. It turns out that expenditure-side budgetary measures with a strong supply-side content (especially research and development related spending and the enhancement of human capital) are most successful and effective at stabilising the Slovenian economy, while tax policies exert much smaller and transitory effects, except on unemployment. Section 5 presents a first tentative simulation of the Covid-19 (Corona virus) shock which is affecting Slovenia (and virtually all countries in the world) at present. Section 6 concludes.",1

In this context, recent developments related to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic will pose additional challenges due to substantial government support to firms and households as well as extreme losses in output (IMF 2020). The EU’s average gross general government debt-to-GDP ratio has risen significantly, from 58 percent in 2007 to over 90 percent in 2020. The public debt levels of many countries are expected to increase further in 2021 owing to the rescue packages in course of the pandemic crisis. Although the eleven Central and Eastern European EU member states (CEECs) are on average much less indebted than more advanced EU members, the increased public debt still poses considerable risks for these countries. The average gross general government debt-to-GDP ratio in these countries has increased from 26 percent in 2007 to 54 percent in 2020. As the market tolerance towards public debt is generally lower in emerging market economies, the CEECs are not spared the risks of rising and persistently high government debt levels (Darvas 2010). Furthermore, six of the CEECs still need to fulfil the Maastricht criteria, which contain thresholds for the government deficit and debt level, in order to join the euro area. This paper aims to identify the key factors that have led to substantial and long-lasting reductions of public debt in the CEECs in the past in order to draw possible conclusions about promising measures for the future. Using data for eleven CEECs from 1996 to 2020, several logistic probability models are estimated to assess which factors contributed to substantial reductions in the gross general government debt-to-GDP ratio during the period concerned. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2 related literature on government debt reduction is discussed. Section 3 provides an overview of debt developments in the CEECs and identifies episodes of substantial public debt reduction within the data set. In Sect. 4, the main determinants of public debt dynamics are examined. The empirical framework is set out in Sect. 5, followed by the presentation of the estimation results. The conclusion is then drawn in Sect. 6.",2

The aim of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their 169 targets was to set an ambitious new plan to “end poverty without imposing significant costs on Earth’s life-support systems” (Gaffney 2014). The SDGs have been successful in bringing attention to many different ecological and social crises and are an impressive product of political compromise and dialogue. Some of the SDGs have been praised by environmental researchers for aiming to “achieve harmony with nature”, with corresponding indicators concentrating on the environmental impact of human societies in line with strong sustainability, i.e., such as SDG 6 – “Clean Water and Sanitation” “Life below Water” (SDG 14), and “Life on Land” (SDG 15) (Hickel 2019a; Eisenmenger et al. 2020). Social goals such as “No Poverty” (SDG 1), “Zero Hunger” (SDG 2), “Good Health and Well-Being” (SDG 3), “Quality Education” (SDG 4), and “Gender Equality” (SDG 5), indicate the extent to which globally unequal social relations and unmet human needs structure everyday lives and still plague global societies (UN 2015). However, they have also remained contested due to some inherent inconsistencies – most visible in the case of SDG 8, the focus of this policy study. Criticism of internal inconsistencies include that SDG 1 accounts for poverty only monetarily, not in terms of human needs, and without facilitating the redistribution of wealth, suggesting that it therefore cannot meet its goal of poverty reduction (Salleh 2016; Lim et al. 2018; Hickel 2019a). It is also argued that further guidelines are needed to make sure that SDG 9 (“Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure”) is compatible with sustainability (Lim et al. 2018), and that SDG 17 (“Partnerships for the Goals”) facilitates the corporate capture of the SDGs (Rai et al. 2019; Eisenmenger et al. 2020). SDG 8 “Decent work and economic growth”, which undermines sustainability directly, has come under the most extensive criticism from the start of the Agenda 2030 process and discussions (Adelman 2018; Demaria 2018; Rai et al. 2019; Hickel 2019a; Eisenmenger et al. 2020). This is because long-term economic growth is at odds with ecological sustainability (Haberl et al. 2020; Wiedenhofer et al. 2020). The need for remaining within a safe operating space for humanity also encompasses the need for transforming work, creating new forms of work, and terminating work, since the work process is the mediating link between society and the environment (UNDP 2015). This makes the focus on the “decency” of work a good start for social outcomes, but inadequate for long-term social-ecological sustainability. Reimagining SDG 8 – from “Decent Work and Economic Growth” to “Sustainable Work and Economic Degrowth” is therefore a critical first step to making the SDGs more internally coherent, and meeting the goals of Agenda 2030. We provide a new framework, targets, sub goals and indicators for SDG 8 in line with the latest scientific evidence and the paradigm of strong sustainability. The new framework provides a starting point for further discussions on indicators to measure societies’ independence of growth, and hence move towards sustainability. The remaining sections are organised as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant literature and provides the background for the study. Section 3 documents the research method and design of the study. Section 4 provides the findings of the analysis of the current SDG 8 framework, as well as the new proposed indicator framework. Finally, Sect. 5 provides tentative policy advice, provisional conclusions, and avenues for further research in this field.",11

For states and governments, employment raises taxes, guaranteeing the financial resilience of (welfare) states. At the same time, environmental and climate targets are increasingly being mainstreamed into new policy fields, like labor market policy, that—until now—had little collaboration with environmental topics. In order to bring the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly SDG8, the Paris Agreement, and the European Green Deal into effect, it will hence be of utter importance to make jobs greener while maintaining a high level of employment. Given the importance of jobs and high levels of employment for household income, state budgets, stable social security systems, and social participation in communities, it is not surprising that the threat of unemployment has been the most powerful argument against adequate environmental policies, particularly climate policies that entail a profound change of production processes (Vona 2019). However, there will be no jobs on a dead planet (ITUC 2015), so greening employment is a prerequisite for maintaining employment in the long run. Employment relationships exhibit large leverage for a sustainability transition as the largest share of income stems from gainful employment, people spend most of their disposable time working (or preparing for work e.g. studying, commuting), while the cultural importance of employment shapes our society’s institutions, for example through unions and professional ethos. This paper presents research on the relationship between employment and its impacts on the environment. Using a Taxonomy of Sustainable Employment, this paper analyses how eight different strategies in employment and social policies contribute towards environmental sustainability. Contentwise this entails two foci: First, the paper focuses on the environmental dimension of work—it therefore blanks other aspects of what matters for the evaluation of jobs. This is no disregard of the importance of jobs being quality opportunities to earn sufficient income and labor laws protecting workers. Yet, with organizations like the International Labor Organization, the social dimension of employment has already been elevated to an established position, while the environmental dimension of work is largely disregarded in assessments of employment. This paper contributes to closing this gap. Second, this paper focuses on formal, paid employment. Hence, it neglects the largest share of work: unpaid work, like care work and volunteering. Contrary to paid employment, additional time spent on care work barely increases resource consumption (Smetschka et al. 2019). Hence, a shift from paid employment to care work could protect the environment (De Lauretis et al. 2017). Existing labor policies focus on employment and largely disregard the domain of unpaid work. The (un-)sustainability of work is therefore currently predominantly institutionalized through the regulation of paid employment. As this paper seeks to analyze the institutionalizing and potentially transformative power of labor (market) policies, it focuses on the domain of work mostly structured by labor (market) policies: paid, formal employment. The paper focuses on describing how the eight strategies manifest in a change in the jobs of individuals. Individuals will, however, in most cases not be the agents of change or might only become agents of change under different structural conditions. Which legal and institutional changes are necessary for this structural change and which actors can develop and implement the policies depends on country-specific labour market characteristics. The paper gives examples of implemented policies but does not systematically discuss the role of individuals, companies, unions, social security insurances or other actors in a green labour market transformation. After a short recap on the theoretical approaches to greening employment, the paper summarizes the Taxonomy of Sustainable Employment with its four dimensions: the output type approach, the occupation approach, the work-lifestyles approach, and the outcome efficiency approach (Sect. 2). The data used and methods applied are then described (Sect. 3). Hereafter, the results identify eight major strategies of greening work through labor market policies and discuss their contribution along the dimensions of the Taxonomy of Sustainable Employment (Sect. 4). The conclusion summarizes and presents future research applications (Sect. 5).",7

In 2015 the United Nations (UN) launched its Agenda for Sustainable Development with an aim to pave the way for “prosperity and opportunity for all on a healthy planet.”Footnote 1 The UN further elaborated its ambitious objectives by defining 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), among which SDG8 occupies a central position for simultaneously promoting sustainable and inclusive economic growth and employment. Among others, Stern and Stiglitz (2021) highlight the strong connection between these dimensions.Footnote 2 Similarly, Mealy and Hepburn (2021, 397) point out that “traditional industrial routes out of poverty are dangerously emissions-intensive” and discuss the common features of transformational change towards the UN climate and development goals. 2021 further stress the importance of new green technologies and products in order to achieve a sustainable growth path. Finally, Stern and Stiglitz (2021, p. 19) also find reason for optimism when it comes to the role of new technology: “The fossil-fuel economy was borne of innovation, and it could as well die as a result of innovation.” This paper investigates how public policies associate with the adoption of new green energy technologies (GETs) and the self-reported impacts on competitiveness in a large sample of individual companies. Within the far-reaching agenda of the SDGs, it aims to contribute in particular at the intersection of energy efficiency, technological change and climate change. But do we really need policy to interfere with the energy efficiency of private businesses? From a conventional economics perspective, there are valid reasons to answer in the negative. Higher efficiency implies lower cost to the individual enterprise, thus providing private incentives to adopt new GETs as long as the savings match the cost of investment. Also for most non-renewable energy sources property rights are well established. If consumption is excludable, prices reflect rents from scarcity and the rate of exhaustion should be welfare-efficient (Hotelling 1931). In contrast, Solow (1992) defined sustainability as an ethical norm of inter-generational equity: to ensure that future generations can be as well off as we are. The distant future, however, is not well represented in the market, and opinion surveys have revealed comparatively low concerns in the overall population about the natural environment.Footnote 3 As a consequence, sustainability is not adequately covered by private decisions and the conventional rationale of allocative efficiency. Hence, robust concerns for sustainability arise with regard to the emission of green house gases and the consequent perils of climate change, where the sheer scope of the problem dwarfs many of the economist’s standard analytic premises. When assessing the benefits and costs of public intervention, the very long time horizon, uncertainty, nonlinear impacts and the related risk of irreversible, catastrophic events largely obliterate the use of expected values or market-based discount rates, instead calling for a general conservationist bias.Footnote 4 Most rationales of public intervention originate in the so called double externality problem, which points at the simultaneous occurrence of negative spillovers from pollution and exhaustible resources in addition to the positive spillovers from innovation and the adoption of “greener” technologies.Footnote 5 Yet in the presence of increasing returns these ecological problems are likely to be amplified by path-dependency and lock-in effects. Therefore, the conventional focus on cost-efficiency and the correction of relative prices alone won’t suffice to change trajectories.Footnote 6 According to Frankel (2004), societies face three distinct paths of transformation: One is to address the scale of operations—that is, pursuing less or no growth with all its consequences of foregone real income and distributional conflicts, especially between developed and developing regions. Even if cushioned by far reaching measures in terms of the redistribution of global incomes, the negative trade-off between such a strategy of de-growth and the UN’s SDG8 are obvious. A second path is to change the composition of activities. At high per capita income, environmental efficiency tends to improve, because of structural change in favour of services and preferences for a clean environment.Footnote 7 While this contributes to the decoupling of the growth of emissions relative to that of output, growth is nevertheless likely to further increase the cumulative stock of pollutants. Innovation and technological change open a third path, which enhances structural change but also reduces the emissions of given activities. At a fundamental theoretical level, it corresponds to the tendency of dissipative systems to either increase the access to free energy or to raise the efficiency in its use.Footnote 8 However, whether innovation and structural change ultimately can be sufficient to decouple material well-being from resource throughput will depend on the aggregate rates of growth in resource efficiency relative to that of labour productivity and of the population (Bretschger 2020; Hahnel 2021). In more practical terms, Nordhaus (2019, p. 2013) emphasises that technological change lowers the cost of reducing \(\hbox {CO}_2\) emissions and provides for a “last refuge” if other policies fail. The focus of our research is on such technological change. But unlike the growing literature on own environmental innovations, which uses patents, R&D expenditures or other relatively well-available measures from common innovation surveys as dependent variables, we are interested in the adoption and perceived impacts of the new technologies. Our central concern is how different policy instruments such as standards and negotiated agreements, taxes or subsidies are related to the adoption of GETs by the companies and thus to their self-reported environmental impacts and competitive position in the market. For this purpose, we had to create a new enterprise survey, which we then conducted simultaneously in Germany, Austria and Switzerland (the ‘DACH region’). There are obvious similarities in how the three countries deploy the policy instruments mentioned above. For instance, in the field of energy policy guaranteed feed-in tariffs for electricity from renewable sources exist in the entire region. They intend to foster investments in the production of renewable energy by reducing the uncertainty about future demand and prices, but also imply that final users must bear higher electricity prices. Similarly, all three countries levy various carbon taxes, e.g. on fossil fuels, and participate in trading systems for carbon emissions. Finally, in innovation policy the growing concerns about climate change tend to shift funding priorities in favour of GETs. But each country has its distinct history, institutional setting and policy framework. For example, during the past decades Germany has put much emphasis on the promotion of renewable energy,Footnote 9 which is expected to substitute for nuclear power after its planned fade out. Germany was the first of the three countries to introduce guaranteed feed-in tariffsFootnote 10 for electricity from renewable sources already in 1991. This contributed greatly to the remarkable increase of the share of wind and solar power in total electricity production.Footnote 11 Another policy that led to higher energy prices was the ecological tax reform in 1999, which included the introduction of a new electricity tax. In addition, the petroleum tax was redesigned to provide better incentives for the purchase of energy-efficient vehicles. A further example is the CO2 Building Rehabilitation Programme aimed at incresing the incentives for energy-efficient building refurbishments. The German Federal Government is also running several R&D programmes that foster the development of energy-saving technologies. Generally, there are no large-scale voluntary agreements on energy saving or energy efficiency on a cross-industry level, though individual industries, such as the chemical industry or the automotive sector, have been following such an approach. In Austria the relative abundance of hydraulic power has provided a comparative advantage to energy intensive industries, such as metal processing or cellulose and paper, which still produce a comparatively high shares of manufacturing output. Another particular characteristic is Austria’s ban on nuclear energy, which was enacted after a public referendum in 1979. Energy policy thus always ranked relatively high on the public agenda, while energy intensive producers enjoy considerable political leverage.Footnote 12 In 2015 the new Energy Efficiency Law became the focal point of the country’s regulatory approach in this area. After adopting EU guidelines, energy suppliers (except small ones) must prove concrete measures to achieve annual efficiency gains of 0.6% relative to their previous year’s total energy sales. These efficiency gains may originate either from their own operations or from their customers and depend on the ratio of energy inputs to output (i.e. not on total energy use).Footnote 13 In addition, the law commands large companies either to install a proper energy management system (EMS), or to have an energy audit every four years. Compared to Germany and Austria, Swiss policy has generally been more reluctant to intervene in favour of GETs. The Swiss framework is mainly characterized by market incentives and voluntary agreements.Footnote 14 Switzerland nevertheless has some important targeted policies, though these were often introduced much later than in the two other countries. For example, in 2008 the first commitment period of the Kyoto protocol initiated a carbon tax and a (still rather narrow) emission trading system started in 2013. Similar to other rules applied in the European Union, there are regulations of, e.g., emissions of passenger cars, or the labeling, promotion and installation of renewable energy plants. Public subsidies are available in form of a technology fund to promote innovations for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the consumption of resources, supporting also the use of renewable energy and the increase of energy efficiency. There are also subsidies for basic research and applied R&D in the form of pilot plants related to GETs. After these introductory remarks, Sect. 2 introduces the main heuristics and hypotheses, whereas Sect. 3 presents the data and descriptive statistics. Section 4 explains the econometric model and results. Section 5 summarizes and concludes. Finally, we provide a list of abbreviations, references, and an Annex with supplementary tables.",7

Feldstein (1976) and Baily (1977) build on the implicit contract theory to motivate recalls: Firms temporarily lay off workers to compensate for a decrease in demand, and recall them at a later point in time. This approach is linked to an implicit agreement according to which laid-off workers will be recalled as soon as the firm’s situation improves. Thus, temporary layoffs and recalls can be used as an instrument to shift labor costs onto the economy or the unemployment insurance system (UI), as shown by Albertini et al. (2020). Analyzing the job search behavior of employees during a temporary layoff, for instance, White (1983), Mortensen (1990) or Fujita and Moscarini (2017) reveal a lower search effort among workers who expect to be rehired. However, their search effort increases the longer the period of unemployment lasts in order to avoid negative effects on their productivity. Empirical studies analyzing this topic show high numbers of recalls and thus the relevance of recalls for the likelihood of unemployed individuals re-entering employment. Figures of 30% or more are found by almost all international studies, such as for the U.S. (Katz and Meyer 1990), Spain (Alba-Ramírez et al. 2007; Arranz and García-Serrano 2014), Austria (Böheim 2006; Nekoei and Weber 2015, 2020) or Sweden (Jansson 2002; Nivorozhkin 2008). For Germany, the corresponding figures are somewhat lower, ranging from 17 to 22% (Mavromaras and Rudolph 1995, 1997, 1998; Liebig and Hense 2007; Edler et al. 2019). Despite these high figures, the topic of temporary layoffs or recalls by previous employers is still often neglected when explaining unemployment dynamics, even though it is a popular instrument used by firms to reduce costs (Liebig and Hense 2007). Studies for Germany indicate large differences in the effects of recalls on employment and in the frequency of use between industry sectors. In particular the construction sector, but also hotels and restaurants, use recalls frequently (Edler et al. 2019). This is due above all to seasonal fluctuations in demand (Mavromaras and Rudolph 1995) and in economic activity (Liebig and Hense 2007, Nekoei and Weber 2020). Moreover, Mavromaras and Rudolph (1998) provide evidence of more frequent recalls in small firms and explain this by the absence of works councils in smaller firms, which tend to reject this instrument. Concerning the impacts of recalls, some studies find direct effects on wages. Kodrzycki (2007) and Edler et al. (2019) reveal wage penalties for rehired workers compared to workers not affected by temporary layoffs. However, re-employed workers earn higher wages in comparison to new employees. Mavromaras and Rudolph (1997) provide further evidence of higher wage penalties for re-employed women, suggesting discrimination. An important but neglected aspect that is closely related to temporary layoffs and recalls concerns fixed-term contracts, as shown by Alba-Ramírez et al. (2007) and Arranz and García-Serrano (2014) for Spain. Accordingly, spanish firms use fixed-term contracts, which enable them, amongst other things, to reduce cost-efficient work force by not extending these contracts as, for example, no redundancy payments have to be paid and no social aspects have to be considered. At the same time, firms still have the option of re-employing laid off workers at a later date if, for example, demand for goods rises. In this way, fixed-term contracts can be used to conduct recalls in Germany as well and to undermine employment protection laws, which usually prohibit temporary layoffs. Analyzing recalls in Spain, Alba-Ramírez et al. (2007) obtain results indicating that the probability of a recall is higher for unemployed workers who had previously had a fixed-term contract. Arranz and García-Serrano (2014) also provide evidence that firms use fixed-term contracts to mitigate seasonal fluctuations in demand and recall laid off workers later. Further, they demonstrate that the instrument of fixed-term contracts is an essential part of Spanish firms’ business strategies. I build on previous studies on recalls and closely follows the work of Mavromaras and Rudolph (1995), Liebig and Hense (2007), Alba-Ramírez et al. (2007), and Arranz and García-Serrano (2014). In particular, I analyze the importance of recalls for the German labor market and the relevance of fixed-term contracts in this context. The interplay between fixed-term contracts and recalls is particularly relevant in the German context, as the German labor market is considered less flexible due to strong employment protection laws. These laws make temporary layoffs and recalls more difficult to use. I use a large administrative individual data set, linked to establishment data for the years 2012–2017. Due to the administrative character of the data and information on individuals on a daily basis, the data are highly accurate and reliable. I can thus precisely identify transitions from unemployment to employment and control for various characteristics, such as wage, industry sector, occupation, education, or region. I provide at least three important contributions. First, I analyze the relationship between fixed-term contracts and recalls for Germany, which was not yet examined for Germany. Second, I consider seasonal and business-cycle recalls with regard to fixed-term contracts, which was not yet addressed by previous literature, either. Third, the extensive and accurate data, which are not available in most comparable studies, enable me to provide a more detailed picture of unemployment dynamics related to temporary layoffs. Using a competing risk framework based on survival time analysis with unobserved heterogeneity, my results indicate an interplay between fixed-term employment contracts, unemployment and recalls for Germany. Unemployed workers who were previously employed on fixed-term contracts are more often rehired by their previous firms. This applies in particular for women and migrants. Furthermore, my results provide evidence that firms use recalls to cope with seasonal fluctuations. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides information on legal regulations and the identification strategy. The data, the summary statistics for the main variables as well as the data preparation are described in Sect. 3. Sections 4 and 5 present the estimation and sensitivity analyses, respectively. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes.",

Export remains the main driving force behind this inspiring growth (He and Zhang 2010). In the 1980s, China adopted a low-priced leadership strategy, viz. low labor cost and high production capacity, which allowed the operation with low-profit margins. Accordingly, China managed to increase its share in the global commodity market from 1.9% in 2000 to 11.4% in 2017. Using this strategy, Chinese companies targeted middle- and low-income countries, where competition is considerably intense, and rapidly increased their global export market share (Lew and Sulaiman 2014; Martin and Mejean 2014; Obeng 2019). However, the widespread adoption of a low-priced leadership strategy by exporting companies led consumers to associate Chinese products with low quality (Karanfil 2015; Zhang and Su 2009). Researchers have presented the existing perception by comparing Chinese goods to both domestic and foreign goods in several countries (Franco and Roach 2018; Khan and Ahmed 2012; Kim et al. 2015; Laforet and Chen 2012; Schniederjans et al. 2004; Srivastava 2015; Watung 2014). Over time, consumers generalized this perception about all Chinese products, including those of higher quality (Barney and Zhang 2008). Other significant developments increased the negative perception of Chinese products around the world. In 2007 and 2008 specifically, reports were issued about Chinese goods that led to food and product safety concerns (e.g., toys dyed with lead paint; melamine in wheat gluten, rice protein, and infant milk powder; harmful pet foods; toothpaste with toxic content; and hazardous drug residues in farm shrimp species) (Becker 2007; Gale and Buzby 2009; Obeng 2019; Peijuan et al. 2009; Watung 2014; Wu and Chen 2013). Although China has improved the quality of its exports in recent years, this improvement has not been sufficient to change the general perception of low quality. This can be due to the heterogeneous distribution of exporting sectors without spreading across the whole export basket (Zhang and Dai 2018). The negative perceptions toward Chinese products affect the country’s export performance (Cagé and Rouzet 2015; Rodrik 2006), considering the perception of consumers towards a particular commodity are more determinative of individual preferences than of actual product quality (Zeithaml et al. 1988). Within this scope, existing studies show outgrowth in income level influences consumers to relatively buy higher-priced products, branded (Üstüner and Holt 2010), luxurious (Madinga et al. 2016), healthy and safe (Hwang and Choe 2016), environmentally friendly (Brécard et al. 2009), organic (Smith et al. 2009), hedonic and snobby (Kambiz and Fereshteh 2013) sophisticated and complicated (Hausmann et al. 2014), and personalized goods. Such goods are sold at a higher price and are relatively perceived by consumers as higher-quality goods (Erickson and Johansson 1985; Lichtenstein et al. 1988; Lichtenstein et al. 1993; Widell 2005; Azhar and Elliott 2006; Hallak 2006; Wiedmann et al. 2009; Ray and Vatan 2013; Pham and Ali 2016). Linder (1961) developed a demand-side approach for foreign trade by addressing this relationship between quality and income, which was revealed through microeconomic studies in the context of foreign trade. According to Linder, changes in income indicate changing demand structures—thus, with increased income, countries spend a higher portion of their income on high-quality products (Linder 1961). This implies consumers tend to buy lower-priced products within the same product segment when income depreciates with time. Linder’s hypothesis that implies countries experiencing an increase in income level mount up their demand for quality products was analyzed by Hummels and Skiba (2004), Hummels and Klenow (2005), Hallak and Schott (2011), Brambilla and Porto (2016) and Hummels and Lee (2017). Thus, the development in demand structures that occurred during the global crisis of 2008–2009 further supports this hypothesis. The negative income shock during the global crisis increased demand for lower-priced products within the same product segment, whereas demand for comparable higher-priced products decreased significantly. Given that price represents quality (Dodds et al. 1991), the shift indicates a transition from high-quality products to low-quality products (“flight from quality”) (Fajgelbaum et al. 2011; Levchenko et al. 2011). Because the fall in Chinese imports was less than that of other countries during the global crisis (Behrens et al. 2013; Lattemann et al. 2012; Levchenko et al. 2011), China was comparatively less affected by the global recession. China had an increase in real income of 8.5% and 8.8%—during and after the global crisis, respectively. These dynamics reveal that the perceived quality of Chinese products impacts exports. Considering the general global perception of Chinese products as less sophisticated than the same product segment from other countries, and demand for higher-quality goods increases with income growth—it is likely Chinese exports could increase to a specific threshold of income level in partner countries. If this threshold is exceeded, Chinese exports might then decrease. This mechanism suggests the relationship between China’s exports and the income of partner countries is synonymous with the “U”Footnote 1 concept proposed by Kuznets (1955)—which explains the relationship between income inequality and per capita income. The approach expounded by Kuznets was widely accepted by researchers and saw fruition in economics, viz., the relationship between environmental degradation and economic growth (see Grossman and Krueger 1991) or the relationship between democracy and income distribution (see Chong 2004). In this study, we investigate how Chinese export and income dynamics across partner countries interact over time by utilizing the U concept—by proposing the quadratic nexus between real income and real exports as the “Trading Kuznets Curve” (TKC) hypothesis. There is a dynamic relationship between exports and income depending on many factors, including preferences, quality of relevant goods, and consumer habits. If a trade-off relationship exists between exports of one country and the income level of its partner countries, it is crucial to establish a threshold income level for partner countries and ascertain the market direction after it surpasses the country-specific income level. However, existing studies that examine the relationship between exports and income of partner countries are based on a monotonic assumption—ignoring the possibility of an inverse U-shaped relationship. In other words, if the estimated income coefficient of a partner country is positive (negative), it is assumed that income growth would increase (decrease) exports. Such an approach may hinder the development of effective export strategies for markets with various income levels. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the possibility of a dynamic relationship between exports and income across partner countries rather than assuming only a monotonic relationship. From this perspective, the purpose of this study is to investigate whether a quadratic relationship exists between China’s real exports to 154 partner countries and income of these countries for the period 1996–2019. Such an approach will help China develop effective export strategies, specify target markets, determine quality diversification policies suitable for its target markets, and sustain the country’s trade competitiveness. The study will contribute to the existing literature on export–the income relationship as follows: First, to the best of our knowledge, no existing studies examine the export–income relationship using a quadratic model for China or other countries. The quadratic approach will allow for empirical testing of the dynamic interaction between export of China and the income level of its trading partners. The findings will be significant in terms of estimating the validity of an inverted U-shaped nexus between China’s export and the income level of its trading partner—by understanding the export dynamics of China. This is essential to determine which markets and up to which income level China can maintain its competitive power. Second, the vast majority of studies investigating China’s export demand function failed to account for the cross-sectional dependence phenomenon frequently encountered in panel data analysis. Hence, ignoring cross-section dependence may lead to biased estimates and undesirable policy results. For this reason, panel data analysis methods that account for cross-section dependence are employed in this study. This study contributes to the existing literature in subject, concept, sample, and method.",

Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 50 countries have asked the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank to suspend repayment of their loans or at least interest. Sovereign debt is skyrocketing all around the World from already elevated levels. In some countries, inclusive of the United States, it is expected to become higher than ever (even after the Second World War it was not as high). Soon, even more countries may struggle to cover their borrowing needs. This will put pressure on the risk premium they pay. Rising interest payments will add to fiscal tensions. Pandemic costs and efforts to mitigate them may bring off about another wave of crises, the fiscal ones. Governments may soon face a serious problem of convincing creditors that lending to them is safe. Literature abounds in studies on fiscal adjustments, their sustainability, and impact on growth. The research on the risk premium following fiscal tensions is scarcer. We build on the former strand of the literature, especially as it comes to methodology and reference results, and contribute to the latter. We investigate what works in lowering the risk premium following fiscal tensions and what doesn’t. We put a particular focus on fiscal adjustments’ composition and accompanying reforms, or more generally, factors found to sustain fiscal adjustments and reduce their costs in terms of aggregate demand. We examine how those factors work in reducing the risk premium following fiscal tensions. We also check if fiscal tensions delay payoffs from reform efforts. Put it differently, we verify whether these tensions undermine trust in the government so much that creditors become insensitive to its announcements and react only to actions (or their effects). To identify fiscal tensions we extend Reinhart and Rogoff (2011) definition of fiscal crises by criteria based on Baldacci et al. (2011a), Baldacci et al. (2011b) and Cottarelli (2011). Fiscal crises narrowly defined are very rare among advanced economies. The extension allows us to study these economies and use long time series of both the risk premium and its likely determinants that are available for them. Our sample covers 22 OECD countries in the years 1978–2017. However, being aware of the discretion of the definition of fiscal tensions, we verify how robust our results are if we focus on periods of fiscal adjustments instead. Their identification is (much more) mature. We use the action-based method developed by Alesina and Ardagna (2013), Alesina et al. (2017), and Devries et al. (2011). Besides, we obviously check robustness of our findings to changes in definitions we apply. Our approach to studying the risk premium builds on the framework often used in studies on fiscal adjustments, e.g. by Alesina and Ardagna (2013), Alesina et al. (2012) and many others. Using the same method, we can easily compare our results to theirs. Recall that we aim at verifying to what extent factors reducing the risk premium following fiscal tensions overlap with those that make fiscal adjustments sustainable and lower their costs. The approach is very simple. Using Student’s t-tests, we compare averages of explanatory variables sub-sets distinguished by the risk premium changes. That is exactly what for example Alesina and Ardagna (2013) or Baldacci et al. (2011a, b) are doing, but we base our analysis on significantly broader set of variables (over 100 variables) and we supplement it with ANOVA analysis. The major drawback of our approach is that it provides only qualitative results. However, quantitative results for periods following fiscal tensions, when economy often does not work as usual, risks being of limited precision (and hence, reliability). Besides, to alleviate this drawback, we recall estimates from many other studies. Although those studies do not focus on fiscal tensions, the estimates allow one to form a view on order of magnitude of the impact of the factors that we find out significant. The strength of the approach is that it allows us to study any number of likely risk premium determinants and is robust to data gaps and non-linearities. Nonetheless we have to stress that it has serious limitations, on top of only qualitative nature of results obtained. Most importantly, based on it, formulating any conclusions as to mechanisms or, especially, causality of any kind is not warranted. But this is not our goal: we simply aim at indicating which variables, used as explanatory variables in other studies, correlates with carefully identified fiscal stress and relaxation periods with different characteristics expressed in different risk premium dynamics. The paper makes at least three contributions to the literature. First, it examines a wide set of likely determinants of the risk premium. We check about a hundred of them, which is the vast majority that has ever been analysed. Second, the paper focuses on periods of fiscal tensions. Understanding what influences the risk premium over exactly these periods is of particular importance. Success in reducing it may then bring particularly large gains while failure risks extreme pains. Although the literature points to a total of about a hundred risk premium determinants (see above), it does not address which of them play a key role in the periods of fiscal tensions. Third, the paper combines two strands of the literature: one devoted to the risk premium determinants and the other concerning fiscal adjustments. In particular, it compares in what part risk premium determinants overlap over fiscal tensions with factors behind successful fiscal adjustments. Thus far, these two strands have largely developed in separation, even though they interrelate. Elevated risk premium should encourage fiscal adjustments, while their success or, conversely, failure, but also procrastination should affect the risk premium. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section two discusses (in more detail than above) the related literature. Section three presents our research strategy and briefly describes the data used. Section four provides the main findings and verifies their robustness. Section five concludes.

This is particularly so when shocks of a large magnitude impact the economy, for instance the COVID-19 pandemic and the currently abnormally high inflation, which may be due to excessive expansionary monetary policies at the global level. Recognition of the aforementioned quantities is fundamental for the design of economic policies. There is, however, no structural modeling framework in the literature that explains them at a global level. The task is left to empirical estimation strategies, which refer only to certain areas, such as the advanced countries. This paper addresses this gap. We used a general equilibrium model to calculate the natural interest and potential gross domestic output growth rates and project them at a global level into a possibly distant future. This was conducted using a micro-founded description of economic sectors (i.e., households, firms, and government, and the evolution of real and financial markets-in particular, private and public savings) in a multi-country context that includes advanced and emerging economies. The potential gross domestic product (GDP) and the real natural interest rate (NRI) in the long term cannot be estimated unless the main components of the economy are taken into account, such as the saving and investment behavior of agents in the economy, the economy’s institutional characteristics, and the interconnections of these components at the international level that affect productivity growth. Moreover, the projection of potential output is becoming increasingly crucial in estimating the long-term consequences of macroeconomic policies, such as those related to climate change policies or to defining the long-term public debt path. For those reasons, as in Holston et al. (2017), and Williams et al. (2020), we determine interest rates and growth simultaneously but working with a calibrated model rather than using econometric measurement. We add specific processes to the model like capital depreciation, labor share dynamics, and demographic changes so as to explicitly specify the trends in preferences and technologies, and we measure their contribution to the interest rates and and growth in GDP. We build a multi-country overlapping generations (OLG) model that includes the United States, Germany, Italy, and France as advanced countries, and China, India, and Africa as emerging countries/regions.Footnote 1 We simulate the model over a long period in history (1960–2019) and the future (2020–2100) to calibrate the model parameters. We assume some exogenous trends that would affect the natural rate projection. For calibrating exogenous factors, we use an index of human capital based on Barro and Lee (2015) education attainment data, UN population projections (United Nations 2019), the capital stock (Berlemann and Wesselhöft 2014), and, for historical matching, the GDP level and the debt-to-GDP ratio (see calibration, Sect. 4). We use the model to estimate the effects of the interaction of trends that would be reflected as a contribution to the dynamics of natural rates and potential growth. The analysis is thus not specific to a single economy/area but considers emerging and advanced countries as being of equal importance. Moreover, our specification of capital markets in the OLG model allows for multi-country effects to be gauged via a capital market allocation mechanism that, over time, is increasingly open to considering a process of increasing globalization. In this kind of model, this is a novel feature that allows measurement of the effect of the heterogeneity of saving behavior among areas and also links to the long-run globalization process, that is, the increasing role of emerging countries in supplying and demanding real investment financing. Our main contribution is to determine the weights of the exogenous components of the model in explaining the potential growth rate and the natural rate of interest. The long-run projection confirms the decreasing path of GDP and interest rates for all countries, with interest rates becoming steadily negative for the advanced economies. This would allow the debt-to-GDP levels to be stabilized in the long-run. A corollary of our analysis is to provide an estimate for natural rates both for China and for emerging countries such as India. Understanding the determinants can thus assist in the design of long-run structural economic policies able to maximize growth and help monetary policy in its long-run operational functions. We find that, in addition to aging, the increasing obsolescence of capital goods has led to a reduction in natural interest rates in Europe and the United States; meanwhile, a reduced share of labor income has caused movement in the opposite direction, leading to an increase in natural interest rates, in contrast with the available empirical evidence. While, in the past, the human capital contribution has played an important role in terms of the potential growth of advanced countries, its contribution in the future would vanish due to weak demographic evolution. The opposite holds for the emerging countries where the main factor sustaining potential growth would be the pace of accumulation of human capital, which in the future would quickly emerge as a substitute for the importance of labor supply. In addition, using calibration strategy and demographic projections of this kind, we can project the dynamics of public debt and public finance that are consistent with long-term growth and interest rate paths. Nevertheless, for many countries, we find a debt-to-GDP ratio that grows in size due to the aging process in the advanced countries. This projection could be useful for advising policymakers of the possible evolution of the “equilibrium levels of public debt,” given the natural evolution of the economy. To sum up, our approach allows us to obtain model-based projections which represent non-filtered estimations of the leading natural variables for the major advanced and emerging economies. In particular, we obtain natural long-run projections for GDP, interest rates, savings, wages, technological trends, net foreign asset position, and public debt. The paper aims to show the methodology and the modeling strategy used and not to provide an update on the determination of natural levels. We have carried out the analysis until 2019 without including recent macroeconomic developments related to the COVID-19 crisis, which will be analyzed in a separate paper. The model is designed to allow further developments that we leave for future research, such as greater disaggregation of these areas/countries and an extension to other economies. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the literature related to natural rates and long-run drivers of economic growth. Section 3 describes the model and Sect. 4 shows how we calibrate the most relevant parameters and exogenous variables. Results are presented in Sects. 5 and 6 concludes. “Appendix 1” discusses stylized trends and empirical facts.",

In this paper, I elaborate on this observation and try to fill this gap. The paper starts by introducing the relevant indicator (“S2”) and explaining why it cannot be derived in the usual fashion if the current low-interest situation lasts too long (Sect. 2). Section 3 illustrates the problem using simulations prepared for the Fifth Sustainability Report published by the German Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF 2020) and discusses whether this non-result is really harmful. In Section﻿ 4, I present an alternative approach to deriving the S2-indicator in a continued low-interest environment and demonstrate how it can be applied to the German example. Section 5 concludes, discussing the implications of the findings for analyses of fiscal sustainability and for long-term fiscal planning.",2

The S2 indicator measures the permanent adjustment in the primary deficit that is necessary to satisfy the government’s intertemporal budget constraint (IBC) which is defined for an infinite period. The S2 indicator is analyzed in detail in the European Commission’s Debt Sustainability Monitor (DSM) in comparisons across (policy) scenarios, countries and time. The report’s findings play a crucial role in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact and the European Semester. As a result, the S2 indicator has a significant indirect influence on policy decisions. Arguably, sustainability indicators used for policy decision making should be transparent and simple to analyze. In this paper we look at two properties of the S2 indicator that do not satisfy these requirements. First, the response of the indicator to changes in the interest rate-growth (r-g) differential is not readily predictable in terms of both strength and direction. The reason is that a change in the interest rate-growth (r-g) differential acts through two channels, sometimes with opposite effects. These channels can be illustrated by representing the S2 indicator as the sum of two annuities—one annuity translating the baseline debt (d) level, S2(d), and a second annuity translating all primary deficits (pd) expected in the future, S2(pd). The first annuity (S2(d)) clearly increases (decreases) as the discount rate (r-g) increases (decreases). For the second annuity (S2(pd)), the response depends on the trajectory of primary deficits since the discount rate affects the weighting of primary deficits over time. When the discount rate is increasing (decreasing), primary deficits that are close (distant) in time are weighted more heavily. For instance, this means that when the discount rate is low, the indicator gives strong weight to projected primary deficits in the distant future. The sum of the two annuities (S2(d) + S2(pd)) responds to a change in interest rates in a clearly determinable direction only when deficits are projected to decline. When primary deficits are projected to increase over time, the direction of change in the S2 indicator is not easily determinable, since the interest rate responsiveness of S2(d) and S2(pd) partly cancel out each other. Second, for low values of r-g (in a range of 0.5%), the influence of highly uncertain projections for distant periods on the S2 indicators is very large. For example, projection values for periods after 2070 explain up to 80% of the S2 indicator in some scenarios. To capture the unexpected properties of the S2 indicator, we propose a new decomposition of the S2 indicator. The new decomposition exploits the observation that many sovereigns pay interest rates on their sovereign debt that are empirically lower than capital market interest rates on other asset classes, and hence, adopts the notion of premia (Reis 2021). Our decomposition allows for a more transparent discussion of the extent to which changes in the S2 indicators’ values are due to direct fiscal policy actions or due to more indirect changes in the discount rate of the government’s inter-temporal budget constraint. Additionally, the decomposition allows to disentangle parts of the indicator which are less dependent on very distant periods. Related Literature. This paper relates to a broader literature that seeks to understand the sustainability of public debt based on indicators (Blanchard 1990; Escolano 2010; Debrun et al. 2019; Furman and Summers 2020; Gründler et al. 2022). Many of these indicators seek to gauge the fiscal adjustment that will bring the public debt level to a targeted debt level (in % of GDP) within a given number of periods (e.g. S1 indicator). These indicators depend on a chosen debt target level and time horizon. Despite its practical appeal, the choice of target public debt levels and number of adjustment periods lacks theoretical rigor. Instead, the S2 indicator’s definition of long-term fiscal sustainability directly follows from the intertemporal budget constraint of the government and can be related to Blanchard (1990). Several papers focus on discussing important properties of the S2 indicator. In a recent paper Werding (2021) describes how to calculate the S2 indicator without imposing special restrictions. Andersen (2020) and Werding et al. (2020) provide an intuition for unexpected responses of the S2 indicator with respect to changes in the interest rates. We complement their studies by showing analytically that an in-depth decomposition analysis is indeed required to make the mechanisms transparent. Additionally, this paper contributes to a literature investigating the impact of the discount factor on the inter-temporal government budget constraint. In this regard, several papers provide explanations for why sovereigns pay interest rates on their debt that are empirically lower than the capital market interest rates on other assets (Reis 2021; Bayer et al. 2021; Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen 2012). Some papers (e.g. Jiang et al. 2019) argue that the discount factor used for the government budget constraint should be the same as for pricing other risky assets. We use the findings of this literature for a new decomposition of the S2 indicator. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 outlines the properties of the S2 indicator and provides an in-depth decomposition of the response of the S2 indicator to changes in the r-g differential. Additionally, we explore the reliance of the indicator on distant periods. In Sect. 3, we introduce our new decomposition of the S2 indicator using the notion of premia. A concluding analysis is presented in Sect. 4.",1

Lagoa,Emanuel R. Leão,Diptes P. Bhimjee,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"If markets are forward looking—like we presume they are—when making judgements about the sustainability of the public finances of a given country they should consider not only the current public-debt-to-gdp ratio but also where this ratio is heading to (Is it growing? Is it steady? Is it falling? How quickly is it moving?). In this paper, we use the dynamic equation of the public-debt-to-gdp ratio to build a database with projections of future values of this ratio in euro area countries. We then estimate a regression to see if these projections can explain the risk premium markets are currently demanding to hold the public debt of the various countries. The literature has used the public-debt-to-gdp ratio, the government’s budget deficit, real GDP growth and the inflation rate as explanatory variables in regressions that try to explain the risk premium of treasury bonds. Underlying these studies is the fact that the aforementioned four variables are key determinants of the evolution of the public-debt-to-gdp ratio. In the present article, instead of using those four variables as explanatory variables, we use them to make projections of future values of the public-debt-to-gdp ratio—via the dynamic equation—and we then use these projections as explanatory variables in a regression. The specificity of our approach therefore lies in that, before estimating the regression, we use the dynamic equation of the public-debt-to-gdp ratio to explore the precise nonlinear mathematics through which the four variables influence the future values of the ratio. To perform our projections and estimations, we used annual data for the Euro Area members. We find that, as expected, projections of future values of the public-debt-to-gdp ratio do impact current 10 year bond spreads, but markets seem to give more weight to forecasts with a horizon smaller than 10 years. These conclusions remain valid after robustness checks. Moreover, our results suggest that agents use a relatively simple mechanism to forecast the public debt-to-GDP ratio, a mechanism which can be used while updated forecasts from international organizations are not yet available. Finally, according with our estimations, euro area sovereign debt markets ceased to significantly discriminate countries based on their public debt prospects after the 2012 ‘Whatever It Takes” Mario Draghi speech and the announcement of the Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) program—indicating that these events contributed to ease tensions in the market. The structure of the article is as follows. Section 2 makes a review of the literature. Section 3 presents the methodology and the data. Section 4 shows the results we obtained and then analyses and interprets them. Section 5 concludes.",

While the liquidity transformation carried out by investment funds serves an important economic function, it comes with risks to financial stability. Indeed, since investors can redeem on any trading day based on the most recent net asset value (NAV), the costly adjustments of funds’ portfolios due to the redemptions may be reflected to a large extent in future NAV and borne by the remaining investors, potentially leading to the first-mover advantage. What is more, the way the asset manager meets the outflows can strengthen the first-mover advantage as demonstrated in a theoretical model by Zeng (2017). Therefore, understanding the liquidity management practices employed by funds’ asset managers when facing investor redemptions is important for mapping risks to financial stability, building stress tests, and navigating regulatory and macroprudential tools.Footnote 1 There are two broad strategies that funds may follow to meet investor redemptions: “horizontal cut” and “vertical cut”. In the horizontal cut, the portfolio manager liquidates cash and liquid assets first to save on trading costs associated with investor outflows. Simultaneously, this practice increases relative exposures to illiquid assets for the remaining investors. On the other hand, if a fund engages in vertical cutting, it scales down the fund’s assets proportionately. This, however, may induce trading costs. Unless funds appropriately charge the corresponding costs to the exiting investors, the expected dilution of the fund can prompt the remaining investors to redeem their shares. Using detailed data for Czech open-ended bond and equity funds, I show that there is a strong propensity to reduce liquid buffers rather than sell securities to meet redemptions in bond funds. Importantly, this propensity increases after one takes the illiquidity of funds’ bond holdings into account. Such a strategy may increase vulnerabilities in the system due to the negative externalities for the remaining investors. Equity funds deplete their liquid buffers less aggressively than the bond funds studied. This might be due to the higher market liquidity in equities than bonds. The limited relationship found between the choice of strategy and the portfolio liquidity for the studied equity funds can be taken as additional evidence that this might be the case. I also show that liquidity management practices are considerably different under stressed market conditions. I track a large propensity to reduce cash balances in bond funds during stress periods, when market liquidity is low and uncertainty is high. For equity funds, I show that historically they have tended to dash for cash in response to investor redemptions during severe market turmoil. This paper contributes to the literature in at least three respects. Firstly, it focuses on funds from a less developed market rather than on funds from advanced markets (such as the U.S.), which have been studied relatively extensively. I aim to fill this void, as it is interesting in terms of portfolios of the investment funds studied and their investor base. The funds studied usually invest in assets from less liquid emerging markets, and their investors can have different sensitivity to funds’ performance stemming from different wealth, risk appetites, and possibly financial literacy.Footnote 2 Finally, I motivate the need to contribute to the rather “U.S.-centric” literature by the staggering growth of the investment fund sector in some EMs, such as the Czech Republic, Chile, and many others.Footnote 3 Despite this rapid growth, empirical research of the vulnerability mechanics and risks stemming from the sector in less developed markets is very scarce. The second contribution lies in the uniquely compiled dataset, which tracks funds’ portfolios and related cash flows at monthly frequency. The unique reconstruction identifies cash flows stemming from: investor inflows and outflows, purchases and sales of securities, inflows from securities (such as dividends, coupons, and maturities), and other inflows (such as margin calls). It provides a detailed picture of the fund’s liquidity and its use. I employ the reconstructed flows to identify liquidity management practices in a natural and easily interpretable way. I also provide results based on reported gross investor flows rather than net investor flows that are usually built from the error-prone return-adjusted approximation.Footnote 4 Such data advantage is relatively rare in the literature, and, as far as I know, unique to the study of liquidity management practices in funds. Thirdly, thanks to the detailed reconstruction of cash flows, I contribute by identifying pure “liquidity need” episodes for the funds studied, i.e., months when the fund had to choose which part of its assets to liquidate, since its total outflows were greater than its total cash inflows. I thus contribute to the literature by reporting results on funds’ strategies that are not biased by the “steady-state”, business as usual, behavior, but are built upon the decisions fund managers had to take during a true liquidity squeeze. Such results are more insightful for calibrating a stress-testing framework in addition to understanding financial stability risks posed by funds when circumstances are far from usual. The next section reviews the literature I build on and contribute to. Then I introduce the sector of Czech investment funds, compare it with other investment fund hubs in Europe, and my develop research hypotheses. The fifth section motivates and introduces the empirical strategy. The sixth section summarizes the data. In the seventh section I provide the core of the paper by testing the hypotheses. I follow with a battery of robustness checks that run the gamut from alternative market turmoil conditions, portfolio illiquidity proxies, omitting institutional investor funds or mixed strategy funds, as well as a decomposing investor outflows into expected and unexpected ones. Then I conclude.",

This is evident in the fact that trade is more volatile than GDP, owing to the numerous interconnections between countries. As seen in Fig. 1, trade volumes in China, the EU27, and the United States all fell in the first half of 2020 before slightly recovering in the second half, with China being the first region to return to pre-pandemic levels. Early in 2021, the United States surpassed the level of 2019, while the EU27 is still at the level of 2019. Exports reacted more strongly than imports in general. Current estimates for annual GDP growth show values of − 5.9% for the EU27 (e.g. − 8% for France, − 4.6% for Germany)Footnote 1 and − 3.4% for the United States. Only China reported a positive growth rate of 2.4%.Footnote 2 Source: Eurostat, FRED Monthly trade volume index, 2019 = 100. In response to the global health crisis and the threat of critical supply shortages, countries around the world began restricting the export of specific products such as masks and other health-related equipment (as well as people's cross-border mobility), reverting to a form of “emergency protectionism”, at least in the short term. Furthermore, multiple supply-side shocks arose as a result of severe lockdowns in various regions or nations, impeding manufacturing and transportation. In a world where industry is organized along global value chains (GVCs), however, the frictionless flow of goods is required to maintain the supply of essential commodities. Aside from the numerous regionalised production and supply shocks, the pandemic highlighted a heavy reliance on foreign manufacturing. As a consequence, the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee of the European Parliament has urged the European Commission “to find ways to restore pharmaceutical manufacturing in Europe”.Footnote 3 These trends raise the obvious concerns of how vulnerable our economies are to demand and supply shocks – both of which apply in the case of the COVID-19 health crisis – from within and outside the EU in general, as well as what role GVCs play in shock transmission. As a result, the subject of international trade and production integration's resilience is once again becoming a focus of economic research and a goal of public policy to reduce economic and health hazards. As the supply of key materials (like drugs, medicines, masks, etc.) demonstrates, this applies not just to individual enterprises and the way international production integration is organized within regional and global supply chains, but also to public sector activities (whether market-oriented or administered by government agencies). This study contributes to this literature by identifying potential vulnerabilities of global value chains at the product level. We provide an assessment of the vulnerability of product supplies concerning internationally traded products, by applying a product riskiness index. This index allows us to identify possible vulnerabilities of industry sectors and dependencies on trading partners. In Sect. 3, following the recent literature, the method for identifying “risky” products is outlined. The method is applied at the level of detailed trade data (Harmonised System HS 6-digit products) including more than 4700 products. A summary of the most important results is then shown descriptively. We will also show the usefulness of this product riskiness index with two applications: First, combining it with multi-country input–output tables to analyse the imports of industries according to the contained share of risky products. Secondly, to assess potential effects of re-shoring policies.",1

This transition has been necessitated by the adoption of strict CO2 emission limits on newly produced vehicles by the European Commission with the goal of decreasing the release of CO2 by the transport sector to limit global warming (EC 2019; Pardi 2021; CLEPA 2021; Biresselioglu et al. 2018). The expected adoption of the ‘Fit for 55’ package by the European Union (EU) will effectively ban ICEs in all new cars and vans starting in 2035 (European Council 2022). The automakers would be unable to meet these CO2 emission standards with the existing ICE technologies and many view EVs as the only viable alternative (Sigal 2021; McKinsey&Company 2021). However, different automakers have followed different strategies and different technological combinations to meet the emission limits. The goal of this article is to analyze the impact of this transition in Eastern Europe (EE)Footnote 1 to date in the context of the development of its automotive industry since the early 1990s and its relative position in the European automotive industry value chains and production networks. Theoretically and conceptually, the analysis draws on the global value chains (GVCs)/global production networks (GPNs) perspective (e.g. Gereffi 2018; Kano et al. 2020; Sturgeon et al. 2008; Coe and Yeung 2015; Coe 2021). Although the GVC and GPN perspectives are distinct, they share their focus on the transnational organization of industries in production networks/value chains, power distribution in these networks, the role of various institutions in affecting the configuration and operation of GVCs/GPNs, and the impact of GVCs/GPNs on economic development within the context of the international division of labor (IDL) (e.g., Pavlínek 2018, 2022a). For the purposes of this article the GVC and GPN perspectives are therefore considered as one analytical approach. I argue that the course of the transition to the production of EVs in EE is strongly affected by the relative position of the EE automotive industry in GVCs/GPNs and the IDL as the integrated periphery of the European automotive industry. I draw on the evolutionary economic geography perspective (e.g. Martin and Sunley 2006; MacKinnon et al. 2019) to contend that this transition is strongly embedded in and constrained by the previous foreign direct investment (FDI) dependent development of the automotive industry in EE (Pavlínek 2017a) and its current integrated periphery position in the European automotive industry production system. This article draws on statistical data about the automotive industry in EE, various automotive industry databases, press reports, specialized automotive industry media, and additional secondary information. It also draws on firm-level interviews previously conducted by the author and members of his research team in Czechia and Slovakia. The article is organized as follows: First, I briefly summarize the state of the automotive industry in EE. Second, I characterize the relative position of EE in the European automotive industry as the integrated periphery and present its basic features. Third, I explain how the integrated periphery position affects the transition to the production of EVs in EE. Fourth, I discuss the uneven nature of the transition in EE. Fifth, I analyze the development of the battery industry in EE. Finally, I summarize the basic arguments in the conclusion.",2

The two most prominent threats are political. First, the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the vulnerability of international value chains, prompting politicians to push for a re-shoring of production in order to reduce dependence on foreign suppliers and thus improve crisis resilience of the domestic economy.Footnote 1 The second threat stems from increased political tensions between China and Russia on one side, and the EU and the US on the other. The Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24th February 2022 has pushed the relationship between Russia and the political West to a new low, having provoked a cascade of economic sanctions and counter-sanctions. Political struggles with China seem negligible in comparison. However, while the Sino-American trade war has raged for several years (Bown 2020), relations between China and the EU are also by no means trouble-free. Following the opening of a Taiwanese representative office in Lithuania’s capital Vilnius in November 2021, both Lithuanian firms and European companies using Lithuanian inputs complained about trade restrictions with China (European Commission 2022). As a response, the EU has launched a case against China at the WTO, while simultaneously continuing the development of an Anti-Coercion Instrument. This recent spat has only been the latest in a series of conflicts between China and the EU. They are spurring a tendency to decouple, as both the EU and China are turning inwards to reduce their dependence on each other.Footnote 2 Against this background, we use a computable general equilibrium model of international trade based on Caliendo and Parro (2015) to investigate the impact of five decoupling scenarios on trade and welfare. Incorporating intra- and international input–output linkages, the model quantifies the effects of changes in bilateral trade barriers on 65 sectors in 141 countries, covering 98 % of economic activity worldwide. It is calibrated using the most recent version 10 of the input–output-database of the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) as described by Aguiar et al. (2019) and allows quantifying both direct and indirect trade effects such as trade diversion and real income effects. In the model, decoupling is achieved by a doubling of non-tariff barriers (NTBs) which strongly reduces trade while not completely eliminating it.Footnote 3 The first scenario assumes a doubling in NTBs between the EU and China (both unilateral and reciprocal). Keeping in mind the ongoing conflicts between China and the US, the second scenario analyses a decoupling between China on one side and the US and its allies (including the EU) on the other.Footnote 4 In light of the crisis in Ukraine, Scenario 3 simulates the effects of a trade war between Russia and the US and its allies. Scenario 4 models an even broader divide between the EU on one side and Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC) on the other. Scenario 5 investigates a trade dispute between the US allies and the BRIC countries. The paper shows that a unilateral decoupling of China from the EU (i.e. a doubling of NTBs on Chinese imports from the EU) would almost eliminate bilateral imports - a phenomenon the literature calls trade destruction (Bown and Crowley 2007). Perhaps less straightforward, Chinese exports to both the EU and the rest of the world also fall. This is because NTBs increase the cost of imported intermediates in China, thus reducing competitiveness of Chinese exporters that rely on foreign inputs. In addition, falling Chinese demand for EU products leads to a real depreciation of the Euro (in the model through falling EU prices), further reducing the competitiveness of Chinese exports relative to European goods. Our model also makes predictions on how trade relations of both parties with third countries would evolve. In line with the literature (Bown and Crowley 2007), we find that NTBs imposed on Chinese imports from the EU cause trade deflection (EU exports to other countries increase), import source diversion (China imports more from non-EU countries) and trade depression (the EU imports less from the rest of the world). A unilateral decoupling by the EU inverts these results. Not surprisingly, both parties would lose from a trade war (reciprocal imposition of NTBs), with welfare declining by 0.92 and 0.78 % in China and the EU respectively. Engaging in a trade war with the US and its allies (including the EU) would be even more costly for China. A trade war between Russia and the political West would inflict high economic damage on Russia, while the US and its allies would remain relatively unharmed on average. However, welfare declines are unevenly distributed, with Eastern European countries suffering most (even though still less than Russia). Overall, it becomes clear that relative economic size matters both for maximizing the welfare loss suffered by the political rival and for minimizing the own party’s losses. The paper relates to three strands of literature. First, it contributes to the literature investigating the impact of NTBs on trade. Several studies provide evidence for the trade dampening effects of NTBs, implying that they would constitute an effective instrument to achieve decoupling. By estimating ad-valorem tariff equivalents, Kee et al. (2009) show that NTBs restrict trade by almost as much as tariffs. Hoekman and Nicita (2011) even find a stronger trade dampening effect of NTBs compared to tariffs. In particular, the authors show that a 10 % increase in NTBs is associated with a 1.7 % reduction in trade. Similar conclusions are reached by Bouët et al. (2008) as well as Bratt (2017). Following the increased use of NTBs, the overall level of protection has not decreased between 1997 and 2015 despite the fall in tariffs during that period (Niu et al. 2017). Ghodsi et al. (2017) investigate different types of NTBs, estimating trade dampening effects ranging between 5 and 30 %, depending on the type of NTB imposed. More recently, Kinzius et al. (2019) show that NTBs reduce imports of affected products by up to 12 %, with certain types of NTBs having an even stronger effect on trade.Footnote 5 We add to this literature by modelling how the reduction in trade induced by the extreme measure of doubling NTBs translates into welfare changes. Crucially, we employ “exact hat algebra” (Dekle et al. 2008) to solve the model in changes rather than levels. This avoids the difficult endeavour of quantifying initial NTBs (Egger et al. 2015), which depend on manifold policy instruments. Sanctions are a specific form of NTBs. Through an embargo, products become non-tradable across country pairs. The counterfactual analysis of the impact of sanctions on trade flows is often modelled by introducing non-tradable sectors (Etkes and Zimring 2015; Crozet and Hinz 2020; Hinz and Monastyrenko 2022). We show that a doubling of NTBs acts almost as an embargo, even though it does not completely reduce trade flows to zero across country pairs. In an extension, we increase NTBs on energy imports from Russia up until they are completely eliminated. We also demonstrate that the damage inflicted by trade restrictions on the strategic rival increases with the economic size of the countries implementing them.Footnote 6 The paper also relates to Amiti et al. (2019) and Fajgelbaum et al. (2020) who investigate the impacts of the recent waves of protectionism. While those studies focus on the impact of tariffs recently imposed by the US government, this paper investigates how NTBs could be used to seal off an economy from a particular trading partner. Second, the paper contributes to the literature investigating the effect of trade barriers on untargeted countries. These are trade deflection as countries targeted by trade barriers export more to third countries (Bown and Crowley 2006, 2007, 2010; Baylis and Perloff 2010), import source diversion as countries imposing barriers on imports increase imports from non-targeted countries (Konings et al. 2001; Baylis and Perloff 2010) and trade depression as targeted countries reduce imports from non-targeted countries (Bown and Crowley 2007). Incorporating all these phenomena through changes in relative prices, our model reveals the impacts of a trade war between China and the EU not only on the two economies but also on their trading partners. Third, the paper relates to the literature on modelling trade flows in computable general equilibrium models (Costinot and Rodríguez-Clare 2014). These models have their theoretical foundation in the so-called gravity equation of international trade (Yotov et al. 2016). They model the structure of bilateral trade flows as a function of bilateral costs. In doing so, these models can be solved in changes, a practice made famous by Dekle et al. (2008) and referred to as “exact hat algebra”. The model used builds on the Ricardian framework developed by Eaton and Kortum (2002) and extended by Caliendo and Parro (2015) to incorporate input–output linkages between multiple sectors. This framework is especially useful for our analysis because input–output linkages play an important role in enhancing the effects of trade policy.Footnote 7 We include services trade and NTBs in this framework in a fashion similar to Felbermayr et al. (2021, 2020). Unlike them, we use the latest version of GTAP (Aguiar et al. 2019) for the calibration of the model. GTAP has the advantage that it not only contains a higher sectoral resolution (65 sectors) but also more countries (121 countries and 20 aggregate regions) than e.g. the World Input–Output Database (WIOD). Therefore, the model is based on detailed input–output linkages among a wide range of sectors and countries. Given the important role played by intermediate products in our model, the paper also relates to Gopinath and Neiman (2014); Halpern et al. (2015); Eaton et al. (2016); Alfaro et al. (2019); Antràs and Gortari (2020) as well as more generally to Goldberg et al. (2010) and Antràs (2020). This paper is not the first to simulate the impact of an increase in NTBs on trade and welfare. Sforza and Steininger (2020) model the welfare effects of the COVID-19 induced shock to global production networks in both an open economy with current trade cost levels and a closed economy which is characterized by 100 percentage points higher trade costs (the same increase as the one we use). Eppinger et al. (2021) apply a similar approach, showing that the welfare loss resulting from a COVID shock is smaller in a de-globalised world. Both papers show that welfare is lower in a world with high trade barriers. Instead of modelling a global decoupling, this paper investigates the impact of NTBs that are imposed between two very specific groups of countries. In contrast to Bachmann et al. (2022) and Chepeliev et al. (2022), who simulate the effects of decoupling from Russian energy exports, we investigate the impacts of a general decoupling that is not limited to energy trade. By revealing the true cost of an escalating trade war between China and Russia on one side and the EU and the US on the other, the findings are highly relevant for policymakers. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 describes the model used for the analysis, while Sect. 3 provides an overview of the data used to calibrate the model. Section 4 presents the baseline results, followed by extensions and a discussion in Sect. 5. Sect. 6 concludes.",1

(2020). Using firm-based data, their papers have shown that market power has continually increased since the 1980’s (except for a brief decrease during the 2007–2008 Financial Crisis) for the US and the world as a whole, mostly driven by the largest firms within markets. Although a too low market power could indicate a loss of competitiveness, an increase in aggregated market power is often associated, at least in theory, with a range of negative economic developments such as: decreasing total factor productivity and output (Baqaee and Farhi 2017), a decrease in the labour share of income (Autor et al. 2020), decreases in investments (Gutiérrez and Philippon 2017), loss of innovation after reaching a threshold (an inverted U-shape relationship), as seen in, for example, Diez et al. (2018) and Mulkay (2019). Furthermore, rising market power also has societal implications due to its contribution to rising income-inequality, see Ennis et al. (2019). This development has sparked interest globally among policy-makers, scholars and members of industry who are interested in understanding the cause of these changes, as well as obtaining a deeper understanding to measure market power. Central Banks are amongst the most important of these entities investigating this phenomenon due to the impact it has on pricing (see for example Koujianou Goldberg and Hellerstein (2012)), with examples including the recent speeches made by Praet (2019) at the European Central Bank, and the Economic Policy Symposium of 2018 organized by the Federal Reserve at Jackson Hole. Moreover, the question of competition and market power is gradually seeping into the political arena with calls increasingly being made to make markets fairer for all of those involved and more efficient as evidenced, for example, by the warnings and reform proposals given by the books Eeckhout (2021) and Baker (2019). This can be seen in Europe not only at the EU level (EU commission), but also at the national level with member-states using various tools and policies to reduce monopolistic action. The topic of market power has always been of crucial importance within the field of industrial organization, ever since Lerner (1934) first proposed an index measuring the markup of price over marginal cost. Subsequent literature adopted the Structural- Conduct-Performance (SCP) approach to study the market structure in detail to understand the causes of market power (Perloff et al. 2007). These papers did not rely on formal models of industry behaviour, rather were often case studies and inter-industry analysis mostly focused on one single year (Schmalensee 1987). The SCP approach was mostly interested in understanding market structures, and therefore limited itself to investigating one or two industries. Hall (1988) outlined a formal model and laid the framework through which markups estimation was generalized. The papers from Olley and Pakes (1996), Levinsohn and Petrin (2003) and Ackerberg et al. (2015) introduced novel ways to estimate production functions using a two- or three stages approach with control functions, solving the usually large problems of endogeneity caused by direct regressions. These papers paved the way to derive estimates for markups directly from production functions, for instance De Loecker et al. (2020). The markup, or the ratio between selling price of a final good and the marginal cost of production, is commonly used in the literature as a proxy for market power. Using De Loecker and Eeckhout (2018) terminology, the markup for firm i at year t is: \(\mu _{it} = {P_{it}}/{\lambda _{it}}\). Assuming that firms are profit maximizers, a markup of 1 is indicative that the firm is setting prices in such a way that they are not able to move beyond the break-even point (\(P_{it} = \lambda _{it}\)), and not making profits. A markup larger than 1 is commonly associated with firms exercising market power (\(P_{it} > \lambda _{it}\)). We propose using this same methodology of calculating markups based on production functions but using aggregated sector-level data instead of the firm-level data, which it was originally designed for in the paper by Hall (1988).Footnote 1 More specifically, in this paper we propose using a General Maximum Entropy (GME) approach with data from the World Input–Output Database (WIOD) as well as the WIOD Socio Economic Accounts (SEA) in order to estimate sector-level markups. Input–output tables such as the ones from WIOD, divides total global economic activity into sectors or industries (used interchangeably during the remainder of the paper). They provide information on the flows of goods or services encompassed within an industry, originating in one sector and ending up in another. Even though markup estimation using micro-based data is considered to be the benchmark in terms of precision (being able to provide estimates by percentile of firm-size along the distribution and conduct granular research), it also has a few notable problems, including: potential sample selection bias due to firms entering bankruptcy during the years of observation (sample attrition), difficulty of classifying a firm into a sector if it produces several goods and the problems of extracting volumes of inputs and outputs, which the SEA conveniently does provide, thus avoiding potential estimation bias arising from pricing,Footnote 2 and difficulty of finding data that is accurately representative of total market activity. The largest databases containing firm activity, such as Worldscope, have information for 70000 firms (De Loecker et al. 2020). These firms are often publicly traded thereby potentially skewing results upwards i.e. successful firms with sound balance sheets will be over-proportionately reported as they have better chances of selling stocks. Firm-level data has the further inconvenience of lacking information on certain sectors, thereby any analysis is constrained to a few, predominantly manufacturing sectors. This is a further advantage of using the SEA of the WIOD, as the data contained therein encompasses total market activity within countries, and represents at least 85% of world economic activity (Timmer et al. 2012). Finally, the WIOD and SEA are free and easily accessible to the general public. This runs in contrast to many databases offering firm-level information, as they generally require fees or are private and not accessible to the general public (for example, due to laws requiring confidentiality on handling firm data). Additionally, the use of micro-data is computationally very demanding, with programs having to process thousands (even hundreds of thousands) of firms thereby necessitating considerable amounts of time for estimates to be produced. The use of macro-data circumvents all of these problems, and is potentially able to yield results for the whole world, yet sacrifices precision. Moreover, this approach allows to fully integrate the strengths of input–output analysis into market power research. Input–output tables are excellent in calculating a myriad of measures and indicators pertinent to the fields of international trade and industrial organisation. These measures may not be easily obtainable using pure firm-level data, thus other dimensions may be opened up for research. A simple example of this type of analysis is shown in Sect. 5.3, which estimates the relationship between the positioning of the production process and Global Value Chains (GVC’s) i.e. the international fragmentation of the production process with markups. The results derived in that section corroborates theory and the empirical results of papers focusing on individual countries and industries. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives a summary of further relevant literature, Sect. 3 presents the basics of the methodology required to estimate market power indicators from IO data. Section 4 provides a general description of the estimation procedure proposed to derive these indicators from aggregate information. Section 5 presents an empirical application for manufacturing industries in the EU basing on data from the World IO database for the period 2000 to 2014. Section 6 closes the paper.",1
50.0,1.0,Empirica,09 January 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10663-022-09562-9,Fiscal policies in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina: are spending or revenue measures more effective?,February 2023,Klaus Weyerstrass,Rijad Kovac,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The economic and financial crisis of 2007–2009, meanwhile known as the “Great Financial Crisis” or the “Great Recession”, the following fiscal consolidation phase, and more recently the sharp recession due to the Coronavirus pandemic, have revived the debate in academia as well as among politicians about the adequacy of active fiscal stabilisation policies. During the “Great Moderation” since the mid-1980s, stabilisation policy had been considered to be of less importance (Lucas 2003). Except for such extreme events as the lockdown measures enacted to contain the spread of the Coronavirus in 2020 and 2021, within academia opinions about the effectiveness of expansionary fiscal policy measures are sharply divided. While some authors (e.g., Taylor 2009) argue against using fiscal policy in a discretionary way, others point towards potentially large multiplier effects of tax reductions or expenditure increases (e.g., Romer and Romer 2010). Although there is a lot of evidence regarding the effects of macroeconomic policies in different countries during the Great Recession, its interpretation still diverges among macroeconomists and politicians. In particular, the role of fiscal policy is subject to ongoing controversies (see, for instance, Coenen et al. 2008, 2013; Cogan et al. 2010). Coenen et al. (2008) analyse macroeconomic effects of fiscal consolidations, while Coenen et al. (2013) and Cogan et al. (2010) analyse expansionary fiscal policies. Coenen et al. (2013) find sizeable effects of higher government consumption and investment, while they conclude that revenue-based fiscal expansions only have small effects. Coenen et al. (2008) find that both expenditure and revenue-based consolidations can have a significant impact on macroeconomic aggregates, at least in a model with an endogenous response of the equilibrium real interest rate. Cogan et al. (2010) conclude that the size of fiscal multipliers depends on the macroeconomic model used and the underlying economic theory. Compared to traditional Keynesian models, fiscal policies are much less effective in new Keynesian models. In this paper, we aim at contributing to this debate by empirically estimating fiscal policy effects for Bosnia and Herzegovina, or to be precise for its entity named Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBIH). We are particularly interested in the question whether demand-side (Keynesian) fiscal policies aiming primarily at supporting demand can contribute to stabilising the economy or if some elements of supply-side orientation have to be added to render these policies successful. The debate between Keynesians and supply-siders was a hot topic in the 1980s in the wake of the oil price shocks and (as many macroeconomic policy debates) has not been completely settled since then. The prevailing opinion (though not a consensus) considers demand-side policies to be appropriate when combating an adverse demand-side shock but not necessarily when faced with a supply-side shock (such as stagflation). The Great Recession—as most real-world shocks—contained both demand and supply elements, but most interpretations agree that demand-side elements prevailed. Nevertheless, policies proposed by the European Commission and by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) contain calls for structural reforms to enhance growth and employment both in the short and the long term, which implies for fiscal policy to embed also supply-side measures. By contrast, many politicians and interest group representatives heavily criticize what they call the “austerity regime” of the European Commission, and advocate an expansionary fiscal policy stance in spite of already high public debt. With the help of an econometric model, we examine the question whether the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina would benefit more from demand or from supply-side measures of its fiscal policy. The theoretical and empirical literature finds that in general spending multipliers are larger than tax multipliers. However, measures reducing the tax wedge not only entail demand effects by increasing disposable income, but in addition they bring about supply-side effects by increasing incentives to work or by reducing the upward pressure in wage negotiations.",

This increase partly resulted from higher precautionary savings, which are a form of unconsumed income attributable to income uncertainty caused by large economic shocks, less generous lending conditions, and consumption smoothing (Ercolani et al. 2021). The increase in household savings was also caused by forced savings, which are additional savings generated by households during the pandemic. These savings emerged due to restrictions imposed by governments in order to limit household mobility and the accompanying risk of infection. These restrictions caused a drop in consumption. Meanwhile, gross household savings are the sum of precautionary and forced savings. Therefore, we assume that before the outbreak of pandemic, forced savings equaled zero and gross household savings were equal to precautionary savings. With the onset of the pandemic, forced savings turned positive. Like precautionary savings, forced savings constitute a flow variable that represents unconsumed income. The higher this flow, the greater the (forced) increase in a household’s stock of accumulated savings over time. This stock can be used to increase a household’s net assets (by enabling it to buy new assets or repay existing debts). Once pandemic restrictions are lifted, the flow of forced savings is driven asymptotically to zero and households may tap into their accumulated assets to finance postponed consumption (i.e., release their pent-up demand). Breaking down gross household savings into precautionary and forced components is relevant to discussions on adjustments to pandemic shocks. This is because precautionary savings may remain elevated for a long period of time and limit post-pandemic recovery, while forced savings may be utilized quickly as they fuel the pent-up demand once restrictions are dropped. In this study, we identify the determinants of forced household savings in 16 European Union (EU) member states in 2020. Our work is related to two strands of literature. First, a growing body of literature on the economic effects of pandemics points to a large and protracted negative impact on economic activity and social cohesion. Jordà et al. (2022b) show that pandemics are followed by sustained periods of a depressed natural rate of interest. A fall in the equilibrium interest rate results from fewer investment opportunities and a higher propensity to save, possibly due to greater precautionary savings or willingness to rebuild depleted wealth. Ma et al. (2020) estimate the effects of major global disease outbreaks in the 21st century on GDP growth and several other economic variables. They show that GDP growth falls persistently following pandemics, and that this effect is more pronounced in countries with less aggressive first-year fiscal easing. Goolsbee and Syverson (2021) analyze the impact of COVID-19-related government restrictions on consumer behavior in the US. They show that while overall consumer traffic dropped by 60%, restrictions accounted for only 7% points. Their results suggest that individual choices tied to fears of infection have been a major driver of declining consumer demand during the pandemic. Regressions run by Barro et al. (2020) show that during the 1918–1920 Great Influenza Pandemic, the flu-generated decline in private consumption was markedly stronger than the decline in GDP, thus pointing to an increase in the domestic savings rate. Kratena (2022) shows that in a household demand model with heterogeneous agents, the rebound of consumption after enforced saving due to the lockdown is complete after two periods; these are periods covering restrictions and post-lockdown adjustment. She also shows that significant substitution effects between consumption categories are observed. Furceri et al. (2021) focus on the distributional consequences of major pandemics in the past two decades and show that they led to increases in the Gini coefficients and a greater income share amongst higher-income deciles. Krueger et al. (2020) combine a macroeconomic model with an epidemiological model estimated on Swedish health data. They demonstrate that the “Swedish solution,” that is, letting the pandemic play out with little government intervention and thus allowing for the reallocation of consumption toward relatively safe sectors, helps avoid more than two-thirds of the decline in output and consumption. Their results are in line with those of the simulations performed by Eichenbaum et al. (2020). They extend the canonical epidemiology model to show that the recession associated with pandemics is exacerbated by people’s decisions to cut back on consumption and work to reduce the chances of being infected. Ehnts and Paetz (2021) focus on the interplay between fiscal response to the COVID-19 pandemic shock and the economic fallout of the pandemic. They argue that, to avoid the protracted post-pandemic economic slowdown, fiscal policies in the euro area have to be more expansionary and the ECB has to ensure the solvency of national governments. However, given the large asymmetry in the size of pandemic shock, fiscal expansion would run against debt sustainability in some EU countries. Hence, public debt mutualization scheme is needed to avert a new debt crisis and related aftershocks to economic activity (Barbier-Gauchard et al. 2021). Second, our study contributes to the ongoing discussion on the determinants of household savings. Cross-country studies for developed and developing economies on this topic are limited. However, empirical studies focusing on theoretically underpinned determinants of household savings point to income growth, real interest rates, inflation, life expectancy, old-age dependency ratio, education, average number of children born per woman over a lifetime, household debt, the gap between genders in higher education attainment and employment, giving childbirth at an old age, preferential income tax rates for households with children, households’ non-financial wealth, stock prices, cultural variables (thrift, trust, religiosity), reliance on direct income taxes, and government transfers as factors that influence household savings (Callen and Thimann 1997; Hüfner and Koske 2010; Hunt et al. 2021; Kool and Muysken 2013; Salotti 2010). Moreover, some empirical literature focuses on the effect of large economic shocks on household savings. Mody et al. (2012) show that at least two-fifths of the sharp increase in household saving rates between 2007 and 2009 can be attributed to the precautionary savings motive triggered by the elevated uncertainty from the Great Recession. Aizenman and Noy (2013) study the degree to which negative income shocks in the past lead to higher saving rates for affected households. They find that a greater experience of past crises results in higher household savings. One can expect that the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic will give a new impetus for research on the determinants of household savings in times of large economic shocks. We analyzed the determinants of forced savings in two steps. First, we used a panel model to explain the fluctuations in the gross household saving rate and we interpreted the residuals from that model as forced savings. Second, we constructed a random-effect panel model to explain the evolution of forced household savings as a percentage of disposable income in EU countries. Our results show that pandemic-induced changes in forced savings depend largely on government response in the form of imposed restrictions, as well as financial support for households and enterprises. The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2, we describe the data and econometric methods used. Section 3 presents the results of this study. The last section concludes the paper and outlines avenues for future research.",
50.0,1.0,Empirica,09 January 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10663-022-09557-6,Stability of pro-sociality and trust amid the Covid-19: panel data from the Netherlands,February 2023,Hamza Umer,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The novel Corona virus was first reported in December 2019 in the Chinese Wuhan city and within short duration spread across numerous countries. The Covid-19 has emerged as a global pandemic and challenged the economic, social and psychological well-being of human beings. Historically, human beings have shown immense resistance against disasters and for achieving shared prosperity during crises. The scale of destruction and challenges posed by the Covid-19 are however unprecedented and require special efforts to ensure the multi-facet damage is curtailed quickly. The existing preliminary research shows that pro-social preferences and trust can play an important role in fighting the challenges of the Covid-19 and in the enhancement of socio-economic and psychological well-being of people (Van Bavel et al 2020). Both pro-sociality and trust can enable individuals to cope up with difficult situations caused by pandemic, extend help towards others and cooperate with each other for repairing the damage caused to the societal setup, political institutions and the economic development (Bjørnskov and Méon 2013; Brañas-Garza et al. 2022; Brück et al. 2020). Moreover, recent evidence also suggests that prosocial people are more likely to take preventive measures (such as social distancing, staying home, wearing masks and intent of vaccination) for the containment of Covid-19 and hence make individual-level contributions for the overall safety and improvement of the society (Campos-Mercade et al. 2021; Ospina et al. 2021; Yu et al. 2021). The potentially important role of pro-sociality and trust in mediating the adverse effects of pandemic necessitates an investigation how Covid-19 has influenced these preferences. There is a possibility that adverse effects of the Covid-19 on the economic activity and co-occurrence of fear of virus contraction can produce psychological distress and make people less prosocial and less trusting (Pan et al. 2022). Similarly, uncertainty in the labor markets and fear of job loss can lead to reduced prosocial behavior specifically in the form of monetary donations. Also, enhanced economic inequalities due to disruptions in the labor market can cause social unrest and ultimately lead to a trust deficit in the society. Furthermore, as Covid-19 mandates social distancing and isolation, reduced interpersonal interactions due to such preventive measures can also decrease general trust in the society. Contrarily, ‘posttraumatic growth’ theory advocates the transformative influence of suffering and predicts a positive change in the personal and interpersonal behavior after experiencing a disaster or a stressful event (Tedeschi and Calhoun 2004). In the literature several other psychological theories also predict similar outcomes as suggested by the ‘posttraumatic growth’. Some of these include positive psychological changes (Yalom and Lieberman 1991), stress related growth (Park et al. 1996), positive by-products of the struggle (McMillen et al. 2001), stress and positive emotions (Folkman and Moskowitz 2000) and others (Tedeschi and Calhoun 2004). Similarly, positive psychology also suggests the possibility that stressful events can be a source of growth. Therefore, both posttraumatic growth theory and positive psychology would predict an enhancement in prosocial behavior and trust due to adverse effects of direct confrontation with the Covid-19. The prosocial behavior can also increase because donors understand the need and efficacy of donating money is higher during the pandemic when a vast majority of people is suffering.Footnote 1 Similarly, to tackle the stressful environment created by the Covid-19, people might become more prosocial because often these acts provide personal satisfaction and enhance well-being.Footnote 2 Some of the existing studies also report that exposure to challenges and stress can improve prosocial behavior and trust (Buchanan and Preston 2014; Von Dawans et al. 2012).Footnote 3 From an economic perspective, the policy studies and welfare analyses are performed based on the premises that preferences are stable over time (Drichoutis and Nayga 2021). Therefore, the traditional economic theory would predict no significant influence of pandemic on the prosocial behavior and trust. The existing literature that examines the influence of pandemic on pro-sociality and trust is relatively sparse and offers divergent results. For example, Shachat et al. (2021) and Zhang and Liu (2021) report that pandemic has increased prosocial behavior in China while Brañas-Garza et al. (2022) report opposite results from Spain. Brück et al. (2020) find that the general trust does not differ across the Covid-19 infected and uninfected people while Sibley et al. (2020) find increased trust post-pandemic among New Zealanders. This expanding pandemic literature only partially informs our understanding regarding the possible effects of the Covid-19 on prosocial preferences and trust because most of these studies use data collected at different times after the emergence of the Covid-19 (for example: Brañas-Garza et al. 2022) or use pre-Covid-19 data from a sample of same population (for example: Sibley et al. 2020). To precisely identify the impacts of the Covid-19 on pro-social preferences and trust, a panel analysis based on pre and post Covid-19 data is an optimal choice. Furthermore, most of the existing studies (very few exceptions such as Brück et al. 2020) per se do not examine how pro-sociality and trust vary across people who unfortunately contracted virus and those who remain safe (‘specific’ or ‘causal’ effects of pandemic). They examine general influence of pandemic on behavior. While this general analysis might capture some of the effects of ongoing pandemic (such as fear of virus contraction, mental health and psychological challenges, possible economic, social and political spillover effects), it does not reveal how pro-social behavior and trust levels of people who unfortunately contracted virus is affected in comparison to those who remained safe. This analysis is important because it can provide us profounder insights regarding the possible disproportionate effects of pandemic on preferences of infected and non-infected people, which subsequently can have implications for the public policies directed at mediating the effects of pandemic to support the socio-economic development. This paper addresses the aforementioned gaps in the rapidly growing literature and disentangles the ‘general’ and ‘causal effects’ of pandemic with the help of two studies. In the first study panel data from the Netherlands (LISS panel 2019–2020 by CentERdata) is used to examine the proportion of people donating to different causes as well as trust in other individuals (general trust) in a pre-and-post Covid-19 situation. The high-quality balanced panel data enables to perform a relatively precise analysis for the pre-and-post effects of the Covid-19 and draw conclusions based on a relatively large number of observations. The analysis reveals no significant changes in the proportion of donors as well as general trust level in a pre-and-post Covid-19 situation. The second study dwells further and examines whether the proportion of donors and general trust levels vary across the Covid-19 infected and uninfected people using the LISS panel data from the Netherlands. Unlike study 1, study 2 draws causal inferences for the effect of Covid-19 infections on preferences by using the difference-in-differences (DD) method. The DD analysis leads to insignificant variation in pro-sociality and trust levels among infected and uninfected people in a post-pandemic situation. However, sub-group analysis shows a positive causal impact of infections on trust for respondents above 60 years. Overall, both studies offer evidence that pro-sociality and trust are largely stable. The study contributes to the literature through several important avenues. First, it provides evidence for the effects of pandemic on prosocial behavior and trust based on a rich and balanced panel data. The high-quality nature of panel data helps to precisely identify whether people modified their prosocial behavior and trust in response to the pandemic. Second, the study performs inter-group comparison of pro-social behavior and trust across people infected and uninfected with virus. This comparison provides initial evidence on the extrinsic effects of the pandemic on preferences and places this study in the broader existing literature that examined the direct effects of exposure to violence and recession on pro-sociality (Voors et al. 2012; Fisman et al. 2015), and the effect of tsunami on trust (Cassar et al. 2017). The findings also contribute to the rapidly growing literature on the effect of Covid-19 on economic preferences (Angrisani et al. 2020; Binder 2020; Brañas-Garza et al. 2022; Brück et al. 2020; Fetzer et al. 2020; Sibley et al. 2020; Shachat et al. 2021; Zhang and Liu 2021 and others). However, the current work is different from these aforementioned studies in two aspects. (a) Several previous studies have examined the effect of extent of exposure to the Covid-19 (such as lockdown duration, local deaths due to virus, previous interaction with an infected person) while the current work (Study 2) focusses on the causal effect of already being infected by virus. (b) The time analyzed in this study is longer (2019–2020) than some of the existing studies (for example, Buso et al. 2020) examined preferences over six weeks after the start of pandemic while Brañas-Garza et al. 2022 examined generosity based on the data collected over a week). Therefore, the methodology and nature of data in this study are not completely comparable to the previous studies. Third, this work contributes to the ongoing debate on the stability of social preferences across time and their resistance to change due to the real-world shocks. The existing literature on the stability of preferences is polarized with studies arguing in favor (please see review article by Chuang and Schechter 2015) and psychological (for example: Hertwig et al. 2004; Filipski et al. 2019) and empirical studies (for example: Choi et al. 2009; Malmendier and Nagel 2011; Andersen et al. 2019) arguing against preference stability across time and natural shocks. The evidence in this study supports the literature that social preferences are stable over time and amid natural disasters. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The second section reports details about panel data and the statistical analysis that examines the general effects of pandemic on pro-sociality and trust. The third section reports details about panel data, examines endogeneity, performs baseline checkups and subsequently examines the prosocial behavior and trust across infected and uninfected people (causal effects) using DD analysis. Last section concludes the paper by discussing important implications.",1

Nordhaus (2007) has pointed out that the improvements in computing power over the last twenty years have enabled technical devices to perform tasks in real world applications. Hence, they bring the discussion of technological unemployment back on the political agenda. Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020) calculate that an increased use of robots in the US economy between 1990 and 2007 had a negative effect on the labour market. According to their calculations, an increase in the number of industrial robots by one, per 1000 people employed, reduces the employment-to-population ratio by 0.18 to 0.34 percentage points. In the past, machines have both complemented and competed with human labour. Inventive ideas and creative destruction, as Schumpeter (1942) puts it, have competed with powerful social and economic interest over the technological status quo. Various movements, such as the Luddites, who destroyed new machinery in the eighteenth century textile industry, have tried to deter progress in times of rising unemployment. However, the Luddite fallacy has found its way into the literature, as employment has not been eradicated alongside fast technological development, but instead continued to expand. Rather than eliminating human labour as such, technological advancements have changed a number of work profiles and led to the creation of new professions. Nonetheless, technological development in recent history has often been linked to a displacement in specific professions (Bresnahan 1999) or even entire industries (Charles et al. 2013; Jaimovich and Siu 2012). According to Goldin and Katz (1998), technological progress led to the simplification of work processes in the nineteenth century. A combination of machines and unskilled labour substituted skilled labour and decreased demand in terms of skills. However, as technologies improved, technological job displacement shifted away from skilled to unskilled labour. Similar to the competition between humans and robots for physical work, McAfee and Brynjolfsson (2014) emphasize that computerization has now started challenging human performance even in cognitive tasks. Beaudry et al. (2016), in an empirical analysis, find evidence that the demand for skilled labour has been declining in recent years. This is an indication that skills under pressure of substitution are altering as technological progress persists. Autor and Dorn (2013) show that the implementation of computer-based technologies has put pressure on wages. As routine tasks are increasingly automated, displaced workers reallocate to the lower skilled service sector with deteriorating wages. According to Goos et al. (2009), this has resulted in the increased polarization of the labour market in a number of developed economies (see also Dustmann et al. 2009). Increasing demand for well-paid jobs in which non-routine cognitive tasks are performed, as well as non-routine manual work at the lower end of the income distribution, in combination with the digitization of repetitive cognitive skills, is forcing employment away from the middle of the income distribution (see also Autor et al. 2003; Autor 2013; Michaels et al. 2014). Recent publications, such as Ford (2015), raise concerns that “this time it could be different” and there will be no room for creating new jobs. Technological mass unemployment has been proclaimed many times throughout history (Mokyr et al. 2015). Nevertheless, to date, technological advancement has not caused mass unemployment. We have seen a shift in labour from the agricultural sector to manufacturing branches, and further into the service sector (Autor 2015). Overall employment has been steadily increasing worldwide, despite (or perhaps because of) technological progress. Hence, new technologies display two opposite effects on employment (Aghion and Howitt 1994): On the one hand, technologies substitute human labour in order to decrease production costs and increase productivity. This displacement effect lowers employment. On the other hand, reduced production costs increase real income and hence demand. The latter effect fosters production and demand for labour. Frey and Osborne (2017) set the starting point for a series of papers that attempt to estimate the degree of susceptibility to digitization in the labour market. Addressing previous limitations, we assume that a significant share of the strong differences in the results between Frey and Osborne (2017) and follow-up studies is not only due to (a) task-heterogeneity of workers within the same occupation but also (b) due to model selection. As a case study, our investigation examines the degree of future digitization of job profiles in Austria. We link expert opinions with individual data from the OECD’s PIAACFootnote 1 data, which in turn allow for heterogeneity among workers within the same occupation. Our results confirm that a) an analysis at the job level instead of the occupational level decreases probabilities but also indicate that b) models with a binary outcome, as applied by Frey and Osborne (2017), result in a much higher share of jobs at risk than models with a fractional dependent variable, as used by Arntz et al. (2016)—even when controlling for varying tasks within the same occupation. In both settings, clerical computer-based routine jobs are likely to change in the next decade. Professional activities with the processing of complex information are less prone to digital change. The following Sect. 2 discusses the related research, while Sect. 3 describes the methodology and data used in this paper. Section 4 presents and discusses the results before the last section concludes the paper.",

Followed by a phase of recovery, which was mainly driven by the “new economy”. The bursting of the dot-com bubble led to an increase of the German unemployment rate to its all-time high in 2005 with 11.7%. However, up to the financial crisis in 2008 the unemployment rate fell sharply to 7.8% and even to 5% in the following decade. Figure 1 illustrates the development of the unemployment rate and the number of unemployed over the period 1991–2019. Hereby, the question about the cause of the strong decrease in the unemployment rate since 2005 naturally arises. Source Statistik der Bundesagentur für Arbeit (2020); Author’s own calculations Development of Unemployment in Germany. At this time, an important labor market policy milestone took place in Germany. In this regard, the German Hartz reforms stand out as a potential channel for the reversal of unemployment.Footnote 1 They had their focus on the restructuring of the low-wage sector in Germany. The labor market reforms were implemented between 2003 and 2005 in four stages (Hartz I–Hartz IV). Especially through the fourth stage (Hartz IV) and the introduction of the long-term unemployment benefit “Arbeitslosengeld II” (hereafter “ALG II”) on January 1st, 2005 it was hoped to cut the unemployment: On the one hand, the long-term unemployment benefit was initiated to provide a life of human dignity for all people living in Germany between the age of 15 and 65 (or 67), who are capable of working and cannot afford to satisfy their basic material needs.Footnote 2 On the other hand, the long-term unemployment benefit is conditional, and the recipients are obliged to aim actively for integration into the labor market. In the case of a breach of duty, the long-term unemployment benefit is reduced by 30%, in the case of a second time by 60%, and in the case of a third time the benefit is cut all together. The long-term unemployment benefit is financed by the federal government via the Federal Employment Agency (“Bundesagentur f\(\ddot{\textrm{u}}\)r Arbeit”), except for housing and other costs that are usually paid by municipalities and counties (§6 SGB II). Typically, the long-term unemployment benefit (“ALG II”) is paid after a person is unemployed for more than 12 months and thus is not eligible for the short-term unemployment benefit “Arbeitslosengeld I” (“ALG I”) anymore. Moreover, a person can be eligible for the long-term unemployment benefit even if the person is working, yet earns less than he needs to satisfy the basic demands. This group makes about one third of all long-term unemployment benefit (“ALG II”) recipients.Footnote 3 This paper investigates the impact of the German labor market reform (Hartz IV) on the German labor market at the German county level (“Kreisebene”). For my analysis I build on the new spatial multi-country and multi-sector equilibrium model of Caliendo et al. (2019). It includes a dynamic set-up, which considers the adjustments of the labor market, as the economic and policy effects on employment differ for each sector and need time to adapt. Further, the model provides a rich theoretical framework which takes input–output linkages, labor mobility frictions, goods mobility frictions as well as spatial factors into account. In order to incorporate the German labor market reform (Hartz IV) in a dynamic general equilibrium setting I apply the extension of the basic Caliendo et al. (2019) model, as it considers the policy effects of the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program in the United States. In doing so, I borrow closely from the SSDI framework and modify the model to make it suitable for analyzing the effects of German labor market reform. I add value through my empirical and counterfactual analysis. In particular, I conduct an analysis of the Hartz IV reform’s employment and welfare effects. Thereby, I answer the question: How would German employment and welfare have evolved, if the Hartz IV reform would not have taken place? I do this by constructing first a baseline economy where the data develop as they actually did. Second, I then construct a counterfactual economy for the case of the Hartz IV reform. By taking the difference between the baseline and the counterfactual economy I am able to identify the employment and welfare impact of the Hartz IV reform. In this regard, I undertake a comprehensive study of the German labor market effect that includes the county level and covers all 402 German counties (NUTS-3 level). The time of interest of my analysis are the years between 2005 and 2014, as during that time the German labor market reforms were introduced. Hereby, I construct an input–output table for the German counties, compatible with the World Input–Output Database (WIOD). I follow the approach of Krebs and Pflüger (2018) and use the production value added data for each county. The data is obtainable from the regional statistic data (“Regionalstatistik”) of the German Federal and Regional Statistical Offices, Statistische Ämter des Bundes und der Länder (2020). It includes seven sectors, which are the sectors of interest in my analysis.Footnote 4 With those seven sectors I am able to construct the input–output table on the county level. Further I include a short-term unemployment sector and a sector for the long-term unemployment (“ALG II”).Footnote 5 To identify income taxes and the costs of the long-term unemployment benefit (“ALG II”) I rely on the data of the federal government budget (“Bundeshaushalt”). Employment, short-term unemployment and long-term unemployment data are provided by the Statistics of the Federal Employment Agency (“Bundesagentur f\(\ddot{\textrm{u}}\)r Arbeit”). In order to identify the movement of households across sectors and counties, I construct a labor mobility matrix. In addition, I identify the probabilities of households becoming employed, short-term unemployed and long-term unemployed. My analysis shows, that without the labor market reform (Hartz IV) the German short-term unemployment would have been 0.4 percentage points larger. This is equivalent to a 385,000 decrease in the number of unemployed and explains a 25% decrease in unemployment between 2005 and 2014. Furthermore, I can demonstrate that welfare would decline as a result of the labor market reform, since the increased labor supply puts pressure on wages and thus reduces welfare. This is especially true for the East German counties. In the empirical part of this paper, I am additionally interested in the employment effects of German labor market reform through the rise of the East. That is the increase in trade between Germany and Eastern Europe due to strong productivity growth in Eastern Europe and Germany. Figure 2 shows that the German imports from Eastern Europe and the German exports to Eastern Europe grew stronger since 2005 (up to the financial crisis in 2008/09), compared to the previous years. This is indicated by the fact that the actual German imports from and exports to Eastern Europe are lager since 2005 than the import and export trend (if the imports and exports of 2005 would rise as between 2004 and 2005). Source World Bank (2021); Author’s own calculations German Trade Development to Eastern Europe. The analysis in my study includes eleven Eastern European countries. Thus, the data on Eastern Europe (in this graph) include those same countries, namely Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania. Dauth et al. (2014) find that the growing trade flows have led to net-employment gains in Germany, as new export opportunities economically stimulated regions with strong export-oriented sectors. Yet, other regions with sectors vulnerable to import competition experienced higher levels of unemployment triggered by the trade exposure. This led to unevenly distributed employment gains or even losses across different regions.Footnote 6 Dauth et al. (2021) suggest the rising productivity in Eastern Europe as a driving force behind the increasing trade flows.Footnote 7 Especially through the economic transformation the Eastern European productivity levels grew substantially, and hence, could have led to more pressure on the German labor market through increasing import competition. At the same time the German productivity grew as well and could have contributed to the increase in exports to Eastern Europe. However, less is known about the precise impact of productivity on the rising trade between Germany and Eastern Europe, and henceforth on the effects on the German labor market. Depending on which effect prevails, the rise of the East can contribute to the decline in German unemployment and accelerate the effect of the Hartz IV reform. The question then becomes, how would the German labor market have reacted if the Hartz IV reform had taken place, but without the simultaneous rise of the East? In other words: How substantial would the marginal employment effects of the Hartz IV reform have been as a result of the rise of the East? My focus is on eleven Eastern European countries, which are represented in the World Input–Output Database (WIOD) (Release 2016) by Timmer et al. (2015). Namely Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania. Since productivities play a crucial part in my study, I identify the precise productivity changes on the sectoral level driving the rising trade between Germany and Eastern Europe. I calibrate for Germany the changes in productivity that corresponds to the increase of Eastern European imports. For Eastern Europe I conduct the productivity changes, which are responsible for the import increase in Germany. I calibrate the productivity changes in two steps: In the first step, I use the instrumental-variable strategy by Autor et al. (2013) to conduct the predicted import changes for Germany and also for Eastern Europe, which arise from the productivity shocks. In the second step, I apply the iteration approach of Caliendo et al. (2019) to detect the productivity changes. By iteration the productivity changes are identified, when the predicted import changes match with the model’s import changes. I then conduct the counterfactual simulation in the following manner, closely using the approach of the SSDI model: First, I carry out a counterfactual analysis in which the rise of the East happens, but the Hartz IV reform does not occur. Second by running a counterfactual analysis in which both the rise of the East and the Hartz IV reform do not take place. The difference between the two analyses then gives the marginal effects of the Hartz IV reform through rise of the East. I observe that the rise of the East leads to an additional positive contribution to the labor market, as employment increases by 0.05%. The largest impact is in the manufacturing sector, where 40,000 additional jobs are created. My paper is based on several ideas from previous research. The approach of “dynamic hat algebra” used in my paper and developed by Caliendo et al. (2019) is based on the approach of relative changes of Dekle et al. (2008) and its “hat algebra”. Moreover, the applied Caliendo et al. (2019) model builds on the work of Eaton and Kortum (2002), Artuç et al. (2010) and Dvorkin (2014). It is linked to a strand of dynamic equilibrium models such as Artuc and McLaren (2010) and Dix-Carneiro (2014). Compared to the reduced form approach à la Autor et al. (2013), the general equilibrium framework of Caliendo et al. (2019) has several advantages: It allows for a comprehensive general equilibrium setting with input–output linkages and a spatial multi-country and multi-sector framework. Furthermore, it makes it possible to evaluate many different policy interventions. The general equilibrium framework enables analysis in multiple domains, e.g., employment and welfare effects in different labor markets. As Caliendo et al. (2019) point out that the reduced-form approach can only determine changes in workers in one labor market relative to another labor market. It is therefore more straightforward to examine aggregate welfare and employment effects in a general equilibrium framework. Muendler (2017) argues that the reduced-form approach delivers empirical results, albeit with less conclusiveness, and indicates that general equilibrium models provide clearer outcomes. Concerning the effect of the Hartz reforms several major studies have been conducted. Using different approaches and matching models the results vary from an unemployment decrease of 0.1% estimated by Launov and Wälde (2013) to 2% by Hochmuth et al. (2021) and of 2.82% by Krause and Uhlig (2012) as well as around 3% by Hartung et al. (2018). Krebs and Scheffel (2014) discover an unemployment reduction through the German labor market reforms (Hartz I to Hartz IV) by around 3%. However, they trace a 2% decrease to the impact of Hartz I to Hartz III (e.g. restructuring and increasing the number of “jobcenters” as well as the establishment of “minijobs”) and a 1% reduction to Hartz IV. I am able to show that using the comprehensive dynamic general equilibrium model that takes into account multiple sectors and counties, the impact of Hartz IV might be smaller. In addition, I complement the literature with a detailed evaluation of the labor market reform at the level of German counties. As a further effect, I include the rise of the East (increase in trade between Germany and Eastern Europe due to productivity growth in Germany and Eastern Europe), which amplifies the employment impact of the Hartz IV reform. The most recognizable work on the German trade exposure of Eastern Europe with its effect on the German labor market has been explored in a series of papers by Dauth et al. (2014, 2017, 2021). However, they do not explore the underlying fundamentals of the rising trade flows, e.g. fall of trade costs and rise in productivity. Related work has explored the effect of the “China Shock” on the U.S. labor market. Autor et al. (2013, 2014) and Acemoglu et al. (2016) suggest the productivity growth in China led to the “China Shock”, whilst Pierce and Schott (2016) demonstrate that the reduction of trade barriers, e.g. China joining the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, led to the growth of Chinese trade flows. The structure of this paper is as follows: In Sect. 2, I introduce a long-term unemployment state into an otherwise standard dynamic trade model à la Caliendo et al. (2019). Section 3 provides a description of the calibration of the data necessary to numerically solve the model. In Sect. 4 I present my findings of the economic impact of the German labor market reform (Hartz IV) and the additional labor market effects due to the rise of the East. In Sect. 5 I conclude.",

At the same time, the nature of trade has changed significantly and is characterized by globalized and vertical production of multinational companies (Gereffi et al. 2005). Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) facilitated increasing international labor division, where firms from various countries add value to geographically dispersed value chains (Baldwin 2006; Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg 2008). Gereffi et al.’s (2005) theoretical framework introduced the term and concept of ‘Global Value Chains’ (GVC), which has been broadly adopted in development and trade studies. This development has also reshaped the role and participation of emerging countries such as the BRICS,Footnote 1 in international trade, causing them to gain in importance (Gereffi and Fernandez-Stark 2016). In previous decades, the share of BRICS countries in international trade has significantly increased and now accounts for over a fifth of global trade volume. Today, BRICS countries are highly embedded in GVC and benefit from this participation by increasing income, growth, and employment (Singh and Dube 2014; World Trade Organization 2019). Most of the BRICS are still focused on the production and export of intermediate goods located downstream in GVC. However, countries such as China and India have entered the global service sectors since the 2000s, and particularly China has upgraded its position in GVC (Ye and Voigt 2014). The increasing international fragmentation of production highlights the role of different domestic and international regulations and economic policies. The quality and intensity of regulation significantly impacts firms' competitiveness and their ability to engage in international markets (Gereffi et al. 2005; Gereffi and Fernandez-Stark 2016; Kaplinsky and Morris 2001). The OECD developed an indicator set called Product Market Regulation (PMR) in order to understand which policy settings promote or inhibit competition. The indicator set allows to disentangle of different kinds of regulations and, for example, measures the extent of state control (e.g., direct governmental support of firms), barriers to entrepreneurship (e.g., administrative burdens), and barriers to trade and investment (e.g., tariff barriers). Moreover, it provides an economy-wide PMR indicator as a composite of the aforementioned sub-indicators. The economy-wide PMR indicator suggests that regulation has been decreasing continuously in OECD and BRICS countries in the last two decades, while it is still significantly higher in the BRICS countries (Koske et al. 2015). Regulatory policy needs to be critically reviewed in light of the dynamically changing structure of international trade, and many economists have called for regulatory reform (e.g., Noll 2000). From a policymaker’s perspective, it is crucial to understand which regulations might increase domestic production shares and which regulations might harm the country’s position in GVC. Notably, emerging countries must embrace policies that support upgrading in GVC, which entails firms evolving from low-value to high-value activities, inherently increasing wealth. Hence, regulation might play a more important role in BRICS countries in shaping their GVC participation. Precise measurement of the new trade patterns is essential to understanding the effects of different regulations. However, the traditional approach, which measures trade flows using gross exports and imports, is inaccurate. It does not capture the actual value that has been added in the exporting country. Therefore, the increasing complexity of trade flows calls for a more input–output-oriented approach. In recent years, new data on trade in value-added has been provided, and it is now considered a more accurate measure since it captures the actual value added of an exporter and avoids double-counting (Grossman 2013). The OECD (2020c) provides an extensive data set with aggregated and sectoral input and output tables for many countries. There are only a few studies that directly analyze the trade effects of regulation comprehensively and mainly focus on regulation that directly impacts trade flows, such as tariffs or technical barriers to trade (compare, e.g., Li and Beghin 2012), are sector-specific (Essaji 2008) or focus only on the structural impact of regulation (Marel 2015). Most empirical studies have explored the effects of regulation not directly on trade but instead on productivity (Bouis et al. 2016; Bourlès et al. 2013; Duval and Furceri 2018; Griffith et al. 2006), innovation (Aghion et al. 2005; Barbosa and Faria 2011; Bassanini and Ernst 2002; Blind 2012; Crafts 2006; Franco et al. 2016), and economic growth (Djankov et al. 2006; Koedijk and Kremers 1996; Loayza et al. 2005; Nicoletti and Scarpetta 2003). We are not familiar with any studies so far that have linked PMR to the more accurate measure of trade in value-added. From this large body of literature, we take inspiration to explore the trade effects of product market regulations. In this paper, we combine trade in value-added data, a more accurate measure of trade flows in GVC, and a comprehensive indicator dataset on PMR to answer the following research questions: How does different product-market regulation influence trade in Global Value Chains? Are the trade effects of product market regulation different in emerging countries? To investigate these research questions, we constructed a panel of 35 OECD and five BRICS countries between 2000 and 2015. We augmented a standard gravity model as introduced by Tinbergen (1962) and linked bilateral TiVA flows and gross exports to regulation indicators and control variables such as distances, economic masses, trade agreements, institutional quality, and multilateral resistance terms (Anderson et al. 1979; Anderson and van Wincoop 2003; Baier and Bergstrand 2007; Deardorff 1998). In addition, we disentangled the PMR indicators to account for the heterogeneity of regulation. Finally, we applied a Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood (PPML) estimation in our model (Silva and Tenreyro 2006). PPML is less biased in the presence of heteroscedasticity, and zero trade between countries does not have to be excluded, something which would need to be done for ordinary least squares (OLS) with log-linearization (Silva and Tenreyro 2006). The paper is structured as follows. The subsequent section presents the study background, providing a brief theoretical and empirical overview of the relationship between regulation and trade, and introduce the product market regulation indicators. We emphasize the shifting paradigms in trade theory that push policymakers to reevaluate their regulatory measures. Section 3 describes our research methods and data before presenting our quantitative analysis in Sect. 4 and discussing it in light of theory and practice.

This has led to advanced countries around the world implementing fiscal rules to control the development of government debt, deficit, expenditure and other macroeconomic aspects. Halac and Yared (2018, 2022) note that the number of countries following at least some form of fiscal rules has increased rapidly in the past 30 years. In the European context, the future of the European Union’s (EU) fiscal framework is currently uncertain. The general escape clause (GEC) of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) was activated in March 2020 due to the severe economic downturn experienced by the entire EU-area during the pandemic and most member country governments adopted an expansive fiscal policy stance to counter the major economic shock caused by the health situation and lockdowns. While an appropriate reaction to the sudden downturn, it led to substantially increased debt levels. As of writing, the GEC is set to be deactivated at the end of 2023 and the discussion on whether the SGP should be revised to better match the changed economic environment is underway as the review of the EU’s economic governance framework has been restarted.Footnote 1 Due to this development and the increasing amount of fiscal rules, a growing number of literature discusses different aspects, such as the impact of national fiscal rules on fiscal and macroeconomic aggregates, or the historical performance of EU-wide fiscal rules. Against this background, for the future of European integration as well as in view of the discussion on the potential revisions to the EU fiscal framework, it is important to understand how different EU-level and national-level fiscal rules affect the dynamics and development of public debt. However, the interplay between national and EU fiscal rules appears to be an under-researched area as of yet. This paper aims on filling a part of this gap and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first attempt at studying how a broad range of European institutions, reforms of the European fiscal framework and the introduction of national fiscal rules have affected public debt developments. The paper uses panel estimations with country and time fixed effects and merges macroeconomic data for the EU Member States with in-depth information on European and national fiscal rules. The findings suggest that the establishment of the EU and the establishment of the SGP have had a lowering effect on government debt. The effectiveness of national fiscal rules is very heterogenous and depends on the specific rules and layer of government they address. Most statistically significant classes of national fiscal rules remain significant when the effect of the SGP is included in the regression. In terms of policy implications, the results suggest that the European and national fiscal rules are generally complementary, and both can be used by policymakers for lowering debt levels or restricting the growth of debt. In addition, the EU fiscal framework and EU-level fiscal policies should take into account potential interactions with well-performing national fiscal rules to increase the effectiveness of fiscal policymaking. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: Sect. 2 presents some of the concepts used and previous literature concentrating on the research done since the financial crisis, Sect. 3 introduces the approach of the study and Sect. 4 the data used.

The ecological transformation of the economy and the need to reduce environmental emissions are major issues of our time. To better understand the mechanisms of the interplay between economic transition and emissions, it is worth examining a past comprehensive transformation—that of the former socialist states. The corresponding debates on the right way to tackle climate change are heavily polarized. While advocates of radical interventions are in favor of reducing resource and energy use with concepts of degrowth, proponents of market-based solutions rather demand industrial restructuring towards a greener and more sustainable growth path (e.g., Kallis et al. 2018; Hickel and Kallis 2020; Fernandes et al. 2021). The underlying question of these debates is whether and how we can overcome the trade-off between environmental pollution and economic prosperity. This trade-off is described by the Environmental Kuznets Curve (from here on, abbreviated as EKC), which, in its conventional variant, assumes a non-linear relationship between environmental pollution and GDP per capita in the form of an inverted U (Grossman and Krueger 1995; Dinda 2004). In recent years, many papers have returned their attention to the EKC, presumably because climate change and global warming have become increasingly urgent issues. Parallelly, the so-called economic complexity approach by Hidalgo and Hausmann (2009) and subsequent work, such as Hausmann et al. (2014), has opened a fresh perspective on economic development. Hidalgo and Hausmann (2009) propose a product-based indicator that aims to relate the products an economy is exporting to its knowledge intensity or, framed differently, its innovation capabilities. Hidalgo and Hausmann (2009) refer to this knowledge or innovation intensity as complexity and frame their indicator as the Economic Complexity Index (from here on abbreviated as ECI). Thus, for economic complexity, the underlying question regarding the pollution-development nexus modifies as follows: Can we overcome the trade-off between environmental pollution and economic prosperity by developing more complex products? Since products with more environmental benefits are, on average, more complex than products without these benefits, a complexity-driven bending of the EKC would suggest that more complex products reduce environmental pollution from a certain threshold (Mealy and Teytelboym 2020).Footnote 1 Various papers have since analyzed the relationship between economic complexity and environmental pollution in order to verify the characteristic inverted u-shape of the EKC hypothesis (e.g., Neagu 2019; Chu 2021; Chu and Le 2022; Balsalobre-Lorente et al. 2022; Pata 2021; Swart and Brinkmann 2020). Chu (2021) examines the relationship with a sample of 118 countries and confirms the EKC. Neagu (2019) uses a sample of 25 countries that are members of the European Union and also finds an inverted U in favor of the EKC. In addition, Chu and Le (2022) and Balsalobre-Lorente et al. (2022) confirm the EKC by examining the pollution paths of G7 countries and the PIIGS countries (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, Spain), respectively. In contrast, Pata (2021) and Swart and Brinkmann (2020) use time-series data for the USA and Brazil, respectively, and provide mixed evidence: The EKC is found to hold for the USA but not for Brazil. A related strand of literature examines the EKC with GDP per capita and adds ECI as an explanatory variable. While Can and Gozgor (2017) and Leitão et al. (2021) report a negative relationship between CO2 emissions per capita and economic complexity, Boleti et al. (2021) and Nathaniel (2021) find that economic complexity increases CO2 emissions. We supplement the literature in three ways. First, to our knowledge, we are the first to examine the link between environmental pollution and economic complexity for the former socialist transition countries. By doing that, we test the EKC hypothesis with a particularly well-suited sample since the former socialist transition countries experienced a major shock at a fixed point in time that impacted their future development. We exploit a massive and unprecedented decrease in CO2 emissions (minus 35%) and economic complexity (minus 11%) during the fall of the iron curtain, which credibly provides us with a sample of countries with comparable development starting points. We are aware, however, that despite the simultaneity of the shock, these countries already exhibited a decent degree of heterogeneity beforehand. The parallelly starting dynamics provide a useful ground for studying the EKC hypothesis, as it describes emission paths along the long-term economic development of countries which should ideally start at the beginning of the observation period. This distinguishes our approach from the previous literature, which, to our knowledge, did not yet consider a sample with a well-defined starting point. If country samples are heterogeneous and lack a joint starting point, it necessarily follows that differently developed countries are located on different parts of the curve during a given observation period. Consequently, there is no chance to observe the same parts of the curve for different countries. Therefore, a given (OLS) estimator will necessarily force a fit over the data that extrapolates the missing (and possibly large) parts of a country’s curve using data from other countries. Many papers (and so do we) circumvent the problem of heterogeneous countries by splitting the sample by income levels (see, e.g., Chu 2021; Doğan et al. 2019) or by choosing a fairly homogeneous group of countries (see, e.g., Nathaniel 2021; Alvadaro et al. 2021; Leitão et al. 2021; Balsalobre-Lorente et al. 2022; Zheng et al. 2021). However, the issue of the lack of a well-defined starting point has been largely neglected in the literature. In our view, analyses that identify the EKC by exploiting panel variation should, at best, conduct their analysis with fairly homogeneous country samples with similar starting points to be able to observe different countries at similar parts of the curve. We contribute to the literature by offering an analysis that addresses both of these issues, thereby putting the empirical literature on a more solid footing. Second, we highlight the (conventionally neglected) three-dimensionality of the EKC and thereby problematize the usage of the Economic Complexity Index when studying the question at hand. In this respect, we argue that the theoretical foundation of the EKC hinges on the implicit assumption that economic development progresses over time, which must not necessarily be fulfilled when studying less developed countries. In addition, as the ECI is a relative measure that captures different aspects of development than, for instance, per capita GDP, this indicator often decreases over time. Guided by these considerations, we propose a sample split based on the dynamics and not on the levels of complexity. By doing that, we bring the empirics of the EKC closer to its conceptual foundation and raise awareness for the challenges the usage of the ECI evokes. In our view, this has not yet been extensively problematized so far. Why is the proposed sample split particularly sensible for our sample? After the fall of the iron curtain and the deindustrialization of the socialist economies, the countries underwent a structural transformation. Hence, our sample provides the unique possibility to explore how different dynamics of development are linked to the existence of the EKC. Countries that progressed towards stronger and more inclusive institutions and opened their increasingly liberalized markets gradually exhibited increased knowledge and productive capabilities. This improved their production processes and resulted in higher complexity of their manufactured products. On the other hand, countries that did not transform towards more inclusive institutions exhibited opposite economic complexity dynamics. With our sample, we can simultaneously observe the pollution and complexity trajectories of both groups of countries. Third, we study the question at hand with both production-based and consumption-based CO2 emissions. We do that because one explanation for the existence of the EKC is that it is due to emissions offshoring, i.e., more developed countries offshore emission-intensive production to less developed countries, thereby reducing the emissions intensity of their domestic production without changing the emissions intensity of their consumption. In this study, we provide suggestive evidence on this strand of explanation. Overall, with our contributions to the literature, we aim to provide an empirical implementation of the EKC with respect to economic complexity that is more related to the theoretical foundations of this question. Methodologically, we use the Fixed Effects estimator and include linear and squared terms of ECI to account for the assumed nonlinearity of the relationship of interest. Additionally, we verify the inverted u-shape relationship with the U-test proposed by Lind and Mehlum (2010). We estimate the parameters of the respective model for various indicators of environmental pollution, most importantly per capita carbon dioxide emissions (CO2). The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 overviews the related literature and presents our general framework. Section 3 introduces the data used in this study and presents descriptive evidence on emissions and complexity trajectories. Further, we describe the considered countries and introduce our sample split. Section 4 proposes our methodological approach and describes the control variables used in our estimations. Section 5 presents the results of our empirical exercises and studies the robustness of our findings. Section 6 concludes.",
