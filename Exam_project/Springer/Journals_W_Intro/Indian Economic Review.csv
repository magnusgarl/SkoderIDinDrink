53,1,Indian Economic Review,03 January 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41775-018-0032-0,Public–private partnerships vs. traditional contracts for highways,December 2018,Ram Singh,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"During the last 2 decades, many governments across the world have used private funding to develop infrastructure.Footnote 1 India is no exception. The successive governments at the centre have attempted to tap private funding to develop and extend networks of roads, ports, and airports.Footnote 2 Private funding has also become a mainstay of plans of the state governments towards infrastructure development. The private funding is tapped through what are called the public–private partnerships (PPPs or P3). In a typical PPP/P3 for infrastructure, the government provides land and is responsible for regulatory clearances for the project. The private partners take responsibility to build the project assets such as roads. Generally, the private partners are required to fund the project upfront, but the government retains the ownership of the assets developed through PPP. Moreover, the private partners are responsible for the upkeeping of the assets during operation-and-maintenance phase of the project. In other words, the tasks of construction and maintenance are bundled together and assigned to one and the same contractor firm. This also means that the control and management rights over the project assets are assigned to the private partner during the terms of the contract. Many a times the private partners are also granted ‘concessions’ (rights) to charge user-fees. At the end of the contract period, the government reclaims all the rights granted to the contractor. In contrast, under a traditional contract used for infrastructure, the contractor is required only to construct the project facilities; he is not responsible for maintaining it. That is, there is no bundling of the tasks of project construction and its maintenance. The government is responsible for the funding of the project. Maintenance of assets during maintenance is done either by the government or another contractor hired for this specific purpose. In other words, under a traditional contract the government retains all the control and ownership rights over the entire life cycle of the project. Therefore, the PPP contracts are fundamentally different from the traditional (non-PPP) contracts, in terms of the responsibility and rights of the private sector towards financing, building, and maintaining of the infrastructure assets. In this paper, we present a model of project life-cycle. The model is used to make predictions about the outcomes under the different types of contracts. As to the nomenclature, we consider three types of PPPs; namely, Toll-PPPs, Annuity-PPPs and the SPVs. These forms differ mainly in terms of the decision and control rights delegated to the private investors during the contract period. The official case for the use of PPPs depends on their perceived economic superiority over the traditional approach, that is, the belief that the PPPs can deliver public goods at relatively low life-cycle costs. The policymakers seem to believe that private sector participation through the PPPs will ensure a speedier delivery of infrastructure as it will reduce the life-cycle project costs. Moreover, it is believed that the PPPs have the potential to incentivize the private sector to deliver a superior quality infrastructure services. At least officially, these beliefs seem to have been the driving force behind the advent and expansion of the PPP programme. For example, the draft of the National Public Private Partnership Policy (NPPPP) clearly states two of these objectives as: “Harness private sector efficiencies in asset creation, maintenance and service delivery; Provide focus on life-cycle approach for development of a project, involving asset creation and maintenance over its life cycle;...”Footnote 3 As to the economic analysis of PPPs, following Hart et al. (1997) and Hart (2003), a large theoretical literature has come up on the subject. It shows that the partnership contracts have some merits vis-a-vis the traditional contracts. However, some features of PPPs can make the outcome under them worse than the outcome under the traditional contracts. In sum, depending on the context, either type of contract can be more desirable than the other.Footnote 4 Therefore, the following question arises: is the belief in the superiority of the PPPs justified? There seems to be no empirical study to answer this question. In this paper, we address this question and the related issues. In Sect. 2 we develop a model of project costs, quality and benefits. In Sect. 3, we examine the potential sources of efficiency of PPP contracts vis-a-vis the traditional contracts. The focus is on comparison of the incentive structure for the contractor under the PPPs vis-a-vis the traditional procurement contracts. In Sect. 4 we predict costs and quality under different contracts. Our empirical analysis is based on a data set of highways projects in India. The PPPs for national highways projects have been implemented by a single agency, namely the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). In fact, the NHAI accounts for the largest number of PPPs executed by any one agency in the country. So, to compare the comparables, the PPP and the non-PPP road projects implemented by the NHAI are a plausible choice for empirical analysis. We use a data set of 313 national highway projects to compare performance of the PPPs with the traditionally procured highway projects. The comparison is made in terms of the project costs and quality of roads. Besides, we compare performance of the toll-PPPs with the non-toll-PPPs. The 2005 PPP policy is used as an Instrument for the empirical analysis on project costs. Bidding and contracting processes and the 2005 PPP policy are described in Sect. 5. In Sect. 6 we empirically examine the outcomes under PPPs and the traditional contracts, in terms of the construction costs and quality of roads. Section 7 presents concluding remarks on various possible reasons behind the relatively high construction costs for PPPs. It also discusses the existing empirical literature on the subject.",7

Sekhar,Devesh Roy,Yogesh Bhatt,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"Food prices and its underlying factors have important macroeconomic implications for inflation and growth. Food inflation strongly impacts welfare, particularly of the poor. If transmission of food prices into nonfood prices is strong, as it is in many low-income countries, the impact on core inflation can also be substantial (Walsh 2011; Anand et al. 2014). Walsh (2011) finds that food inflation is generally higher and more persistent than nonfood inflation in many countries. In India, food inflation has been continually high over the past several years, particularly after the drought in 2009.Footnote 1 Initially, this was attributed to poor agricultural performance because of drought, as well as inadequate trade policy (Chand 2010; Nair and Eapen 2012; Nair 2013). However, the problem persisted even after improvements in food production, a tightening of grain exports, and liberalization of imports. Most studies on food inflation in India have been based on one or two episodes of inflation. Years of low inflation were not factored into these analyses. The present study attempts to fill this gap through a systematic analysis of food inflation and its determinants over a longer horizon at the disaggregated commodity level. We identify the major contributors to food inflation through a decomposition exercise. We also analyzed the patterns in short-term price volatility. We specifically include the period post 2008 until 2015 to capture the situation post global food price crisis. Employing dynamic panel regression framework we estimate the possible causal effect on food prices. The study is organized as follows. A detailed review of the relevant literature is presented in Sect. 2. Section 3 contains a description of the methodology followed. Results of the study are presented in Sect. 4. Section 5 summarizes the results of the study and its important policy implications.",6
53,1,Indian Economic Review,23 July 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41775-018-0018-y,Debt sustainability of states in India: An assessment,December 2018,Balbir Kaur,Atri Mukherjee,Anand Prakash Ekka,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"In line with an overall decentralizing trend, the sub-national governments worldwide have been entrusted with increasing responsibilities towards delivery of public goods and services, and investment in physical and social infrastructure. As the concomitant expenditure requirements generally fall short of own revenue receipts and inter-governmental transfers from the national authorities, the sub-national governments have to depend on borrowed resources to finance such expenditure. However, the borrowing limits of sub-national governments in various countries are subject to either regulatory restrictions or self-imposed fiscal discipline, given the underlying requirement to ensure debt sustainability at the sub-national level. In India, the state governments have been playing an important role in discharging various functions assigned to them under the Constitution. As the non-debt receipts of states are often not sufficient to provide the requisite financial resources, they resort to borrowings to meet various development needs. It is often said that borrowing per se is not bad provided it is used for productive purposes. While this may be a desirable goal, the actual utilisation of borrowed resources may not necessarily be only for productive purposes due to various reasons. However, the accumulation of debt liabilities, if left uncontrolled, could cause macroeconomic and financial stability issues. The evolution of debt position of state governments in India has seen several phases: a comfortable position prior to 1997–1998 to a phase of sharp deterioration and fiscal stress during 1997–1998 to 2003–2004 and then to a phase of significant improvement since 2004–2005. While the debt liabilities of states increased sharply during 1997–1998 to 2003–2004, the subsequent period has been a phase of consolidation, attributable, among others, to the implementation of fiscal rules through the enactment of Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Acts/Fiscal Responsibility Legislations (FRLs) at the state level in early 2000s. These fiscal consolidation initiatives were complemented by debt and interest relief measures of the central government, and also supported by a favourable macroeconomic environment following the high growth phase and a reversal of the interest rate cycle in the mid-2000s. Majority of the states adhered to the debt targets set for them by the Thirteenth Finance Commission (FC-XIII) for the period 2010–2014, even as some of them breached their respective debt targets and continued to have unsustainable debt positions. In the recent period, the signs of fiscal stress have re-emerged on the back of poor performance of state public sector enterprises. With several states assuming additional debt liabilities as part of financial and operational restructuring of state power distribution companies, there is an inherent risk in terms of debt servicing capacity and soundness of fiscal performance parameters of states. In addition, the adoption of farm loan waivers by different state governments, viz, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Karnataka is likely to further enhance their fiscal burden. It is against the above backdrop that this paper assesses the issue of debt sustainability of states in India. The issue has become all the more relevant after the release of the report of the FRBM Review Committee (Chairperson: N. K. Singh), 2017, which suggests using debt as the primary target for fiscal policy. The debt sustainability analysis carried out in this paper is based on three approaches: indicator-based analysis, estimation of both inter-temporal budget constraint and fiscal policy response function (to deterioration in debt position) at the state level. While the debt sustainability analysis per se is in respect of debt stock or outstanding liabilities of the state governments, this has been extended to highlight the fiscal implications of off-budget items, viz, contingent liabilities of states, guarantees extended by them to state power utilities and finally the take-over of debt liabilities of these utilities by the state governments that have decided to participate in the restructuring scheme implemented by the central government. The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 defines debt sustainability. Section 3 presents a brief overview of various studies that have examined debt sustainability at the state level in the Indian context. An analytical presentation of the theoretical basis underlying fiscal/debt sustainability analysis is provided in Sect. 4. Some stylised facts relating to the evolution of state government debt in India are presented in Sect. 5. Section 6 presents an empirical assessment of debt sustainability at the state level based on different approaches. The rationale for extending the conventional debt sustainability analysis to include off-budget fiscal position of states in the context of additional debt liabilities which have arisen on account of take-over of debt of state power utilities is explained in Sect. 7. The concluding observations are covered in Sect. 8.",12
53,1,Indian Economic Review,16 October 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41775-018-0025-z,"Foreign direct investment, welfare and wage inequality in a small open economy: theory and empirics",December 2018,Sugandha Huria,Manoj Pant,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The literature abounds with studies on various issues related to foreign direct investment (FDI). Amongst all, the forerunner relates to its definition, determinants and existence. Being considered as equivalent to international mobility of capital until 1950s, with the pioneer studies of Hymer (1960), Caves (1971, 1982), Dunning (1973) and others, it was realised that FDI, as distinct from Foreign Portfolio Investment, is rather associated with some firm-specific factor and that an international difference in expected return to capital is not sufficient to induce an investor to undertake direct investment. Of further importance was the question regarding the incorporation of multinational (MN) activities in models of trade theory (Pant and Srivastava 2015). Not surprisingly, gradually with the increase in FDI flows, the subject related to its role in driving economic growth and development also became a contested one. Beginning with Behrman (1960) and MacDougall (1960), etc., up until today, a large number of both theoretical and empirical studies have been undertaken in this regard: while some argue that FDI leads to an increase in productivity and hence positively affects the host economy’s growth and development, the focal point of others rests on its negative impact such as extraction of natural resources and destruction of local capabilities. Apart from this, several other FDI-specific issues have also been dealt with in the past, for example, testing of traditional trade theorems by Batra and Ramachandran (1980) in the presence of MN activities, employment-related effects of FDI by Batra (1986) and others, interlinkage between trade and FDI (like Buckley and Casson 1981), FDI as a channel of knowledge spill over (Crespo and Fontoura 2007, amongst others), etc. More recently, the focus has been on the global rise in skilled–unskilled wage gap or what is commonly referred to as wage inequality. A lot of theoretical reformulations of the standard trade models have been done to reconcile this empirical finding with that of the Hecksher–Ohlin–Samuelson (H–O–S) conclusion.Footnote 1 By and large, the issue has been studied in general equilibrium models of trade without FDI (see, for example, Barua and Pant 2014). However, it is clear from the literature on FDI that incorporation of MN activities in the trade models leads to dramatic changes in standard trade theory results (Batra and Ramachandran 1980). Thus, in this paper, we have tried to set-up a model of trade with FDI to see how this impacts the wage inequality debate. Since MNs are assumed to be carriers of superior technology, that is more complementary to skilled than to unskilled labour, it is generally believed that their activities necessarily worsen wage inequality in the host economies. The concern is even more grounded in the developing countries or the south, the majority of whose GDP depends on the activities of the large unorganised sector that employs unskilled labour intensively. One of the earliest works in this regard was undertaken by Feenstra and Hanson (1995), who modelled FDI as a channel through which fragmentation of production can take place. Their structure was similar to the standard HO model with continuum of goods, except that all activities now occur within a single manufacturing industry. Their results show that outsourcing of basic stages of production through movement of capital from the capital-abundant north to the capital-scarce south increases wage inequality in both these types of countries. This is because, in the latter, the basic stages are relatively skill intensive and hence, the transfer of capital raises the relative demand for skilled labour, and so does its return. More recently, Oladi et al. (2011) also analysed this issue by introducing non-traded goods in a three-sector general equilibrium model. Considering that the foreign capital is specific to the export sector, the results show that the net distributional impact of FDI depends crucially on the intensities with which different factors are employed in different sectors within an economy. A similar kind of conclusion was also reached by Chaudhuri and Yabuuchi (2008). In yet another set of studies, the authors have departed from the perfectly competitive models. Markusen and Venables (1996, 1997), for instance, have related MN activities to wage inequality by developing a firm-based trade model. After characterising the equilibrium regime as a function of characteristics of the two countries and their trade costs, the results of their study suggest that higher FDI leads to a rise in the wage gap in both the skilled and unskilled labour-abundant host countries because these firms are more skill intensive than their national counterparts. Further, assuming a two-stage game, where in the first stage, the MN firms in the differentiated sector choose a quality, and then a competitive price under free entry and exit, Wu (2001) has also developed a small open economy model incorporating the element of vertical direct investment. His observations show that the impact on the wage gap depends on whether the FDI-induced technology transfer from the developed countries is skilled or unskilled labour biased, regardless of which sector receives the FDI. In a similar kind of basic set-up but excluding the product-quality choice, Das (2002) has shown that in the absence of trade, a rise in the number of foreign firms in the skill-intensive sector affects relative wages through three different ways—the direct impact, that widens the wage differential; the technology gap between the domestic and the foreign firms which tend to lower the wage gap and finally, the transfer effect that occurs due to changes in foreign profits to be repatriated to the source economy. Thus, the effect of FDI on the skilled–unskilled wage gap has been relatively under-studied theoretically. Some of the models, however, assert that under certain conditions, FDI could be considered as a reason to explain why the unskilled-abundant developing economies are witnessing higher wage inequality today but none of them focusses on the co-existence of trade and FDI in explaining that link. As regards the empirical literature, on the other hand, there are certain studies that stress on the positive role of FDI in improving the productivity and wage disparity between the skilled and unskilled work forces (Figini and Görg 1999, among others), while the focal point of others rests on its negative impacts through a transfer of skill-biased technology or investment in skilled labour-intensive sector (Taylor and Driffield 2005; Ghosh 2008; Chen et al. 2011; Lee and Wie 2015, among others). These findings are more or less country specific and sector specific, and do not generate any concrete conclusion even on the basis of whether an economy is developing or developed. It, thus, seems necessary to theoretically derive the conditions under which higher FDI distorts wage distribution within an economy, taking into account the fact that FDI is just another form of doing trade. Given that the MNs have access to specific advantages, the literature suggests that one needs to depart from the standard general equilibrium HOS framework to incorporate their behaviour. However, in this paper, we have made an attempt to formulate two different models to analyse the distributional role of higher FDI inflows in the developing economies within the modified HOS framework only, using the Ricardo–Viner Model. The advantage is that this model tackles the specificity of technology or some factor, which is considered to be one of the most important characteristics of an MNC. The assumptions of neo-classical structure and perfect competition have been retained because, in most of the cases, it is the only way in which a general equilibrium analysis can be carried out. In the first model, we assume that FDI occurs through transfer of both specific knowledge and MN capital from the source into the host economy, while in the second, the MNs are assumed to finance most of their capital requirement through local sources available in the host economy. The analysis of the former shows that irrespective of the nature of the technical progress, the impact of FDI on wage disparity in the host economy depends on the sector in which it occurs, while the second shows how factor intensities and their cross-complementarities play a major role in determining the ultimate impact of liberalisation policies, viz. trade and FDI. Thus, we are able to show that domestic factors also play a crucial role in determining the distribution of income within a country, and not just trade or FDI per se. Even more, the second model also highlights why it is important for the developing countries to insist on maximum capital transfers by the MNCs. We also discuss a ‘welfare–wage inequality’ trade-off that a host developing economy faces while allowing for higher inward FDI. Finally, taking the predictions of our models, we subject them to a limited empirical testing using the panel dataset of Indian organised manufacturing industries. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In the next two sections, we develop the two theory models and present results from our analyses. The following Sect. 4 presents results from a quick empirical testing. The conclusion and policy recommendations are given in Sect. 5.",2

53,1,Indian Economic Review,28 August 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41775-018-0021-3,Evidence on the determinants of investment-cash flow sensitivity,December 2018,Vikash Gautam,Rajendra R. Vaidya,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Lack of adequate finance on competitive terms poses a key constraint on firm investment.Footnote 1 It is argued that if a firm is unable to obtain finance at a competitive rate, i.e., if it is financially constrained, then its ability to invest is contingent on its ability to generate internal liquidity. Financially unconstrained firms, in contrast, do not display a systematic propensity to invest out of internal liquidity as the cost of funds, relative to its opportunity cost, is likely to be small for them. In such investigations, internal liquidity is commonly represented by cash flows whereas ‘investment-cash flow sensitivity (ICFS)’ is considered as the metric representing finance constraints.Footnote 2 So, for a sample of firms, after sorting them into groups based on the likelihood of being financially constrained using variables, the group with positive ICFS is considered financially constrained whereas the group with insignificant ICFS is considered financially unconstrained. Although it is intuitively appealing to conclude that a higher ICFS is representative of finance constraints, there are considerable disputes on the empirical evidences. Several issues are noteworthy. First, since cash flows endow managers with more control than external funds, higher ICFS may signal preference of firms for internal funds over the external funds, even though the risk adjusted cost of external funds is close to the cost of internal cash flows (Kaplan and Zingales 1997; Cleary 1999). Second, if positive ICFS firms are to be interpreted as financially constrained and insignificant ICFS firms as financially unconstrained, it is implicitly assumed that ICFS monotonically increases with the severity of finance constraints. Such an assumption may be restrictive and ensue into erroneous inferences. Cleary et al. (2007) and Guariglia (2008) show that investments made by firms exhibit an inverted U-shaped relationship with their borrowing capacity. Third, innovation in cash flows may induce firms to revise their expected profitability. In such a case, cash flows, besides signaling information on internal liquidity, also signal information on growth opportunities of firms even when they are financially unconstrained (Gilchrist and Himmelberg 1995; Hovakimian and Titman 2006). Finally, the ex-ante sorting of firms based on the likelihood of finance constraints is critically dependent on the choice of the sample splitting criterion. This splitting procedure is valid only if the sample splitting scheme unequivocally distinguishes between constrained and unconstrained firms (Kaplan and Zingales 1997; D’Espallier et al. 2008). In the wake of the aforementioned arguments, the paper presents a direct evaluation of the ICFS at firm level, rather than relying on the ad-hoc nature of ex ante classification. We also include in our purview a third group of negative ICFS firms. Such firms, though much less researched than the other two groups, represent financially distressed firms (Allayannis and Mozumdar 2004; Bhagat et al. 2005). It is argued that on start-up, negative ICFS firms have low internal funds and they are mainly financed by external sources. As they mature, their cash flows rise but their debt obligations also get bigger because of the previously taken loans. Therefore, their probability of default in case of an adverse shock is high. In our empirical exercise, we analyze the determinants of firm-level ICFS using an unbalanced panel of 3680 Indian manufacturing firms over the period 1994–2015. Specifically, we investigate distinct firm characteristics associated with negative, insignificant and positive ICFS firms without imposing any ex ante restriction on them. We expect that if the commonly used interpretations with each of the three groups (i.e., financially distressed, unconstrained and constrained, respectively) are justified, then the same must be reflected in the firm characteristics associated with them. The considered period for the Indian manufacturing sector is noteworthy because it witnessed an adverse shift in the domestic investment financing policy. The focus of the policy makers, however, was not to restrict investment but to restrict non-performing assets (Gautam and Vaibhav 2017). Athey and Reeser (2000) also suggest that the policy issues are a major bottleneck in financing investment in India. They focus mainly on the targeted credit program of the government that adversely affected investments of those firms that are excluded from the program. The presence of finance constraints in Indian firms is also widely established in some of the recent works (Athey and Laumas 1994; Ganesh-Kumar et al. 2001; Lensink et al. 2003; Bhaduri 2005, 2008; Gautam and Vaidya 2013). To the best of our knowledge, D’Espallier et al. (2008) and Hovakimian (2009) are the only other works that have attempted to evaluate firm-level ICFS as the measure of finance constraints. D’Espallier et al. (2008) construct firm-specific ICFS metric using generalized maximum-entropy method to avoid ex-ante sample sorting criteria. Essentially, the estimation problem is transformed into a constrained maximization problem, where the objective function consists of the entropy-information criterion. Maximizing the entropy amounts to choosing a probability vector for each parameter that is consistent with the available data and the relevant constraints. Although the choice of generalized maximum-entropy method is decorous in principle, it would give unbiased results only when the signal to noise ratio is very small (Adkins 1997). Given that D’Espallier et al. (2008) largely ignore the concern that cash flows apart from capturing information on financials also capture information on the growth opportunities of the firms, one needs to be cautious while interpreting their results. Hovakimian (2009), in an alternative arrangement, regresses investment on all relevant variables except the cash flows and uses the error term to construct firm-level estimates of ICFS. She, thereby, implicitly assumes that the information contained in the error term is mainly because of the cash flows. This is a restrictive assumption if the dataset lacks information on some of the variables which are important for investment decisions. In fact, we show that nearly 14% of observations cannot be inferred as reasonable using the method as suggested by Hovakimian (2009). The empirical strategy in this paper allows to construct firm-level ICFS estimates from the investment regression itself by allowing cash flow to have variable slope across firms. We show that the variable slope method finds a better support from the data. We use clusters of firm-level ICFS scores to construct negative, insignificant and positive ICFS groups. ICFS across these groups reveals a non-monotonic relationship with the variables perceived to be correlated with finance constraints. We also show that our dataset does not yield three groups—negative, insignificant and positive ICFS firms, which can be unambiguously interpreted as distressed, financially unconstrained and constrained, respectively, based on firm characteristics. These results hold for both unlisted and listed firms. The approach in this paper has a wide scope for application in both developed and developing country contexts, especially when data on some on some of the control variables is not available or/and when a fraction of firms is not listed in the stock exchange. It serves as a pragmatic wedge to elucidate the importance of ICFS in representing finance constraints. It can easily be made the vehicle for further endeavours. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the sample and the variables. Section 3 outlines the methods for measuring firm-level ICFS. Section 4 presents the characteristics of firms into negative, insignificant and positive ICFS groups followed by a discussion of the determinants of ICFS in Sect. 5. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes.",2

However, many empirical works show that wage income inequality has increased in different countries. This rising income inequality is experienced in US during 1960s and 1970sFootnote 2 and in European countries between 1978 and 1988.Footnote 3 Similar trends are also found in many Latin American and South Asian countries in the mid 1980s.Footnote 4 However, the experience of East Asian countries during1960s and 1970s advocates the conventional theory that a greater openness to international trade tends to reduce the skilled-unskilled wage gap.Footnote 5 Various studies provide various explanations for this growing wage inequality. Trade liberalization and technological progress are the main two controversial reasons of this phenomenon.Footnote 6 Many empirical studies suggest alternative causes; and these include international outsourcing,Footnote 7 increase in the price of skill intensive product,Footnote 8 entry of overpopulated low income countries in the international marketFootnote 9 etc. A theoretical literature analyses the problem of growing wage inequality and trade liberalization; and a part of this literature is based on the framework of static competitive general equilibrium models.Footnote 10 These models consider two different types of labour-skilled and unskilled; and take the ratio of the skilled wage rate to the unskilled wage rate as a measure of wage inequality. The existing theoretical literature can be divided into two groups. Some models assume exogenous supply of skilled labour; and they include works of Gupta and Dutta (2010a, 2011), Chaudhuri (2004, 2008), Yabuuchi and Chadhuri (2007), Chaudhuri and Yabuuchi (2007, 2008), Beladi et al. (2008), Marjit and Acharyya (2003, 2006), Marjit and Kar (2005) and Marjit et al. (2004) etc. Hence, these models can not analyze the role of endogenous skill formation on the skilled-unskilled wage inequality. Other models introduce endogenous formation of skilled labour in static competitive general equilibrium models; and they include works of Beladi et al. (2011a, b), Gupta and Dutta (2010b), Yabuuchi and Chaudhuri (2009), Kar and Beladi (2004) and Marjit and Acharyya (2003) etc. Endogenous formation of skilled labour means the transformation of unskilled labour into skilled labour; and, in the above mentioned static models, this structural transformation takes place instantaneously. However, Skill formation takes place over time; and none of the existing static sectoral models on skilled unskilled wage inequality focuses on the dynamics of skill formation. There exist substantial theoretical works analyzing the role of human capital accumulation on endogenous economic growth. However, almost every model available in the literature is built on a one sector aggregative framework with one final good production sector and with one human capital accumulation sector. Human capital or skilled labour is assumed to be an essential input in such a model. However, an aggregative model fails to capture the intersectoral interdependence as well as structural and technological dualism prevalent in a less developed economy. In a less developed economy, the backward agricultural sector occupies an important place in terms of its contribution to national income as well as to national employment; and this agricultural sector is mainly dependent on unskilled labour. An aggregative model, makes itself applicable only in the case of a mature industrial economy. Economic development of a less developed economy involves a relative expansion of the industrial sector caused by a process of transformation of unskilled labour into skilled labour along with the accumulation of capital stock. In order to highlight these features, we need a sectoral model with the coexistence of a backward agricultural sector dependent on the unskilled labour and an advanced industrial sector as well as an education sector based on skilled labour. The transformation of unskilled labour into skilled labour through the expansion of the education sector and the capital accumulation through investment should act as two engines of economic development. In the old dual economy models,Footnote 11 the focus was concentrated only on the investment of industrial surplus but the role of skill accumulation was totally ignored. There exists a very recent literature on structural transformation in a dual economy dealing with how structural transformation takes place as well as how it affects aggregate productivity. These dual economy models are called new dual economy models. Works of Rogerson (2008), Duarte and Restuccia (2010), Liu and Yang (2015) develop static three sector models consisting of an agricultural sector, an industrial sector and a service sector. However, they do not distinguish between skilled labour and unskilled labour and ignore the role of education sector as well as of physical capital accumulation. Works of Caselli and Coleman (2001), Lucas (2004) and Wingender (2015) provide two sector models in which human capital (skilled labour) is the main driver of structural transformation. Either skilled labour is specific to the non-agricultural sector or the agricultural sector is less skilled labour intensive than the non-agricultural sector; and the use of skilled labour is always productivity-enhancing in these models. However, these models are also static in nature; and hence fail to analyse the dynamics of skill accumulation through development of education sector as well as the dynamics of capital accumulation through savings and investment. In this paper, we develop a dynamic sectoral model with a backward agricultural sector dependent on unskilled labour and with an advanced industrial sector dependent on capital and skilled labour. We also introduce an education sector whose role is to transform an unskilled labourer into a skilled one. This transformation is not automatic and the rate of transformation depends on the allocation of capital and skilled labour to this sector. The mechanism of capital accumulation through investment of savings is borrowed from Growth theory. We do not follow classical dual economy modelsFootnote 12 to assume fixed wage and surplus labour in the unskilled labour market but follow neo-classical traditionFootnote 13 to assume factor price flexibility and full employment equilibrium. We do not follow Lucas (1988) and his extensions to define human capital accumulation as a household activity but consider transformation of unskilled labour into skilled labour through expansion of the privately run competitive education sector. Using a Ramsey framework of consumption saving allocation, we analyse how the economy grows over time through accumulation of capital and through transformation of unskilled labour into skilled labour. Such a modelat least partially helps us to analyse how the structural shift from agriculture to industry takes place and what role do sector specific polices play in this context. This is so because, in this model, these two sectors are dependent on these two different types of labour and sector specific policies affect their relative supply. However, we only emphasize on the supply side constraints of skill accumulation and ignore the problems related to workers’ demand for skill. We develop a dynamic three sector model but first introduce a short-run competitive equilibrium analysis of resource allocation with given amounts of capital, skilled labour and unskilled labour. We then enter into the dynamic analysis introducing the intertemporal accumulation of skilled labour and of physical capital. We analyse the short-run as well as long run effects of sector specific policies on the degree of wage income inequality as well as on the endogenous rate of economic growth; and find that sector specific policies produce opposite effects. Subsidization to agricultural sector leads to an improvement in the degree of wage income inequality but lowers the rate of economic growth in the long run. On the other hand, subsidization or protection to the manufacturing sector produces just the opposite effect. So, in our model, high growth and improvement in wage income distribution do not go hand by hand. There exists a recent literature on income distribution and economic growth advocating the hypothesis that economic inequality produces a negative effect on economic growth.Footnote 14 Results of our model do not make it to belong to that group. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we describe the short run equilibrium of the small open economy model and its working; and analyse various comparative static effects on the skilled-unskilled relative wage. In Sect. 3, we make a dynamic analysis with accumulation of capital and transformation of unskilled labour into skilled ones; and then analyse properties of the balanced growth path and the comparative steady state effects of development policies on skill accumulation and endogenous growth. Concluding remarks are made in Sect. 4.",

An analysis under an input–output framework,December 2018,Tulika Bhattacharya,Meenakshi Rajeev,Indrajit Bairagya,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"For a modern, liberalized economy, productivity growth is essential for retaining competitiveness of its various sectors and thereby ensuring overall growth. In the context of productivity growth, the total-factor productivity growth (TFPG) (also known as the Solow residual) refers to the growth in real output that is not influenced by growth in factor inputs of labour and capital, and is, thus, associated with a shift in technology (Solow 1957). Several authors have utilized this concept to measure TFPG (see Groth et al. 2004; Raa 2010; Baumol and Wolff 1984; Wolff 1985). There are also other methods of measuring productivity and then computing their growth rates. Notable examples amongst them include: (a) The index number approach (McLellan, 2004); (b) stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) (Kathuria et al. 2013b, 2014) and (c) data envelopment analysis (Deb and Ray 2014; Sehgal and Sharma 2011). It is, however, noteworthy that several authors, while using these methods, consider only value-added inputs for measuring productivity. Many, while using the DEA or SFA approaches, do not arrive at technological progress through a residual method. In this area, an important contribution is by Goldar et al. (2017) who use KLEMS approach by considering explicitly the role of capital, labour, energy, material and service related inputs. In this paper, we utilize the input–output technique for two reasons. First, to isolate the contributions of not only value-added inputs for productivity calculations but also intermediate inputs by the methodology adopted by Miller and Blair (2009). Such an approach helps us to understand the true contribution of technological improvements in the production process. Further, we have decomposed the value-added coefficients into labour (lj) and capital (kj) coefficients and then calculated TFPG across sectors, which is an important contribution. Secondly, using the same input–output data, we can also compute output linkage coefficients of different sectors of the economy and compare them with the productivity measures of various sectors. Sectors with high output linkages are ones that help output growth of other sectors by demanding them as inputs (backward linkage effect). Further, by supplying their output to other sectors as inputs, these high-linked sectors accelerate output growth of these input demanding sectors (forward linkage). Moreover, when one incorporates employment figures in the I–O table, it is possible to arrive at employment linkages (see also Bhattacharya and Rajeev 2014 and Bhattacharya 2016), and also examine whether the sectors with high employment linkages, i.e., that can generate employment in other sectors through forward and backward linkages, are productive or not. This exercise, we believe, has important policy relevance. For any economy, it is beneficial to have high growth of the high-linked sectors as that would automatically boost several other interlinked sectors. However, growth of a high-linked sector in a competitive world demands productivity growth as well, to compete with other producers across the globe. Hence, a lack of productivity growth of a high-linked sector calls for the attention of policy-makers. While there is a body of research that is devoted to productivity measurement, there is limited literature that combines productivity and linkage issues through a unified I–O framework. In that regard, this paper makes a contribution to the literature in this area. Further, productivity and linkage measurements over a period of time, consisting of both pre- and post-liberalization era data, also reveal changes that have taken place at the sectoral level. Needless to state that these findings are also of importance to policy-makers. In this backdrop, the current paper unfolds as follows. The next section presents a review of literature, focused on the measurement of productivity growth of different sectors for the Indian economy. We also discuss a few papers that examine linkage effects using I–O matrices for India. Section 3 presents methodological details regarding the measurement of TFPG using the I–O framework. In Sect. 4, TFPG growth, over time, of each sector is presented, using I–O tables for the years 1989–90, 1993–94, 1998–99, 2003–04 and 2007–08 (CSO 1997, 2000, 2005, 2008, 2012), both at the aggregate and disaggregate levels. An interpretation of these results including a comparison of linkage coefficients (both output and employment linkages) and TFPG is also discussed in this section, followed by concluding views at the end, in Sect. 5.",1

Bokhtiar Hasan,SM Nahidul Islam,Abu N. M. Wahid,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Male,"Human life is full of uncertainties and risks. Every risk is followed by cost. Cost of risks may be minimized by managing them separately and individually. Sometimes risks cannot be managed properly due to lack of knowledge and experience. In this regard, insurance has extended its hand to manage such risks effectively and efficiently. Insurance is basically a co-operative device to distribute loss over a number of users. If any person under this device suffers loss caused by a certain risk, the rest of the group are agreed to share the loss through payment of premiums. At present, the contributions of insurance industry are not confined to individuals and families. It also covers businesses as well by providing mechanisms for risk management, pooling resources and subdividing shares, transferring resources across time and space, giving information, dealing with incentive problems, extending protection, improving economic efficiency and ensuring economic progress (Merton and Bodie 1995). Delivering these services, insurance industry affects investment, savings and costs of intermediation and thereby, contributes to economic growth (Outreville 2013). Even though the history of insurance sector in Bangladesh is very long, it is not yet matured enough. Its contribution to DSE market capitalization is only 2.64% (as of 30 September 2017). Compared to that of developed countries, Bangladesh insurance sector employs a small number of labor forces of the country. Moreover, the financial performance of the insurance companies in Bangladesh is not up to the mark. This very phenomenon can be analyzed at both micro and macroeconomic levels, which can be determined by internal and external factors, respectively. Internal factors are represented by firms’ specific characteristics (i.e., age of the company, size of the company, return on asset, return on equity, earnings per share, liquidity ratio, debt ratio, management competence index, etc.) while external factors are represented macroeconomic environment of a country (i.e., GDP growth rate, inflation rate, interest rate, exchange rate, etc.). Although a number of studies have already been done on the financial sector of Bangladesh, among those, a few were on insurance sector. Most of the studies carried out on insurance were about finding determinants of firms’ profitability, measuring firms’ financial performance and so on. However, it seems from the literature review that a very few or none has addressed the impact of macroeconomic variables on the insurance companies’ performance in Bangladesh. The factors (especially macroeconomic factors) that may affect the financial performance of insurance companies are supposed to be identified, because this information will be very useful to investors, researchers, financial analysts, and regulators as well (Burca and Batrînca 2014). In fact, we have been inspired on this ground to conduct this research. We believe that this study would contribute to the existing literature. Nonetheless, 32 non-life insurance companies that are listed on DSE are taken as a sample for this study. The sample period of this study covers 2009–2015 forming a panel of 224 observations. The rest of the paper is, therefore, organized as follows. Section 2 describes the history of insurance in Bangladesh. Section 3 discusses the previous literature relevant to our topic. Section 4 explains the data and methodology used in the study. Section 5 presents the results of the analysis of this study, and finally Sect. 6 concludes the study with some policy recommendations.",7

54,1,Indian Economic Review,10 May 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41775-019-00047-4,Investigating the composition of product-level specialization,June 2019,Purba Mukerji,Arvind Panagariya,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The study of intra-industry trade is important because it has fundamental implications for what drives trade. The existence of overlapping trade where countries buy and sell the same product implies that factor endowment differences need not necessarily drive all trade. In the present day, intra-industry trade implies direct competition among countries. And this is an important consideration in evaluating the implications of global integration of an increasing number of economies. Attempts to quantify intra-industry trade have yielded consistently high and growing estimates of overlapping trade among countries (Helpman 1999). Certain sectors and certain groups of countries show a higher propensity for overlaps in trade. Larger countries with similar sizes, levels of development and high incomes are the most fertile ground for intra-industry trade. The existing measures of intra-industry trade are based on the index developed by Grubel and Lloyd in (1975). This index is constructed by dividing the sum of overlapping trade in each industry by the total trade and gives a summary statistic of the extent of the overlap. By definition, this index gives a larger estimate as the aggregation of the data increases. This raises an important issue of whether intra-industry trade is really only a matter of not having sufficiently disaggregated data. With the availability of detailed trade data at the product-level detailed, the literature has grown to incorporate careful studies of trade composition (e.g., Schott (2002, 2004), Kehoe and Ruhl 2013), Mukerji (2009, 2013, 2019)). A pioneering example of this is when using product-level US trade data Schott (2004) finds a systematic positive relation between the unit value of the same product imported by the US and the income (or skill intensity) of the source country. He concludes that this fits an endowment-based trade pattern within each product rather than the intra-industry trade. According to him, while countries would seem to be selling the same product despite having vastly different endowments, closer inspection through his analysis had revealed that these countries were in fact specializing within the product and selling the costlier or cheaper version of the product based on their endowment. In this paper, we take this line of research further in two ways. First, we develop a new measure of intra-industry trade. Figure 1 gives a useful classification of product-level trade and presents the difference between the traditional measure of intra-industry trade and the new measure we propose in this paper. Our measure is specifically designed to utilize the new information that detailed trade data provide. Specifically, it creates a test of the significance of the proximity of unit values of exports and imports. Only when the trade of a country passes this test, it is considered intra-industry trade. Thus, this measure bases the criteria of qualifying as intra-industry on actual product characteristics and not on how products might happen to be categorized, as was the case in earlier measures such as the Grubel and Lloyd (1971) index. Our index attempts to capture the true substitutability of the products in question in as much as prices embody this property and, therefore, achieve a more robust measurement of intra-industry trade. An interesting feature of this measure is that while traditionally higher levels of aggregation of product classification necessarily lead to more intra-industry trade being recorded, this is not the case in the present instance. This is because at a higher level of aggregation the dispersion of unit values is likely to be higher as well and the direction of change in the proximity of average unit values of exports and imports is not obvious. Classifying trade in products Second, we use our newly developed measure to investigate direct evidence of intra-industry trade in the US trade data. Schott’s finding that richer (and more skill intensive) countries sell at the higher end of the unit value spectrum of the same product automatically, raises the question whether individual countries export and import within the same range of the spectrum of unit values. This will mean higher intra-industry trade as measured by our index. The availability of detailed export and import data for the US helps to operationalize our index to investigate this question. In this paper, we examine both export and import data of the United States disaggregated down to HTS 10-digit products from 1989 to 2001. This examination leads to a clear picture of within- versus across-product specialization. For example, we find that less than 30% (27.5% in 2001) of all products the United States trades are subject to movements in both directions meaning they are exported as well as imported (Table 1, last rowFootnote 1). As many as two-thirds of the products the United States imports do not appear in its export basket. That is to say, the United States does not export a single variety of two-thirds of the products it imports. In a similar vein, the United States does not import one-third of the products it exports: No country exports to the United States a single variety of one-thirds of the latter’s export products. These results suggest a strong tendency towards across-product specialization. Skeptics may argue, however, that the vast majority of trade may still be concentrated within products that are traded in both directions. To address this concern, we calculate the standard Grubel–Lloyd index of intra-industry trade. We find that at HTS 10-digit level of classification, the value of this index fluctuates around 21% between 1989 and 2001. Interestingly, this result is even more stark when we apply the new index (detailed formula presented in Sect. 6 and results are in Table 6). In that case, we find that intra-industry trade is only 14% of total trade during the same time period and using the same product classification. Thus, while 21% of trade appears to be intra-industry under the traditional measure, when instead we use the substitutability of exports and imports of a given product as the criteria, we find that only 14% qualifies as intra-industry trade. Thus, a disproportionately large volume of the United States trade exhibits across-product specialization. Applying the new intra-industry trade index allows us to address another closely related question that has occupied many trade economists: To what extent is the observed intra-industry trade the result of two-way trade in quality-differentiated varieties (vertical differentiation) and to what extent does it represent trade in attributes-differentiated varieties (horizontal differentiation)? Falvey (1981) offers an excellent theoretical analysis of how two-way trade in quality-differentiated varieties may arise within a factor-endowments model while Krugman (1979, 1980) and Helpman (1981) have provided the pioneering analyses of two-way trade in attributes-differentiated products.Footnote 2 A superficial reading of Schott (2004) may lead one to conclude that a disproportionately large part of within-product trade is in quality-differentiated varieties: since his findings indicate that countries specialize in varieties of different qualities (as measured by unit values) according to their per capita incomes and factor endowments. But a more careful consideration raises doubts about this inference along two separate lines. First, a very large proportion of the world trade is among rich countries. Based on Schott’s findings that per capita income and factor endowments determine product quality of exports, these countries are likely to export product of more or less similar quality to one another. Second, countries may specialize in and export varieties of different qualities of a product. This is where by bringing in export data we are able to consider the possibility that a country may produce and export different qualities of a product. Such a possibility is particularly relevant to the United States as an exporter. Given its skewed income distribution, diverse resource base, and large size, the home-demand bias models would predict that the United States would specialize in and export varieties of diverse qualities. This suggests further role for within-product trade in attributes- over quality-differentiated varieties. An examination of unit values of varieties of 15 randomly selected 10-digit export products (Table 3) of the United Sates confirms this conjecture: The ratio of the highest to lowest unit value within the same 10-digit product varies from 5.4 to 208.6 across these products. Therefore, the United States exports varieties of diverse qualities of the same product. These varieties can mirror some of the import varieties of the same product thereby giving rise to attributes-differentiated two-way trade. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we begin with broad trends and conclusions from US two-way trade data. In Sects. 3–5, we use the unit value and volume of trade data for the United States export and import to systematically make the point that across-product specialization remains pervasive in the data. In Sect. 6, we introduce the new measure of intra-industry trade. In Sect. 7, we conclude.",1

Subsequently, it was used to assess the relevance of the law of one price, the theory of purchasing power parity, the appreciation and depreciation effects on inflation, etc. (Goldberg and Knetter 1997; Feenstra and Kendalld 1997; Isard 1997). Pioneer research was directed at a microeconomic approach, while later research put the macroeconomic approach in focus. Microeconomic factors include industrial organizational models, substitution between import and domestic products, determination of pricing strategy of monopolistic companies at the industrial and product level (Mankiw 1985; Dornbusch 1987; Krugman 1987; Goldberg and Knetter 1997; Obstfeld and Rogoff 2000; Bitâns 2004; Beirne and Bijsterbosch 2011; Kurtović et al. 2018), while macroeconomic factors include exchange rate variability, inflation, market openness, monopolistic competition, etc. (Menon 1995; Taylor 2000; Bacchetta and van Wincoop 2003; Devereux et al. 2004; Bitâns 2004; Choudhri and Hakura 2006; María-Dolores 2010; Kurtović et al. 2018). The degree of ERPT depends on economic shocks, nominal exchange rate volatility, the importing country’s shifts in demand, market structure, economic openness, market segmentation and aggregate imports (Kurtović et al. 2018).The import price ERPT elasticity ranges from 0 to 100%, depending on the exporters’ pricing strategy (Brun-Aguerre et al. 2012). Margin adjustment will depend on the market share of domestic producers in relation to foreign producers, the type of competition and level of discrimination in a given industry. Hence, if there is a higher share in the overall industrial supply, a higher level of price discrimination and a higher share of imported goods in the importing country’s production, the ERPT into import prices will be higher. Additionally, the ERPT will be higher if exporters prevail over domestic competitors. On the other hand, it will be lower if exporters struggle to have a share on the market and normal if there are significant currency oscillations (Campa and Goldberg 2005; Alvarez et al. 2014). Exporters are given an opportunity to absorb currency oscillations so as to avoid modifying the prices designated in the currency of the importing country. When ERPT is complete (PCP—producer-currency pricing), exporters do not have to adjust the margin as a reaction to exchange rate variations. When ERPT is incomplete, exporters may change the prices denominated in the currency of the importing country (LPC—local currency pricing) and adjust the margin with a view to amortise exchange rate variations. The main purpose of this paper was to evaluate the degree, depreciation and asymmetry of ERPT on aggregate import prices in nine countries in transition of Central and Southeast Europe. The methodology used to assess the degree of ERPT on import prices was based on the single equation and cointegration approach (the ARDL model) and the error correction term EC(− 1). The econometric techniques we used have enabled us to measure the effects of ERPT on aggregate import prices in the short and long run. The majority of existing research has used Johansen’s cointegration techniques and the vector autoregressive model (VAR) (Kurtović et al. 2018). There is a limitation to our research as it was impossible for us to evaluate the degree of ERPT on industrial sectors due to a lack of data for the majority of countries in our sample. Furthermore, we could not calculate the effect of certain micro and macro factors affecting the degree ERPT countries analyzed due to lack. The paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 provides an overview of references; Sect. 3 explains some stylized facts; Sect. 4 presents the model, econometric techniques and data bases used; Sect. 5 presents our research results; Sect. 6 lists the conclusions of our research.",
54,1,Indian Economic Review,07 February 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41775-019-00038-5,Financial liberalization and channels of growth: a comparative study of developed and emerging economies,June 2019,Archi Bhatia,Hans Raj Sharma,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Smith (1776), Ricardo (1821), Heckscher (1919), Ohlin (1967), Samuelson (1948) and Krugman (1979, 1993) are amongst the most prominent trade theorists who advocated the benefits of free trade. The world witnessed a gradual shift towards liberalization, both unilaterally and multilaterally, posts the Second World-war, following the writings of trade economist. Efforts of multilateral agencies like WTO and significant reduction in transportation and communication cost with advances in technology like internet access are fostering the ongoing process of liberalization. Nevertheless, the significant integration of the world economy has been in the area of only commodity trade and, to some extent, in the sphere of asset trade. Further, while the benefits of commodity trade have been established beyond doubt, the same cannot be asserted about the international trade in assets more so with respect to financial integration of poor countries. The work of Domer (1946) and Solow (1956) provided an impetus to international financial integration of LDCs by predicting a flow of capital from capital abundant to capital scarce countries in lieu of higher expected returns. It is, however, the seminal works of Mckinnon (1973) and Shaw (1973) which drew the attention of the academician to the ill effects of financial repression—the practice of controlling financial markets by fixing interest rates below market levels and controlling the allocation of credit. Financial repression causes negative and unstable return on savings, low saving rate, inadequate financial deepening, unsustainable budgetary deficits, inflation, overvalued exchange rate and financial crises. A solution to this state, as advocated by Mckinnon and Shaw, can be achieved through financial liberalization. In this context, financial liberalization is viewed as a set of operational reforms and policy measures designed to deregulate and transform the financial system and its structure with a view to achieve a liberalized market oriented system within an appropriate regulatory framework, and thus encompasses measures like lifting capital controls, allowing foreign investors to invest in domestic equity and deregulating banking sector. Degree of financial liberalization can be assessed by studying the following three areas (a) capital account liberalization (b) equity market liberalization (c) banking sector liberalization (Johnston and Sundararajan 1999). In spite of the purported benefits of financial liberalization for the rich and poor countries, financial liberalization has remained as one of the most controversial and least understood policies given the lack of clarity both at the theoretical and empirical levels. Theoretical models delineate several mechanisms through which financial liberalization raises output. These mechanisms are (a) improvement in stock market liquidity and the resultant fall in the cost of equity capital. Bekaert and Harvey (2000); Levine (2001) find evidence in support of this; (b) Enhanced performance of domestic banking sector through entry of foreign banks (Levine (2001); Klein and Olivei (2005)); (c) International portfolio diversification which diversifies risk and reduces costs (Obstfeld (1994)); (d) Improvement in TFP (Total Factor Productivity) through adoption of new methods of production, organization and training of personnel (Borensztein and Lee (1998); Grossman and Helpman (1991); Haskell et al. (2007); Javorcik (2004); Atiken and Harrison (1999)); (e) Enhancement in quality of institutions, property rights and government’s commitment to good policies (Bartolini and Drazen (1997); Gourinchas and Jeanne (2006); Quinn (2000)). The theoretical models are supported by a large number of empirical studies which find a strong positive effect of capital account liberalization on growth in real PCGDP (Quinn (1997); Klein and Olivei (2005); Edwards (2001); Arteta et al. (2001); Henry (2000); Raza and Mohsin (2011)). Few studies have analyzed the growth effect of equity liberalization also. Bekaert and  Harvey (2000); Bekaert et al. (2005, 2011) find equity liberalization to be associated with higher investment–GDP ratio, higher credit ratings and higher real PCGDP growth. Bonfiglioli and Mendicino (2004) have shown that the equity liberalization effect becomes significant after controlling for banking crisis. The counter argument that financial liberalization may trigger financial instability, causes misallocation of capital, be harmful in the presence of distortions is also given by ample number of studies (Rodrik 1998); Brecher and Calos (1977), Stiglitz (2000) and Boot (2000)). Similarly, a number of studies demonstrate that liberalization reduces profit margins of banks, decrease their franchise value, stimulate risk taking and triggers bank runs (Hellmann et al. (Hellmann et al. 1996, 2000; Hellmann and Murdock 1997); Demirguc Kunt and Detragiache (1998); Diamond and Dybving (1983)). Basu and Srinivasan (2002) assert that financial integration disproportionately benefit large businesses and large economies, bypassing small economies. Using IMF Areaer measure or other comparable measure, a number of empirical studies showed liberalization to have insignificant or weak growth effect (Grilli and Milesi-Ferretti (1995); Kraay (1998); Arteta et al. (2001); Bumann et al. (2002); Edison et al. (2002). Vlachos and Waldenstrom (2002) found liberalization to have no effect on value added at the industry level. Kose et al. (2007) showed that liberalization does not increase risk sharing in developing or emerging economies. In the literature, growth is said to be governed by an increase in human and physical capital and an increase in total factor productivity. It is, hence, imperative to analyze the issue of how liberalization is affecting economic activity in the two set of countries that is, developed and emerging after establishing the fact that liberalization affects economic activity. However, studies in this respect have been limited to very few and suffer from important limitations. Bonfiglioli (2008) and Bekaert et al. (2011) showed that TFP growth effect to be greater than capital accumulation effect with both capital account liberalization and equity market liberalization. Kose et al. (2008) arrived at the same conclusion with de jure measures of capital account liberalization. As is evident, the conclusions from the theoretical and empirical studies on finance–growth nexus cannot be generalized. Besides, the past literature suffers from serious methodological flaws as the studies have not covered banking sector liberalization; have clubbed diverse country groups like developed and emerging, or emerging and developing together and have mostly used IMF Areaer measure to capture capital account liberalization. The Areaer measure is a binary measure and does not differentiate between more binding and harsh capital controls and less strict ones. More importantly, this measure suffered a structural break in 1997 due to change in methodology from four categories into thirteen categories. Bekaert et al. (2005) in their greatly cited work conclude that the relationship between IMF crude measure and growth is fragile. Hence, studies which use IMF Areaer measure are likely to find no association between liberalization and growth. O’Donnel (2001) concludes that rule-based measures are too coarse indicators of capital account liberalization. The issue of the channels through which financial liberalization affects growth has been scantily covered by only few studies in a combined country set of developed and emerging. Against this background, we have undertaken the present study to analyze (1) whether the relationship between financial liberalization and economic activity is diverse for developed and emerging economies by splitting the sample into two country groups (2) whether financial liberalization affects economic activity via capital accumulation channel (in which case the growth effects of liberalization will be temporary in nature and vanish as capital stock depreciates) or TFP improvement channel (in which case liberalization will have permanent growth effects), in our two set of countries. To seek answers to these issues, we tested the following hypotheses (1) the null hypotheses of no impact of financial liberalization on economic activity, (2) the null of no impact of financial liberalization on the two channels of growth, namely, capital accumulation and TFP improvement. A robust and scientific methodology is used to examine the two hypotheses by (1) defining financial liberalization in its entirety, and hence including measures of capital account liberalization, equity market liberalization and banking sector liberalization, (2) replacing the IMF measure with a kaopen index as it accounts for the intensity of capital controls, besides incorporating two de facto capital liberalization measures, one equity dummy and one banking dummy, (3) testing for permanent level effects of liberalization in the light of Henry (2007) criticism of the past studies, using panel data modeling technique to overcome the problem of omitted variable bias and estimating our results after controlling for serial correlation, contemporaneous correlation and group-wise heteroskedasticity, (4) addressing the issue of endogeneity using instruments in a two-step GMM model approach of Blundell and Bond (1998). The GMM model controls for the fact that IFI–growth relation runs both ways, and (5) using new array of instruments, namely, average level of financial liberalization in the neighboring countries, which approximates liberalization more closely, following Zhen (2012).Footnote 1 The remainder of the paper is organized into five sections. Section 2 elaborates on the data set including the variables, their definitions and sources and the country samples. Section 3 explains the econometric methodology which is followed to analyze the results. Section 4 discusses the empirical results and Sect. 5 presents the conclusion and policy implications.",

54,1,Indian Economic Review,18 March 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41775-019-00041-w,Operational externalities and counter-terrorism,June 2019,Aditya Bhan,Tarun Kabiraj,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Arce and Sandler (2005) define terrorism as the ‘premeditated use or threat of use of violence by individuals or sub-national groups to obtain political, religious, or ideological objectives through intimidation of a large audience usually beyond that of the immediate victims’. Because terrorists simulate randomness to generate fear and widespread panic, it is usually a daunting challenge for the targeted country’s government to design a strategy that optimally utilizes its counter-terrorism (CT) resources. Achieving this involves assessing the threat that various terror outfits pose in terms of their resources and inclination for conducting attacks.Footnote 1 Moreover, as shall be demonstrated, the importance of understanding the magnitude and nature of operational externalities generated by terror activities in framing the appropriate CT response cannot be overstated. Consider a situation in which a terror outfit uses a particular route to transport terrorists and materials into a conflict zone. If another outfit begins to use the same route for infiltration and/or exfiltration, the chances of the route being discovered by the security forces may increase, resulting in negative operational externalities between the outfits through the resulting increase in the expected cost of operations. There are numerous other such factors which can give rise to negative operational externalities when more than one outfit is active in the same theatre of operations. Some examples are discussed below. In June 2014, for instance, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)Footnote 2 conducted a rapid invasion of large parts of northern Iraq including Mosul. The media attention afforded to al-Qaeda declined ever since, while the focus on ISIS rose. This made recruitment more difficult and therefore more costly, for al-Qaeda. Al-Qaeda responded by escalating its rivalry with ISIS. Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) affiliates like Ansar Dine stepped up attacks, joining a series of efforts to regain support from the more popular ISIS.Footnote 3 The predominantly Shiite outfit Hezbollah has, for decades, been one of the most intimate allies of the Gaza-based Palestinian Sunni group Hamas. However, their ties have suffered following the rebellion which began in March 2011 against the Syrian regime headed by President Bashar al-Assad, an Alawite Shia. The resultant overwhelmingly Sunni insurgency was supported by Hamas, while Hezbollah became deeply committed in fighting alongside Assad’s forces (Karam 2014). Since then, the total number of attacks conducted by these outfits more than doubled from a combined 34 in 2011 and 2012, to a combined 88 in 2013 and 2014.Footnote 4 Consider, conversely, the presence of a sleeper cell of a terror outfit in a city. Left to itself, the cell may be unable to conduct successful attacks given the level of security preparedness. However, if another terror outfit enters the fray and conducts attacks—successful or otherwise—the terror cell may be activated to conduct attacks of its own in the resultant conducive environment of confusion. This provides a characterization of positive operational externalities between terror outfits. There are many other circumstances in which a group can benefit due to the presence of another in the same region. Scrutinize, for instance, the relationship between Boko Haram and its 2012 offshoot Ansaru, and AQIM. When Boko Haram initially metamorphosed into a jihadist outfit post 2009, its affiliation with AQIM and the core of al-Qaeda was largely dismissed as rhetoric by observers and analysts. The notion that inexperienced domestic insurgents from northeast Nigeria would receive backing from transnational jihadist outfits was admonished as wishful at best. In 2010, however, AQIM leader Droukdel announced that AQIM would provide weapons, support and training to Boko Haram. This Boko Haram—AQIM alliance is validated by public statements from both outfits. Moreover, Boko Haram’s suicide attack in 2011 targeting the United Nations office in Abuja, Nigeria, was tactically akin to bombings by AQIM (Aronson 2014). The literature addressing the impact of externalities on the incidence of terrorism, and its implications on CT, is limited. Anderton and Carter (2006) demonstrate the applicability of microeconomic concepts and principles to the study of terrorism. They utilize game theory to characterize strategic interdependencies among terrorists and governments. Enders and Jindapon (2010) analyze the optimal network structure of centralized and decentralized terror outfits, and demonstrate the sub-optimality of decentralized decision-making resulting from its inability to internalize important network externalities. A substantial part of the existing literature focuses on the externalities imposed on other countries, by the CT actions of one country against a common transnational terrorist threat. Arce and Sandler (2005) demonstrate the negative externalities imposed by a country’s defensive measures on other countries, by deflecting attacks towards them. On the contrary, proactive measures are shown to generate positive externalities for all other countries by degrading the capabilities of the terrorists. This is what causes the international co-ordination failure problem characterized by the oversupply of defensive measures and undersupply of offensive measures relative to the optimum, as also discussed in Sandler and Siqueira (2006). Faria et al. (2013) formulate a structure with temporal and spatial externalities to demonstrate that in steady state, intertemporal policy considerations outweigh concerns usually related to transnational CT policy. Siqueira and Sandler (2007) investigate the impact of domestic politics on the CT policy of two countries against a common terrorist threat. They demonstrate that the resulting delegation problem in which voters choose a policymaker with preferences different from their own, results in countries limiting the presumed oversupply of defensive CT measures. Similarly, Das and Roy Chowdhury (2014) apply a game-theoretic model to identify circumstances based on the impact of fear, which may render it logical to respond to increased terrorism with increased pre-emption. The present paper is the first to provide a formal analysis of the implications of the presence of operational externalities on the interactions between terror outfits. As opposed to the aforementioned literature on international externalities, this paper focuses on the externalities imposed by the activities of one terror outfit, on those of another. The findings are compared with the “benchmark” case without externalities. The study then proceeds to analyze the counter-terrorism ramifications of the nature and magnitude of operational externalities, if present. The analysis demonstrates that there is always scope for the effective employment of defensive CT, irrespective of whether or not operational externalities are present. This lends support to the “oversupply of defensive CT” hypothesis mentioned above. Moreover, confidence-building measures (CBM) are shown to be ineffective against resource-constrained outfits. In the presence of externalities, it is also demonstrated that the impact of offensive CT against a resource-abundant outfit is successful in reducing the total number of attacks of all outfits if and only if the magnitude of negative externalities on the other outfit is sufficiently high. This may explain the greater prudence with which countries, especially with strong democratic institutions, may employ offensive CT measures as compared to defensive measures. The following section presents the basic model in the absence of operational externalities. The third section introduces externalities and analyzes the associated comparative statics. The fourth section addresses some aspects of counter-terrorism policy, both in the presence and absence of externalities. The salient findings of the paper and their implications are summarized in the fifth and concluding section.",1

According to Cass Sunstein, an eminent legal scholar, L and E has revolutionised legal thinking. The discipline has had major impact on how developed economies have dealt with paramount economic issues like anti-trust, contracts, environment, property, land acquisition, regulation of banking and other financial entities, labour laws, road and health safety, among others. At the same time, the discipline has not been able to satisfactorily address several conundrums. Why are some laws followed by people, but others are not? Why are laws observed less frequently in some societies than others? Why is corruption more prevalent in some countries and not in others? These questions have spawned a huge theoretical and empirical literature by legal scholars and economists, but without any satisfactory answer. The book, The Republic of Beliefs, re-examines the foundations of L and E. It argues that the field as it stands today is incapable of answering the above and several other troubling questions faced by the discipline. The failure is due to a fault line that runs through the mainstream models of L and E, says the author, Professor Kaushik Basu, former Chief Economist at the World Bank and the Carl Marks Professor of International Studies and Professor of Economics at Cornell University. The book makes a compelling case for revisiting the gamut of law and economics. The new framework of analysis introduced in the book has potential to bring a paradigm shift in the discipline of law and economics, something similar to the changes brought about in economics by the concepts of Nash equilibrium and Coase theorem.Footnote 1 In addition, it provides interesting insights into several subjects like governance, power and social norms. Insights from the book provide a new perspective for analysing issues in the field of law, economics and also disciplines like political science, philosophy, sociology, among others. While the book resolves several conundrums facing the mainstream L and E, it raises equally serious issues that need addressing for us to have a good understanding of the law and its functioning. For the ease of exposition, let me use a few scenarios, the likes of which typically arise in implementation of the law. Scenario 1: You own a commercial firm whose back office is located in a residential neighbourhood. The back office is opened to your clients 5 days a week, i.e., Monday through Friday. You are contemplating whether you should do more business by opening it on Saturday as well. The net worth of the additional business would be Rupees B per Saturday, B > 0. Visits by your clients add to the congestion and noise in the neighbourhoods and are a nuisance for the residents who want to enjoy a quite weekend. Assume the disutility caused to residents is worth Rupees H per Saturday and H > B. In other words, the net social welfare measured in monetary terms is reduced by your working on Saturday. However, it is entirely up to you to decide whether you want to open your office or not. You are a ‘rational’ person who values money. So you will open the back office since B > 0. The question is: Can the law change your payoffs and decision related to keeping your office opened on Saturdays? According to the mainstream (neoclassical) approach in law and economics, the answer is ‘yes’. The standard approachFootnote 2 assumes the people to be rational actors and argues that a law can alter behaviour by changing the payoffs people get from different acts.Footnote 3 To illustrate, consider the following context involving a law. Scenario 2: Consider scenario 1, but assume that the city government has introduced a new zoning law. To enable the residents to enjoy quiet weekends, the law imposes restrictions on commercial activities carried out by residential neighbourhoods. The law prohibits you from opening your office over the weekend. There is a fine if you open the back office on Saturday. Suppose the monetary worth of the fine is F and it is imposed with probability p so the expected value of fine is pF. Following Becker (1968),Footnote 4 the standard L and E literature argues like this: In the absence of the law, your payoff from working on a Saturday is B. The zoning law reduces the payoff to B–pF; the gains B minus the expected fine you will have to pay, i.e., pF. Assume B < pF. That is, the inference is that in the absence of the law, you would operate your office on Saturdays. In contrast, you will not do so after enactment of the law, since B–pF < 0 (by assumption).Footnote 5 In other words, the standard L and E reasoning suggests that the zoning law does change your payoffs, and hence behaviour by imposing liability or fine. The view that through liability and punishment, the law changes the payoffs and behaviour gets reflected in the works of the legal positivists. For these legal scholars, the law sets the rules of behaviour and influences individual acts with punishment/costs associated with violations of the rules. This idea also gets echoed in the works of Jeremy Bentham, John Austin and more recently in the works of Hans Kelsen and H.L.A. Hart. According to the ‘imperative theory of law’ also the law works, because it is an order backed by a sanction. The book under review questions this line of reasoning. It argues that the law cannot affect individual behaviour by changing the payoff people get from their actions. This is a fundamental, but a subtle contribution made by the book. To drive home the point, consider the following hypothetical situation. Scenario 3: Let us go back to scenario 1, i.e., there is no zoning law in place. However, there is a person, X, who frequents the neighbourhood. While X does not interfere with your business on working days, if she finds your office opened on a Saturday, she demands a payment, F. You can think of X as a local bully with the physical might and resources needed to extract amount F from you, if she chooses to do so. There is nothing that can come in the way. To facilitate comparison with scenario 2, assume on every Saturday you open your office, X will extract a payment of F with probability p. When such a person is around, you will choose to keep your office closed on Saturdays, since iff B < pF. In other words, your payoffs from operating on a Saturday are affected by the action of X and your behaviour depends on the action of X. Can the law affect payoffs in a similar way? The answer is ‘no’. To see this, let us now go back to scenario 2 with the law. For your payoffs and behaviour to change under the zoning law, we must assume the following: As soon as the zoning law is enacted, there appears on the scene a powerful entity (inspector or policeman) that is capable of extracting the fine F, just like person X in scenario 3. Moreover, such an entity should want to extract the fine (with probability p), if you open your office on Saturday. This is exactly what the mainstream L. and E implicitly assumes, when it argues that the law can change individual payoffs and behaviour, as discussed above. In other words, the standard L. and. E assumes that enactment of law per se ensures existence of an entity capable of imposing liability or punishment as intended by the law. This entity can be a person (the inspector) or a group of individuals, the inspector, his superior, the superior of his superior, the judge, etc. Moreover, the neoclassical L and E assumes that all players in the entity have robotic preferences. Rather than pursuing self-interest, they obey the diktat of the law in letter and spirit.Footnote 6 According to the book, these assumptions are a source of inconsistency and a fault line that run through the models used in the discipline. Does the law not automatically provide for the kind of entity assumed in the mainstream L and E, as described above? The answer is ‘no’. At a first go, it might appear that the law can create an entity and empower it by making provisions for enforcement agents backed by budgetary allocations to pay for their services. However, such an argument means that the force of the entity essentially comes from a suitable combination of human and other resources. But, then these resources together will have the same force in the absence of the law. The law, in itself, cannot generate resources and hence, the consequent entity based on them. Moreover, even if we assume that pursuant to the law, a powerful law enforcement entity can be formed, why would it want to enforce the law just because the law says so? In real world, we do see collective looking away from laws by the police, the courts and civilians alike. In India, the legal right of women to parents’ property is one of the many cases in point. To sum up, enactment of the law, in itself, can neither produce an entity that is all-powerful and willing to extract fine, as described above, nor can it make the entity disappear if one already existed. If an entity willing and capable of extracting the fine were there, it could have extracted the fine without needing a law, just like the person X does in scenario 3. According to Basu, in a sense, the law is nothing, but “ink on paper”. The book highlights the fallacies that have come to beset the mainstream L and E models as a consequence of contradictory assumptions discussed above. These models assume the private individuals to be rational and self-seeking who act to maximise their respective payoffs. However, the individuals who act as the law enforcement agents of the state are assumed to be robotic in the sense that they do what the law asks them to do regardless of whether the act is in their private interest or not.Footnote 7 It is in this sense, the standard framework of L and E is internally flawed.",

55,1,Indian Economic Review,07 May 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41775-020-00083-5,Manufacturing agglomeration and export dynamics across Indian states,June 2020,Piyali Majumder,Aparna Sawhney,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"Regional inequality and unbalanced growth have been a persistent feature of India’s development, driven largely by uneven geographical provision of infrastructural facilities and spatial concentration of manufacturing industries (Nagraj et al. 1998; Zhang and Fan 2004; Chakravorty 2003; Lall and Chakravorty 2005; Fernandes and Sharma 2012; Barua and Sawhney 2015; Das et al. 2015). Geographical factors play a key role in the development process of a region, where availability of input resources, better transport network, larger markets and economies of scale lead to agglomeration of industries in core regions (Krugman 1991; Fujita et al. 1999). Location-specific synergies due to the spatial proximity of production facilities that create positive externalities then reinforce the formation of industrial clusters. The external benefits for producers in the clusters include easier access to market and labour, lower logistical costs, knowledge sharing, etc. However, diseconomies due to congestion eventually lead to rising costs (as land becomes scarce, pollution increases, transportation time increases), and induce producers to spread to less congested peripheral regions. In the presence of regional imbalance, trade openness is likely to further increase regional disparity, as indeed has been observed in India in post-liberalization era since 1991, with more advanced states making greater gains from trade liberalization (Marjit et al. 2007; Aghion et al. 2008; Barua and Sawhney 2015). The new economic geography literature emphasized the role of second nature geography, beyond the first nature geography due to natural advantages (endowment of mineral resources or coastline), that leads to concentration of manufacturing activities within a region. These are the external economies arising through the common labor pool, access to intermediate inputs, knowledge and information spillovers among the economic agents within a region. These economies are self-reinforcing since the concentration of manufacturing activities within a region attracts other industries in that region and reinforces further concentration of industries, leading to the formation of central business districts within a country. Other economies considered under the scope of second nature geography are proximity to consumer markets, availability of infrastructural facilities including the transport network system, institutional facilities and governance structure of a region. In India, the spatial distribution of the manufacturing is highly skewed due to the presence of agglomeration economies (Lall and Chakraborty 2005; Lall et al. 2004; Ghani et al. 2014), and these economies have had a productivity spillover effect among the manufacturing plants (Lall et al. 2004). Agglomeration economies have been found to have significant productivity spillover on the export behaviour of manufacturing plants (Aitken et al. 1997; Bernard and Jensen 2004) and firms (Greenaway and Knellar 2008; Farole 2013; Mukim 2013; Rodriguez-Pose et al. 2013; Yi 2014; Ito et al. 2015). Moreover, the presence of incumbent exporters in a region provides cost benefits to a potential entrant through information and resource externalities (export spillover effect). In the Indian context, however, the overall spatial concentration of manufacturing has declined substantially during 1998–2013 (Amirapu et al. 2019). In the face of the changing pattern of agglomeration, it remains to be seen to what extent has manufacturing agglomeration has affected manufacturing plants, in particular their trade performance? Localization economies, also called own-industry agglomeration, among Indian firms have been found to significantly increase the odds for a firm to start exporting (Mukim 2013), yet exporting firms’ agglomeration was not found to have any significant impact. Mukim calibrated industry agglomeration at the 2-digit industry-level, and it is possible that agglomeration economies among exporters are relevant at finer industrial definition. It is important to note also that firms may have multiple production establishments (factories), and often these factories are spread across different districts and states—which the firm’s corporate office address does not reflect. However industrial agglomeration (defined at 3-digit industry) was not found to enhance the export intensity of single-state based firms across Indian states (Pradhan and Das 2013). Both studies examined the agglomeration economies at the firm-level using the Prowess database, where labour-pool or capital-investment productivity spillover effects is likely to be missed since firms typically produce multiple industrial products across multiple manufacturing plants spread over different regions. i.e. firm-level export behaviour would not accurately reflect the agglomeration effects associated with manufacturing activity, and it is best tracked through factory-level data. In our study, we track export behaviour of manufacturing plants directly and test for the impact of industry agglomeration and exporters’ spillover at the finer 4-digit industry classification, which may not be otherwise evident at the more aggregate sector level (2-digit or 3-digit classification). As several states offer infrastructure and financial incentives to promote exports and have special economic zones (SEZs), we control for the presence of SEZs across the states. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that analyses the impact of industrial agglomeration on the export behaviour of manufacturing plants in India. The role of regional factors on the export behaviour of organised manufacturing plants is examined after controlling for other plant-level and regional characteristics in a dynamic framework over the period 2008–2009 to 2013–2014. We use factory data from the annual survey of industries (ASI) for the organized manufacturing sector, which provides information on the plant characteristics as well as the plant output directly exported beginning 2008–2009. The ASI factory data with identifier codes are used to create a panel (with state as spatial unit, as the ASI factory code data only provides state location). We calibrate industrial agglomeration at the 4-digit code of the National Industrial Classification (NIC) based on employment, using spatially weighed Ellison Glaeser index of organized manufacturing, and alternatively the spatially weighted Gini index as a measure. The spatial weighted matrix accommodates spillover effects from adjacent states and helps us control for the problem associated with data aggregation by pre-defined administrative state boundaries. We find that export-spillovers have been highly significant in enhancing the export behaviour of manufacturing plants, after controlling for the degree of industrial agglomeration. We find that labour pool with specialized knowledge in the incumbent exporting plants, especially from those in the same industry, and to a lesser extent than from other industries, increase plant export propensity. Among the location-specific infrastructural amenities, we find that transportation has played the most significant role in enhancing plant export performance. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 gives a brief literature review of the linkage between agglomeration economies and manufacturing export behaviour; Sect. 3 discusses the geographical spread of the manufacturing export activity across Indian states and districts. In Sect. 4 we specify our dynamic model, and in Sect. 5 we summarize our estimation results. Section 6 concludes.",2

Central banks periodically set policy interest rates, which signal their intention of the level of the operating target. The changes in the operating target are transmitted to the entire spectrum of interest rates and asset prices, which then help achieve ultimate objectives of price stability and growth. In order to make sure that the operating target remains close to the policy rate, central banks need to supply only that much liquidity as is demanded by the system. If liquidity supplied is more than the demand, the operating target may fall below the policy rate with attendant implications for other interest rates in the system and ultimate objectives of monetary policy. Conversely, if liquidity supplied is less than the demand, the operating target may trade above the policy rate. Thus, active day-to-day liquidity management is a sine qua non for the successful conduct of monetary policy. After the global financial crisis (GFC) in 2008, central banks in many advanced economies (AEs), especially the United States (US) and the Euro area, infused large liquidity first to restore normalcy in dysfunctional financial markets and then to support economic activity after interest rates reached effective lower bound (ELB).Footnote 1 Liquidity was infused through large-scale asset purchase programmes (LSAPs), the so-called quantitative easing, so as to bring down long-term interest rates and encourage private sector lending directly. That is, central banks in these countries used their balance sheets as a tool of monetary policy to promote economic activity. The balance sheet of the US Federal Reserve (US Fed) expanded five times from US Dollar (USD) 0.9 trillion in January 2008 to USD 4.5 trillion in January 2015 and that of the European Central Bank (ECB) 3.5 times from EUR 1.3 trillion in January 2008 to EUR 4.6 trillion in October 2018. This surge in the central banks’ balance sheet size and the quantum of bank reserves affected the conduct of monetary policy operations of these central banks (Bernanke 2016). On November 8, 2016, India demonetised its high-value currency notes constituting about 86.9% of total currency in the circulation. Demonetisation did not impact immediately the balance sheet of the Reserve Bank India (RBI) as demonetised notes continued to be its liabilities. However, as old currency notes returned to banks, a large part of it remained as deposits with the banks, flushing the system with large surplus liquidity.Footnote 2 The question that arises is as follows: How did central banks in these countries steer interest rates in the context of large liquidity? Since the contexts of surplus liquidity and the operating procedures of monetary policy were different in these three economies, the challenges were also different. The ECB and the RBI followed a corridor system, which provided a floor and ceiling to short-term interest rates. Large liquidity did not pose much of a challenge to the ECB as it was intentional, and the lower bound of the corridor ensured that the operating target did not collapse. The large surplus liquidity in India was the unintended outcome of demonetisation of high-value currency notes. Hence, it became a challenge to steer overnight interest rates close to policy rate. On the other hand, the operating system in the US did not have a floor and the US Fed wanted to create a lower bound or floor on the federal funds rate to have an effective control of interest rates, especially when it had to raise the interest rates in the economy (FOMC 2016). The US Fed, therefore, set up a floor and also a sub-floor to have effective control over interest rates. In the above backdrop, this paper examines as to how the three central banks, viz. the US Fed, the ECB and the RBI, steered interest rates in the face of unprecedented surplus liquidity,Footnote 3 i.e. it assesses the marksmanship in keeping an effective control over the benchmark rate or the operating target amidst large surplus liquidity. This study finds that it is challenging to steer interest rates in the middle of the corridor in the face of large surplus liquidity. However, all the three central banks were able to keep the benchmark rates within the corridor (the ECB and the RBI) or target range (the US Fed) even in the face of unprecedented surplus liquidity. The paper is organised in six sections: Section 2 provides the theoretical underpinnings of liquidity management framework followed by most central banks (CB) and compares the corridor and floor systems of liquidity management. Section 3 details the developments which led to large surplus liquidity in the United States, Euro area and India. Section 4 delineates the challenges posed by large surplus liquidity in steering short-term interest rates and the measures undertaken for ensuring an effective control over them. Section 5 empirically evaluates as to how far the three central banks were able to have an effective control over short-term rates. Section 6 sums up the key findings and sets out some final reflections.",

A majority of these studies have focussed mainly on the time period before Global Financial Crisis (GFC) (see Bhandari 2012; Bhattacharyya et al. 1997; Das and Ghosh 2006, 2009; Kumbhakar and Sarkar 2003; Ray and Das 2010; Sahoo and Tone 2009; Sensarma 2005; Zhao et al. 2010, among others). By contrast, only limited number of empirical studies have analysed the changes taken place within the Indian banking industry since GFC, i.e. after 2008 (Fujii et al. 2014; Gulati and Kumar 2016; Tzeremes 2015). Although studies on banking efficiency and productivity analysis are voluminous, little attention has been paid to convergence in efficiency among banks. From a regulatory perspective, measurement of convergence process is important, since increase in integration fosters competition which in turn may result in improvement in cost efficiency (Guiso et al. 2004). Also, an integrated financial system plays an important role in promoting savings, investments and subsequently, economic growth of an economy (Mohan 2005). This study aims to fill this gap by investigating the convergence properties among Indian commercial banks during 1998–2015. In particular, we intend inter alia to address the following questions regarding the Indian banking industry. First, what is the overall cost efficiency of Indian commercial banks during the post deregulation period and how has it varied over time? Second, does efficiency vary among various ownership groups? Third, is there any convergence in cost efficiency among Indian banks? Fourth, if so, is it due to catching up or lagging behind processes? Fifth, has overall competition increased over time in the Indian banking industry? This study contributes to the existing banking efficiency literature in many ways. Firstly, for measuring the efficiency or productivity of banking industry, it is essential that sample period must be large (Berger and Humphrey 1997). For this purpose, we use a time period that covers both pre and post GFC. This enables us to carry out a comprehensive analysis of cost efficiency among Indian banks during the time period consistent with the consolidation process. Secondly, to overcome the problems inherent in conventional two-stage analysis, we adopt the double bootstrap procedure (Simar and Wilson 2007), which provides bias-corrected cost efficiency scores and enables consistent inference. Thirdly, for estimating convergence in cost efficiency in the Indian banking industry, the concepts of β-convergence, and σ-convergence (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1991; 1992) are employed in a dynamic panel framework. This is very important, since a number of structural and regulatory changes have been taking place in the Indian banking industry over the years. Finally, in order to estimate the intensity of competition in the banking industry, we deploy the Rosse and Panzar 1977 non-structural model, considered to be more comprehensive than k-firm concentration ratio or Herfindahl–Hirschman index (HHI). The remainder of the paper unfolds as follows. Section 2 provides a brief overview of the Indian banking industry. Section 3 reviews the literature on banking efficiency and convergence. Section 4 presents the data and methodology we use for measuring efficiency and convergence. The empirical results are presented and discussed in Sect. 5, and Sect. 6 concludes.",4

Since the early 1980s, there has been a systematic growth of income inequality in nations across the world, and India has been no exception (Milanovic, 2016). And while significant attention has focused on India’s poverty alleviation effects over the past 40 years (Deaton & Dreze, 2002; Dev & Ravi, 2007; Dhongde, 2007; Kjelsrud & Somanathan, 2017; Ninan, 1994; World Bank, 2019), the rapid rise in inequality in the same period merits deeper examination, especially pertaining to the dynamics at the bottom of the distribution. Many studies on the Indian income distribution use consumption data as provided by the National Sample Survey (NSS) as the basis to study income inequality (Deaton & Dreze, 2002; Sarkar & Mehta, 2010), while others have attempted to construct the income distribution using multiple sources in addition to NSS expenditure data, such as income tax data, national accounts data from the Central Statistical Organization (CSO), and Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) household savings data (Ahmed & Bhattacharya, 2017; Banerjee & Piketty, 2005; Chancel & Piketty, 2019; Ojha & Bhatt, 1964; Sinha et al. 2017). Chancel and Piketty (2019), construct the longest (and most up-to-date) income inequality time-series for India, from 1922 to 2015, using income tax data, NSS expenditure data, and the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) income data, providing us a picture of the longer-term temporal evolution of income inequality in India (Fig. 1). Income inequality shows a declining trend for the first 3 decades after independence, with the top 10% (1%) earning 36.7% (11.5%) of the total income in 1951 and 30.7% (6.7%) in 1981. The bottom 50% meanwhile see their income share increase from 20.6 to 23.5% in the same period. However, from the early 1980s, inequality has shown a sustained and steep increase, resulting in the top 10% (1%) earning 56% (21%) of income in 2015, with the bottom 50% seeing their share reduce to 14.7% (Chancel & Piketty, 2019). Evolution of income inequality (1951–2015): The temporal evolution of inequality is represented through the shares of incomes owned by the top 1% (\({S}_{1\%}\), red line), top 10% (\({S}_{10\%}\), blue line), and bottom 50% (\({S}_{50\%}\), green line) of the population. Top income shares declined until the early 1980s, and have sharply risen since then. Income shares of the bottom half have declined since 1980 Before we delve deeper into the dynamics of inequality in India, it is useful to contextualize the Indian experience within the broader global experience of inequality. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, mean incomes in most countries were stagnant for many centuries (Alvarez-Nogal & Prados de la Escosura, 2013), but inequality waxed and waned over time as a consequence of idiosyncratic forces such as wars, discovery of new lands, and epidemics (Milanovic, 2016). The rise and fall of inequality around an essentially fixed mean income illustrates the fact that there was no systematic relationship between inequality and income. The industrial revolution, however, appears to have fundamentally altered the dynamic between income and inequality in two significant ways (Milanovic, 2016). First, growing total national incomes meant that inequality had more 'space' to increase now than before, thereby allowing a small portion of the population very high incomes, while also ensuring that nobody was pushed below subsistence level. This notion of greater potential inequality on account of increasing total income has been formalized as the 'inequality possibility frontier', which is defined as the locus of maximum feasible inequality levels for different values of mean income (Milanovic et al. 2011). Second, after the Industrial Revolution there emerged a new relationship between mean income and inequality. Both mean income and income inequality, on average, displayed a rising trend over time. The structural change on account of shift in occupations from agriculture to industry as well as changes in patterns of living as captured in the rural-to-urban migration, drove inequality up as a consequence of capital being able to capture most of the gains of increasing total income at the expense of labour. It has been argued that income inequality always rises when the rate of return from capital is greater than the rate of economic growth (Piketty, 2014), and that it is only for the brief period in the middle of the twentieth century that there is a decline in inequality, which is due to a special set of political circumstances such as education, taxation, workers movements, social security, as well as economic convergence (Milanovic, 2016; Piketty, 2014). This decline is apparent in the time-evolution of inequality between the Second World War and the 1980s—to illustrate, between 1955 and 1980, the share of income earned by the top 10% declined by 7% in the United States, 15% in France, 18% in the Soviet Union, and 19% in India (Alvaredo et al. 2017; Chancel & Piketty, 2019; Garbinti et al. 2017; Novokmet et al. 2017). However, post the 1980s, inequality has resumed its expected upward trend and Milanovic (2016) argues that we are currently witnessing yet another set of structural changes encompassing the communications and Internet revolution that has resulted in a sectoral shift from industry to services, increased economic interconnectedness between countries, and weakened the labour movement on account of the dispersed nature of employment in the services industry. Again, capital has captured a large share of the increased total income, resulting in a rising trend of economic inequality in nations across the world, even as average incomes have continued rising. For instance, between 1995 and 2012 the total fraction of income earned by the top 10% has grown by almost 13% in South Africa, 15% in the US, 25% in China, and 45% in India (Alvaredo et al. 2017; Assouad et al. 2018; Chancel & Piketty, 2019). While the evolution of income inequality in India appears to broadly follow global trends, it is important to recognize that constructing the income distribution for measurement of inequality in India presents specific and unique challenges. To construct an annual time-series of income inequality for India, given the largely informal nature of the workforce (tax data only covers ~ 7% of the working population), incomes of over 90% of the population are generally estimated from NSS consumption data, because regular income surveys do not exist (Bardhan, 2017; Chancel & Piketty, 2019). There are a number of challenges, such as under-reporting and under-sampling, in using NSS consumption data to estimate income inequality, in addition to the fact that the dynamics of these two distributions (consumption and income) may be quite different (Atkinson & Piketty, 2010). In their work estimating India’s income distribution from 1922 to 2015, Chancel and Piketty (2019) rely on tax data for the top of the distribution, but use income data from two IHDS surveys to compute income-consumption ratios, which forms their basis to construct income profiles from NSS consumption data. They clearly discuss the significant methodological and data challenges inherent in the empirical construction of the entire Indian income distribution, especially moving towards the bottom incomes. Studies of inequality generally tend to focus on the income shares of those at the top of the distribution (top 0.1%, top 1%, top 10%, etc.), so as to understand the (often disproportionate) extent of economic growth, they have garnered over time. Our primary interest, however, lies in understanding the nature and extent of reallocation occurring within the income distribution over time. We propose to use income inequality data to fit a stochastic model of income evolution and thereby construct a theoretically consistent estimation of redistribution inherent in the economy. We also seek to understand better the dynamics of the lowest end of the spectrum—the bottom decile and the bottom percentile of the income distribution. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings in the context of significant global and national trends impinging on the Indian economy.",4
56,1,Indian Economic Review,11 January 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41775-020-00101-6,Heterogeneity in food expenditure among US families: evidence from longitudinal quantile regression,June 2021,Arjun Gupta,Soudeh Mirghasemi,Mohammad Arshad Rahman,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"Food expenditure forms an integral part of the total family (or household) expenditure and is often categorized into food at home (FAH), food away from home (FAFH), and food delivered at home (FDAH). This categorization is relevant from a health perspective and other reasons. First, the division permits us to analyze the nutrition quality of food among families. This is important, because there are health implications of consuming more FAFH, as it is considered to be less nutritious than FAH (Mancino et al. 2009) and more energy dense (Binkley 2008). Some authors have also linked more FAFH to overweight and obesity (Cai et al. 2008). Second, the division allows us to answer interesting policy-oriented questions. For example, what is the effect of a female-headed family on FAH expenditure or does having a home mortgage reduce FAH and/or FAFH expenditures? Third, food assistance programs are often designed to minimize the health risks arising from deficient nutrition particularly among unemployed and lower income groups. This categorization can help assess the efficacy of food assistance program on FAH expenditure of the vulnerable groups, particularly during times of economic crisis. As a result, the study of expenditure on FAH and FAFH has attracted considerable attention in the literature. Few previous studies using cross-section data include Lee and Brown (1986), Nayga (1996), Aguiar and Hurst (2005), and Liu et al. (2013). Lee and Brown (1986) employ a switching regression model on the 1977–78 Nationwide Food Consumption Survey data to examine expenditures on FAH and FAFH among the US households. Nayga (1996) utilizes the 1992 US consumer expenditure survey (CES) data to estimate the effect of wife’s education and employment on three subcategories of food expenditure—for prepared food, food prepared at home, and food away from home. The modeling scheme utilized is a generalized version of Heckman’s sample selection model (Heckman 1979). Aguiar and Hurst (2005) employs an instrumental variable linear regression to investigate, among other things, the effect of anticipated (i.e., retirement) and unanticipated (i.e., unemployment) shock to income on TF, FAH, and FAFH expenditures. The data are taken from the Continuing Survey of Food Intake of Individuals (CSFII, collected by the US Department of Agriculture) and corresponds to interviews conducted between 1989–1991 and 1994–1996, but the households are different in the two interviews. Liu et al. (2015) use a trivariate sample selection procedure to study patterns in FAFH expenditure among the Chinese households. In studies such as Liu et al. (2013), the use of the sample selection framework is motivated to account for the occurrence of zero expenditures, particularly on FAFH or in its subdivision (e.g., full-service restaurants, fast-food restaurants, and others). To get a more complete picture, readers may look into Table 1 of Davis (2014) for a brief summary of 17 articles (out of 20) on studies related to food expenditure using cross-section data. The relationship of food expenditure (at home and away from home) to other covariates has been the focus of analysis in several cross-section studies. They include the relation of food expenditure (of various types) to consumer preferences (Stewart et al. 2005), family composition (Liu et al. 2013), race (Lanfranco et al. 2002), homeownership and mortgages (Nayga 1996; Mian et al. 2013), wife’s labor force participation (Redman 1980; Kinsey 1983; Darian and Klein 1989; Yen 1993; Nayga 1996), children’s welfare (Handa 1996), and obesity (Drichoutis et al. 2012). Some authors have also examined the effects of tax on food expenditure. For example, Zheng et al. (2019) examines the impact of tax on expenditure in grocery food (i.e., FAH) and restaurant food (i.e., FAFH) using a weekly data observed between April 2012 and January 2013, collected by United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). They find that tax on grocery (restaurant food) reduces expenditure on grocery (restaurant food) and increases expenditure on restaurant food (grocery). The above paragraphs clearly indicate that there are ample cross-section studies on food expenditure, but panel or longitudinal studies are rather lacking with few exceptions. Cai et al. (2008) presents a state-level analysis of different types of food expenditure on overweight rates, obesity rates, and combined rates (the sum of overweight and obesity rates) using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The primary finding is that FAH (FAFH) expenditure is negatively (positively) associated to obesity and combined rates, and both FAH and FAFH expenditures do not significantly affect overweight rates. The only panel study mentioned in Davis (2014) is the article by Gelber and Mitchell (2012), where they use PSID and time diary data between 1975 and 2004, and find that for a decrease in income tax (i.e., incentive to join the labor force increases), single women are much more likely to increase FAFH expenditure to substitute for housework compared to single men. At the same time, the effect on FAH expenditure is statistically insignificant. Kohara and Kamiya (2016) use a panel data on Japanese households for the period 2004–2006 and find that mothers’ labor supply decision has a negative effect on food produced at home. Moreover, the negative effect is common for all economic classes and more pronounced for the low economic class. Besides, there are abundant studies that examine the impact on food expenditure from participating in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as Food Stamp Program (FSP)Footnote 1. Few articles from this literatureFootnote 2 include Hoynes and Schanzenbach (2009), Wilde et al. (2009), Beatty and Tuttle (2014), and Burney (2018). However, these studies focus on the conditional mean of the response variable and thus cannot explain the relationship at the quantiles. The current study takes a broader perspective and looks at expenditures on total food (TF), food at home (FAH), and food away from home (FAFH), and explains its variation based on various demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic factors including mortgage and recession. The data are taken from Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and are composed of 2174 family units observed over the period 2001–2015. Since ours is a panel data, we exploit a longitudinal or panel regression framework that can accommodate both common (fixed-effects) and individual-specific (random-effects) parameters (hence also known as mixed-effects model in Statistics)Footnote 3. However, mean longitudinal regression is not capable of capturing the heterogeneity in covariate effects across the conditional distribution of the response variable. To overcome this limitation, we study the heterogeneous effect of the covariates on food expenditure (TF, FAH, and FAFH) using a quantile model for longitudinal data that accommodates both common effects and individual-specific effects, also known as quantile mixed models. This paper contributes to the literature in at least three different ways. First, quantile longitudinal regression provides a comprehensive understanding of food expenditure pattern of family units to variation in covariates by providing estimates at different quantiles. The method is robust compared to standard longitudinal models where the focus is on the mean, because among other things, it is unaffected by the presence of outliers in the data. Second, this study adds to the understanding of the differences in food expenditure pre, during, and after the Great Recession. This enables us to capture patterns linking recession and food expenditure by categories which we explore in this study. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to examine the effects of the Great Recession on food expenditure at home and away from home within a quantile panel data framework. Third, longitudinal data allow us to model the behavior of family units over time, which provides an advantage to control for unobserved heterogeneity leading to more robust estimates. As shown in this paper, it is important to control for this repeated behavior, because models which treat unobserved heterogeneity as a part of error term often result in inconsistent estimates and may lead to incorrect policy inference. The remaining paper is organized as follows. Section 2 lays out the basic framework of the mean regression and quantile regression models for longitudinal data that we employ in our analysis. Section 3 presents a descriptive summary of the data and discusses the trends in variables over the time period of our study. Section 4 presents the results from the aforementioned regression models and shows the consequences of not modeling individual-specific heterogeneity. Finally, Sect. 5 presents concluding remarks.",

India’s dependence on imports has increased manifolds over the years with greater market access provided to foreign goods through liberalisation policies. Total imports into India have increased from $50 billion in 2000 to $514 billion in 2018–2019. This increase in imports has also contributed to the export sector by providing access to cheaper and technically advanced inputs for further production process. One of the fallouts of import liberalisation policy was internationalization of the production process. Relying on import of raw materials for production and export of finished goods is an integral feature of international economic integration and globalization of production. Import intensity signifies the extent of imported inputs embodied in the goods being exported; thus, it is an indication of the extent of a country’s participation in the global production network (GPN). India integrated herself into the GPN by enabling producers to access foreign inputs for domestic value addition. According to the OECD’s Trade in Value Added (TiVA) database, the foreign value added in India has risen from 18.8% in 2005 to 25.1% in 2012. The latest data, however, show a decline in the foreign value added for India to 16.1% in 2016. This may be likely, in part due to the shift of domestic producers towards local suppliers of intermediate inputs. The thrust of the government on enhancing local manufacturing through policies like ‘Make in India’ and the emphasis to promote domestic production components, such as electronic products and components under a Phased Manufacturing ProgrammeFootnote 1 launched in 2015. Our data also show a decline in import intensity of exports for sectors like textiles and automobiles. However, overall for the manufacturing sector the import intensity has risen from 29% in 2007–2008 to 51% in a span of 8 years in 2013–2014 based on input–output table for the year 2013–2014. Imported raw materials and intermediate inputs enable industries to improve the international competitiveness of exports by giving them access to advanced technology and larger scale of operation. Thus, increase in import intensity of export may lead to higher export growth, given the favourable world demand. One of the prime reasons for slow growth of exports in the Indian economy was lack of access to imported raw material and plant and machinery to the industry.Footnote 2 The restrictive trade policy regime, thus, constrained the improvement in quality and thereby exports competitiveness. It has been further claimed by some studies (Sathe 1997) even under the restrictive policy regime in some selected cases, where imported raw materials have been allowed, export performance has been noteworthy, for instance, diamond industry, where exports have increased substantially with greater accessibility to imported raw materials. However, raw diamonds, the raw material required for this industry is not available in India. So, it may not be a proper example to justify the policy of import liberalisation under structural adjustment programme. Also, since the import requirement of this industry is high, it is imperative to examine the net gain in foreign exchange after adjustment for import demands are made. Apart from contributing to export growth, fallout of higher imports of intermediate goods over the years has been the shift in demand for a higher skill set. It is believed in trade theory that trade liberalisation leads the developing countries to experience a rise in the demand for labour-intensive technologies, and thereby, demand for the most abundant form of human resource. If this theory were to hold, in case of India where skilled labour is in scarcity, trade openness should have led to demand for more labour-intensive technologies and thereby, absorption of the abundant less skilled labour. However, such a phenomenon has not been observed by many studies across developing countries including India (Goldberg and Pavcnik 2007; Marjit et al. 2004; Chaudhuri and Yabuuchi 2007; Feenstra and Hanson 1996). Dependence on imports of technologically advanced inputs demands highly skilled labour that enables firms to raise their productivity while reducing their costs by way of cheaper and better inputs imported from abroad. Foreign technology requires plant-level adoption of sophisticated technology inducing skill-biased technological change Kasaharaa et al. (2016). Several studies have found the effect of imports of intermediate inputs to be biased towards demand for skilled labour (Bernard and Jensen 1997; Biscourp and Kramarz 2007; Bustos 2011; Koren 2011; Ludwig and Brautzsch 2014). In case of India, on the other hand, there has been very little research on the impact of import intensity of exports of the manufacturing sector on exports and on demand for skill. The present paper makes an attempt in this direction. The specific objectives of the present study are: To study import intensity trends of broad manufacturing sectors which are engaged in export activities over the years 2003–2004 to 2013–2014. To assess the impact of import intensity on exports To explore the import intensity on skill levels in India’s organized manufacturing sector. The paper is divided into six sections with the first section being the introduction, followed by a detailed literature review in the context set out in Sect. 1. Section 3 explains the data sources employed in the analysis and the detailed methodology followed in calculating various measures like import intensity and skill index. Analysis of the trends and the empirical results are presented in Sects. 4 and 5, respectively. Section 6 concludes the study.",2

Bhattacharya,Ranojoy Basu,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The term “ property rights” refers to an owner’s legal right to use a good or an asset for consumption or income generation, and also, the right to transfer the good to another party (Besley and Ghatak 2009). Property rights have been center stage in all analyses of the development (and dominance) of the market system in modern societies. Over two centuries ago, Adam Smith, and subsequently other thinkers, expounded on the idea that property rights encourage their holders to develop the property, generate wealth, and efficiently allocate resources via the market mechanism.Footnote 1 They noted that the anticipation of profit from “ improving one’s stock of capital” rests on clear delineation and enforcement of private property rights, which, in turn, leads to more wealth and improved standards of living for all.Footnote 2 While this prescription for material progress and prosperity has been around for a while, not every country has succeeded in harnessing it. Indeed, in most less-developed and transition economies, institutions aimed at defining and preserving property rights are still woefully fragile, and as such, property rights are terribly insecure. This insecurity comes at a hefty price—heightened conflict over property and the accompanying dissipation of scarce resources in the creation of effective property rights.Footnote 3 Our paper analyzes the role an improvement in property security plays in superior technology adoption and economic development, especially in societies characterized by fragile institutions and weak property security. Specifically, output is contestable in a society with imperfect property rights and conflict over the output cannot be settled without expending scarce resources in “ appropriation”. Appropriation in general represents a composite use of resources for grabbing the production of other agents or defending own property from others, but in our formulation, it will only represent grabbing an amount from the “ contestable” output. Thus, appropriation is a rival and socially wasteful utilization of scarce resources which not only causes economic underdevelopment but also influences agents rational best response in a strategic environment. It has been observed that in societies characterized by such poor property rights enforcement, agents do not always adopt superior technologies, even when it is available for free. For example, Platteau (2000) documents how fishermen in Congo refused to use a new net technology which was offered to them at no cost. More generally, it has been documented that economic agents in impoverished societies often reject superior technologies—technologies that are on the frontier—even when the cost of adoption appears negligible. In explaining this apparent paradox, one line of argument holds lack of enforced property security responsible for such technological backwardness in a strategic environment. One such explanation is forwarded by Gonzalez (2005) in which anticipation of heightened future conflict forestalls the adoption of superior technology by strategic agents. Almost the entire literature models conflict as a contest in which agents play a non-cooperative game to settle the conflict (Gonzalez 2012). Gonzalez (2005) has in mind a setting in which two agents contemplate adoption of a superior technology in an insecure property-rights environment. While each recognize that such adoption would lead to an increase in future output, each is nevertheless afraid that this newly created wealth generates an incentive for the rival to engage in a costly game of predation. The expected predatory response discourages adoption of the superior technology in the first place, and thus “...poverty becomes the price of peace” (Bates 2001).Footnote 4 The upshot of the Gonzalez (2005) analysis is that adoption of the best-available technology is never sustainable as an equilibrium in the game of conflict. It bears emphasis that property rights in Gonzalez (2005) are not just insecure, they simply do not exist. Property rights are created by the two parties by expending real resources in appropriation: they emerge in the game of conflict as the jointly determined return to “ appropriative investments” made by each contesting party. If people are hesitant to adopt superior technologies because of a fear of subsequent conflict, would some sort of external intervention be beneficial? Would it help if a third party intervenes in this conflict? But intervene how? If property rights exist but are insecure because they are not strictly enforced, then intervention could take the form of better enforcement. But if property rights do not exist in the first place, what form can public intervention take? To pursue this, we introduce a stylized third party, a “ government”, in the framework of Gonzalez (2005). We think of the government as imposing a non-distortionary tax on the initial endowments of each agent at the start of their life. The tax proceeds are utilized to finance the hiring of a “guard”. The guard is not posted to enforce existing property rights, because none exist anyway. The guard is simply a public security service whose sole aim is to reduce the effectiveness of agents’ predatory activities, without directly interfering in the game. Once each agent’s predation gets blunted, they each feel more secure in diverting resources toward productive activities. In sharp contrast to the main result in Gonzalez (2005), we show that under guard-posting, adoption of the best-available technology by each agent can be supported as a subgame-perfect equilibrium. The point is, even in the absence of property rights, the presence of a third party may succeed in getting the contesting parties to reach an efficient, non-cooperative outcome all on their own. This result means that an external agent, just by thwarting the appropriative efforts, without having a direct intervention in the level of property security, can actually give the agents enough incentive to adopt best available technology and thus, overcome the immediate inefficiency. Having this objective accomplished, we go on to explore a more pertinent issue: is improvement in property security always a socially beneficial outcome for all the agents? To address this issue, we extend the analysis by allowing the government to directly influence the nature of the ex-post conflict, not merely thwart predation. In other words, we allow the government to use its tax-financed resources to alter the existing regime of property rights. Presumably, a government can achieve increased security of property rights by funding the police, the judiciary, and the corrections systems better. Our formulation allows for all possible property-rights regimes, from the one extreme discussed above with no rights, to one where rights are perfectly secure. We find that adoption of the best-available technology by each agent continues to emerge as an equilibrium for a range of property-rights regimes. Within the confines of this first-best technology adoption equilibrium, we find that publicly funded improvements in the property-rights regime gives agents an elevated incentive to move resources away from appropriative activities towards productive activities. This reduces the socially wasteful utilization of scarce resources and as a result, the total production increases by such an extent that both the agents have an increased consumption in post-production conflict period. On this account, improvement in property rights is shown to be a pro-growth activity from the policy perspective. However, this movement towards a better property security is not always socially optimal from an aggregate-welfare point of view.Footnote 5 Though the consumption in post-production conflict period increases for everyone, welfare of some agents might fall (as a result of inter-temporal adjustments) which has nothing to do with corruption or enforceability. In other words, an improved property rights that enhances growth might just be insufficiently effective to ensure improved welfare for everyone. This point illustrates how difficult it is to implement property rights in an impoverished society and emphasizes that property rights enforcement might just be insufficiently effective. In a nutshell, the upshot of the findings thus far is that although sufficient public investment in the security of property rights can overcome technological backwardness, improved property security does not always lead to a Pareto improvement: there are winners and losers. Naturally, an important policy-related question arises: can we find a tax-transfer policy—within the confines of frontier technology adoption—that leads to a Pareto improving movement towards more secure property rights? The genesis of this question is in the findings—an improvement in property security increases output and consumption of both agents and as result welfare of the rich agent increases and that of the poor agent decreases throughout. So, the question we ask is whether we can give poor some tax-rebate and impose that amount to the rich—to keep the budget balanced—so as to achieve a Pareto improving movement towards property security. To that end, we design a budget-balanced tax-linked-transfer policy where the poor is given a tax-rebate at the expense of the exact amount of additional tax-burden on the rich within property security regimes that support frontier technology adoption as an equilibrium. We find that for a less than thirty per cent tax rebate for the poor (and equivalent additional tax burden for the rich), a Pareto improving enhancement in property security is achieved where an improvement in property security never decreases the lifetime utility of the poor and strictly increases the lifetime utility of the rich agent throughout. Thus, we conclude that when sufficient public security—that produces efficient adoption of technologies—is insufficiently effective to improve welfare for all, a suitably designed budget-balanced tax-linked-transfer scheme can achieve the much-desired Pareto-improving movement towards property security. The paper is organized in the following manner. Section 2 describes the benchmark model of property insecurity and Sect. 3 presents a technological backwardness result due to Gonzalez (2005). In Sect. 4, we introduce public security of private property in this framework and analyze the equilibrium outcomes. In Sect. 5, we endogenize the property rights regime and present numerical results. Section 6 concludes the paper.",
56,1,Indian Economic Review,17 May 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41775-021-00111-y,"COVID-19: facts, figures, estimated relationships and analysis",June 2021,Ranjan Ray,Sanjesh Kumar,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The disease caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, referred to as COVID-19, is currently raging globally in both intensity and spread on a scale never seen before. As we write this article, much of Europe and the USA are going through the ‘second wave’ of infections and deaths. The only parallel that can be drawn of this global pandemic is with the Spanish Flu that was also declared a pandemic and took place over a century ago (February, 1918 to April, 1920). There are some interesting similarities and differences between the two pandemics. While the origin of COVID-19 can be traced to the Wuhan province in China which recorded the first case of COVID-19, little is known of where, or exactly when, the Spanish Flu started and no evidence to suggest that the Spanish Flu started in Spain. In case of both pandemics, Europe and North America experienced the major outbreaks recording the largest incidence of the disease globally. Since this paper was written in late 2020, the outbreak has spread to South America putting it on par with North America. This makes Europe and the whole of America as the regions reporting the largest incidence of COVID-19. Though this is speculative, both viruses are believed to have started from wild animals, not from the mixing of human and flu viruses. Both pandemics spread rapidly, with the end of World War 1 and the returning troops helping to spread Spanish Flu, while increased travel between and within countries, especially a high volume of international traffic due to a closely integrated global network, contributed to the rapid spread of COVID-19 crossing national boundaries. The Spanish Flu is considered to have been deadly with the estimates of deaths ranging from 20 to 50 million, while in the case of COVID-19, nearly 2.9 million fatalities have been reported to date. As per the latest figures that are publicly available, there has been 134 million cases of COVID-19 reported worldwide. The infection rate is, however, comparable between the two. The estimate of R0 that measures the average number of individuals that an infected person passes the infection to is within the range of 1.2–3.0 and 2.1–7.5 for community-based and confined settings, respectively, in case of the Spanish Flu,Footnote 1 while the corresponding range for COVID-19 is estimated to be 2.0–3.0.Footnote 2 A significant point of difference between the two is that while the Spanish Flu affected the young disproportionately more than the old, the reverse is the case for COVID-19. A point of similarity is that what started as a health shock soon escalated to a serious economic crisis in case of both. For example, Barro et al. (2020) estimated that the Spanish flu reduced real GDP per capita by around 6% in the typical country over the period 1918–21, a figure that is in line with the magnitude of downward revisions estimated by the IMF (2020b) and the World Bank (2020) in their latest economic updates of various countries. Before proceeding, we need to sound a note of caution with the COVID-19 numbers and the relationships reported in this paper. The results cannot be treated as definitive because the pandemic is still raging, and much uncertainty remains about its course. Also, the economic data pertaining to the economy considered here relates to late 2020, which is too contemporaneous to the pandemic and the lockdowns for us to be sure that these relationships will hold when we allow for a little lag between, on the one hand, the pandemic and the measures to contain it, and, on the other, the economic variables. Because of the rapid changes taking place concerning the situation on the ground pertaining to the pandemic, we wish to remind the reader that the bulk of this analysis was done in November/December, 2020. Some of the most recent numbers in the first quarter of 2021 have of course changed the picture since then, and there seems to be a new wave setting in India, Bangladesh and other Asian nations, but we hope that the broad relationships established in this paper are valid and will help design better policies. Despite these notes of caution, this paper gives critical, early insights into how these unprecedented relations between health and disease, and economic growth and poverty mitigation, are likely to play out in the future. The focus of this study is on COVID-19. The motivation of this exercise is to answer the following questions that cover both the health and economic shocks due to COVID-19, with special focus on their interaction. What are the economic effects of COVID-19 on global poverty numbers and on inequality between countries via the downward movement in growth rates? In the wake of the rapid spread of COVID-19, various countries have closed their borders at different times and declared lockdown limiting movement and economic activity within their borders in a bid to counter the disease. This has been quite controversial giving rise to a vigorous ‘lives vs livelihood’ debate.Footnote 3 In the light of this debate, what is the evidence on the effectiveness of lockdown in containing the incidence of the disease? Though there is no perfectly satisfactory answer to this question since we do not have any counterfactual evidence of what would have happened if there was no lockdown in the country, the graphs presented later point to some interesting differences between countries on the effectiveness of lockdowns. In this context, the heterogeneous picture between countries on the spread of COVID-19 over time, within and beyond the lockdown period, is an interesting feature of the results reported here. Do countries experiencing increasing cases of COVID-19 respond by making its lockdown more ‘stringent’? Do countries prolong their lockdown as infections increase, and what is the incremental effect of confirmed cases on the period of lockdown? Does lockdown have a negative economic impact on growth rates? If the answer is in the affirmative as the results presented later suggest, and given the poverty enhancing feature of decline in growth rates, it follows that extended lockdowns have contributed to the worsening of global poverty. What is the magnitude of the increase in global poverty and its regional breakdown due to COVID-19? If, as one observes globally and confirmed by this study, countries with high incidence of COVID-19 have experienced greater negative impact of their growth rates, what is the transmission mechanism from the health shock to the economic shock? This study also investigates the effectiveness of stimulus measures in limiting the economic damage by asking the question: did larger quantum of stimulus measured as proportion of real GDP lead to lower downward revision of the growth rate? An interesting feature of the results on the role of fiscal stimulus in spurring economic growth is the differential in the quantitative impact of fiscal stimulus between developing/emerging countries and developed countries, with their effectiveness in preventing economic downturn much stronger in developing/emerging economies. This is a result with considerable policy significance. Before concluding, the study widens the enquiry to identify some of the key determinants of the aggregate number of COVID-19 infections and COVID-19 deaths to date (30 September, 2020) based on cross-country regressions of these variables on a selection of country level characteristics as possible determinants. This part of the study has been a challenging exercise since for the most part the spread and intensity of COVID-19 has been quite idiosyncratic and economists have been puzzled by why some countries were more affected than the others and some were not affected at all. While the estimated regressions presented later do not provide fully satisfactory explanations and do not identify all the key determinants of infections and deaths, they do provide evidence of interesting relationships between some of the country characteristics and COVID-19 infections/deaths that could help to explain part of the apparently idiosyncratic behaviour of the virus. Confidence in the estimated relationships is based on the fact that the variation in the relevant country characteristics that we could find for inclusion explains nearly 70% of the cross-country variations in COVID-19 infections and deaths.",3

Not only has it helped to inspire the integration of modern empirical methods with the study of historical data but it has also had an influence on economics more generally.

Insights from this literature also have the potential to inform economic policy today by clarifying how policy interacts with the broader historical and institutional context and how the effects of these policies unfold over time. In thinking about this literature, I draw inspiration from one of the greats of economics, Robert Solow, who said the part of economics that is independent of history and social context is not only small, but dull (Solow, 1997); and of course none of us want our research to be boring. And so regardless of one’s area of study or field, bringing in some of that history and social context can really enrich the insights that come out of our research. In this paper, I focus on insights that have been developed over the past decade using illustrations from my research. There is a large literature on persistence and transformation in development.

56,2,Indian Economic Review,29 November 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41775-021-00125-6,Stability and efficiency in a model of production and pillage,December 2021,Rakesh Chaturvedi,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The institution of property rights gives meaning to ownership claims of an individual over property by legally preventing others from expropriating or pillaging it. The classical efficiency of exchange in a free market economy is predicated on legal enforcement of property rights. The first welfare theorem postulates voluntary exchange as a premise for allocative efficiency. The present paper is motivated by the question as to whether legal enforcement of property rights is a necessary prerequisite for efficiency. Consider an environment with a single indivisible productive asset, e.g., land. The society cannot legally enforce property rights over the asset. The asset may be owned by coalitions which may differ in terms of their power and their productivity with the asset. A state in the model describes which coalition owns the asset and how is the wealth produced from the asset distributed among all the players. Coalitions can move to costlessly pillage the asset from current owners if they are more powerful than the coalition of players who lose from such a move and the new owners are complicit in the pillage. Even in the absence of legal enforcement, is an efficient allocation of the asset enforceable in this model? This paper uses cooperative game analysis to give an affirmative answer for a wide class of production and pillage technologies. As Hirshleifer (1994) reminds us, the appropriative struggle for control of productive resources alongside the economic activity of production and exchange through market institutions provides the main storyline of human history. The acts of pillage can take many forms—war, theft, and rent seeking activities like lobbying for licenses and monopoly privileges as well as coercive taxes/transfers of democratic governments. Pillage, therefore, is as much a feature of advanced societies as it appears to be of the primitive societies. Models of weak property rights either formulate pillage as costly investment in rent seeking activities (Murphy et al., 1991; Muthoo, 2004; Hafer, 2006) or as costless (Piccione & Rubinstein, 2007; Jordan, 2006). This paper is in the latter tradition of modeling pillage as costless. Our model has the same lack of commitment that characterizes dynamic political settings and has been emphasized in the recent literature (Jordan, 2009; Acemoglu et al., 2012, etc.). A sufficiently powerful coalition may pillage the asset today from a less powerful coalition. However, members of the coalition cannot commit not to part ways and join another coalition tomorrow to appropriate the asset in hope of a better payoff. Enforceability thus depends on the distribution of power. All our results pertain to the class of strictly monotonic production technologies, implying that an efficient state is one where the grand coalition owns the asset and produces the greatest aggregate wealth. The first two propositions are preliminary and bring out the efficiency implications of stability theories defined with respect to a myopic notion of dominance. Proposition 1 characterizes the Core. While the Core supports the efficient allocation of property rights, it does limit the possibilities for wealth distribution in the society. At a wealth distribution in a Core state, every coalition whose total wealth allocation falls short of what it can produce on its own cannot be more powerful than its complementary coalition. Proposition 2, however, shows the set of all efficient states as a von Neumann Morgenstern (vNM) Stable Set. In the next three propositions that constitute the core of this paper, we show that a subset of efficient states is always supported as a Consistent Set of Chwe (1994) (a stability concept based on farsighted notion of dominance). Propositions 3 and 4 provide the results for a notion of power that views size and wealth as perfect substitutes for power of a coalition. Proposition 5 does the same for a notion of power that views them as imperfect substitutes. Efficiency is supported as stable, because it is possible to construct expectations that punish some player who is complicit in an act of pillage by stripping him of his ownership claims over the asset in the next move. The proofs of three results have a common structure. We give an algorithm that, for any given efficient state \(z^0\) in the candidate set and a deviation \(z^1\), constructs an expected path of length two \(z^2, z^3\) that makes \(z^0\) stable against the deviation \(z^1\). This paper thus highlights the expectation enforcement of property claims. This paper is closely related to and draws the modeling ingredients from the literature on pillage games. At the same time, it also belongs to the literature on non-consensual interactions. Piccione and Rubinstein (2007) develop a stylized model of coercive interactions that mirrors that of an exchange economy and show that efficiency can be supported as an equilibrium. They themselves remark that their model does not indicate the source of power and also prohibits coalition formation. The pillage game formulation identifies size and wealth as sources of power, and permits coalitional moves. Jordan (2006) invents single good pillage games as a setting for the study of power and studies the core and vNM stable sets of these games. An important result in Jordan (2006) is that the vNM stable set is immune to the Harsanyi critique, because it is equivalent to the farsighted core with respect to expectations that satisfy a rational expectations property. However, expectations are assumed to be Markovian. We show, in Example 2, that if expectations are constrained to be markovian, vNM stable set in our production pillage game is vulnerable to the Harsanyi critique. To address this, we use the Consistent Set of Chwe (1994) as our stability concept which allows expectations to be history-dependent. We show, in Propositions 3, 4, and 5, that efficiency is supported as a Consistent Set in our model. Jordan (2009) introduces production in his pillage game model and studies the problem of achieving efficiency. In addition to pillage opportunities, each player now has an individual production technology which she uses to produce consumption from the share of asset that she owns. Our model differs from Jordan (2009) on two counts. First, in terms of formulation, we enrich that the way production is incorporated by allowing for coalitional ownership and coalitional production. Second, in terms of the stability concept, Jordan uses the farsighted core while restricting the ‘farsightedness’ to players being able to look only one move ahead. We use the Consistent Set of Chwe (1994) as our stability concept which is based on fully farsighted (players are able to look arbitrary moves ahead) expectations. Nevertheless, our results are similar in spirit to him. In a different line of work, Bar-Gill and Persico (2016) formulate weak protection of property rights as a liability rule and point to the possibility of achieving efficiency in an exchange model with a single durable asset that is accorded a weak protection of property rights. Rowat (2009) adds a second good to single good pillage games, thus introducing opportunities for exchange. Consequently, gains from trade may also motivate pillage in their setting. Moreover, vNM stability may preclude efficiency.",

We assume that all employment in the public sector for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are on account of the job reservation policy.Footnote 1 The job reservation policy is termed as effective if the chances of representation in public sector jobs increase for those individuals who belong to the Scheduled Caste and the Scheduled Tribes category. Access, social inclusion and equality of opportunity are the three factors that policy makers take into account to judge the effectiveness of public policies that may influence an individual’s life chances (Roemer, 2004, d’Addio, 2007). Equality of opportunity exists when an individual’s life outcomes depend only on his effort and talent rather than on attributes that are beyond his control such as ethnicity and family background. A high degree of intergenerational mobility implies that the socio-economic status of parents has less influence on the child’s life chances and; therefore, it can be said that the child’s achievement as an adult is due to his/her effort and ability rather than inherited traits and socioeconomic status of the parents. In Indian society, certain social classes were traditionally deprived (Rao, 2008). In the year 1956, these classes were singled out and classified in Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (STs). SC/STs were provided with certain special benefits to redress the earlier deprivations they faced, reservation in government jobs being one such benefit. Works of literature that are in favour of the anti-discriminatory policy (see Prakash, 2020; Thorat, 2005; Deshpande, 2005; Basavaraju, 2009; Corak, 2013) concluded that it is necessary to remove constraints imposed by caste discrimination on the labour market to improve efficiency and economic growth. If equality of opportunity across social groups is a desirable objective, then targeted public policy and proper policing of implementation of such policies is needed to give equal opportunity to all individuals. A study by Blank (1985) using the 1979 Current Population Survey data for the United States has found that other things equal, government jobs were mostly preferred by the protected groups of veterans, non-whites and women in the States. They also found that the implementation of employment guidelines for the targeted groups is effective internally within the public sector than if it is enforced in the private sector. However, there also exist few studies that are against the implementation of anti-discriminatory policies (see Suresh Raj & Gokulraja, 2015; Rao, 2008; Rao, 2000; Borooah, 2010). They are of opinion that if reservation policy is continued indefinitely, it will promote caste consciousness among all castes and create a vested interest in remaining backward. A large section of the total workforce in India is self-employed. According to the NSSO survey 66th round (2009–2010) report,Footnote 2 around 51 percent of the total workforce in India were self-employed. On the other hand, the employment growth of India observed over the period 1960–1961 to 2010–2011 shows that before the adoption of the economic reform policies in 1991, the rate of growth in public sector employment was higher than that of private-sector employment; however, the growth rate in private sector employment exceeded that of the public sector since 1996 (see Fig. 1, Appendix 1). We are intrigued to examine whether a similar shift is observed across social groups between the father and son’s sector of employment. The paper is organised as follows: Sect. 2 discusses the existing literature and the literature gaps. Section 3 discusses the empirical methodology; in Sect. 4, we explain the dataset that has been used for the analysis; Sect. 5 presents the results and finally, Sect. 6 gives the conclusion.",

A high level of distress in balance sheet of firms has led to considerable increase in the risk faced by banks and other financial institutions. The inability of firms in servicing the outstanding debt has further resulted in considerably high level of non-performing assets in banking sector, a situation best described as the ‘twin balances sheet’ problem.Footnote 1 The co-existence of considerably high levels of financial distress in corporate as well as the banking system has created a suspicion about the stability of overall financial system (see Economic Survey, 2018–19). The issue has assumed central position in policy debates given the fact that the presence of financial distress in one sector of the economy (i.e., corporate sector) has the tendency and potential to transmit to other sectors of the economy in the absence of suitable policy responses. Financially distressed firms are considered to be a kind of liability for both governments and lenders. In short, financial distress refers to the situation in which a firm’s cash flows are not sufficient enough to meet their payment-related commitments, and hence, it is finding difficult to continue production with the current income. While the firms have the incentives to conceal financial distress in their balance sheet to access further funds to stay afloat, but the delay in detection or disclosure of distress imposes huge cost on the economy (see Altman, 1983; Altman and Hotchkiss, 2006). Hence, early detection of financial distress is critical in avoiding the related costs. It is now a common observation in the world economy that during prosperity phase, when economic activities are at their peak, many new firms enter into production process, and during recession and depression phase, they gradually exit from the market or become insolvent. During recessions, the aggregate output, inflows of foreign funds, and domestic demand decrease considerably. Consequently, revenue of firms declines making it difficult to service their outstanding debt and cover other running expenses. Some of the big recessions in the past provide strong evidence in favor of this argument (see Altman, 1983; Bhattacharjee et al., 2009). Even if the firms are not facing the relatively high debt, firms will face financial distress if they do not have sufficient financial resources available for shareholders and reinvestment. Hence, changes in domestic and international macroeconomic conditions directly or indirectly affect firm’s performance through demand and cash flows and force firms to align their production, pricing, and investment strategies accordingly. Most of the previous studies on financial distress have focused on the role of micro- or firm-specific characteristics such as accounting ratios to analyze the distress dynamics of firms (see, for example, Beaver, 1966, 1968; Atlman, 1968; Deakin, 1972; Taffler, 1982).Footnote 2 Findings of these studies have clearly established the role of firm-specific factors in distress prediction. However, the role of macroeconomic factors has received relatively less attention in the literature. Even though firms formulate their own business policies and operate from their own production facilities, but a large part of their business outcomes in terms of costs, sales, revenues, and future business prospects are determined by the overall macroeconomic conditions prevailing in the domestic and the world economy. Changes in macroeconomic policies lead to changes in key macro variables such as interest rate, inflation, gross output, exchange rate, and exports, and all these factors influence the overall demand and cash flows of firm’s overtime. Hence, a considerably large part of the accounting figures and ratios available in the firms’ balance sheet depends on the macroeconomic conditions prevailing or expected to prevail in the near future. Therefore, the role of macroeconomic environment in determining the onset and severity of financial distress cannot be ignored. Hence, it is very important to explore and uncover the critical factors that determine the onset and severity of financial distress from policy formulation and monitoring point of view. In this study, we attempt to investigate and identify some critical macroeconomic determinants of corporate financial distress using data from the Indian corporate sector. The issue is important for the Indian economy in the sense that the high level of financial distress in the Indian corporate sector is notwithstanding with the fact that Indian economy witnessed an impressive growth rate in the recent past. Existence of financial distress in one or more sectors when the overall economy is growing at a relatively faster rate is suggestive of some deeper trouble which will only deteriorate further in the absence of timely identification and policy intervention. The recent slowdown of economic activity and demand will tighten the cash flows, profit conditions, and the debt servicing ability of firms in the near future and will further aggravate the financial health of firms and lending institution (see Sehgal et al., 2021). A clear understanding of factors that determine the financial distress of firms in the Indian corporate sector will help in monitoring the transition of firms from a financially healthy unit to a distressed and loss making production unit. Against this background, this study attempts to make the following contributions to the existing literature. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts to investigate role of macroeconomic factors for the Indian corporate sector. In a most recent study, Sehgal et al. (2021) examined financial distress of firms but from a microeconomic or firms specific perspective. Second, previous studies have highlighted the role of firm-specific factors or accounting ratios in distress prediction (see Altman, 1968; Ohlson, 1980; Zmijewski, 1984; Shumway, 2001 and Hillegeist et al., 2004) and confirmed significant explanatory power of these factors. Hence, it makes sense to observe the same accounting variables at the aggregate level, as it is expected that they may also play critical role in explaining distress at macrolevel as well. Therefore, we attempt to design a parsimonious hybrid model by combining macroeconomic and aggregate corporate characteristics that determine financial distress. Although these variables are not truly macroeconomic variables but they do possess the ability to influence financial distress of firms, hence, at aggregate level, they behave as quasi-macrovariables (see Sehgal et al., 2021). Three, unlike a legal outcome-based definition of distress or firm’s failure, we use an accounting-based definitions involving three variables for classifying firms as healthy or distressed. Four, we use the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL)-based bounds testing approach to explore the short-run and long-run dynamics of financial distress. The bounds testing approach to cointegration has some major advantages over the highly popular Engle–Granger (1987) and Johansen and Juselius (1990) method used by some previous studies (see for example, Liu, 2004, 2009) on financial distress. Finally, given the fact that India is a relatively large emerging economy, we believe that the empirical findings of the study will offer a significant addition to the existing literature and will carry implication for other emerging market economies. Rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section briefly discusses findings of previous studies on financial distress. Section three presents model specification. Section four presents data, empirical methodology, and empirical findings, and the final section presents the conclusions and policy recommendations based on the findings of the study.",

56,2,Indian Economic Review,18 October 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41775-021-00120-x,Revisiting the relationship between farm mechanization and labour requirement in India,December 2021,Pallavi Rajkhowa,Zaneta Kubik,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"In developing countries, increasing population densities, urbanization, and rising incomes have increased the need for sustainable agriculture intensification to meet the growing consumer food demand. Crop intensification is either possible through the expansion of cultivable land or an increase in land productivity (Ruttan, 2002). Intensification of agricultural systems is usually associated with increased labour requirements per unit of cultivated area for land preparation, maintaining soil fertility, weeding, harvesting, processing, and maintaining draft animals (Binswanger & Pingali, 1984). However, in many developing and emerging economies, increasing employment opportunities in the non-farm sector have increased rural wages due to labour shortages during the peak agricultural season (Wang et al., 2016). The theory of induced innovation suggests that increasing wages and labour scarcities cause a substitution of labour for mechanical power or labour-saving technologies (Binswanger & Ruttan, 1978; Hayami & Ruttan, 1970). However, extensive use of labour-saving technologies may cause labour displacement and have serious equity concerns (Malabo Montpellier Panel, 2018; Pingali, 2007). This concern is often raised concerning the mechanisation of farms in low-income countries and it needs to be assessed empirically (Daum & Birner, 2020). Most of the earlier studies in the 1970s and 1980s on farm mechanization were static assessments based on cross-sectional data and they did not separate the effect of different types of mechanization (Benin, 2015; Mrema et al., 2008). However, the consequences of mechanization on employment can differ depending on the operation that is being mechanized and the level of agricultural productivity (Afridi et al., 2020). Mechanization can have a substitution effect by directly replacing labour in certain activities, or it could have a scale effect by increasing demand by improving overall productivity or expansion of cultivated land (Caunedo & Kala, 2021). Using experimental evidence, Caunedo and Kala (2021) show the impact of subsidizing access to rental services on labour requirement, while Afridi et al. (2020), use an instrumental variable approach to analyse how the use of tractors and power tillers during the tilling stage of land preparation affects labour use by genderFootnote 1 in the period 1999–2011. Furthermore, Caunedo and Kala (2021) estimate the intent to treat estimates where their main measure of mechanization identifies the impact of being given a farm machine rental subsidy voucher. They find that the rental subsidy programme declined female hired labour requirement as well as female and male family labour requirement on farm. Afridi et al. (2020) in their paper specifically analyse the effects of mechanization of the tilling phase of agriculture cultivation. They find that mechanization of tilling of land reduces overall female labour use on farm. This paper builds on this literature by using nationally representative panel data collected in 2004–2005 and 2011–2012. Here, we study the relationship between ownership of different types of farm machines—such as water-lifting equipment, draft power, tractors and threshers—and hired and family labour requirements applying household and individual fixed effect estimation approach. This paper also analyses the consequences of farm mechanisation on the expansion of farmland and intensification of input use to better understand the mechanisms of effect on farm labour requirement. Finally, the study examines the heterogeneous effects of farm mechanisation based on the size of cultivable land. During the period of the survey, rental services for farm machines were in their nascent phase in India and were available only in selected regions of the country. However, there was an expansion of ownership of farm machines due to the policies and programs introduced since 2000 which subsidized the purchase of farm equipment, and also the expansion of agricultural credit boosted the process of farm mechanization in India (Afridi et al., 2020). Thus, this paper studies the effects of ownership of different types of farm machines on labour requirements in Indian farms between 2004–2005 and 2011–2012. The novelty of this paper is that besides looking at the disaggregated effects on the implications of farm machines on family male labour, family female labour, and hired labour, it also analyses the effects on child labour and the heterogeneous effects of mechanization on labour requirement based on land size. Furthermore, we not only analyse the effects of mobile machinery such as tractors, but also stationary machineries such as electric and diesel pump sets and post-harvest machinery such as threshers. While mechanization, in general, is likely to have a differential effect on labour requirement—male vs female or family vs hired labour—so is the nature of the machine, the operation that is being mechanized and the level of farm mechanization. Thus, this paper aims to add to the existing literature on farm mechanization and its implications on labour market by analysing the effects of both mobile and stationary machines. The paper proceeds as follows: Sect. 2 discusses the conceptual framework, while Sect. 3 describes the material and methods used in the paper. Section 4 presents the descriptive and the econometrics results while Sect. 5 concludes.",7

Azad,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The positive association between education and economic development is one of the most established facts in the literature of economics. Aristotle and Adam Smith argued for public provision of education, as it builds the foundation for sustainable and striving development of the state (Alvey, 2001; Curren, 2000, 2010; Thomas, 2018; Weinstein, 2006). The fact that education contributes to human capital formation has led economists to conduct a more individual-level analysis investigating the positive correlation between education and individual earnings. The idea of ‘returns to education’ is one of such research outputs, and it possesses a crucial role in taking various decisions related to educational provision and pursuits. Mincer (1958, 1974, 1984) provided one of the initial frameworks of calculating returns to education by treating earnings as a function of education and experience, and this spurred a surge in research in the field. However, the calculation of returns to education using basic Mincerian function leads to an apparent case of spurious correlation as the earnings could depend on many other unobserved factors. As a remedy to this problem, economists started to work on augmented Mincer regression which enables the inclusion of other relevant factors that may affect the earnings of an individual along with education. This will also help in answering the fundamental question of why there exists heterogeneity in earnings among people with the same level of education. Out of various additional factors such as parental education, family background, quality of schools, gender, social groups, etc. (Afzal, 2011; Agrawal, 2011; Agrawal & Agrawal, 2017; Checchi, 2006; Layard & Psacharopoulos, 1974; Li, 2003; Singhari & Madheswaran, 2016) that affect schooling and earnings, ability or the skills of individuals are found to play a key role in determining the returns to education (Patrinos et al., 2006). This provides a scope for an extended discourse on ‘returns to skills’ beyond ‘returns to education’ per se. There are studies exclusively conducted to analyse the impact of skills on individual earnings, and those studies assert that labour markets greatly reward individual skills and abilities (Khatun & Saadat, 2021). A few of such studies have taken linguistic abilities in English (Azam et al., 2013; Di Paolo & Tansel, 2015) and computer skills (Borghans & Weel, 2004; Dolton & Makepeace, 2004; Krueger, 1993) as proxies for the skills. Hypothesising that skills do possess a significant role in individual wage earnings, the extant study estimates returns to skills by using proficiency in English and computer skills as proxies for individual skills and abilities. In the present-day workplace, written and oral communication skills and technical skills are of paramount importance. Individuals with commendable communication skills and digital competency are more likely to be hired by companies, and they are in a favourable position as they have an upper hand in negotiating remunerations and other benefits. Being a former British colony and a land of diverse languages, labour markets in India, especially in the formal sector, consider proficiency in English language as one of the most sought-after skills in the workplace (Azam et al., 2013; Chakraborty & Bakshi, 2016). Similarly, the advancement in information and technology has placed computer skills at the top of the modern-day skill sets (Agrawal & Agrawal, 2017; Basant & Rani, 2004). Thus, this study is an attempt to figure out how far skills and abilities of an individual, measured in terms of English language skills and computer skills, influence the earnings of an individual in India. Though it is a widely known fact that English proficiency and computer skills positively affect the returns to education in India, the exact degrees of these returns are unexplored owing to lack of appropriate data. This study makes use of nationally representative micro-level data provided by the India Human Development Survey (IHDS), 2011–2012, to calculate returns to education along with linguistic and computer skills. As the objective of the study is to measure earning differences, samples are restricted to individuals aged 15–65 years who are reported to be earning wage. The estimation of wage could suffer from sample selection bias if the wage functions are estimated using only the people who work and earn a wage. This might be a selective group, and it may give rise to the problem of sample selection bias. This selectivity problem is addressed by employing Heckman Sample Selection Model. This study will be helpful in taking proper decisions regarding the necessity of imparting linguistic and computer skills to individuals. The study becomes further relevant as there is no previous study that comprehensively discusses the returns to linguistic and technical skills along with returns to education. Though Azam et al. (2013) have studied the impact of English language skills on wage earnings in India, their research does not discuss the returns to computer skills. Similarly, as the authors themselves addressed, their research does not discuss cross-state differences. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Part 2 provides a review of related literature, and part 3 discusses the data and methodology of the study. Part 4 presents the results of the study, and part 5 summarises.",

Even as the aggregate economy has recovered in many countries since the pandemic, millions of individuals are still experiencing livelihood losses and are facing the risks of long-term unemployment. Long-term unemployment (LTU) has been a concern in developed countries since at least the eighties after the oil crisis and more recently, after the great recession of 2008 and the huge economic shock from the COVID-19 pandemic. Employment rates fell during these crises, and many of the displaced workers were pushed onto a trajectory of long periods of worklessness. Evidence shows prolonged unemployment has adverse consequences over and above the income and consumption losses from becoming unemployed. Long-term worklessness can have life-long scarring impacts on the future employment and earning prospects of individuals and lead to an overall deterioration in the wellbeing of communities. The likelihood of an unemployed individual finding a job decreases with time, translating into slower economic growth and structural unemployment. At an individual level, long-term unemployment can discourage individuals from seeking work and therefore induce them to drop out of the labour force altogether. In the long-term, it can lower reemployment wages as workers' reservation wages decline, erode human and social capital, and result in worse physical and mental health for individuals and their communities.Footnote 1Scars from entering a weak labour market and from unemployment spells when young are not transitory, and active labour policies are an important tool to prevent young workers from prolonged worklessness (Arulampalam et al., 2001; Machin & Manning, 1999; Von Wachter, 2020). Developing economies are characterised by large informal sectors, where workers lack social protection.Footnote 2 High levels of informality are associated with higher levels of poverty and inequality and slower progress toward achieving Sustainable Development Goals. The pandemic has exacerbated livelihood insecurity, especially among informal workers who were more likely to lose their jobs and to be pushed into poverty (Ohnsorge & Yu, 2021). Even as the aggregate economy has recovered in many countries since the pandemic, millions of informal workers are still experiencing livelihood losses and are facing the risks of long-term unemployment. India has a large informal workforce, typical of developing countries,Footnote 3 and it also suffered one of the deepest economic contractions from the pandemic (see Ray & Subramanian, 2020). High unemployment was a feature of the labour market even before the pandemic (Deshpande & Singh, 2021; Gupta & Kishore, 2021), and the pandemic caused sharp increases in unemployment, especially among young workers in low-income urban areas, which were at the frontlines of the pandemic (Bhalotia et al., 2020; Dhingra & Kondirolli, 2021, see Azim Premji University, 2021). While GDP has recovered to its pre-pandemic levels since 2021, unemployment has remained above its pre-pandemic levels, especially among young workers. At the time of writing this article (April 2022), unemployment was termed the ""biggest challenge"" for India in the light of the pandemic and the demographic transition to a higher share of working-age individuals in the population.Footnote 4 For demographic transitions to provide growth dividends, young workers need to be gainfully employed. But many developing economies, including India, face a jobs crisis, which has been made more severe by the pandemic. This article examines unemployment in India, providing some of the first estimates of long-term unemployment (LTU) from a panel of individuals before and during the pandemic. It shows that LTU makes up a substantial proportion of unemployment among the working-age population, particularly young workers who have fared even worse since the pandemic. It then examines the potential of different labour market recovery policies in delivering a transformative recovery from long-term worklessness in India and, more broadly, in developing economies where the majority of the workforce is young and informally employed.",2

57,2,Indian Economic Review,20 December 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41775-022-00149-6,The health benefits of air pollution control in India,December 2022,Maureen Cropper,Yongjoon Park,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"There are three methods used to measure ambient air pollution. The first is ground-based monitors: it is important to consider what is happening on the ground, both in terms of fine particles as well as other air pollutants. The Central Pollution Control Board operates over 800 monitoring stations across the country. But we are also interested in parts of the country where monitoring stations are sparsely distributed. Therefore, to analyze the impact of a policy or to build a counterfactual, it is necessary to model ambient air pollution. The second method uses estimates from atmospheric chemistry models. This requires data on emissions inventories and meteorological data. Examples of this approach include work by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Vienna, which has developed the GAINS model (IIASA, 2019). Work by Urban Emissions Info. in India (Guttikunda & Jawahar, 2014) also falls in this category. The third way to measure ambient air pollution is to use satellite data on aerosol optical depth and combine it with atmospheric chemistry modeling. This approach is used by the Global Burden of Disease study (Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network, 2021). Satellite-based modeling is also used by Sagnik Dey at IIT Delhi (Dey et al., 2020). Figure 1 (World Bank, 2022) shows estimated average annual PM2.5 ambient air pollution levels in 2018 from IIASA’s GAINS model. Areas in red and orange have higher levels of ambient annual PM2.5. For example, in the Indo-Gangetic plain, the annual average PM2.5 has been estimated to exceed 90 µg per cubic meter. The orange areas in Rajasthan and Gujarat and the eastern states correspond to annual averages of approximately 50–60 µg per cubic meter. The eastern part of India is also home to many power plants. The southern regions see much lower ambient concentrations, on the order of 30 µg per cubic meter. Source: World Bank (2022) 2018 Annual average PM2.5 based on GAINS model. Comparing this with the results of the Global Burden of Disease analysis for 2019 in Fig. 2 (Members of the India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative Air Pollution Collaborators, 2021), the broad picture is quite similar, although there are differences. The states depicted in red (Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana) were estimated to have population-weighted ambient concentrations greater than one hundred micrograms per cubic meter in 2019. In Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Punjab population-weighted PM 2.5 was estimated between 80 and 100 µg. PM2.5 levels were slightly lower in Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal. In Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, levels were estimated to be 30 µg or less.

Figure 2 also presents information on the percentage of households that burned solid fuels for cooking, in 2019, by state. In Odisha, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, and Assam over 70% of households burned solid fuels for cooking. Between 60 and 70% of households burned solid fuels in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. The percentage of households burning solid fuels was much lower in southern India. These patterns have important consequences for controlling ambient air pollution in the Indo-Gangetic Plain, where household air pollution is an important source of ambient air pollution.",
57,2,Indian Economic Review,23 December 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41775-022-00148-7,Inflation targeting and price behaviour: evidence from India,December 2022,Amlendu Dubey,Juhi Lohani,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"Consumer Price Index (CPI) is instrumental in measuring inflation and monitoring price stability by central banks worldwide. In May 2016, India officially adopted inflation targeting (IT) as its monetary policy framework. The inflation target in India is set at 4% CPI inflation with the upper tolerance limit of 6% and lower limit of 2%. The important features of IT policy include preannouncement of inflation targets in public, transparency and accountability of central banks to achieve the objective of low and stable inflation (Roger, 2010). As far as relationship between inflation targeting and price stability is concerned, a section of literature shows that inflation targeting reduces inflation (Creel & Hubert, 2015; Mishkin, 2000; Mishkin & Schmidt-Hebbel, 2007; Neumann & von Hagen, 2002; Vega & Winkelried, 2005; Wu, 2004) while others argue that there is no significant impact of IT on inflation (Angeriz & Arestis, 2007; Ball & Sheridan, 2005; Johnson, 2002; Lin & Ye, 2007). Svensson, (1997) shows that inflation targeting helps in reducing inflation variability while Bernanke et al., (1999) and Civcir & Akcaglayan, (2010) explain the role of IT regime in anchoring inflationary expectations. Similarly, King, (2002) shows that the inflation rates in the IT countries are less persistent and less volatile while Fititi & Hichri, (2014) show that IT is a relevant policy in achieving price stability. However, we could not find any study which specifically explores the implications of inflation targeting (IT) on frequency of price increases, decreases or overall price changes. The issue is important because high inflation increases price dispersion and distorts the allocative role of the price system (Nakamura et al., 2018). In economies with consistently high inflation, relative prices fluctuate, as prices move away frequently from their optimal value during the price adjustment process. Consequently, relative prices no longer give correct signals regarding relative cost of production leading to production inefficiency and significant welfare cost of inflation (Nakamura et al., 2018). Also, at low inflation rates, a significant portion of the price changes should consist of price decreases. As inflation increases, the frequency of price decreases should fall, and frequency of price increases should increase (Gagnon, 2009; Nakamura et al., 2018). In this paper, taking the case of CPI prices in India, we study the implications of inflation targeting on this aspect of price behaviour. We find that the implementation of inflation targeting has led to significant reduction in the frequency of price increases and increased the frequency of price decreases in India; however, it does not have any impact on the dispersion of price increases or price decreases. This result suggests that although inflation targeting has been successful in stabilizing the inflation rate, it has not been successful in reducing the price dispersion emanating from high inflation. This may be because of targeting a relatively wider inflation range of 2% to 6% in India as compared to other inflation targeting economies. During our period of analysis, another important policy of Demonetization was announced in 2016. Demonetization affected various sectors of the economy with varying degrees. Chodorow-Reich et al., (2020) show that the decline in cash led to the fall in the growth rate of economic activity by at least 2 percentage points during the quarter demonetization was implemented. Other studies have used descriptive statistics (Krishnan & Siegel, 2017; RBI, 2017) or time series methods (Aggarwal & Narayanan, 2021; Banerjee & Kala, 2017) to understand the impact of demonetization on the various sectors of Indian economy. Aggarwal and Narayanan (2021) studied the impact of demonetization on domestic agricultural trade and found the trade got displaced considerably following demonetization because of the collapse in prices. Currency squeeze due to demonetization along with seasonal factors pushed food inflation significantly down but did not show much impact on inflation excluding food and fuel (RBI, 2017). Our results show that demonetization seems to have significantly reduced the dispersion of price increases and increased the dispersion of price decreases. It also seems to have reduced the kurtosis in price decreases. Further, we find that increase in monthly inflation increased the frequency of price increases and decreased the frequency of price decreases which is as per the literature. Overall, we find that CPI Prices in India are highly flexible which is similar to the price behaviour found in other emerging market economies (Barros et al., 2009; Kovanen, 2006; Medina et al., 2007). Rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we discuss the individual CPI price behaviour in India. In Sect. 3, we discuss the methodology adopted and the results. Section 4 concludes the paper.",

These models identify the risk factors that are priced and thereby provide tools that guide the investor in making optimal investment decisions. However, majority of the asset pricing tests have not examined the risk factors that the investors consider before making investment decisions. The question of how investors perceive risk in financial market has received very little attention. This is mainly due to the fact that, for most of the assets, it is difficult to observe and measure investor’s reaction to various investment opportunities. In this context, Berk and Van Binsbergen (2016) and Barber et al. (2016) propose an approach to gauge investor response. They assert that mutual fund flows can be used as a measure of investor response to identification of profitable investment opportunities. Though both the studies use different empirical technique, the basic premise is that the investors, being rational, would evaluate the performance of alternative mutual fund schemes and reward the best performing fund with additional fund flows. They argue that by assessing the sensitivity of flows to alternative risk factors or performance measures, one can conjecture the asset pricing model used by the investors. Both studies suggest that the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) performs the best in predicting the fund flows to the actively managed US equity mutual funds. The finding that investors rely on the CAPM for evaluating mutual fund is intriguing mainly since the model is found to be inadequate in explaining the cross-sectional variation in returns. Subsequent studies that made attempts to resolve this puzzle also reached a similar conclusion. See for instance, Blocher and Molyboga (2017) and Agarwal et al. (2018) who examined the case for hedge fund investors and Dang et al. (2019) for investors in bond market. Interestingly, Ben-David et al. (2019), in contradiction to the previous studies, concludes that investors do not use any of the asset pricing models while investing in mutual funds. Rather, empirical evidence suggests that they have outsourced the risk adjustment to external entities like Morningstar (a fund rating agency). The empirical literature that sheds light on the risk factors from the perspective of an investor is in a nascent stage. Moreover, most of the studies in the area are confined to the US market. US financial market and mutual fund industry are well developed with very little informational inefficiency. The case of underdeveloped economy may not be so. The capital market in most of the underdeveloped market are thin and underdeveloped (Rojas-Suarez, 2013). Though these markets exhibit significant growth opportunities, high political and economic risks make emerging markets more volatile than mature markets (De Santis & İmrohoroğlu, 1997). The development of mutual funds in the emerging markets has provided the masses with a means to participate in capital markets and has contributed towards the strengthening of securities and derivatives markets in these economies (Ong & Sy, 2004). Emerging markets, therefore, essentially provide alternative testing grounds for drawing inference about the asset pricing model preferred by investors. Given this backdrop, we enquire whether Indian mutual fund investors exhibit a pattern similar to their counterparts in the developed markets when allocating funds to different mutual fund schemes. The Indian mutual fund market is quite old, history of which dates back to 1963. See Fig. 1 that traces the growth in asset under management (AUM) over the years. However, the industry is still in its growing stage, with ratio of AUM to GDP (measure of mutual fund penetration) around 13 per cent. This implies that the potential for growth in the mutual fund industry in India is very high. Moreover, the participation of individual investors in the Indian mutual fund industry has been showing an increasing trend. As of December 2019, more than half (around 54 per cent) of the industry assets are held by individual investors. It is largely the equity-oriented schemes that attract the individual investors. According to the July 2019 report on Industry Trends by Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), the equity-oriented schemes generate 88 per cent of their assets from individual investors. All these factors motivate us to consider the Indian market as an ideal choice for evaluating the asset pricing model preferred by individual investors in emerging market. Source: Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) Asset under Management (AUM). We examine the responsiveness of mutual fund flows to alternative performance measures to identify the risk factors that investors weigh in while making investment decision. We use six alternative performance measures. Three of these measures are based on widely used asset pricing models, i.e., Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) (Lintner, 1965; Sharpe, 1964), Three-Factor Model (TFM) (Fama & French, 1993) and Four-Factor Model (FFM) (Carhart, 1997). The remaining three are based on naïve models wherein the performance of mutual fund is measured based on raw return, excess return (i.e., return in excess of the risk-free return) and market adjusted return (i.e., returns in excess of the market return). We analyze the flow–performance sensitivity following the seminal works of Berk and Van Binsbergen (2016) and Barber et al. (2016). Further, considering the argument that uncertainty in developing countries acts as a tax on investment, thereby discouraging the investors from making even profitable investment (Rodrik, 1991). We extend our analysis to take into account the impact of uncertainty on the flow–performance relation. We enquire whether uncertainty influences investors’ evaluation of alternative mutual funds. Baker et al. (2016) Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) Index for India is used to capture uncertainty. Our study, based on a sample of 991 actively managed equity funds for the period that spans from the second quarter of 2006 to the last quarter of 2019, suggests that the mutual fund flows are highly sensitive to the performance measure obtained using naïve models. Both, Berk and Van Binsbergen (2016) approach and Barber et al. (2016) approach confirm that none of the factor models outperforms the naïve models in explaining flows. This implies that the mutual fund investors do not tend to adjust for any of the risk factors while evaluation alternative investment options and simply chase funds that generate high excess returns or market adjusted returns. In other words, investors do not account for the return generated by known risk factors while evaluating the performance of the funds. Our findings in this regard are contrary to that of earlier studies that suggest that investors use CAPM while evaluating alternative investment options and thus adjust for only market factor. Our enquiry into the influence of uncertainty on investors’ evaluation of alternative mutual funds suggests that uncertainty and mutual fund flows are negatively related. Surprisingly we find no significant impact of uncertainty on the flow–performance sensitivity. Our study contributes to the existing literature in multiple ways. First, our study adds to the literature that uses flow–performance sensitivity to infer the asset pricing model or the risk factors that investors consider while making investment decisions. We extend the existing literature by examining the case of an emerging economy and present evidence contrary to those observed in developed markets. While previous studies suggest that mutual fund investors make use of CAPM for evaluating the performance of alternative funds, we find that naïve models outperform the factor models in explaining the fund flows. Second, we examine the impact of uncertainty on the flow–performance relation and thereby take the literature forward. While there are numerous theoretical and experimental studies that suggest that investors are less willing to participate in financial market when uncertainty increases (see for instance Cao et al., 2005 and Bossaerts et al., 2010), empirical evidence for the same is rather limited. In this regard, Antoniou et al. (2015) and Li et al. (2017), using mutual fund flows, provide empirical evidence for ambiguity aversion among mutual fund investors. Adding to the existing literature, we examine whether investors use stringent measures for evaluating alternative mutual funds when faced with higher levels of uncertainty. Though, consistent with the existing literature, we document evidence for ambiguity aversion among mutual fund investors, we find that uncertainty does not induce investors to take into account risk factors while making investment decisions. Last, we also add to the literature that seeks to identify the behavior of mutual fund investors. Empirical literature provides evidence that suggests majority of mutual fund investors are sophisticated and make informed decisions (see for instance Zheng, 1999; Gharghori et al., 2007; Chalmers et al., 2013 and Dyakov & Verbeek, 2019 among others). However, our results suggest that mutual fund investors fail to make informed investment decisions. The findings corroborate those of Capon et al. (1996), Barber et al. (2005), Cooper et al. (2005) and Hillenbrand and Schmelzer (2017) among others, who argue that mutual fund investors are naïve and subject to various behavioral biases. The paper is organized as follows. Sect. 2 discusses the methodology and database we have used for our empirical analyses. Sect. 3 devotes on the discussion of our findings. Results of some further robustness checks are discussed in Sect. 4, and Sect. 5 concludes.",

Awan,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The disruption in the availability of electricity is impacting the Pakistan economy severely, especially its industrial sector. The estimates of Siddiqui et al., (2011) reveal that power outages have resulted in total industrial output losses ranging from 12 to 37% in Punjab. This failure in electricity provision has cost the industrial sector Rs. 210 billion or more than 2% of GDP annually (Pasha, 2010). Further, the decline in industrial output led to losses in exports earnings of over US$ 1 billion and 400,000 displacements of potential workers (Institute of Public Policy, 2009). It has also majorly affected small-scale industries relative to the large-scale manufacturing industries that have their own alternative arrangements for electricity generation. The failure of adequate electricity provision in Pakistan has been worsening over time, and consequently, many industries are closing down and/or relocating to other countries, such as Bangladesh.Footnote 1 There are several reasons for the transition from uninterrupted availability of electricity to its interrupted availability or lack of availability. First, electricity production largely depends upon thermal resources, which are very expensive and entail huge costs to the national exchequer. Second, it is hugely dependent on furnace oil, whereby high and volatile oil prices make it difficult for the government to purchase it on demand. The price of furnace oil is continually rising very sharply and presently costs almost Rs. 70,000 per tonne. The cost of producing electricity from furnace oil is about Rs. 20 per Kwh, which is only the fuel cost, not the fixed cost and does not therefore take transmission losses into account. Third, it leads to circular debt, or the government’s inability to pay the fuel cost to the generating companies because the consumers of electricity are paying less for every unit but the suppliers have to pay higher prices, and the gap thus created has to be bridged by subsidies. Finally, the increase in demand for energy is more expansionary than supply, which poses a real challenge for the Government in terms of controlling the energy crisis for a longer period. In order to protect the consumer, the Government of Pakistan intervenes in the market to provide subsidised electricity under the Tariff Differential Subsidies (TDS) scheme. For instance, in 2011, the Government provided Rs. 285 billion worth of subsidies to the power sector, out of which Rs. 750 million was spent on a daily basis. On an average, the Government pays at least Rs. 3 for every Kwh used by domestic consumers in order to bridge the gap between the billed rate and the cost of production of electricity. While 45% of the country’s electricity is consumed by the residential users, who pay an average rate of Rs.7 per Kwh, 75% of the residential users use less than 300 units of electricity, which is charged at the rate of Rs. 5.5 per Kwh. Although electricity generation costs more than Rs. 9 per Kwh, the differential is covered under the TDS (see Baig, 2012). The mechanism to protect the consumer through the TDS has been criticised because it ostensibly does not reach the poor segment of society for whom it was originally designed and instead allows the rich segment of society to derive the maximum benefit from the TDS. The primary question investigated in this study is the degree of usefulness of the TDS for the poor segment of the society. In the process, this study has developed and analysed scenarios, such as payment of the TDS to poor households through the direct transfer mechanism. The study examines the impact of direct transfers on circular debt, fiscal deficit, and household welfare as compared to the baseline results. In order to quantify these impacts, we use the Social Accounting Matrix (SAM), 2010–11, and the Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) Model developed by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IPFPRI). This analysis is in line with the recommendations of New Growth Framework of Pakistan and Vision 2025. It will help policymakers devise a long-term and sustainable solution to the problem of negative social and economic impacts. The erstwhile literature on the subject, including Siddiqui et. al. (2011); Jahan (2014); Bacon (2019); Pasha and Saleem (2013); and Trimble et. al. (2011), discusses the factors contributing to the electricity crisis, various constraints, circular debt issues, and electricity linkages with economic growth, among others. However, the TDS and its impact on the poor segment of the society has not been explored empirically earlier. This study also highlights that most of the time, TDS benefits the rich segment rather than the poor segment of society. Therefore, it suggests the conceptualisation and implementation of a targeted programme/sFootnote 2 aimed at benefiting the poor segment of the society. The rest of this paper has been organised as follows: Sect. 2 discusses the frontline issues in the electricity sector in Pakistan. Section 3 presents the literature review, while Sect. 4 delineates the methodology and data pertaining to the study. Section 5 lists the empirical results. Section 6 examines the welfare impact of the study. Finally, Sect. 7 provides the concluding remarks for the study.",
57,2,Indian Economic Review,11 January 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41775-022-00151-y,Impact of foreign ownership on firm’s performance: a study of Indian manufacturing industry,December 2022,Deepika Srivastava,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"It is generally believed that foreign firms perform better than domestic firms in terms of productivity Helpman et al. (2004). Further, foreign firms tend to have higher export intensity. This is because combining the technological know-how, managerial expertise and competitive advantage of foreign direct investors, foreign-invested firms would enjoy enhanced operating performance. Thus, foreign firms could have direct as well as indirect impacts on the performance of the firms in the host country. However, this does not by itself mean that foreign acquisition will lead to an improvement in productivity. There is a possibility of cherry picking by foreign investors, that is they may have invested in the relatively more productive firms. This study therefore attempts to contribute to the growing literature regarding the post acquisition impacts of foreign firms on certain indicators such as productivity and export intensity especially in the case of Indian manufacturing sector. In the recent years manufacturing has been the major focus for the government of India. The share of the manufacturing sector in India’s GDP has shown a steady increase especially since 2006. Gross Value Added (GVA), at constant prices (2011–2), for the manufacturing sector registered a growth of 6.9% in the year 2018–19 as compared to a growth of 5.9% in the year 2017–18Footnote 1. Within manufacturing, growth has often been highest in sectors that are relatively capital intensive, such as automobiles, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. It is clear from Table 10 that the IIP for the stated period is comparatively higher in case of nic group, 10, 11,13, 20,21,22, 24 and 28. Thus, we can say that manufacture of textiles, chemical and chemical products and pharmaceuticals sectors have registered a high IIP during April to Jan 2018. Among these chemical and pharmaceutical sectors are one of the most capital as well as knowledge intensive industries. With opening up of trade the manufacturing sector has experienced an increasing share of both import and export. The share of manufacturing in total merchandise exports of India has been increasing, though at a slower rate. Its share declined substantially over the period 2000–01 to 2007–08 from above 76–59%. The share went up marginally thereafter,and was about 61.5%  in 2010–11Footnote 2. Recently, in 2018 India’s manufactured exports share in total merchandise exports is around 74.8of India’s Manufactured exports share in total merchandise exports is given in Table 1. If we look at sector-wise Foreign Direct investment(FDI) flows we can see from Table 11 of Appendix-II that, communication services and manufacturing industry attract the largest amount of FDI. Other sectors such as financial services and computer services have gained momentum in attracting FDI over the years. FDI inflows into the manufacturing sector reached about 35% of total FDIFootnote 3. However, within manufacturing, Drugs and pharmaceuticals and Chemicals(other than fertiliser) account for the largest share of the cumulative FDI flows at US $218 million and US $1817 million for the period April 2000 to December 2018Footnote 4. Automobiles sector which has attracted many new entrants is the next important manufacturing industry in terms of the FDI inflows followed by metallurgical industries. In case of electrical equipment and industrial machinery share of FDI is very low. From the above discussion we can say that manufacturing sector is an important sector for trade and FDI. Since there has been an increase in share of foreign investment in manufacturing sector we can expect that there may be direct benefits of FDI in productivity and efficiency of firms in manufacturing sector. Thus, against this background we attempt to assess whether change in ownership from domestic to foreign has a positive impact on the performance of the firm. There have been theoretical as well as empirical works which suggest that foreign ownership has a positive and significant impact on the performance of firms. Many studies such as Harris and Robinson (2003), Harris (2009) and Karpaty (2004) have shown that acquisition of a domestic firm by a foreign firm increases the productivity of the acquired firm. Arnold and Javorcik (2009) however moved a step further to see if the change in ownership has led to an increase in productivity of the acquired firm.Studies similar to Arnold and Javorcik (2009) have been done in the case of India. Petkova (2008) studied the impact of FDI on growth performance of firms for Indian manufacturing industries.She found a significant positive effect of FDI on growth performance of firms. Goldar and Sharma (2015) have used a similar methodology as that of Arnold and Javorcik (2009) and found a significant effect of FDI on growth and export performance. However, the paper suggests that there is some evidence, though not strong, that FDI tends to raise profitability of Indian manufacturing firms after two or three years.",
57,2,Indian Economic Review,28 October 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41775-022-00139-8,Estimation of VAT compliance costs of unincorporated enterprises in India: unit-level analysis,December 2022,Sacchidananda Mukherjee,Shivani Badola,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"Tax is the most important source of government’s revenue and it could be raised by expanding the tax base, improving tax efficiency and encouraging tax compliance by keeping tax rates at their levels. Improving participation in any tax regime by bringing more eligible taxpayers under the tax net is important as it expands the tax base and improves tax environment/morale (Hofmann et al., 2008). However, participation in any tax regime depends on several factors and cost of tax compliance is one of them. Compliance costs of taxes often referred as “hidden costs of taxation” (Sandford, 1973) and emerged as one of the important aspects of tax policy research since early 1970s. Literature on tax compliance costs in general and VAT/Sales tax compliance costs in particular is sparse in India. Hence, objective of the present paper is to estimate VAT/Sales tax compliance costs of unincorporated enterprises based on National Sample Survey Office (NSSO)’s 73rd round survey conducted during July 2015 to June 2016. Unincorporated enterprises comprise of proprietary enterprises, partnership firms, self-help groups, trusts, and others and not registered under the Companies Act. Together, proprietary enterprises and partnership firms constitute 90.96 per cent of registered taxpayers’ base in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime and contribute 20.7 per cent of GST collection in India (GST Council, 2020). Though, India has embraced GST since 1 July 2017, an assessment of compliance costs of the VAT/Sales tax regime could be useful, as VAT and GST differ only in coverage and some aspects of compliance burden in the GST regime have only increased (e.g., frequency of tax returns in a financial year) (Rao & Mukherjee, 2019). Since comparable survey for the GST regime is awaited, we have used NSSO’s 73rd round survey to develop methodology for estimation of compliance costs. Unincorporated enterprises often bypass formal regulations in general and taxation in particular (Mukherjee & Rao, 2019). Therefore, it is important to understand the burden of compliance costs of unincorporated enterprises to suggest possible measures to reduce the compliance burden. In literature, it is often argued that smaller enterprises bear the disproportionate cost of complying with the tax regime which discourages them to take part in the tax system (Chittenden et al., 2003). A strand of literature assesses the regressiveness of compliance costs of taxes for developed nations, e.g., the United Kingdom (UK) (Hansford et al., 2003), Australia (Evans et al., 2013; Lignier & Evans, 2012; Pope, 1995), and the United States of America (Slemrod & Venkatesh, 2002). Similarly, with specific to compliance costs of VAT, Chittenden et al. (2003) for U.K., Eichfelder and Hechtner (2018) for Belgium and Plamondon and Zussman (1998) for Canada confirm regressivity. For developing countries and economies in transition (such as South Africa, Vietnam, Ukraine, Yemen, Peru, Nepal, Kenya, and Uzbekistan, etc.), the World Bank Group conducts large-scale semi-structured questionnaire surveys during 2006–2011 to measure the compliance costs associated with the VAT, income tax and payroll tax. The study finds extremely regressive patterns of compliance costs (including VAT as well) in developing and transition countries (Dom et al., 2022). Based on surveys conducted by the World Bank Group in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, Coolidge (2012) finds that compliance cost of small businesses is up to 15 per cent or more of turnover. Evans et al. (2013) find that gross compliance costs of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) rises in Australia by 150 per cent during 1995 to 2012 (in constant dollar term). The study argues that the introduction of GST in Australia may be one of the reasons for rise in compliance costs of SMEs (Evans et al., 2013). Similarly, Evans et al. (2014) find that GST or VAT continues to be the cause of the highest tax compliance costs in Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, and South Africa. However, there is no estimation of VAT compliance cost in India, at least in our knowledge.Footnote 1 To fill the gap in the literature, the present paper attempts to measure VAT/Sales tax compliance costs of unincorporated enterprises. Earlier studies on tax compliance costs in India have relied on primary survey and not free from limitation of low response rate. Therefore, to overcome the challenges of resource constraints to conduct primary survey and low response rate, the present study estimates VAT/Sales tax compliance costs based on secondary data, i.e., NSSO’s 73rd round survey of unincorporated enterprises. In Sect. 2 we review the existing literature to identify components and factors associated with tax compliance costs. In Sect. 3 we describe the methodology, data sources, and data cleaning process. We present our results in Sect. 4 and draw our conclusions in Sect. 5.",

57,2,Indian Economic Review,06 December 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41775-022-00143-y,Effects of diversification on firm performance: an analysis of Indian firms,December 2022,Zinnia Mitra Bose,Indrani Chakraborty,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"Product diversification strategies are undertaken by firms to increase firm expansion and to create new options for value. Diversification has both benefits and costs. Firms can benefit from diversification through the creation of internal capital markets (Williamson, 1975), higher debt capacity (Lewellen, 1971; Shleifer & Vishny, 1992) and economies of scope (Teece, 1982). On the other hand, the costs of diversification emerge mainly from agency problem. Managers may diversify mainly due to three reasons, viz., to protect their human capital (Amihud & Lev, 1981), to increase their private benefits (Jensen, 1986; Morck et. al., 1990) and to entrench themselves (Shleifer & Vishny, 1989). However, the benefits of diversification decline after reaching an optimal or threshold level, suggesting an ‘inverted-U’ relationship between performance and diversification (Markides, 1992; Pierce and Aguinis, 2013; Rumelt, 1974 among others). With increasing diversification, managerial, structural, and organizational complexity increases, leading to greater coordination and integration costs and creates pressures for top management resources (Grant et al., 1988) and the ability of firms’ in responding to major external changes declines (Donaldson, 2000; Greenwood and Hinnings, 1996; Hoskisson & Hitt, 1994). Hence, the costs of diversification increase with the scope of operations, which in turn reduce the benefits of further diversification. These arguments suggest that moderate diversification is beneficial for firms, whereas broader diversification may be harmful for performance (Dess et al., 1995; Hoskisson & Hitt, 1994; Montgomery & Wernerfelt, 1988; Palich et al., 2000; Ramanujan and Varadarajan, 1989). Some other studies argue that small diversification into lines of related business, related to a firm’s existing ones, will lead to benefits which will offset the costs. However, diversifying into less related lines of business, the marginal costs will increase more than marginal benefits. In this case, the effects of diversification on performance would become negative after reaching an optimal level (Markides, 1995a). The impact of diversification on a firm’s performance has been a subject of extensive research and analysis. A large volume of recent literature shows that diversification strategies are value-destroying (Lang & Stulz, 1994; Berger & Ofek, 1995, 1996; Comment & Jarrell, 1995; John & Ofek, 1995; Servaes, 1996; Denis et. al., 1997). These studies suggest that the costs of diversification outweigh the benefits. However, a recent study by Villalonga (2004) shows the existence of diversification premium and she argues for value creating role of diversification strategies. Hence, whether the diversification strategies are value-destroying or value-creating is basically an empirical question. Studies on diversification strategies are based mainly on developed country data, reflecting their corporate behaviour and capital market environment (Nayyar, 1992; Rajan et. al., 2000; Wiersema & Bowen, 2008). Very little is known about diversification and its value outside the developed countries especially in emerging markets, where the capital markets are less developed. In this study, we want to examine how diversification strategies affect firm performance in India. One influential study in the context of India was Khanna and Palepu (2000) which show that performance improved in diversified business group firms in India. It was argued that the main reason behind it was the imperfections in the external capital, product and labour markets in India, which was referred to as “institutional voids”. Internal markets are created due to diversification which are quite often more effective than external markets which are inefficient, in developing economies (Ghemawat and Khanna, 1998; Khanna & Palepu, 1997; Williamson, 1985). Due to this, in developing economies, firms enjoy economies of scope and scale which are generally provided by efficient external institutions in developed economies. As efficient external institutions are often absent in developing economies, such internalization may be profitable. However, diversified firms do not gain always in developed economies as the institutions are more developed and efficient there. The institutional context has changed in India since the economic reforms in 1991. Market imperfections are no longer prevailing. As stated earlier, with the institutional development the benefits of diversification disappear and hence, diversification fails to improve performance in perfect markets (Kock & Guillen, 2001). Therefore, the effects of diversification depend on the degree of institutional development of a country. Hence, the outcome of diversification is a country-specific phenomenon, as the influence of the institutional environment matters for diversification. It is expected that the benefits from diversification would be higher in less institutionally developed economies compared to a more institutionally developed economies. Matsusaka (1993) shows that in the United States the effects of diversification on performance started to become negative between the 1960s and the 1980s as financial institutions developed. Following this line of arguments, one can predict that the effects of diversification on performance of firms in India would become negative or insignificant during the post-liberalization period. Our study tries to throw more lights on this issue, by analyzing empirically Indian data for the period 2012 to 2018. This study attempts to look at the impact of diversification on performance for 1759 listed firms spread across all sectors of the economy whose data are available for the study period. Using the dynamic panel estimation method and two-stage least squares (2SLS) method, this study attempts to also understand whether the size and age of the firm and group affiliation affect the results obtained. Although the study is primarily based on quantitative analysis, to understand the true causal relationship between diversification and performance, we have supplemented it with inputs from Annual Reports of major companies. The firm’s value may involve intangible or long-term benefits which are not evident in quantitative parameters. While we analyse the causal relationship based on the underlying theories discussed in the next section, we also try to understand whether the outcome is a result of other factors like the ability to adapt to technological disruption, governmental policies and competition which may call for a fresh understanding of the available empirical evidence. This study has several contributions to the literature. First, most researchers use the excess value method to determine the impact of diversification premium or discount. Our study differ from these earlier literature as we use firm performance measures, viz. Tobin’s q and ROA, to determine the impact of diversification. Second, our study is based on the period 2012–2018 which is a very recent period. The existing studies on India are based on samples which are rather outdated. This is one important contribution of this study. Third, our study establishes the proposition that the diversification-performance relationship changes over time. External institutional factors have a major role in shaping this relationship. Fourth, our study is more nuanced than many existing studies, by showing that the effects of diversification have been different for different measures. Fifth, this study uses novel techniques like system dynamic panel data method and 2SLS, which take care of endogeneity issues. These methods have been used in a few studies on India, viz., Bhatia and Thakur (2018). Finally, while most studies in the Indian context focus on manufacturing sector only, our study covers both manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors. This recognises that fact that many traditional manufacturing groups have diversified into sunrise sectors like information technology, financial services and others in the last two decades. Remaining portion of this study is organized as follows: Sect. 1.1 discusses the literature review, Sect. 2 deals with the methodological discussion, Sect. 3 presents the data and variables, Sect. 4 reports the empirical analysis and Sect. 5 reports the robustness check. Finally, we conclude in Sect. 6. The existing literature is full of contradictory arguments which suggest that diversification might have both value-creating and value-destroying effects (Benito et. al., 2012). Market power advantages are much more in diversified firms than non-diversified firms (Scherer, 1980). It has been further argued that, due to the efficiencies in internal markets, diversified firms enjoy the advantage of easier access to external financing, and they enjoy the benefits of transferring capital across businesses (Meyer et. al., 1992). These arguments imply that diversification is positively related to performance. Some recent studies show that diversified firms enjoy some premium compared to non-diversified firms (Campa & Kedia, 2002; Villalonga, 2004). On the other hand, some have argued that diversification is value-destroying and showed evidence which indicates that diversified firms show a discount compared to non-diversified firms (Berger & Ofek, 1995; Rajan et. al., 2000). One of these arguments from agency theory suggests that through diversification, managers try to pursue their own interests ignoring that of the shareholders (Jensen, 1986). Diversification helps to reduce the personal risk of the managers (Amihud & Lev, 1981), and helps to increase their compensation and power (Jensen & Murphy, 1990). Moreover, in diversified firms, managers would be interested to invest the free cash flow in an inefficient manner (Jensen, 1986). According to the agency theory, the separation between ownership and control resulting in conflicting interests between owners and managers reduce the value of the firm. This problem can be mitigated by aligning the manager’s compensation to shareholder wealth. (Denis et al., 1999). Agency Theory has been challenged by Stewardship theory (Donaldson & Davis, 1991), which presumes that managers are inherently committed to seeking enhanced company profit and growth prospects by reducing dependence on static or declining markets through diversification strategy. In explaining the relationship between diversification and firm performance, there are arguments from transaction cost literature too. Williamson (1975, 1985) argued that managing different business units in a diversified firm helps to generate economies of scope. But the costs created by such co-ordinations would outweigh the benefits generated after some time. Therefore, the resulting transaction costs would lead a reduction in profits of the company. The transaction cost theory also suggests that management and administration costs will also increase if the firm is located at a distant place from its core business segment, because then the functions of the firms will be more dissimilar (Hitt et. al., 1997). Theoretical background explaining that diversification as a strategy has been adopted due to several other theories too viz. Resource-Based Theory, Market Power Theory and, the Institution Based View. Resource-Based theory suggests that firms benefit from diversification due to utilization of excess capacity in joint product facilities, managerial expertise, and financial synergies of reallocating scarce capital internally to the most profitable projects. Resource-Based Theory has drawn its theoretical base from Edith Penrose’s (1959) seminal work “The Theory of the Growth of the Firm” where she asserts that rather than market factors, it is the firm resources that limit the potential growth and the choice of businesses for a firm. Firms have intangible assets like distribution networks, patents, technology. These resources and skills are the sources of its capability, and these resources can find multiple uses (Caves, 1984; Teece, 1982). Due to the difficulty in imitating or acquiring these resources which are unique to the firm, the differences in resources and capabilities of the firm are persistent (Barney, 1986a, 1991). The works of Rumelt (1982), Hoskisson (1987), and Wernerfelt (1984) emphasize the importance of resources for diversification. According to the Market Power theory, when a firm operates in many markets, it may be able to hold a strong position in a particular market not only due to its efforts in that market but also due to its dominant position in other markets. (Montgomery, 1985) A diversified conglomerate can exercise power by cross-subsidization where profits from one market are used to support predatory pricing in another market. They can also dominate the market using reciprocal buying and selling and other non-competitive practices that increase industry concentration (Berry, 1974). However, Gribbin (1976) pointed out that to exercise market power across markets, a firm must have a strong position in its core market. The Institution-Based View (IBV) argues that the institutional contexts impact the profitability of the firm (Jennings et al, 2013; Khanna & Palepu, 1997). In developed economies, due to the existence of sophisticated institutions and efficient markets for goods, labor and capital, firms do not benefit by pursuing strategic actions like diversification that seek to replace the functions of institutions. Managers must oversee a wide variety of businesses that negatively impact coordination, control, and their information-processing abilities (Wan & Hoskisson, 2003). However, in economies where the institutional development is inadequate, firms provide access to foreign capital and technology and to internal capital markets while attempting to fill the institutional vacuums. (Khanna & Palepu, 1997; Lee et al, 2008). However, the benefits of diversification decline when the institutional environment develops. More recent research studying the impact of diversification on firm performance has varied outcomes. While Lien and Li, (2013) and Berg, (2016) show a positive relationship between diversification and firm performance, Chen and Yu, (2012); Purkayastha, (2013), Phung and Mishra, (2016) show a negative relation. Benito -Osario et al., (2012) and Santarelli and Tran (2016) find an inverted U shape implying that there is an optimal level of diversification, beyond which it may be counter-productive. Lahiri and Purkayastha, (2017), Phung, (2015) showed that the effect of diversification varies among industries. Some recent literature also shows that diversification decisions differ between family-controlled business groups and stand-alone firms (Gomez-Mejia et. al., 2010; Chung, 2013). Group-affiliated firms are distinguished from stand-alone firms in two major ways. First, group-affiliated firms consist of groups of companies that are connected through a network of legal, financial, and transactional relationships. According to Gopalan et al. (2007), Indian business groups are characterized by a substantial amount of intra-group financing. Comparing group-affiliated firms with stand-alone firms, Khanna and Palepu (2000) argue that the use of internal market mechanisms reduces transaction costs among group-affiliated firms, in the absence of well-developed and efficient factor markets. They conclude that in highly diversified and large business groups in India, group-affiliation affects firm performance positively. Second, in group-affiliated firms family involvement in firm management prevails more than is the case in stand-alone firms (Denis & Denis, 1994; Holderness & Sheehan, 1988). Many family members reach the leadership positions in a firm, which sets the direction of the firm (Jones, Makri, Gomez-Mejia, 2008). These family leaders possess organizational attachment. Family management in group-affiliated firms often encompasses a variety of non-financial aspects of the business that meet the family’s emotional needs. These non-financial aspects create socio-emotional wealth (SEW) that leads to challenges for the family since the family managers attach more importance for growth opportunities, specifically diversification (Gomez-Mejia, Makri et. al., 2007). Gomez-Mejia et al. (2010) hypothesized that for group-affiliated firms the primary reference point is the loss of socio-emotional wealth. SEW is defined as the ability to exercise authority, the enjoyment of personal control, “clan membership”, a sense of belonging, affection, intimacy as well as an active role in the family dynasty. In other words, family firms would not like to diversify to dilute concentrated business risk as it may reduce the family’s role to exercise managerial control. Gomez-Mejia et al. (2010) further argued that diversification requires raising additional capital by taking on more debt or stocks and higher external funding increase the risk of financial distress and loss of family control, and hence family firms are less willing to diversify. Moreover, diversification implies that more outside managers will be hired which may increase information asymmetries and increase the conflicts regarding goals of the firm and erode family SEW. Also, diversification requires expertise and resources from external members to the firm and family firms are less likely to incorporate external members’ perspectives and opinion in their decision making, because it would lead to loss of control (Schulz et. al., 2001, 2003b). However, these observations from family firms in developed economies are not applicable in the context of an emerging economy like India. The controlling owner’s family in an emerging economy is likely to diversify into multiple industrial domains and retain control over affiliate firms through a pyramidal ownership structure and family management (Almeida & Wolfenzon, 2006; Chung, 2013; La Porta et al., 1999). The extant literature has noted that in emerging economies, imperfect markets and institutional voids provide an external environment for group-affiliated firms, controlled by owner’s family, to gain scale and scope advantages through diversification (Khanna & Palepu, 1997; Khanna & Rivkin, 2001). Khanna and Palepu (2000) find that group-affiliated firms diversify in India and after reaching a certain threshold diversification strategy leads to increase in firm value. On the other hand, in case of stand-alone firms, one of the important motivations behind diversification for entrenched managers is to make themselves valuable to shareholders and costly to replace (Shleifer & Vishny, 1989). It has also been reported that through diversification managers diversify their own employment risk (Amihud & Lev, 1999), reduce firm risk and increase firm size and thus producing several personal gains related to their compensation schemes (Stulz, 1990). As diversification reduces shareholder wealth, on average, there is a conflict of interest between manager and shareholders, regarding diversification. It has been argued that managers will diversify less only if there is pressure to do so by internal or external monitoring mechanisms (Denis et al., 1999). In support of this prediction Denis et. al. (1997) documented the US experience where there was general increase in focus in the 1980s, and which has been attributed to increased monitoring associated with the market for corporate control. Moreover, group-affiliated firms have a dominant shareholder, usually a family, which helps to shape strategies and policies of the company. The dominant shareholder exercise substantial control over the firm by way of board representation as well as through voting rights. Managers of group-affiliated firms also like to diversify their firms for getting private benefits. Studies show that diversification is positively related to managerial incentives (Aggarwal & Samwick, 2003). Several advantages of the group-affiliated firms over stand-alone firms lead to superior performance of the former with respect to diversification. These advantages include increased managerial economies of scale, ability to take on more debt, increased intensity of monitoring and the ability to internalize market abilities and or failures. We have already discussed that group-affiliated firms performance improved after diversification in India, due to the presence of “institutional voids” (Khanna & Palepu, 2000). But after liberalization, the scenario has changed. It has been argued that when the institutional environments of an economy move towards markets, group-affiliated firms will have relatively lesser access to external institutional resources (Peng, 2003) and the institutional pressure will increase substantially (Kedia et. al., 2006; Kim et. al., 2004). These external changes will require suitable adaptations in their strategies by the group-affiliated firms, hence it would become more complex for them to select suitable strategies while diversifying in a relatively developed institutional environment (Kedia et. al., 2006; Lee et. al., 2008).",

While acknowledging their strengths and weaknesses, an attempt will be made to reconcile these perspectives wherever possible. Some economic theories and empirical methods that have been used in this literature will be explained in simple terms for the benefit of readers with only a basic knowledge of economics. The possible reasons why different policies were adopted at different times are also touched upon. The review is structured in four sections. Section 2 gives a very brief description of the state of Indian industry at independence. Section 3 covers the period of detailed state control over industry between 1948 and 1980. Section 4 briefly covers the transitional phase of gradual economic reforms during the 1980s. Section 5 deals at length with the period of far-reaching liberalization since 1991. This being a review article, it offers no original research contribution, but I shall give my own views towards the end of each section, and some suggestions for policy in the concluding Sect. 6. Although I use the term industrial policy, the focus throughout will be on policies relating to the manufacturing sector. This excludes construction, electricity, gas and water supply, which are usually included in the category of industry. Within manufacturing, the focus will be on what is referred to by most researchers as the organized, registered, or formal sector. This is because development of this sector has been the main objective of industrial policy in both the pre- and post-reform eras, and because data on the unorganized/unregistered/informal sector is much more sparse.Footnote 1 Consequently, organized manufacturing has received disproportionate attention from researchers, although as late as 2017, the unorganized sector contributed a third of gross value added in manufacturing and employed two-thirds of the manufacturing workforce. These proportions had not changed significantly since the beginning of this century (Krishna et al., 2022a, ch.8). However, at various points, I shall briefly discuss the relationship between the organized and unorganized sectors. Covering even a limited range of issues concerning the organized sector, and the associated literature, has extended this review to an excessive length, so it has not been possible to deal with more specialized topics such as the costs and benefits of foreign direct investment, regional imbalances in industrial development, technology policy, or the growing concern with the environmental effects of industrialization. I also do not go deeply into two subjects on which I have written at length elsewhere: labor market regulation (Bhattacharjea, 2021) and competition (antitrust) policy (Bhattacharjea, 2010; Bhattacharjea & De, 2021).",
