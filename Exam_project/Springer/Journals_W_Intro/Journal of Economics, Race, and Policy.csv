Diette,Arthur H. Goldsmith,William Darity Jr,Male,Male,Male,Male,"A persistent feature of the US labor market is the significantly higher rate of unemployment for blacks relative to whites. In the USA, the unemployment rate for black persons is consistently about twice the rate for whites. During the Great Recession, which ran from December 2007–June 2009, the rate of unemployment for blacks and whites soared in the USA. The unemployment rate for blacks during the Great Recession reached 15.9% while the white unemployment rate reached its zenith at 8%, lower than the pre-recession unemployment rate for blacks of 8.3%. The disproportionate adverse economic consequences of the Great Recession on blacks in the USA are well-documented. During the course of the downturn, the racial wealth gap widened (Hamilton et al. 2015), and between 2007 and 2010, the median black household’s income fell 10.1%, compared with a 5.4% decline for white households. However, an unexplored question is whether the adverse emotional consequences of unemployment are more sever for black individuals than white persons in the USA during any US recession, including the Great Recession. It is unclear whether the Great Recession generated relatively more intense psychological distress among blacks who experienced unemployment. There is compelling evidence that blacks face discrimination in the labor market from audit (Darity Jr. and Mason 1998; Hamilton 2000), experimental (Bertrand and Mullainathan 2004), and survey-based studies (Goldsmith et al. 2007). This situation could result in unemployment generating even greater anxiety for blacks due to an expectation of a comparatively longer duration of unemployment. On the other hand, in an unfortunate, ironic twist of fate, blacks may be more resilient than whites in coping with the trauma of unemployment due to greater prior experience with such hardships as a result of racial discrimination.Footnote 1 Thus, a priori, it is unclear if experiencing a bout of unemployment damages the psychological well-being of a black individual more or less than a white individual. We are unaware of any data sets that provide information on both the labor force and mental health status of individuals—based on a fully structured, lay-administered, diagnostic interview that generates diagnoses, rather than self-reports—during the midst of the Great Recession.Footnote 2 However, such information is available in the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication (NCS-R)—which surveyed respondents once during the period from 2001 to 2003—when the US economy was in a less pronounced recession. Thus, if there is a stable racial gap in the relation between perceived prospects for reemployment by the unemployed and their mental health, then the estimates we report would be lower bound estimates of the link between unemployment and mental health during the Great Recession. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, to more accurately estimate the link between experiencing unemployment during the most recent year and the likelihood of suffering from poor mental health during the past year for blacks and whites using data drawn from the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication (NCS-R). Second, using these results we infer the emotional consequences of the Great Recession within and across racial groups in the USA and discuss the policy implications of our findings. Our findings reveal that for resilient persons—those without histories of poor mental health—the group for which we believe estimates of the unemployment mental health link can be considered plausibly more causal and accurate, the effect of short-term unemployment on psychological distress is significantly greater for blacks.",10

Yaya,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The US economy, infamous for its high income inequality among the developed economies, was rocked with a deep recession in the late 2000s, known as the Great Recession. The recession started in the housing market with sharp declines in housing prices; then, it spilled into the financial sector with the collapse of the Lehman Brothers in late 2008 due to declines in the values of mortgage-backed securities. Eventually, the effects of the recession were felt in the entire economy including the labor markets, industrial production, and international trade. The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) announced the official beginning of the recession as December 2008 after three-quarters of negative GDP growth. During the Great Recession, the unemployment rate rapidly increased from 5 to 10%. Furthermore, more than 5 million Americans lost their health insurance due to declining incomes and employment Holahan (2011) , and a quarter of the families lost three-quarters of their wealth during the Great Recession. These losses disproportionally affected the lower-income, less-educated, and minority families Pfeffer et al. (2013). The Great Recession finally concluded at the end of 2009. Some recently published articles have analyzed the consequences of recessions (see Pfeffer et al. 2013; Meyer and Sullivan 2013; Hellebrandt 2014; Piketty and Saez 2013; Salgado et al. 2014). From the labor market impact to the mental health, these papers showed the adverse effects of recessions. However, only a few published articles discussed the impact of economic downturns on income inequality. One possible reason for the lack of extensive research on the true impact of recessions on inequality might be the complex nature of income inequality. More specifically, the changes in inequality are multifaceted, and inequality is a persistent process. Furthermore, no single factor can solely explain the majority of the changes in income inequality, especially in the short run. However, it is natural to think that inequality, social problems, and demographical changes such as discrimination, segregation, poverty, immigration, and access to education and health are closely related to each other. This is especially true when a recession has non-uniform effects on vulnerable populations such as different racial and ethnic groups in the economy. In addition to the issues pertaining to the Great Recession, the US economy has been facing challenges associated with race and ethnicity, including but not limited to these minorities’ earnings, education, health, and income inequalities. It should be noted that the US population is very heterogeneous, with blacks and Asians as the largest two minorities in the US population at approximately 12.6 and 4.8% of the US population, respectively, according to the 2010 US Census. Furthermore, Hispanics, the largest ethnic minority, constitute approximately 16.3% of the US population. These racial and ethnic groups in the USA have varying levels of earnings, poverty rates, educational attainments, health, and income inequality characteristics. Asians are repeatedly shown to earn the most (family income of Asians was $77,900 in 2014), while non-white Hispanics and blacks earn the least (both groups earn approximately $43,000). Furthermore, Asians have the lowest poverty rate, highest educational attainment (53% of Asians completed a college degree), and highest income inequality compared to blacks and Hispanics. In comparison, blacks tend to have highest poverty rates (26% of blacks live in poverty) while Hispanics have the lowest educational attainment (only 15% of Hispanics complete a college degree).Footnote 1 Furthermore, inequality in the USA has been increasing since the 1970s. Orrenius and Zavodny (2013) argued that Hispanics face higher inequality than non-Hispanic whites but lower income inequality than non-Hispanic blacks, based on the 2010 Current Population Survey. Their findings suggest that, with their relatively high poverty rate, Hispanics are at the bottom of the income distribution. Hoover and Yaya (2010, 2011) showed substantial differences in inequality among the racial and ethnic groups in the USA. Their results suggest that inequality is the lowest among Hispanics, followed by blacks and whites.Footnote 2 As important as the distribution of income and income inequality, the literature truly lacks a comprehensive analysis of the impact of the Great Recession on these issues. The needed comprehensive analysis would provide a better understanding of the impact of the Great Recession, facilitating a path to a public policy discussion regarding how to alleviate the adverse effects of recessions, especially in the context of within- and between-group income inequalities among the racial and ethnic groups. Income inequality is an indisputable measure of social mobility and available economic opportunities to individuals in a society; hence, the discussion of public policies toward understanding and alleviating income inequality has utmost importance. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of income inequality should incorporate the vulnerable populations who have not been fully examined in the literature. More specifically, females, immigrants, young adults, less-educated individuals, and racial and ethnic groups are some examples of populations that need to be studied for a complete understanding of these social issues. Unfortunately, few studies have examined the impact of recessions on overall income inequality, and almost none of them has focused on vulnerable populations. Furthermore, most of the earlier studies used overall income inequality. In the context of vulnerable populations, specifically racial and ethnic groups, it is possible to decompose the income inequality into within- and between-group inequalities, which demonstrate the share of inequality that can be attributed to the income inequality within each group as well as between one group and the rest of the population. Again, the decomposition of income inequality within and between vulnerable populations has not been explored in the literature, particularly during and after economic downturns, business cycles, and recessions. This paper fills the gap in the literature with the impact of the Great Recession on income inequalities of one of the vulnerable populations, i.e., racial and ethnic groups. More specifically, this paper analyzes the impact of the Great Recession on within- and between-group inequalities based on the Gini Coefficient and state-level average personal incomes. Income inequalities within- and between-groups at the state level over a 12-year span are analyzed before and after the Great Recession using the pooled regression approach with robust standard errors. The research questions that are being analyzed are fourfold: (1) Has the Great Recession increased the overall income inequality in the USA? (2) Is the impact of the Great Recession on income inequality uniform among the racial and ethnic groups? (3) Has the Great Recession changed the within- and between-group inequalities among whites, blacks, Asians, and Hispanics? and (4) Is the impact of the Great Recession on income inequality short-lived, or is there a permanent effect of the Great Recession on income inequality in the USA? The rest of the paper is organized as follows: the “Literature review” section presents a brief literature review. The “Data” section presents the data and the descriptive statistics of the variables. The “Methodology” section introduces the econometric model, which estimates the effect of the Great Recession on overall and within- and between-group income inequalities among racial and ethnic groups across 50 states and the District of Columbia over a period of 12 years. The “Results” section presents the results from the econometric models. The “Conclusion” section concludes.",3

Bogan,Di Wu,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"“When America catches acold, minorities catch pneumonia”- Unknown During times of economic difficulty, there is evidence to suggest that certain ethnic households in the USA disproportionately suffer economic hardships such as higher unemployment, bankruptcy, and home foreclosure rates. For example, during an expansionary time in 2005, unemployment for college-educated whites was 2.1% while it was 3.5% for college-educated African Americans and 2.9% for college-educated Latinos. In the less robust economy of 2010, the college-educated unemployment rate was 4.3% for whites, 7.9% for African Americans, and 6.0% for Latinos.Footnote 1 If the business cycle differentially affects ethnic groups, then responses to the business cycle also may be different by racial group. There has been considerable literature devoted to investigating how the business cycle affects human capital investment decisions. Generally, the literature focuses on primary, secondary, and undergraduate education forms of human capital investment (see for example, Herman 2010; Dellas and Koubi 2003; Dellas and Sakellaris 2003; Boffy-Ramirez et al. 2010; Betts and McFarland 1995; Higa 2010; Heylen and Pozzi 2007; Blackburn and Varvarigos 2008). However, the opportunity cost (due to lost wages) to pursue an advanced degree is considerably larger than that related to pursuing a high school, associate, or bachelor’s degree. Hence, business cycle fluctuations are more likely to affect graduate and professional school enrollment than primary, secondary, or undergraduate enrollment. Nonetheless, the literature examining the effect of the business cycle on graduate school and professional school enrollment is more limited (Bedard and Herman 2008; Wei 2004; Goh 2009). Bedard and Herman (2008) find specific differences for higher levels of education. They find male Ph.D. enrollment is counter-cyclical, male master’s degree enrollment is procyclical, and female enrollment is acyclical among various advanced degree categories. While business cycle effects on enrollment and demographic characteristic effects on enrollment have been separately studied, to our knowledge, the work of Bedard and Herman (2008), using cross-section data, was first to analyze advance degree enrollment patterns across the business cycle by individual characteristics (undergraduate major, undergraduate GPA, gender). Using a panel data set, we build on the work of Bedard and Herman (2008) and expand the literature by providing evidence suggestive of a causal relationship between the business cycle and graduate school enrollment. Moreover, using an over-sample of under-represented minority respondents, we analyze the relationship between the business cycle, graduate enrollment, and another salient individual characteristic that has been shown to influence educational choice—race. Consistent with previous literature, we find that poorer economic conditions drive more people to enroll in graduate school programs and that the magnitude of the relationship between the business cycle and the specific type of graduate school programs varies. More importantly, we find large differential racial effects of the business cycle on graduate school enrollment. Given theory indicates that graduate school enrollment is driven by the opportunity costs to pursue a graduate degree, this evidence suggests lower opportunity costs for minorities. While there are a number of potential explanations for lower minority opportunity costs, this finding is consistent with the presence of a greater degree of wage discrimination. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. “Data” presents the data used. “Theoretical Framework” discusses the theoretical framework. “Econometric Analysis” and “Robustness Checks” presents the econometric analysis and results. Finally, the last section summarizes key findings and provides concluding remarks.",

Swinton,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"There has been a steady increase in the demand for postsecondary education since the 1970s that has not been matched by state government spending on higher education—a phenomenon that is exacerbated during economic downturns. The average support for higher education remains below pre-2007 recession levels,Footnote 1 while access to educational opportunities for all students has greatly increased. The benefits of obtaining a higher education are evidenced throughout literature (Autor et al. 2008; Card 2001; Jaeger and Page 1996). Many fear that continued cuts to education funding coupled with steady increases in the demand for postsecondary education will result in perpetual hikes in tuition, which are already rising at a rate faster than inflation and family wages (Desrochers and Wellman 2011). Some argue that lower appropriations can result in fewer available courses and full-time faculty, which may potentially decrease the quality of education. A lack of investment and support for public institutions threatens to put higher education out of reach for a larger share of the population. Given that state funding of public Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) has been shown to be lower than that of other institutions (Sav 2010), we investigate whether these inequities in state funding persist during periods of economic downturns. This paper examines whether institution type, specifically congressional designation as an HBCU, results in differential funding decreases within a state. HBCUs were founded to provide educational opportunities to African Americans when other postsecondary education institutions were closed, restricted, or discouraged. Today, HBCUs award nearly one-fifth of all bachelor degrees earned by African Americans (Palmer and Gasman 2008). This is significant given that HBCUs represent only 3% of higher learning institutions in the nation. Some scholars argue that HBCUs educate many African American and other diverse students, regardless of academic preparation, test scores, and socioeconomic status; some of whom might otherwise not be able to pursue a degree at the collegiate level (Freeman and Cohen 2001). Given that HBCUs are effective at enrolling, retaining, and graduating African Americans (Minor 2008), there are public concerns regarding budget cuts or a lack of support for these institutions. For instance, Sav (2010) finds that although the discrepancy in state funding has decreased over the last three decades, the disparities in the funding of HBCUs remain. To the extent that higher education cuts are most dire during recessionary periods, it is of interest to determine whether inequities in funding persist during such periods. Humphreys (2000) finds that state appropriations to higher education decrease substantially during recessionary downturns. In addition, enrollment during recessionary periods has been found to be countercyclical (Johnson 2013; Humphreys 2000; Betts and McFarland 1995). Together, these outcomes create pressures on colleges and universities that may affect the quality of education—pressures that can be exacerbated at HBCUs due to historical funding levels proportionately lower than their counterparts. Moreover, Clelan and Kofoed (2017) finds that during recessionary periods states cut back their need based student financial aid, which place a greater financial burden on families. To prevent a drop in sorely needed student financial aid, and thus, in student enrollment, families seek elusive increases in state and federal aid. Inevitably, families of least advantage and underrepresented minorities are most adversely impacted. Using macroeconomic indicators similar to those used in Humphreys (2000) and McGranahan (1999) along with linear regression model setup similar to Sav (2010), we examine the effect business cycle fluctuations on the funding of higher education institutions. We add to the literature by considering that funding across all types of colleges/universities is heterogeneous during economic downturns and otherwise. We find that on average HBCUs receive less funding in general than other types of institutions. During downturns, the funding appropriated to HBCUs decreases at a larger rate than other institutions, a result that is driven by inequities among 4-year institutions. We also examine whether unequal funding persists within each state and find that some states have not experienced differential funding effects between HBCUs and other institutions. Further, we explore some of the possible mechanisms through which these differences persist. Although most states with HBCUs have funding formulas, discussions with each state’s higher education executive association reveal that state funding to higher education, independent of a funding formula, is often influenced by state governor and legislature preferences.",6

Orrenius,Madeline Zavodny,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Immigrants typically converge toward mainstream economic and social outcomes across generations. In general, immigrants’ children, grandchildren, and subsequent generations of descendants each more closely resemble the population average in terms of education, employment, earnings, and other outcomes than do immigrants themselves. Evidence of such intergenerational assimilation or integration is widespread across origins, destinations, and time periods. However, there are exceptions. Hispanics in the contemporary USA may be one of them. Studies have noted that the children of Hispanic immigrants have far more education than their parents, but gains in educational attainment appear to stall after the second generation.Footnote 1 The average education level of third-plus generation Hispanics is well below that of non-Hispanic whites. This study examines differences in labor market outcomes across Hispanic immigrant generations. Understanding how Hispanics do in the labor market is important since more than one in six workers is Hispanic, and Hispanics account for a disproportionate share of labor force growth. Differences across immigrant generations may be important as well since a rising share of Hispanics is US-born. This is the result of both smaller immigration flows from Latin America since the start of the Great Recession of 2007–2009 and, until the recession, relatively high birthrates among Hispanic immigrants living in the USA. Although a number of studies examine differences across immigrant generations in Hispanics’ or Mexican Americans’ educational attainment (e.g., Telles and Ortiz 2008; Duncan et al. 2017) and in their earnings (Trejo 1997; Livingston and Kahn 2002; Fry and Lowell 2006; Blau and Kahn 2007; Duncan and Trejo 2018), few studies have examined differences across immigrant generations in employment, which is our focus here.Footnote 2 There is also a large literature on intragenerational assimilation among Hispanic and other immigrants that examines whether their labor market outcomes catch up with those of US natives as their duration of US residence increases (e.g., Chiswick 1978; Borjas 1985).Footnote 3 While understanding intragenerational assimilation is also important, it is not our focus here. Specifically, this study examines the employment rates of Hispanic immigrants, the children of Hispanic immigrants (the second generation), and subsequent descendants of Hispanic immigrants (the third-plus generation). We present descriptive and multivariate analyses of employment rates for those groups absolutely, relative to each other, and relative to non-Hispanic white US natives. We study the period 1996 to 2017, an era that encompasses the latter half of the Great Moderation and all of the Great Recession. The large swings in the business cycle during the second half of this period led to substantial changes in employment for all demographic groups. The first half of this period witnessed substantial growth in the number of Hispanic immigrants, and the size of the second and third-plus generations grew throughout the period as the children and later descendants of Hispanic immigrants reached working age. Although studies of racial and ethnic differences in labor market outcomes often focus on earnings, employment is a key labor market outcome. Needs-based transfer programs increasingly emphasize employment, as exemplified by the growth in the Earned Income Tax Credit program, shrinkage in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, and imposition of work requirements for food stamp and Medicaid recipients in some states. Working has therefore become even more critical to most people’s ability to make ends meet. In addition, differences in time spent employed over people’s lifespan lead to gaps in accumulated work experience and job-related skills. Experience and skills gaps are likely to lead to differences in earnings. Income differentials then lead to disparities in savings and financial security during retirement. For immigrants, employment also facilitates integration into American society, which improves outcomes for future generations as well. Further, understanding the determinants of differences in employment is a necessary precursor to understanding the determinants of differences in earnings since earnings are conditional on employment. The results here indicate substantial differences in Hispanics’ employment rates across immigrant generations. Hispanic immigrant men tend to have higher employment rates than second- and third-plus generation Hispanics do, while the opposite pattern holds among Hispanic women. Nonetheless, this pattern of intergenerational assimilation reverses between the second and the third-plus generations of Hispanic women. Overall, the results paint a discouraging picture of employment among Hispanics by the third generation and beyond that appears to be primarily due to relatively low educational attainment. This accords with other findings that lower educational attainment is the most important contributor to the earnings gap between US-born Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites (e.g., Duncan and Trejo 2018). Selective ethnic attrition, the propensity for more successful Hispanics to stop identifying themselves as such, also may play a role in the observed employment decline between the second and third-plus generations. While our results are consistent with ethnic attrition, data limitations mean we are unable to fully determine its contribution to the patterns we observe.",2

DACA offered to its recipients a 2-year relief from deportation and the ability to legally work in the country. In 2017, the future of DACA recipients became uncertain after President Trump announced its termination. At the time of the announcement, there were more than 680 thousand DACA recipients,Footnote 1 almost half of the original estimated eligible DACA population of 1.7 million of individuals (Jeanne and Mittelstadt 2012). The legal suit against the program and the interjections to the program’s termination at the beginning of 2018 increased the level of uncertainty. With Congress’ lack of ability to reach a consensus on immigration, the decision on DACAmented’s future is currently in the hands of the local courts. Meanwhile, a large number of DACAmented are expected to renew their status during the last quarter of 2018. Studying DACA recipients offers us a view on how immigration reforms could affect undocumented populations, and how they can properly be incorporated into society through employment, education, and access to other resources, such as health coverage, to improve their lifelong well-being. This paper studies the interconnection between access to public health insurance and individuals’ employment, schooling, and health care coverage. Using the 1% American Community Survey from 2009 to 2016, this study evaluates whether access to state-level Medicaid has an effect on DACA-eligible individuals employment, schooling, and health care coverage decisions. Also, it tests whether there is a crowd out public-versus-private effect when public coverage is available among the DACA eligible. The identification strategy in the analysis exploits the differences in providing state-level Medicaid to DACA recipients across states, before and after DACA, and between eligibles and non-eligibles. We implement this triple-difference approach (DDD) by separating states into DACA accommodating areas and DACA non-accommodating areas and defining the DACA eligible and non-eligible sample using the eligibility criteria from the program. The DDD approach, combined with state- and year-fixed effects, allows this study to disentangle the effects of DACA and access to health coverage from the effects of other economic and policy factors. Our contribution to the literature is twofold. First, we offer evidence of the connection between DACA recipients’ working and college education decisions and the availability of state-level Medicaid. This relationship unveils the complex trade-off between work and schooling. We further provide this evidence across different relevant groups to account for the characteristics of current DACA recipients. Because health coverage is an additional cost of college enrollment for undocumented students—due to colleges’ insurance requirements and their legal barriers on undocumented students accessing coverageFootnote 2—DACA recipients would incorporate health insurance into the costs of enrolling in higher education. Second, we show evidence on how the access to Medicaid coverage affects the rate and type of health insurance among DACA recipients who have limited options. Access to Medicaid, and its expansion, provides them a higher incentive to obtain public instead of private coverage. Other published research has not connected the issue of access to health care coverage and employment and schooling among DACA recipients. Current research on DACA and health care focuses on the connection between health coverage and health usage and outcomes (Giuntella and Lonsky 2018) or the direct impact of DACA on ESI coverage among DACA recipients (Rubalcaba 2018). Previous literature largely focused on the effect of DACA on employment, income/poverty, and schooling (Pope 2016; Amuedo-Dorantes and Antman 2016, 2017; Hsin and Ortega 2017; Kuka et al.2018). The study identifies California, New York, and DC as the accommodating areas that offer state-level Medicaid to DACA recipients. After the program, DACA eligibles were more likely to work than DACA ineligibles (between 3 and 4 percentage points), and this effect is larger in accommodating areas (about 4 percentage points more). The presence of public coverage did not reduce the incentive to work among DACA eligibles. For particular groups, such as Mexican, Hispanics, and males, the impact on employment is higher, with those living in poor families also reflecting higher effects. With respect to schooling, the effect of DACA and access to public coverage is mixed. In accommodating areas, the effect is consistently positive but only significant for certain specifications. Meanwhile, in non-accommodating areas, the effect is consistently negative and non-significant when comparing DACA eligibles versus ineligibles. The program did not offer them access to additional supporting resources for individuals to consider higher education instead of legal work. As DACAmented see an increase in their chances of getting career-related jobs, and other resources are made available to them, they show higher interest in enrolling into higher education. Our findings also provide evidence of a differential effect across age groups. We encounter variations in the size and significance of the effect across different definitions of the samples of potential DACA eligibles and non-eligibles that affect the average age of the groups. In “older” samples the effect is about 1 percentage point smaller, regardless of the area. DACA increased the proportion of individuals reporting public/Medicaid coverage among DACA eligibles in accommodating areas compared to DACA ineligibles (about 3 percentage points), especially for those who can satisfy Medicaid income eligibility, and those who are younger (about 2 to 6 percentage points more likely to report public coverage). This evidence on the increase of public coverage is comparable to Giuntella and Lonsky (2018) findings. However, we also see an increase in ESI and self-paid coverage among DACA eligibles compared to DACA ineligibles when looking at relatively “older” samples. On the other hand, DACA eligibles in non-accommodating areas have lower insurance rates, but, when covered, they are more likely to have ESI or self-pay coverage compared to ineligibles. This supports (Rubalcaba 2018)’s findings on ESI coverage increases among DACA eligibles after DACA. The differential effects across areas, and across age groups, seem to explain the mixed conclusions found in other investigations. We acknowledge the limitation of our study regarding the endogeneity of immigrants’ location choice. There is no prior belief on a systematic difference with respect to the choice of residence between documented and undocumented immigrants. In general, among immigrants, the findings have shown that the presence of co-ethnics and other immigrants are significant determinants of immigrants’ location choice (Zavodni 1997, 1998; Kaushal 2005). Another element identified in the literature is the difference between established and recent immigrants (Borjas 1999). There exist contrasting evidence regarding the existence of welfare programs and their impact on immigrants’ location choice (Zavodni 1997, 1998; Borjas1999).Footnote 3 However, the literature on immigration cautions that estimates resulting form comparisons across states could reflect movements across states instead of a policy change effect. Because “welfare magnets” could attract individuals with low internal mobility costs, certain benefits would be more attractive for certain groups. Medicaid available to DACA recipients would be attractive only to that population. Because DACA recipients are, on average, younger and more likely to be single, we cannot entirely discount the possibility of this endogeneity issue. We address this problem in the paper by comparing different samples and time frames. The results are consistent with our main findings, except those with regard to ESI coverage and, for some samples, to employment when we compare accommodating areas against similar-type states. For employment, we estimate that access to Medicaid has a negative effect among DACA eligibles compared to non-eligibles when we compare California against similar-type states. This estimate is not significant when the comparison is only between California and Texas. Yet, among Mexican DACA eligibles, we maintain our general results: increase in employment, increase in schooling, increase in Medicaid coverage, and increase in coverage overall occurred in accommodating areas among eligibles, while increase in ESI and self-paid coverage occurred in non-accommodating areas. The paper is organized as follows. Section “Background” summarizes the relevant points of the major policies that are connected to our study and the findings from previous literature. Then, in “Data,” we describe the data and the definition of the populations we plan to use in our work. In “Empirical Model,” explain in detail the strategy we follow for all the analysis and present the empirical model. Section “Analysis of Results” shows the estimated results. We perform several robustness tests to check for the assumptions and consistency of our results: for pre-trends, the issue of location choice among immigrants, key demographic groups’ effects, the existence of a differential effect across age groups, and the sensitivity of our cutoff ranges. Section “Robustness Check” presents all these different exercises. We end with “Policy Implications and Remarks,” offering policy implications of our study and some concluding remarks.",4

The Case of Lima and Asuncion Metropolitan Areas,March 2020,Laura Jaitman,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Public transport systems are the principal mode of travel for millions of people in Latin America. An average of 43% of daily trips are made on public transport (CAF 2010). However, a higher perception and experience of insecurity is associated with lower public transportation use. Thus, it is likely these perceptions limit women’s transport options and therefore directly affect their mobility, their opportunities to participate equally with men in activities that generate employment, their access to services, and their right to freely enjoy the city. Evidence on victimization of women on public transport is rather scarce, especially in less developed countries. Gaps in the official recording of crimes together with the difficulty of accessing crime figures disaggregated by gender make it particularly difficult to gain an accurate picture of public transport victimization in terms of the whole journey (Newton 2004 and Smith 2008). Although some studies found that women suffer higher rates of victimization than men on public transport, there are still important differences across types of crime and areas (see the next section). The scarce literature together with the differing crime patterns across cities point to the need for specific research on place and crime patterns with a special focus on women. This information is key to leveling the playing field in terms of labor market opportunities and use of public spaces for women. The main contribution of this article is to close data gaps by providing empirical evidence of victimization of women on public transport in two Latin American metropolitan cities, Lima (Peru) and Asuncion (Paraguay), based on an innovative survey design. The paper also provides policy recommendations to enhance women’s security on public transport. The objective of this study is to measure women’s perception of insecurity and victimization on public transport in the metropolitan areas of Lima and Asunción in order to understand what factors influenced them and what changes on optimal decision-making in terms of mobility are associated with them. For that, we conducted an innovative survey of more than 1200 women that included users and nonusers of public transport. The survey collected information on their socioeconomic profile, types and frequency of their travel on public transport, their perceptions of insecurity on public transport, and their victimization on it as well as the propensity of victims to report crimes. The survey reveals that, in line with regional patterns, more than 50% of women between the ages of 18 and 65 use public transport for their most frequent trips. Approximately 75–80% of them feel unsafe when traveling alone at night in the city, and 64% consider public transport unsafe or very unsafe. Using an order probit model, we find that institutional factors, such as confidence in the institutions, are associated with perceptions of security. In particular, more confidence in institutions (such as the police) is correlated with a higher perception of security on public transport, and the perception of insecurity is greater among women who do not use public transport compared to women who use it. This finding suggests that surveys that use a sample comprised of only users of public transport can present a bias in the perception of insecurity, since women who self-select to use public transport, on average, have less fear of crime. This highlights the advantage of the design of our survey, which uses a sample comprised of both users and nonusers of public transport in equal proportions according to their socioeconomic level. According to the survey, 6 and 30% of women who regularly use public transport in the Asuncion and Lima metropolitan areas were victims of a crime while riding or waiting at a station during the past 12 months, respectively. Sexual offenses against women represent a daily and recurring problem for women users of public transport. These offenses are the second most frequent crime that affects women on public transport and have affected more than one third of women at some point in their lives. Victimization can be affected by a series of factors. Using a probit model, we find that being younger is associated with a greater probability of a woman being victim of a crime on public transport, after isolating a series of demographic factors. Also, a greater perception of insecurity in the neighborhood where the women reside is associated with a greater probability of being a victim of a crime on public transport. A higher perception and experience of insecurity is associated with lower public transportation use. Thus, it is likely that insecurity limits women’s transport options and contributes to altering their travel routes. In particular, 35% of women in the Asuncion and 53% in the Lima metropolitan areas reported having changed the mode of transport they used in order to feel safer (most opted for taxis or car services known as remi). Twenty-four percent in Asunción and 16% in Lima reported that they no longer travel at night, and 26% in Asuncion and 21% in Lima reported having traveled with someone or are accompanied to the station by someone. It is likely these changes affect the mobility of women: they can lead them to waste time (for example, by using a bus line that might not be the quickest, or letting buses that are mostly full pass by) and increase travel costs (such as by substituting the bus with a taxi/remi or a car). Finally, the survey also alerts us to the noteworthy level of under-reporting by women who were victims on public transport. In fact, more than 80% of women do not report the crimes to the corresponding authorities, and, in the case of sexual offenses, none of them expressed having reported them. This suggests that the cost of reporting crime is greater than the benefit it generates, which can be attributed to a very low trust in these institutions, such as the police, to help the victims. The remainder of the study is organized as follows. The next section describes the conceptual framework for understanding crime on public transport and reviews the literature. The “Methodology” section describes the methodology used to conduct the survey. The “Insecurity on Public Transport for Women” section analyzes the results found in the Asuncion and Lima metropolitan areas. The “Women’s Perception of Insecurity and Victimization on Public Transport: A Comparative Analysis” section contextualizes the statistics on victimization and levels of insecurity on public transport with the figures reported in other Latin America countries and in developed countries. The “Public Policy Interventions” section reviews the main public policies implemented to combat violence against women on public transport. Finally, the last section presents the conclusions and recommendations.",2

Corral,César E. Montiel Olea,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Land is a central economic asset for the rural poor. Enhancing land tenure security has been touted to yield a number of economic benefits, from increased investment and credit access to productivity growth (Lawry et al. 2017). In addition, property rights are potentially important for women’s empowerment through, for example, enhancing their bargaining position within the household (Newman et al. 2015) and facilitating fertility choice (Field 2003). Cognizant of these potential benefits, international development institutions have provided significant funding to implement projects aimed at land tenure security. World Bank lending for projects related to land tenure totaled US$ 1797 million from 1995 to 2006 (Bell 2006). In Latin America and the Caribbean, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has approved close to 40 projects, totaling US$ 1707 million for this purpose (IDB 2014). Other donors, such as USAID, DFID, and AusAID, have also placed priority on land issues in their portfolios (Mitchell et al. 2008). Many of these interventions include regularization activities, understood for our purposes as the process of bringing a de facto or irregular situation into compliance with the law (IDB 2014). The ultimate goal of these programs is to grant titles to the land as a means to increase tenure security. Besides the intrinsic value, tenure security might allow rural agricultural households to capture the benefit of investments in the land. Titling might also lower transaction costs in the land market, by clarifying rights and making them transferable. Where credit markets exist, even for households that never intend to sell their land, the ability to alienate property through title could be valuable. These benefits might be immaterial, however, where informal property rights can substitute effectively for formal property rights (Deininger and Feder 2009; Atwood 1990; Lanjouw and Levy 2002). Using newly collected household- and plot-level survey data in rural Ecuador, combined with census-level data—that include an array of community-level characteristics—and project-level data on formal and informal ownership to land, in this paper, we assess how characteristics related to the substitutability of formal and informal property rights affect the demand for regularization in rural Ecuador. We posit, similarly as Lanjouw and Levy (2002) do for urban Ecuador, that for communities and households with certain characteristics, informal property rights can substitute effectively for formal property rights, in effect lowering the value of land regularization. Thus, we investigate household-, plot-, and community-level characteristics as sources of informal property rights which might explain the low take-up of land regularization under the National Rural Land Information and Management System Program (Sigtierras Program) in Ecuador. This was an ambitious national-level land administration project, where less than 15% of eligible households (those with irregular tenancy) sought legal help from the program’s System for Legal Orientation (SIOL) to regularize their tenancy. Overall, our results suggest that household with characteristics that are likely associated with lesser informal security of tenure were more likely to approach the Sigtierras project seeking legal assistance. For instance, younger female-headed households were more likely to request legal support. This might be, as Lanjouw and Levy (2002) argue, due to younger female-headed households facing greater uncertainty in certain land transactions, such as renting, where they might be less able to claim property back if solely relying on informal property rights. A strong determinant of take-up was a measure of the informality of the household’s plots, captured as the number of plots with perceived land tenure issues over the total number of plots managed by the household. Similarly, the more reliant the household is on agriculture, the more likely to take up SIOL. Households located in more marginalized communities with low access to infrastructure and services had a higher probability of requesting legal help to regularize their land from SIOL, suggesting that programs such as Sigtierras target these types of communities. We also find that indigenous households were less likely to take up SIOL, which was an unexpected finding. We conjecture that this finding might be related to insufficient cultural and linguistic relevant communication efforts on the part of the program. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to study rural land regularization take-up. In addition to offering new insights into the substitutability of informal property rights for formal ones, it explicitly assesses the role of gender in this context. The main policy lesson of our results is that through informed targeting based on categorization of beneficiaries, plots, and communities, land administration programs can benefit those that will profit the most from regularization, thereby enhancing their effectiveness and efficiency. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: “Ecuador’s Sigtierras Program” section describes the Sigtierras Project. “Land Rights and Gender” section presents a discussion on the importance of women’s right to land. In “Data and Descriptive Statistics” section, the data used in our analysis is detailed. “Conceptual Framework and Empirical Strategy” section presents a conceptual framework to illustrate how households might decide whether it is worth regularizing. This section also presents the empirical methods used in our analysis. In “Estimation Results and Discussion” section, we present a discussion of our main results as they relate to property rights and take-up. “Conclusion and Policy Implications” section offers concluding remarks and policy implications.",3

Less than 9% of the world’s population lives in the region; yet, 33% of recorded homicides worldwide occur there. The annual homicide rate in LAC of 24 per 100,000 population is more than three times the world average, six times greater than that of the USA, and 20 times greater than in the United Kingdom. This makes LAC one of the most dangerous places on the planet. In addition, LAC continues to be the only region where, on average, levels of violence are still high and have been increasing since 2005 (Jaitman 2017). These levels of violence are even more worrying for gender violence. Considering only non-partner sexual violence, the prevalence of violence against women in LAC is close to that observed in Africa (10.7% and 11.9%, respectively), and almost doubles that in Europe (5.2%) or Southeast Asia (4.9%) (Jaitman 2017). Given this high incidence of violence, it is not surprising that the main concern of the population is crime, even more so than unemployment or the economic situation of countries in the region (Jaitman 2015). The purpose of this article is to examine the phenomenon of the dark figure of crime for different types of crimes, with a special focus on gender-based violent offenses, in LAC. The dark figure (DF, hereafter) of crime refers to the crimes committed that are neither reported to the police, nor recorded in official police records even if reported. We approximate this figure by way of a systematic comparison between administrative crime records and victimization surveys for the period 2004–2014. Understanding the DF of crime, especially of gender-based violent crimes, is on the one hand central for the design of public policies directed toward preventing crime and for the impact evaluation of those policies, especially in a context where crime is a daily concern for people. First, a high DF of crime impedes key actors from adequately understanding the crime problem, such as the critical areas where crimes occur, the time when crimes occur, which crimes are the most frequent, and the characteristics of the victims (Zakula 2015). Second, a lack of knowledge about the DF of crime can limit the capacity of the judicial system to deter crime, since the type of crime reported determines the actions by law enforcement, and under-reporting contributes to the inefficient allocation of resources of the judicial system. For example, one problem that arises as a result of not taking this gap into account is that crimes with low DF are over-represented in administrative records, while crimes with high DF are under-represented (Zakula 2015). As will be discussed later, this is mainly the case for gender-based violent crimes. Third, victims of crimes that were not reported to the police or recorded in administrative systems may not be eligible to access benefits in terms of the support and protection offered by public and private entities (Skogan 1977). Forth, a high DF of crime implies that many illegal actions will not end up in a legal process in the judiciary, and no sanction will be taken against the aggressors. This feeds the perception of impunity and ineffectiveness of justice. In the Becker framework of crime economics, an expected low cost of committing crimes increases the incentives to engage in criminal activities vis-à-vis legal activities. Understanding the DF, on the other hand, is critical to close the knowledge gap in the analyses of criminality. For example, the DF of crime leads to under-estimate the true social costs of crime because private insurance premiums and the cost of compensation programs for victims are affected by the number and the nature of the incidents that do not appear in official estimates. In addition, inferences based on official statistics bias the true distribution of criminality towards certain types of victims or crimes (Skogan 1977). In summary, information on the volume and distribution of crime plays a central role both in the design of public policies as well as in the rigorous study of criminality. To the best of our knowledge, there is scant knowledge on the levels of crimes not officially reported in LAC countries. The literature refers mostly to more targeted research or comparisons within countries rather than between countries, and most of the research focuses on advanced economies where the incidence of crime is relatively low (for example in countries studied such as Netherlands or Finland, homicide rates are between 44 and 17 times lower than in LAC). In contrast, studies that focus on developing countries or LAC countries are scarcer and do not focus on gender violence. For this reason, the present study is innovative in systemically and robustly quantifying the DF of different types of crimes in LAC countries and is novel in examining the principal determinants of the heterogeneity of DF among countries in the region using an original panel dataset. The results of this study demonstrate that there is a large DF of gender-based violent crimes in the region. We find that this figure is greater than 70% for sexual crimes and domestic violence against women older than 15 years. We also find that there is some heterogeneity in this figure within countries except for Chile and that there is a positive correlation between the DF of gender-based violent crimes and the percentage of people living in rural areas, which may be due to the greater barriers to reporting crime faced by rural women in comparison to urban women. Compared to other types of crimes, DF of gender-based violent crimes is relatively similar to the DF of extortion and kidnapping, while it is significantly greater than the DF of assaults and vehicle thefts, which ranges between 61 and 38%, respectively. This is in line with the economic theory of crime: the lower DF occurs in crimes for which there is a greatest benefit from reporting the incident in relation to its cost. Compared to developed countries, the DF of gender-based violent crimes is, on average, 30% higher in LAC, while the DF of all crimes is 70% higher in LAC. This suggests that the DF of sexual crimes is also a problem in developed countries. In terms of general crimes, our results indicate that the DF is heterogeneous in the region: the DF for South America and Central America is on average 30% higher than that of the Caribbean. The DF can be attributed to under-reporting and under-recording. We find evidence that admirative records suffer under-reporting mainly. More precisely, women’s under-reporting rate of gender-based violent crimes is 43% higher than that of men in 2012, while for robberies and general crimes, women’s under-reporting rate is 9 and 5% higher than that of men. Finally, using quantitative techniques and a panel of 14 countries between 2004 and 2014, we find that the perception of corruption, the low confidence in the police, the low income per capita, and the fewer number of police officers per population are positively correlated with the DF of crime. Our results also suggest that the rate of homicides is directly related to the DF of crime, which suggests that official statistics distort the true geographic profile of criminality because they are biased downward in areas with the greatest amount of crime. The estimates include fixed effects by year and subregion. The DF of crime is a multi-dimensional phenomenon; regarding under-reporting, our results show that the authorities can take certain actions to increase the reporting rate in the short and medium term. These actions include public awareness campaigns about the importance of reporting as well as interventions that promote more transparent and efficient policing and that generate confidence among the population. The next section of the paper describes the basic conceptual framework that guides our empirical analysis and reviews the literature relevant to this topic. “Data Sources and Methodology” details the data sources and the methodology used for the calculation of the DF of crime. “The Dark Figure of Gender-Based Violent Crimes from a Comparative Perspective” describes the DF of gender-based violent crimes from a comparative perspective, while “Determinants of the Heterogeneity of Dark Figure of Crimes” analyzes the main determinants of the DF. Finally, “Conclusions” presents the main conclusions.",8

An emerging area of research has examined the impact of land tenure and property rights on economic performance and development for American Indian reservations. One set of authors has found that trust land status has had a negative effect on agricultural productivity on reservations, while others have found that it has not adversely affected various types of investment in land on reservations (Akee 2009; Anderson and Lueck 1992; Carlson 1983; Trosper 1978). These previous analyses have used property rights and land tenure institutions to explain long-run outcomes for American Indian reservations. Allotment of American Indian reservations resulted in a dramatic decline in land ownership by American Indians collectively and individually. It has been estimated that almost two thirds of the existing land base collectively owned by American Indians had been transferred to non-Indians less than 50 years later (Canby 1998). An important remaining question is why these transfers occurred at all: were they due to the legitimate sales of lands or were they coerced sales and/or foreclosures due to nonpayment of property taxes? While I am unable to examine these potential channels in this analysis, I am able to examine changes in homeownership over time by reservation location (and land allotment status). My analysis provides some initial insight into the role that allotment played in land loss and the corresponding decline in home ownership for American Indians who were subject to the privatization of their lands.In this research, I examine the short-run impact of changing land tenure status on two American Indian reservations over a relatively short period of time. Specifically, I examine the transition from home ownership to renting for American Indians due to the US Federal government’s land allotment programs in Minnesota (also known as the Nelson Act of 1889) between 1900 and 1910.Footnote 1 The Nelson Act of 1889 authorized the allotment of land for the Minnesota Anishinaabe reservations.Footnote 2 Allotment put communally owned tribal lands into private ownership for individual American Indians and the tribal government; however, there were restrictions on the ability to sell, lease, or mortgage the lands. The US Federal government held all of those lands in federal trust which meant that it could not be sold, leased, or used as collateral in conventional mortgages. The first allotments on the White Earth reservation were made in 1901 (Doerfler 2015, p. 4). Subsequent amendments to the Nelson Act removed restrictions on the sale, lease, mortgage, and taxation of Indian lands owned by “mixed bloods” (Meyer 1994 p. 153). In practice, it appears that full blood Anishinaabe were treated as mixed blood for the purposes of land sales, leasing, and taxation and lands were sold at an accelerated pace.Footnote 3 Using novel data from two US Censuses that straddle the policy change, I conduct a difference-in-difference analysis across two different reservations in Minnesota. The first reservation, Red Lake, was not allotted at all, and the other reservation, White Earth, was almost completely allotted within the decade 1900–1910. This analysis focuses on the intention-to-treat effect of the allotment of land on home ownership. I find that there is a significant reduction in home ownership and farming activities for the allotted reservation, White Earth, as expected. Additionally, I find that households tend to increase in size after the start of the allotment process for the affected reservation. I also find evidence that this increase in household size is not due to the presence of more children (younger than 10 years of age) but most likely due to an increase of other family members and/or boarders. Finally, there is a movement away from farming to working as a laborer in the timber industry for White Earth residents after allotment. I also examine several household characteristics that may explain differential effects of the allotment policy on home ownership. This analysis is the first to identify whether certain types of households were most at risk of transitioning from home ownership to renting after allotment. Two different hypotheses exist for explaining why land allotment policy resulted in such a staggering loss of Anishinaabe lands. One is that there was little experience or understanding of American legal and property institutions. The first hypothesis is that these households were not prepared or unfamiliar with managing their land and property under the US system of property laws. The second is that after allotment the land and real property became liable for property taxes which were unknown previously. As a result, those with little or no cash income would be unable to pay property taxes and would be at risk of having their properties foreclosed upon. Using household characteristics from 1900, I find evidence that younger, male-headed households had the highest likelihood of reporting home rental as opposed to ownership after the allotment process. There is also a higher probability of reporting home rental if households have a higher proportion of individuals with hunting or gathering as their reported occupation in the 1900 Census. Prior research has examined the results of land allotment for American Indians by analyzing reservation-level statistics only (such as the percent of reservation lands allotted, owned, or rented) and was therefore unable to control for potential differences in household characteristics, preferences, or decision-making (Carlson 1981, 1983; Anderson and Lueck 1992). In this analysis, I control explicitly (using panel data at the household level) for unobserved household characteristics across time. I use data that I have partially digitized from the US Census Bureau Indian Population forms for 1900 and 1910. Given that there are names, ages, and genders for individuals in both sets of records, I am able to link a proportion of them between the two censuses to create a panel data set. This is the first instance to my knowledge that investigates the economic impact of the reservation-level change in land tenure on household-level outcomes using quantitative analysis. In the next section, I provide some background information on the reservation history for White Earth and Red Lake. In the “Data Set Creation for White Earth and Red Lake Reservations in 1900 and 1910” section, I detail the data collection and the characteristics of the populations at both points in time. I also describe the method and success rates of matching households across the two US Censuses. The “Empirical Methods” section provides the empirical specifications. In the “Effects of Allotment on Dispossession, Household Size, and Employment” section, I discuss overall results for the main difference-in-difference analysis. The “Differential Effects by Head of Household Characteristics” section examines whether there are differences in outcomes by the household head characteristics which provide some additional information on which household types were most at risk for the loss of their land and homes after allotment occurred. The “Discussion of Results and Conclusion” section concludes.",3

Cook,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) signed in 2010 created significant healthcare reform in the USA. One goal of the ACA was to reduce the number of uninsured individuals in the USA. Three significant components of the ACA contributed to higher rates of health insurance coverage: the individual mandate, which required individuals to have health insurance or pay a financial penalty, a healthcare exchange where individuals could buy health insurance, and an expansion of Medicaid. Collectively, these three components of the ACA have decreased the number of uninsured from about 44 million to 24 million individuals (Collins et al. 2016). A comprehensive literature review by Antonisse et al. (2017) provides evidences from over 200 studies that the ACA expansion has increased the Medicaid coverage rate and reduced the uninsured rate. The ACA required that all states expand Medicaid eligibility. However, in 2012, the Supreme Court ruled that states could elect to expand their eligibility but were not required to do so. In 24 states and Washington DC, the expanded coverage under Medicaid went into effect on January 1, 2014. Subsequently, 13 other states expanded or have passed ballot measures to expand Medicaid eligibility in 2019. As of November 2018, only 14 states have chosen not to expand their Medicaid eligibility (Kaiser Family Foundation 2018). Courtemanche et al. (2017) found that in expansion states, the insurance rate increased by about 6 percentage points, while in non-expansion states, it was about 3 percentage points. Thus, Medicaid expansion created significant opportunities for gaining insurance. Prior to the ACA, to be eligible for Medicaid, individuals had to have a low income and be a member of an eligible category. Eligible categories included pregnant women, children, parents of dependent children, individuals with disabilities, and the elderly. Notably, pre-ACA, Medicaid often did not cover childless adults regardless of their income (NCSL 2018). Thus, the Medicaid expansion under the ACA relaxed income constraints, now including individuals with incomes up to 138% of the poverty line, and also included groups of people who previously were ineligible for Medicaid.Footnote 1 Simon et al. (2017) found removing eligibility categories increased coverage rates and preventive care for low-income childless adults. In 2013, Hispanic individuals comprised about 25% of Medicaid enrollees, whereas about 40% of enrollees were White, 21% were Black, and 14% identified as “Other” (Kasier Family Foundation 2018). Medicaid enrollment rates do not mirror the demographics of the population. Prior to the ACA, Hispanics were lagging the farthest behind in coverage rates (S. R. Collins et al. 2016 and Doty et al. 2014). According to the Migration Policy Institute (2018), the ACA positively impacted health insurance coverage rates in the USA. Specifically, from 2013 to 2016, the uninsured rate for both immigrants and individuals born in the USA decreased. We seek to determine if Medicaid uptake under the ACA changed the frequency with which Hispanics who self-identify as Spanish (English) speakers enrolled in Medicaid. In early work on the ACA, Sommers et al. (2015) found that many individuals were unaware of the changes to insurance under the healthcare reform. In fact, an individual having information about their options under the ACA strongly predicted whether they would apply to obtain coverage. While Sommers et.al. focus on the role of outreach in getting Hispanics enrolled in health insurance, we consider informal information sharing, both about new components of the ACA and the details of enrolling in Medicaid to be correlated with increased uptake. As an individual has more social capital, the probability that this information will be shared increases, decreasing the informational barriers. Buchmueller et al. (2016) investigate the role of ethnicity and race in insurance rates under the ACA, examining differences in expansion states and non-expansion states. They find that the ACA expansion reduced disparities in coverage rates between ethnic groups, but substantial disparities remain post-ACA. This result is consistent with Yue et al. (2018), who consider the differential effects of Medicaid expansion for Hispanics. While our study does not include the geographic analysis, we consider individual-level relationships to examine the role of language and community connection on the impact of enrollment, which to our knowledge is a novel contribution. We exploit expanded eligibility for Medicaid under the ACA to determine if the expansion had a differential impact on demographic groups. Specifically, we focus on the uptake of Medicaid for Hispanics who self-identify as either primarily English or primarily Spanish speakers. We propose why the uptake rates might vary among Hispanic and non-Hispanic adults, in addition to considering how one’s primary language might impact one’s decision to enroll in Medicaid. The ability to separate ethnic identity from language allows us to consider how social capital might affect Medicaid enrollment. We use neighborhood connection as an additional measure of social capital and determine that increased social capital leads to increased Medicaid enrollment. We determine relative rates of Medicaid enrollment for Hispanic English speakers, Spanish speakers, and Hispanic Spanish speakers and consider how additional measures of social capital impact enrollment. The term Social Capital has been used to describe both the resources shared within a group of people and the relationships between people. It is challenging to measure either resource sharing or relationships quantitatively and so we look at indicators of social capital as a proxy. Putnam (1993) considers trust and community building as the most important indicators of social capital. Putnam highlights that an individual with more connections does not necessarily have stronger social capital, as some connections might provide the desired resources. Putnam indicates that to expand networks, individuals should engage in civic activities. This increases collaboration and generates a “stock” of social capital and produces a wealthier economic and social environment. In other words, wealth is a function of how able people are to access the resources they want (Daubón and Carrasquillo 2002). While some work on social capital has focused on the individual or family level, Engbers et al. (2017) look at large groups to measure social capital. The increased aggregation provides consensus among and between communities, so measuring social capital at a community level might be more reliable. Higher associations result from the expansion of the social capital network. That is, people can use social capital to build a relationship, then a community, a higher order group, and so on. We follow this work by looking at language communities within an ethnic group, an aggregate measure of human capital. There is limited work looking at social capital and health insurance, and it focuses on communities outside the USA. Donfouet and Mahieu (2012), and Mladovsky et al. (2014) study social capital and community-based health insurance (CBHI). CBHI is very common in low-income rural communities around the world. This type of insurance is supported by trust and communication between members of the group, and therefore, social capital increases the probability of enrollment. While CBHI is uncommon in the USA, the same sort of mechanisms related to shared knowledge or community exchange may influence an individual’s decision to seek insurance. Similarly, we can think of a community member’s private or public health insurance enrollment (coverage) as a signal of trust and a potential source of information. For instance, in a community of immigrants, people share their country of origin, values, language, beliefs, and culture. Therefore, if an individual chooses a health insurance product and shares their experience with their community counterparts, there is an information and trust advantage for selecting that health insurance. Monnat (2017) finds that Hispanics have high rates of uninsured individuals. Hispanics had an increase in the rate of uninsured individuals for the period 1983–2003, while for non-Hispanics, the rate has been steady (Rutledge and McLaughlin 2008). Furthermore, Monnat finds that Hispanics living in geographic areas chosen as immigrant destinations have higher uninsured rates. Monnat attributes these results to the concentration of immigrant noncitizen Hispanics living in the area. We add to this literature by focusing our analysis on individuals who are eligible for Medicaid to clarify if these differences in coverage are related only to eligibility. Both language and culture may provide barriers to health insurance enrollment under the ACA. Schembri and Ghaddar (2018) consider both culture and language on enrollment rates. They interview Hispanic individuals and households near the Texas-Mexico border to document their experience with the ACA expansion. Their results suggest that in these communities cultural perspectives influence health insurance enrollment. One respondent mentioned the Mexican perspective of “macho” includes not needing frequent health care and assuming strong physical health. Other participants of their study mention language as the main barrier. Some people are not even aware of the expansion: Spanish speakers living in a community with similar characteristics are only aware of the changes if a bilingual individual mentions it. Others who had knowledge of the program struggled with clearly understanding the requirements. While van der Goes and Santos (2018) focus on rates of private health insurance for Mexican-American men, they find income, low educational attainment, and language barriers diminish the probability of having private health insurance. They find about 80% of non-Hispanic men to have private health insurance compared to 44% of Mexican-American men. These substantial disparities in coverage for Mexican-American men make public health insurance all the more critical. Many of the barriers identified by van der Goes and Santos (2018) likely exist for public health insurance as well. Wehby and Lyu (2018) studied the effect of the Medicaid expansion under the ACA on low-income individuals and stratify by age, ethnicity, and gender. Using a Difference-in-Difference model, they compare states that approved the expansion with those states which did not expand. Their results indicate that even though the ACA decreased the uninsured rate, Hispanics and young adults remained with the largest disparities in coverage. We utilize Coleman (1988) and Portes (1998)’s perspective of social capital being measured through a relationship network by variables that identify ethnicity and language spoken. These serve as a proxy to measure such networks because we envision members of an ethnic or language community sharing information about the process of enrolling for Medicaid. Once a member of a network has completed the process successfully, some of the informational barriers are lessened for other members of that same community, through the mechanism of social capital. Language as a proxy has already been used in Gee and Giuntella (2011) while ethnicity has been studied in Schembri and Ghaddar (2018). The dynamics of social capital bonding mentioned by Kawachi et al. (2008), apply to people who consider themselves Hispanic and indicate that they mostly or always speak Spanish because they are likely to be living in a community that shapes a Hispanic set of values. Distinguishing between Spanish and non-Spanish speakers, we can also identify social cohesion. In our study, we follow Putman’s model of capital plurality and homogeneity by utilizing national data from the USA. In this study, we utilize the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a cross-sectional dataset of individuals and households, from 2000 to 2016. This data set contains information on household size and members, income, demographics, language spoken, citizenship status, years residing in the USA, beliefs about one’s neighbors, and data related to health status and insurance. We are interested in the adult population, so we exclude individuals under 18 and over 65, so as to not include individuals eligible for Medicare. We also restrict our sample to US citizens. Like Bertrand et al. (2000) and Gee and Giuntella (2011), we use language spoken as a proxy of social connections. We define a Spanish speaker as someone who elected to take the NHIS survey in Spanish. While spoken language is our primary measure of social connection, we expand our measure of social capital by utilizing 4 questions in the NHIS regarding how one perceives one’s neighbors. There are questions which indicate whether one trusts their neighbors, feels that neighbors help each other, is close with one’s neighbors, and can count on one’s neighbors. We use these four questions as an indicator of social capital. If one has a strong relationship with one’s neighbors, we anticipate that one has a larger social network, and may be more likely to share information generally, and specifically about Medicaid enrollment. Table 1 contains summary statistics broken down by demographics pre- and post-ACA for our sample. As many of the variables are categorical variables, we omit standard deviations and simply present means. When one compares the first 4 columns (pre-ACA) with columns 5–8 (post-ACA), every demographic group was more likely to have Medicaid after the expansion. The poor variable represents individuals who are below the poverty line, which varies from 10.5 to 21% of our sample. The new cases variable represents individuals who will be the most impacted by the ACA Medicaid expansion in that they now have household incomes that may make them eligible for Medicaid if they live in an expansion state. It is worth noting that the different demographic groups have reasonably stable populations across regions pre- and post-reform, with the exception of an increase in Hispanic Spanish speakers in the South. For a discussion of differences in uptake across regions, see Appendix 4. Means of all dependent and independent variables are provided so one can observe the variation across the demographic group’s pre- and post-reform. To illustrate trends in Medicaid coverage over time, in Fig. 1, we plot the percentage of individuals who have Medicaid in our sample for (1) non-Hispanic English speakers, (2) Hispanic English speakers, (3) Hispanic Spanish speakers, and (4) non-Hispanic Spanish speakers. As illustrated in Fig. 1, non-Hispanic English speakers have low rates of Medicaid enrollment, followed by Hispanic English speakers, and Hispanic Spanish speakers have the highest fraction of enrollment. All three of these groups see increases in enrollment in 2014, 2015, and 2016, with decreases in enrollment in 2017. Non-Hispanic Spanish speakers seem to have an atypical trend, with falling enrollment from 2011 to 2014, and then a substantial increase in 2016. Coverage trends in Medicaid pre- and post-ACA expansion for 4 groups We are interested in how the probability of having Medicaid changes for different populations, pre- and post-ACA expansion. As such, we run a logistic regression:     Where γR are region fixed effects, γP is a vector of controls including fixed effects for age, years residing in the USA, race, marital status, educational attainment, family income, as well as dummies for being born in the USA, having a disability, below the poverty line, up to 150% of the poverty line, over 200% of the poverty line, and sex. Data is weighted using the NHIS person weights. As we have a number of interactions in Eq. (1), coefficients from the regression cannot be interpreted directly.Footnote 2 Instead, we employ odds ratios for comparison of marginal effects. We are aware that with interaction terms, odds ratios are not simply exponentiated coefficients,Footnote 3 and as such, all odds ratios were manually coded in Stata, with the appropriate combination of coefficients for the comparisons described in the tables below. Please see Appendix 1 for derivations. We also add a new measure of social capital relating to how one feels about one’s neighbors. We create four dummy variables regarding neighborhood characteristics, responding that you agree or strongly agree that you trust (count on/are close with/help) your neighbors is coded as 1, whereas disagree or strongly disagree is coded as 0. We use interactions of these neighborhood variables to see if there is an increased likelihood of Medicaid uptake for individuals we hypothesis to have larger social networks. In Appendix 3, we provide additional summary statistics for English-speaking Hispanics and Spanish-speaking Hispanics. Hispanic Spanish speakers were older, less likely to have been born in the USA, less likely to be disabled, more likely to be below the federal poverty line, and had about half a year less education than their Hispanic English-speaking counterparts. While we control for all of the above factors in our subsequent analysis, it lends weight to our assumption that Spanish-speaking Hispanics and English-speaking Hispanics may have different social networks.",1

Ramsay-Jordan,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Every child has a right to an equitable education, yet schools serving predominantly black students continue to experience unfair and inadequate schooling experiences (Darling-Hammond 2010; Ostrander 2015). In a recent report about teacher equity, the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (OCR) found schools serving majority black students in grades K-12 often had the least distribution of well-qualified teachers to students (OCR 2014). OCR reported that while most teachers are certified, nearly half a million students nationwide attend schools where 60% or fewer of teachers meet all state certification and licensure requirements and that racial disparities were particularly acute in schools where uncertified and unlicensed teachers are concentrated. The OCR report goes on to indicate that nearly 7% of the nation’s black students—totaling over half a million students—attend schools where 80% or fewer of teachers meet these requirements with black students more than four times as likely, and Latino students twice as possible, as white students to attend these schools. Further unequal education practices include inequitable access to quality resources including the availability of tools, technology, and programs, as well as partnerships for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) (Adamson and Darling-Hammond 2012), as well as the socioeconomic status (SES) and funding disparities of predominantly black schools. These unequal education practices have led to inequitable access to a quality STEM education for many black students, prompting the National Science and Technology Council to caution K-12 educators of the increasing shortage of historically marginalized students in STEM fields and its national and global repercussions for the U.S.A. While this increasing shortage of black people in STEM fields might not be the intended outcome as noted in the current demands for STEM, it is nonetheless the de facto outcome as underlined by decades of research and reported statistics (NSF 2019; Palmer et al. 2011). Expectedly, this de facto outcome has led to many questions and concerns about reasons for the inequitable educational experiences of black students and why this growing racial gap in STEM is expected to increase. As a start, one obvious response to these questions is that although many civil rights leaders and education activists have fought for equity in education, the response and progress toward such goals remain slow and inadequate. In this article, the author examines policies and practices from a socioeconomic and racial perspective that contribute to disparage STEM educational experiences for black children. Through critical discussions that explore the dynamics of socioeconomics, race, and policies, this paper explores how SES and inequitable funding have slowed efforts toward increased participation of black students in STEM. Background information regarding the dynamics of educational funding that create racial disparities and unfair access to rich STEM education is shared, and empirical studies which explore STEM experiences of black students are discussed to help determine new pathways to STEM equity and access.",4

Recent research has found that high-poverty children who are afforded the opportunity to move out of housing projects in low-income areas at an early age has had a positive impact on these children’s future earnings and reducing the intergenerational persistence of poverty (Chetty et al. 2016). Neighborhoods also impact earnings and college attendance rates of children across the country (Chetty and Hendren 2018). Not only that, but there is a relationship between black student isolation and the black-white achievement gap (Condron et al. 2013). Reducing racial disparities in exposure to low-income classmates may be an effective way to narrow racial academic achievement gaps (Reardon 2015; Condron 2009). Unfortunately, many schools and school districts across the country are segregated based on race and socioeconomic status. Nationally, 58% of black students attend schools where minority students make up 75% or more of the entire student body (National Center for Education Statistics 2019). Despite years of federal desegregation efforts, minority children are still heavily concentrated in largely minority schools in which most of the students come from disadvantaged backgrounds, and significant racial and ethnic disparities in dropout rates and educational achievement continue to exist (McFarland et al. 2016). Public schools in New Jersey are historically segregated and remain one of the most segregated school systems in the USA (Orfield et al. 2017; Flaxman et al. 2013). Schools that have 90% or more nonwhite students have increased in the past few years, and currently, 28.3% of all New Jersey public schools have 90% or more nonwhite students (Orfield, Ee, & Coughlin, 2017). Although the enrollment of black students has decreased slightly over the past few years, black students make up 15% of public school enrollment in New Jersey public schools (New Jersey Department of Education 2018). Over the past 25 years, black students have become increasingly concentrated in schools that serve a majority nonwhite student population and are the most segregated group in New Jersey public schools (Orfield et al. 2017). According to data from the 2005–2009 American Community Survey, New Jersey is the 6th most segregated state for black-white segregation and the 7th most segregated for Latino-white segregation (Orfield et al. 2017). There is a direct link between residential segregation and school segregation in New Jersey. Housing affordability is one of the reasons for this relationship. There is an absence of integration programs and a severe segregation of subsidized housing in New Jersey that greatly impacts school segregation in the state (Orfield 2013). There is a need for over 1 million affordable homes in New Jersey, and unfortunately, most of the affordable housing is concentrated in the poorer cities with low-quality public schools (Mallach 2013). The New Jersey Fair Housing Act of 1985 created the Council of Affordable Housing so municipalities could devise plans to meet their affordable housing needs. However, the Fair Housing Act did not eliminate exclusionary zoning. Instead, through Regional Contribution Agreements (RCAs), the Fair Housing Act allowed exclusionary zoning to continue as sending municipality to pay for the construction of low- and moderate-income housing somewhere within a certain radius of its borders to a receiving municipality. In this way, RCAs continued exclusionary zoning in New Jersey by providing compensation to other municipalities that had a greater percentage of low-income residents. Under the legislation that was signed on July 17, 2008, the RCA loophole was closed, and all towns are now required to meet all of their fair share obligations within their own borders rather than paying other towns to accept the housing (Fair Share Housing Center n.d.). This paper examines the relationship between changes in affordable housing units in school districts across New Jersey and changes in the white-black academic achievement gap. In addition, this paper examines the role of school demographics on this relationship. First, this paper shows that the reversal of the RCA loophole in 2008 may have had an impact on affordable housing in former sending school districts. Next, this paper investigates the relationship between affordable housing increases and school district demographics. Finally, through stratified regression modeling, this paper investigates the relationship between changes in affordable housing and changes in the white-black academic achievement gaps and the role that school district demographic changes have had on this relationship. This paper shows that there has been an increase in affordable housing units across the state of New Jersey, and school districts which had previously been RCA senders have experienced a larger increase in affordable housing units since the RCA reversal. This study shows that former RCA-sending districts had a larger increase in affordable housing units and that these districts also had a larger increase in the percent of Latino students, school diversity indices, and the percent of free-lunch students. Finally, this paper is the first to show the white-black academic achievement gap is increasing in school districts that formerly acted as RCA receivers when affordable housing continues to increase. These findings provide insight for policies that impact affordable housing in affluent areas and the impact of affordable housing on the academic achievement gap. An increase in affordable housing in former RCA-receiving districts allows for shifts in school demographics that may continue to increase white-black academic gaps.",

S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020, 2020c). Like many other issues pertaining to health and economic disparities, the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic falls disproportionately on Black and Hispanic communities. Through June 13, 2020, the rate of hospitalization for Blacks and Hispanics was more than four times as high as for Whites (CDC, U. S. 2020b). The pandemic is taking a substantial toll on physical, mental, and economic health across the USA, but disparities in whom is impacted by the virus are an additional cause for alarm. Part of the barrier to carefully studying disparities from the pandemic—both their magnitudes and potential explanations—is that current published data on COVID-19 outcomes are coarse (Killeen et al. 2020). Most studies focus on COVID-19 outcomes at highly aggregated levels such as the state (Friedson et al. 2020) or county (Courtemanche et al. 2020). Within a state or county—especially in areas with larger populations—residential segregation by race and ethnicity can be quite stark, meaning that analyzing disparities at such levels misses an important part of the variation. Partway through the pandemic, a number of local and state governments began producing COVID-19 statistics in a more disaggregated fashion—most commonly reporting confirmed cases by ZIP code. This paper provides one of the first attempts to systematically investigate racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 using these newly available ZIP code level data. Specifically, we utilize data on confirmed COVID-19 cases from six cities—New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Baltimore, San Diego, and St. Louis—as well as data on fatalities from New York and Chicago. Our analysis links these COVID-19 outcomes to six separate data sources to control for ZIP code level demographics, housing, socioeconomic status, occupational choices, transportation modes, health care access, long-run opportunity (income mobility and incarceration rates), human mobility, and population health disparities. This rich set of covariates allows us to investigate the extent to which mechanisms that have received popular attention—such as income; education; living in densely populated communities; reliance on public transportation; representation in forward-facing, essential jobs; mobility during lockdowns; pre-pandemic health; and access to health care—contribute to racial and ethnic disparities (Harrison 2020; Hubler et al. 2020; Oppel et al. 2020; CDC, U. S. 2020b). We find statistically significant and economically meaningful disparities for both Blacks and Hispanics at the ZIP code level in confirmed cases, and most of the disparity is remains unexplained even after including extensive controls. Without additional covariates, a 10 percentage point increase in a ZIP code’s share of Black residents is associated with 9.2 additional confirmed COVID-19 cases per 10,000 residents, while a similar change in the Hispanic share is associated with 20.6 additional cases. Both are sizable changes relative to the average confirmed case rate of 153 per 10,000 population. Using decompositions that are insensitive to the ordering of the covariates (Gelbach 2016), we find that at least part of these disparities can be explained by differences in long-run opportunity (income mobility and incarceration rates), human mobility as measured by cell phone activity, and demographics. However, even with an extensive set of controls, more than half of the disparity in COVID-19 cases remains unexplained. For the two cities where we are also able to examine COVID-19 fatalities, we find that differences in confirmed COVID-19 cases strongly predict the observed disparities, in fact entirely eliminating the entire association for proportion Hispanic and the majority of the association for proportion Black.

Vargas,Gabriel R. Sanchez,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"COVID-19 has taken a significant toll on racial and ethnic communities across the country, while early work has focused on the economic and health consequences disproportionately impacting Black Americans (Hardy and Logan 2020). We use this opportunity to focus on how COVID-19 is impacting Latina/o populations. Latino Americans are more likely than non-Hispanic Whites to become ill with the virus and have faced disproportionately high casualty rates when they contract the virus (Hernandez-Vallant et al. 2020). As our article discusses, unfortunately Latino families are also being devastated by the economic recession driven by the need to close down many businesses due to fear of spreading the virus. We draw from a recent Abriendo Puertas/Latino Decisions National Parent Survey to identify the factors that are most highly correlated with two economic stress variables we created based on a battery of survey questions that includes questions on economic stress such as job loss, lost wages, and business closures and economic coping strategies such as using pay-day loans, postponing educational, and health expenditures. Our analysis suggests that not only is a large segment of Latino families facing severe economic stress due to the health pandemic, but a large percentage have only a shockingly small safety net and limited access to financial support to weather this financial stress. Our analysis includes an assessment of the coping techniques Latinos are taking to cope with the economic stress they are facing. When taken together, the survey data suggests a very rough road ahead for far too many Latino families. While descriptive in nature, our manuscript references relevant research that helps contextualize the findings from our survey. Given that Latinos were the population who was hit the hardest by the last economic recession, and took the longest to recover, tracking the financial stress across the Latino community early in this recession is critical.",37

Yet, more recently, transportation employers have expressed concern about the labor shortage of truck drivers due in large part to significant driver turnover. Analysis by the American Trucking Association (ATA) suggests that the shortage of truck drivers is likely to become more acute following future changes to hours of service regulation (ATA 2012). The change in this policy limits the maximum average work week for truck drivers to 70 h, a decrease from the current maximum of 82 h, and requires truck drivers to take a 30-min break during the first 8 h of a shift. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration oversees enforcement of hours-of-service (hos) regulation with the objective of keeping fatigued drivers off the public roadways. While hos-regulation is intended to improve safety performance of drivers, the ATA argues that this change will facilitate carriers expanding their fleet to haul the same amount of freight. The notion of a widespread shortage, however, is not universally shared as research suggests that a perceived shortage of over-the-road drivers in the USA actually depicts high turnover due to low wages given more challenging working conditions following regulatory reform in the trucking industry (Conyngham 2005).Footnote 2 High turnover then creates a need for trucking employers to find a source of stable employment. Noncitizens are likely candidates to satisfy this employment need since temporary residency visa requirements that restrict noncitizen employees’ tenure in the USA limit the amount of time they have to search for alternative employment. Demand for noncitizen truck drivers is further enhanced given demographic trends showing large numbers of truck drivers approaching retirement age without an obvious pool of new entrants with citizenship willing to adopt the lifestyle of an over-the-road truck driver (Conyngham 2005). In response to the recruitment challenges carriers face employing drivers who are US citizens, these employers may view hiring noncitizens as a low-cost approach to meeting the demand for drivers. Indeed, Conyngham argues that too few US citizens are willing to enter driving professions to meet the growing need of the modern trucking industry. He cites evidence in the form of reports of large truckload employers recruiting drivers from foreign lands, and corporations pushing for easing the department of transportation’s (DOT) amendment to NAFTA’s trucking provisions. Evidence of such recruiting is depicted by the number of noncitizen truck drivers employed in the USA increasing consistently from 156,629 in 1996 and peaking at 254,245 in 2006. Even though these numbers fell following the 2007 recession, they remained above 200,000 from 2007 to 2013 (Source: Current Population Survey (CPS) files). Several studies have investigated the effect of immigration on the wages of US citizens employed in low skill occupations (Altonji and Card 1991; Butcher and Card 1991; Lalonde and Topel 1991; Schoeni 1997). However, there is an absence of research examining the influence of noncitizen truck driver employment on the wages of citizen truck drivers. Previous work identifying truck drivers among the top ten occupations of workers migrating from Mexico to the USA highlights the significance of providing such analysis (Borjas and Katz 2007), especially since the largest share of noncitizen truck drivers migrate from Mexico.Footnote 3 In addition, focusing attention on truck driving jobs presents the opportunity to examine noncitizen workers competing for relatively well paying blue-collar jobs. Indeed, even though real truck driver wages have declined since regulatory reform in 1980, they have not declined at the rate of construction jobs, which is another blue-collar occupation that employs a nontrivial number of noncitizens (source: unionstats.com). This study contributes to the debate on the noncitizen employment effect on the wages of US citizens by empirically testing the high immigration employment-low domestic wage hypothesis for truck drivers. Testing this hypothesis for truck drivers contributes to our understanding whether domestic employers are able to address labor shortages due to high turnover rates without adversely affecting wages of US citizens.",

Throughout the nation, veterans who served in the Post-9/11 era responded to the new GI Bill by participating in record numbers. Between 2008 and 2010, during the transition to the Post-9/11 GI Bill, the number of GI Bill participants grew from approximately 541,000 to 800,000.Footnote 1 The GI Bill, as an institution of veterans’ education benefits, is often considered to be one of the “greatest democratizers” of American higher education and the model of race-neutral policies (Onkst 1998). However, the legacy of the GI Bill is tainted by educational disparities that cut through race and geography (Bound and Turner 2003, Herbold 1994). While studies have linked the Post-9/11 GI Bill to increased program utilization and college enrollment, a critical assessment of the Post-9/11 GI Bill across racial and ethnic groups has largely been overlooked (Barr 2015; Simon et al. 2010). In this study, we examine the impact of the Post-9/11 GI Bill with an emphasis on racial and ethnic heterogeneity, specifically college enrollments between White, Black, and Hispanic veterans.Footnote 2 While racial and ethnic disparities in college enrollments has declined over the past 20 years, there remains a significant and persistent gap in enrollments between Black and White college age youth (de Brey 2019, Musu-Gillette 2016). However, racial and ethnic disparities in education go well beyond college enrollments. Black and Hispanic college students are more likely to take on student loan debt and are less likely to graduate relative to their White counterparts (de Brey 2019, Musu-Gillette 2016). The adoption of the Post 9/11 GI Bill provides a unique opportunity to investigate whether federal educational grants and financial aid policies can work to alleviate racial and ethnic disparities in education within a contemporary social, economic, and political context of the USA. Unraveling the impacts of the Post-9/11 GI Bill across race and ethnicity is not only important to veterans’ education policy but may also provide insights into racial and ethnic equality within higher education. The evidence is estimated using a triple-differences evaluation designed to exploit the variation in the timing of the policy and veteran status across race and ethnicity. The empirical model and the robustness checks are evaluated using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) and the American Community Survey (ACS). Our findings suggest that the Post-9/11 GI Bill increased college enrollments by 4 percentage points among all veterans, while disproportionately increasing college enrollments for Black veterans by 4.7 percentage points. Furthermore, this study also reveals that a $10,000 increase in pecuniary educational benefits increased college enrollments for Black and Hispanic veterans by 9.2 and 8.9 percentage points respectively. These results imply veteran’s education benefits play a positive role in reducing racial and ethnic disparities in college achievement, providing a pathway to increase upward mobility among disadvantage groups. However, we argue that the Post-9/11 GI Bill, maintaining its legacy of race neutrality, is successful in reducing the achievement gap only within the contemporary context of the USA. We also maintain that the deficiencies in the implementation of the Post-9/11 GI Bill weakened its ability to have a larger effect in the first few years of the program, particularly among Black and Hispanic veterans. During World War II, the Serviceman’s Readjustment Act of 1944, also known as the GI Bill, was signed into law (Lashbrook 1944). For the first time in US history, non-disabled veterans were awarded financial assistance for education, the financial opportunity to pursue a college education after fighting the war. Depending on length of service, the GI Bill provided education benefits lasting between 1 and 4 years. Benefits included tuition and a monthly stipend that accounted for about half of the opportunity cost of not working (Bound and Turner 2002). At the time, tuition allotments were generous enough to cover tuition, expenses, and books at some of the most expensive schools in the nation (Bound and Turner 2002). However, non-White veterans, especially Black veterans in the South, continued to experience tremendous obstacles in their pursuits of higher education despite the promise of GI Bill. Between 1940 and 1973 men were conscripted into the armed forces to meet the needs of the military generated by overseas conflicts. The end of the Vietnam War marked the end of conscription and the beginning of an all-volunteer military. Since the introduction of the all-volunteer military, the overall demographics of recruits have changed. Educational attainment and IQ have increased substantially, a majority of recruits now represent middle and lower socioeconomic classes, Black recruits are overrepresented, and Hispanic recruits are underrepresented (Rostker and Yeh 2006). As a result of the demographic change in the military, the demographics of the veteran population have changed over time. Since WWII, the GI Bill has evolved to meet the needs of the armed forces. In a military that fills its ranks with volunteer citizens, the Post-9/11 GI Bill was an unprecedented change in benefits for veterans and recruitment efforts. On August 1, 2009, the Post-9/11 GI Bill became available to qualified veterans with at least 90 days of active duty service after September 10, 2001. Veterans who served after September 10, 2001 (Post-9/11 era), and separated from active duty before the policy change are also eligible for the Post-9/11 education benefits. The Post-9/11 GI Bill originally included 36 months of paid tuition, a monthly living stipend adjusted to the basic housing allowance rate and eliminated the program enrollment fee required under the Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB). In 2010, congress expanded the Post-9/11 GI Bill eliminating the tuition cap for public institutions, allowing active duty service members to transfer the benefit to their spouse or child, providing an annual book stipend, and extending the benefits to qualified Reservist and National Guard members.Footnote 3 The monetary benefit increase from the MGIB to the Post-9/11 GI Bill was significant. Veterans in Texas and California, states with the largest population of GI Bill participants, experienced an annual benefit increase of approximately $10,132 and $15,496 respectively.Footnote 4 Along with the substantial increase in education benefits, the implementation of the new GI Bill resulted in confusion and a backlog of claims and payments. In response the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) instituted emergency payments of $3000 to those who did not receive payment (Steele et al. 2010). Within the first 2 months of implementation (the end of fiscal year 2009), the VA had processed 34,393 Post-9/11 GI Bill claims.Footnote 5 The number of backlogged claims almost doubled the number of processed claims at 63,661 in October 2009 (the beginning of fiscal year 2010). As a result, many veterans who applied for the Post-9/11 GI Bill and enrolled in college did not receive benefit payments for many months. By the end of fiscal year 2010, the VA had processed 365,640 Post-9/11 GI Bill claims with only 18,311 pending claims to start the 2010 fall semester. The backlog of claims and sluggish response may have discouraged many Post-9/11 veterans from applying during the first or second year. Furthermore, Black and Hispanic veterans may have disproportionately been affected by the backlog. Studies on the GI Bill have been conducted in retrospect as far back as its inception during WWII. For instance, Bound and Turner (2002) estimated that the GI Bill combined with military service had a positive effect on educational attainment of veteran returning from the war. WWII veterans on average completed 0.52 years of schooling more than non-veterans, a difference of 10 percentage points (Bound and Turner 2002). They also estimate that military service increased educational attainment by 0.15 years, a difference of 4 percentage points (Bound and Turner 2002). However, when evaluated across race, Bound and Turner (2003) found that the GI Bill had a negligible impact on educational outcomes of Black WWII veterans in the South. An early study by O’Neill (1977) evaluated the Post-Korean Conflict and the Vietnam Era GI Bill. Secondary analysis revealed that GI Bill participation by Black veterans exceeded that of non-Black veterans by 9 percentage points. This was observed only after controlling for characteristics such as Armed Forces Qualifying Test (AFQT) scores and prior educational attainment. In another study, Angrist (1993) investigated the effects of a change in GI Bill benefits during a critical period when the military transitioned from conscription to an all-volunteer military. He provided evidence suggesting that veterans eligible for generous education benefits were 23 percentage-points more likely to use their education benefits. In a later study, Angrist and Chen (2011) showed that the Vietnam era military conscription also increased college attainment among Vietnam veterans. Two studies have investigated the effects of the GI Bill on veteran education in the Post-9/11 era. Simon et al. (2010) conducted a study on military retention and veteran benefit usage under the MGIB. They found that a $10,000 increase in veteran education benefits would increase the probability of GI Bill participation by 5 percentage points. Their results had great implications for veteran college enrollment under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. In a more recent study, Barr (2015) was the first to directly investigate the immediate impact of the Post-9/11 GI Bill on veterans’ education. Results from his study suggested that the Post-9/11 GI Bill increased college enrollments by 15 to 20% for veterans. However, Barr (2015) also concluded that the Post-9/11 GI Bill did not have a disproportionate impact on college enrollments between Black and White veterans. Overall, these studies have shown that the GI Bill as an institution for veteran education benefits have had positive effects on college enrollments among veterans since WWII. Although other studies have provided evidence of a positive relationship between educational benefits and college enrollments (Cornwell et al. 2006; Dynarski 2000; Seftor and Turner 2002), current studies on the Post-9/11 GI Bill do not focus on racial or ethnic heterogeneity. This study attempts to fill in this gap and differs from previous studies in several ways. First, our study focuses on disentangling the effects of the Post-9/11 GI Bill across race and ethnicity in a triple-differences model. We use this analysis to estimate the degree to which college enrollments among Black and Hispanic veterans changed relative to Whites. Second, we use include a longer time frame after the implementation of the Post-9/11 GI Bill in our analysis relative to the Barr (2015) study. The additional post-implementation years provide the opportunity to evaluate how the backlogs of GI bill claims in the early years may have disproportionately disadvantaged Black veterans. While our primary analysis is focused on college enrollments across race and ethnicity, we extend our investigation to estimate how the Post-9/11 GI Bill may have impacted college enrollment among veterans who are similarly positioned on the basis of race and ethnicity. This analysis begins by first estimating the effects of the Post-9/11 GI Bill on veteran college enrollments. Figure 1 shows college enrollment rates for veterans and non-veterans over time using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS). In the figure, veteran and non-veteran enrollment rates are shown to trend along parallel paths under the MGIB (pretreatment period). However, under the Post-9/11 GI Bill (treatment period), veteran enrollment rates increase relative to non-veterans. The enrollment trends in Fig. 1 display a natural distinction between pre- and post-policy implementation. The figure provides a visual motivation to use the difference-in-differences (DID) framework. A probit model is used to evaluate the DID given the discrete choice of enrollment. College enrollment rates The empirical model is evaluated as: The variable Veterani indicates individual i as a veteran (treatment group) when Veterani = 1 and a non-veteran (control group) when Veterani = 0. Post911t is the treatment variable indicating each year, t, before and after the change in veteran benefits. Post911t = 1 for all treatment years (Post-9/11 GI Bill) and Post911t = 0 for all non-treatment years (MGIB). The interaction term Veterani × Post911t identifies the effects of the treatment on the intended treatment group. This term is estimated at the margins for the probit model and is interpreted as the marginal impact of the Post-9/11 GI Bill on veteran college enrollments. χ is a vector of control variables to be included in the model. Next, the heterogeneous effects of the Post-9/11 GI Bill on veterans across race are estimated by extending the difference-in-differences model to the triple-differences model below. In the triple-differences model the variable Racei is added to indicate non-Hispanic Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics. The Veterani, Post911t, and Racei triple interaction will estimate the treatment effect for Black and Hispanic veterans, where White non-veterans are considered the control group. The model is flexible in that the treatment effect can be estimated across racial groups. In both empirical models, the control variables include age, gender, race, marital status, the number of children, and the mean and standard deviation of income among individuals with a bachelor’s degree or higher. The mean income variable was calculated in 2010 dollars at the state level across year and race. It is assumed that individuals are aware of and use labor market conditions faced by college graduates to form a heuristic expectation of future wages when making the college enrollment decision. The standard deviation around the mean of income is included to estimate the effect of labor market uncertainties on college enrollment. A similar method was used by Lazear (2005) to determine the likelihood of individual entrepreneurship. Mincer (1974) explains that dispersion of income can be used as an index of risk for human capital investment. When income dispersion is high, those who are relatively risk averse will be less likely to enroll in college. Informally, individuals may ask themselves “how much can I expect make with a college education?” to “am I able to earn that much?” The data includes the October School Enrollment Supplement subset of the Current Population Survey (CPS) and the American Community Survey (ACS). Both surveys are nationally representative and provide detailed characteristics for veteran and non-veteran populations. The October School Enrollment Supplement contains detailed education enrollment characteristics used to determine the effects of the Post-9/11 GI Bill on veteran college enrollments. The sample used in our analysis includes all respondents observed between 2006 and 2013. Observations are restricted using several conditions. First, individuals are restricted by age between 22 and 50. The lower bound on age is designed to remove veterans with less than 2 years of active duty service. It is an approximation given that individuals may enlist up to the age of 42.Footnote 6 Post-9/11 veterans with at least 36 months of active duty service (30 months for disabled veterans) qualify for the full amount of payable benefits. Veterans with less time in service may qualify for less than the full amount of payable benefits. The upper bound is designed to capture older veterans who separate from the military (possibly after retirement) but remain GI Bill eligible. Post-9/11 veterans remain GI Bill eligible for up to 15 years after the last day of separation. Second, all active duty service members are removed from the sample. Third, individuals with less than a high school diploma or GED are dropped from the sample. High school diplomas and GEDs have been one of the minimum requirements for enlistment in the all-volunteer military. The lower bound restriction on education gives a better comparison of ability and selection between veterans and non-veterans in the absence of AFQT scores—characteristics used to minimize selection bias. Last, individuals with a bachelor’s degree or higher were removed from the sample used in our regression analysis. Commissioned officers and enlisted service members both qualify for the Post-9/11 GI Bill, potentially a benefit to finance a graduate education. By imposing the upper bound restriction on education, the intention is to restrict the sample to enlisted veterans. However, some enlisted veterans may not be observed as a result of this restriction scheme.Footnote 7 In Table 1, we use the restricted sample to compare basic characteristics between veterans and non-veterans before and after the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Before the Post-9/11 GI Bill, veterans and non-veterans were no different in terms of college enrollment rates. However, after the implementation of the Post-9/11 GI Bill, veterans experienced a greater increase in college enrollments. A difference in enrollment rates between pre- and post-treatment periods, among veterans, shows an increase in college enrollments of approximately four percentage points. A naïve DID calculation, using the enrollment rates for both veterans and non-veterans, suggests a potential treatment effect of three percentage points; this is of course, without controlling for any individual characteristics. Figure 1 indicates the similarity in college enrollment rates between veterans and non-veterans during the pretreatment period and provides the motivation to pursue a more formalized DID regression analysis. Other estimates, presented in Table 1, suggest veterans are more likely to be male, married, White, and less likely to be Hispanic relative to the civilian population. Also, in the pretreatment period veterans are more likely to be Black relative to the civilian population, but not during the treatment period. Given the historical context of the GI Bill and military service among racial and ethnic minorities, how has educational attainment affected racial and ethnic educational achievement gaps? To provide insight into this question, we estimate degree attainment across race/ethnicity and veteran status before the implementation of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. As presented in Table 2, respondents were categorized into the following degree attainment groups: has a high school diploma/GED (also includes respondents some college but no college degree), has an associate degree, and has at least a bachelor’s degree. Table 2 also contains degree attainment relative risk ratios calculated for Black and Hispanics relative to Whites. The relative risk ratios are used to evaluate the proportional representation in each degree attainment category across race/ethnicity and veteran status. The results in column 4 are clear—there is an underrepresentation of Black and Hispanic non-veterans holding associate and bachelor’s degrees relative to White non-veterans. The results in column 5 suggests that military service coupled with the GI Bill reduces some of the racial and ethnic achievement gaps, where White veteran’s educational achievement is considered the baseline. However, if we use White non-veteran’s educational achievement as the baseline, we see that there is a consistent underrepresentation of Black veterans who have attained a bachelor’s degree similar to that of Black non-veterans. The brief descriptive analysis, presented in Table 2, further suggests that there may be a penalty to higher educational achievement among Whites given military service. For Hispanic, the description suggests a potential educational achievement advantage due to military service. These basic descriptive findings stress the core focus of this study as an investigation into the racial and ethnic disparities. Moreover, that the interplay between military service and race/ethnicity are apparent in terms of educational outcomes. This particular exercise underscores the importance of understanding how the GI Bill, specifically the Post-9/11 GI Bill, influences the flow of veterans who are racial and ethnic minorities into institutions of higher learning. Additionally, military service may fundamentally alter the terrain by which Black, Hispanic, and White veterans participate in the labor market and how employers perceive them (Kleykamp 2013; Loughran 2014; Martorell et al. 2013). Given that the GI Bill is race-neutral, all Post-9/11 veterans experienced the same benefit change.Footnote 8 However, there may exist distinct labor market outcomes for Blacks, Hispanics, and Whites at the intersection of military service and educational achievement. Deciding to enroll in college may be less appealing for Black veterans or Hispanic veterans who observe wage disparities in segments of the labor market that require higher education. Following the results from Table 2, the returns on education among veterans in the labor market may be smaller than that of non-veterans, a result that could be exacerbated across race and ethnicity. The empirical evidence indicating a differential in college enrollment behavior in response to changes in the return on investment across race is mixed (Cameron and Heckman 2001; Kane 1994). Another concern is the uncertainty of labor market outcomes. Becker (1975) suggests that uncertainty exists given the nature of the labor market and the measure of one’s own ability. Individuals considering college take into account cost “today,” expected earnings “tomorrow,” and the risk associated with the human capital investment. To address this issue, we use the ACS to estimate the mean and standard deviation of income among individuals with a bachelor’s degree or higher. The means and standard deviations of income are estimated across state, year, and race using ACS replicate weights. A cold-deck imputation was used to impute the ACS estimates to observations in the CPS based on state, year, and race/ethnicity.",1

Reece,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Over the past two decades, the number of color discrimination claims filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has quadrupled even though the number of overall claims has remained relatively consistent. This signals a spike in public awareness and acknowledgement of color or skin tone discrimination. Concurrently, scholarship dedicated to color has increased dramatically, and skin tone has become an almost standard inclusion in social science surveys. As a result, our knowledge of the extent of color stratification has improved significantly in recent years, and, so far, it seems ever-present, permeating almost every aspect of society. However, our knowledge continues to expand in important ways. As we continue to establish that color stratification is a constant throughout American society, we must also develop our understanding of how it works. Although we have made recent strides in developing theories to explain the mechanisms (such as Goldsmith et al. 2007; Hargrove 2018a, b; Finkeldey and Demuth 2019; Louie 2019; Monk 2015; Painter et al. 2015; Reece 2018a, b, c), we still have ways to go. One vital step is to examine how different groups are affected by color stratification. For example, we have produced a robust amount of research that demonstrates the near-ubiquity of color stratification among black Americans, but moving forward to truly grasp the contours of the phenomenon, we have to see black Americans as more than a homogenous group and explore whether colorism affects all black Americans equally. The most straightforward way to launch a research platform that investigates how color intersects with other social locations is through an analysis of gender, where full comparisons of the effects of color between men and women are limited. Although income and wages are among the most studied outcomes in color research with ten studies (Goldsmith et al. 2006; Goldsmith et al. 2007; Hersch 2006; Hunter 1998; Hunter 2002; Keith and Herring 1991; Kreisman and Rangel 2015; Monk 2014; Robst et al. 2011; Sweet et al. 2007), all consistently showing considerable advantages for lighter skinned black Americans, they lack a thorough gender analysis. Some of these elected to build a theoretical framework that focused on one gender (i.e., Hunter 1998, 2002), others focused on a single gender to circumvent data and methodological concerns (i.e., Goldsmith et al. 2006; Goldsmith et al. 2007; Kreisman and Rangel 2015), and others offer side-by-side gender comparisons but not necessarily intersectional comparisons (i.e., Hersch 2006; Keith and Herring 1991). I seek to build on this groundwork by bringing an intersectional lens to an analysis of color and gender, where I will not only compare the effect of color between men and women but also compare the combined effect of gender and color. This will show whether colorism remains consistent across gender, provide insight into whether gender or color is more important to the life outcomes of black Americans, and, because it is impossible to isolate real world experiences to a single social characteristic, this will give us a better view into how black Americans experience life. Ultimately, my results reveal a complex relationship between gender and color. Both lighter skinned men and lighter skinned women earned more than their darker skinned counterparts. However, when comparing combinations of gender and color light-skinned men seem to stand apart from everyone else, suggesting they benefit from a combination of favorable gender status and favorable color status. Conversely, dark-skinned people seem to suffer the effects of subordinate color status, while there seems to be no significant difference between the individual incomes of light-skinned women, medium-skinned women, and medium-skinned men.",6

Academic literature and stories in the popular press have documented an increasing spread in the income distribution and a dilution of the middle class since the Great Recession (e.g., Meyer and Sullivan 2013; Cynamon and Fazzari 2016). At the same time, other researchers have noted the specific importance of local-level dynamics for understanding changing spatial inequality (e.g., Holmes and Berube 2016). Further articles on labor markets have described worker substitutions and changing skill needs in industries sensitive to technological change and mechanization of production processes reducing the availability of jobs for people in the lower end of the skill distribution (e.g., Autor and Dorn 2013). Labor market polarization (i.e., an increased gap between concentrations of higher-skilled and lower-skilled jobs) is seen as one feasible explanation of increasing earning inequality over time as employment becomes concentrated in services on one hand and in non-routine high-skill occupations on the other, squeezing out occupations traditionally in the middle (e.g., Rendall and Weiss 2016). Concurrent to these economic dynamics, the 2012 to 2016 time period was characterized by growing racial and ethnic tensions in local communities (e.g., Peterson 2017). These tensions, coupled with Trump’s campaign platform highlighting protectionism of US-born workers, provided a setting for a seemingly unpredictable election (Collingwood 2016). One leading narrative, highlighted in the literature, suggests that Trump’s win may have related to the mobilization of white, working class voters in a different way than in past election years and status threat (e.g., Lamont et al. 2017; McQuarrie 2017; Morgan and Lee 2017; Morgan 2018). Political scientists have long recognized negative correlations between economic inequality and political participation usually manifested in terms of lower voter turnout (e.g., Solt 2008; Solt 2010). Furthermore, negative racial attitudes have been shown interrelated with both economic conditions related to business cycles and with voter behavior (e.g., Jayadev and Johnson 2017; Knuckey and Kim 2015). We draw from these insights in this paper as we examine if and how voters’ life circumstances (including those related to labor market polarization, inequality, and race) affected their election behavior between 2012 and 2016. In this paper and unlike previous entries to the literature, we isolate the unique contributions of social and economic circumstances leading up to electoral outcomes in the 2016 voting cycle using econometric decomposition to pinpoint the relative importance of compositional versus structural change at the local level and to highlight the primary contributing factors to each of these components of change. We contrast results in the presidential and congressional races to highlight differences in the relative contributions of competing dynamics while taking a regional approach by examining the importance of county-level characteristics and emphasizing inequalities within and across communities. We also compare battleground with non-battleground states to highlight differences in key political targets. County-level party share data from Dave Leip’s Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections reveal the substantial local-level spatial variation that we analyze. This is the lowest geographic level party share data available to our knowledge. Examining elections at refined geographic levels is well-supported in the regional science literature (e.g., Pattie et al. 2015; Pattie and Johnston 1998). Figure 1 illustrates patterns in the difference between the Republican presidential vote share in 2012 and 2016.Footnote 1 Counties with higher Republican shares in 2016 than in 2012 tend to be in the Midwest and northeast. Counties with higher Democratic shares over this period tend to be the southwest. Change in Republican Vote Share in Presidential Elections from 2012 until 2016. Source: Dave Leip’s Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections and authors’ calculations In some cases, the changes documented for the presidential vote share diverge from congressional election outcomes. Figure 2 shows patterns in the difference between the Republican House of Representatives vote share in 2012 and 2016. Some states that had large increase in Republican presidential vote share saw significant decrease in Republican House vote share. This observation suggests that the 2016 presidential race was distinctive in terms of voting dynamics and that voting behavior digressed from being uniformly partisan. We therefore argue that these figures suggest significant structural changes measured in terms of rates of impact on voter behavior, and we contribute to the literature by isolating these aspects of change. Since elected officials may affect economic outcomes along several dimensions,Footnote 2 understanding the dynamics of vote shares is important to economics in addition to applications elsewhere in the social sciences. Local-level analysis is particularly relevant. Change in Republican vote share in House of Representatives Races from 2012 until 2016. Source: Dave Leip’s Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections and authors’ calculations The paper proceeds as follows. We start by outlining relevant literature indicating aspects of changing community patterns over time and relate these to hypotheses regarding recent elections. To this end, we summarize patterns in county-level economic and demographic data such as household income, poverty and unemployment rates, occupational characteristics of local labor markets, racial and ethnic diversity, and educational levels. We then present details of the empirical methodology in which we estimate Republican vote share regressions for 2012 and for 2016 for presidential and congressional elections respectively, and use Blinder-Oaxaca decompositions to highlight how observable community change does not fully explain these election outcomes. Thus, we compare differences in observed levels of characteristics to changing rates of returns of both economic and demographic variables. Our empirical results provide an ex post decomposition of the relative importance of differences in observed economic indicators capturing inequality and polarization that is interrelated with continued, yet unequal, recovery following the Great Recession, and of changes in demographic distributions which may reflect economic class and racial pressures reaching a critical tipping point manifesting in Donald Trump’s 2016 win of the presidential race. We also show how changes in congressional elections in this same time period were less dramatic and highlight differences across battleground states where campaigning may have been more concentrated. We argue that these results show how election results can be greatly impacted by structural change (in terms of the changing relative importance of community-level factors in contributing to voter behavior) intersected with the labor market and demographic dynamics themselves. This finding is particularly relevant as the 2020 US presidential election approaches especially since inequality, labor market polarization, and demographic dynamics have continued.",

“Sociology has been – and still is – a white-led and white-dominated field and, therefore, it should not surprise anyone that the logic of analysis and methods used to investigate racial matters reflect this social fact.”
 - Eduardo Bonilla-Silva and Tukufu Zuberi, White Logic, White Methods: Racism and Methodology The institutionalization of higher education in the USA led to the perpetuation of the American achievement ideology in US culture (Dewey 2016). This belief in the positive relationship between an individual’s education, hard work and effort, and their success has never been applicable to Black people,Footnote 1 especially Black women, in the same way it is for white people (Hochschild 1984; Ford 1992) despite our continued attempts to “make it.” As a Black woman myself, I grew up being told education was the way to professional success and financial stability. But for Black scholars, especially those who, like me, write, research, and teach about race and racism, there are structural and cultural blocks to those achievements. This paper examines a specific discipline, sociology, to uncover how and why “achievement,” in terms of position, salary, and notoriety, is less attainable for Black scholars. In sociology, Black scholars’ difficulty establishing similar financial stability as our white colleagues and peers, despite a shared level of education, means the issue of economics across the discipline is race-specific and must be addressed. Rates of Black students in higher education from bachelors to terminal degrees continues to increase annually over the last 30 years (Cottom 2017). However, higher degree completion rates have not significantly increased annual income or wealth accumulation in Black communities over the same period (Nettles and Perna 1995; Spalter-Roth et al. 2019). Black sociology scholars logged the second fewest number of earned doctorate doctorates 2006–2012 (Fig. 1). The 701 doctorates awarded to Black people over this six-year period are less than Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, and white scholars, and second lowest overall. Our underrepresentation in the discipline suggests that the marginalization of Black scholars in higher education is unique from that of our other non-white colleagues who experience their own distinct forms of discrimination and prejudice not rooted in the same historical or disciplinary foundation. As such all raw distribution data collected as part of this analysis are broken into Black and non-Black comparisons.
 NSF survey of earned doctorates by race/ethnicity, sociology 2006–2012. Source: NSF/NIH/USED/USDA/NEH/NASA, 2006–2012 Survey of Earned Doctorates The lagging economic position for Black sociologists is directly related to disciplinary evaluation of scholarship, and research agendas focused on Black communities, and the oppressions they experience. In particular, culturally perpetuated beliefs about the quality and value of research conducted by Black scholars examining Black people weakens the professional power of our work in tenure-track job searches, as well as tenure evaluations (Matthew 2016), and, in doing so, stagnates upward social mobility for Black sociologists. Basic descriptive statistics paint a clear picture of continued marginalization of Black sociologists, especially among the top 20 ranked sociology departments in the USA (U.S. News and World Report 2017). This begins with admittance into and mentorship at well-ranked programs. Being a graduate of a top 20 program significantly increases your likelihood of landing a tenure-track job at a top research university (Emerson 2018). The remaining 120 or so programs are more likely to place graduates in “teaching schools, regional (university), or the private sector (p.1)” where research and publishing is less directly connected to a long-term financial or professional position. Though increases in college and graduate school enrollment among underrepresented minority students continue, such increases do not represent a diversification of higher education faculty or significant shifts in class membership for Black degree holders. Only 57 of 1056 sociology doctorates that were conferred in 2018 went to Black students (ASA 2020). In the top 20 sociology departments, Black graduate students are even more underrepresented. In June 2020 only 12 of the 213 sociology graduate students designated as “on the market” on the department websiteFootnote 2 were Black (Table 1). These numbers are important because graduate students from the top 20 departments are more likely to take jobs in similarly ranked programs (Emerson 2018) where salaries are considerable higher (Chronicle Data 2019) than other types of institutions, but sociology departments are “very male, and very white” across the discipline (Romero 2017). Such insularity within the top programs in the discipline stunt opportunities for the upward social mobility typically associated with jobs in those places (Clauset et al. 2015), especially for Black scholars.
 Underrepresentation of Black graduate students, and subsequently Black faculty, maintain the white supremacistFootnote 3 academic culture on which all US colleges and universities are founded (Harris 2019), where white people gatekeep access to tenure-track jobs, and the job security they promise, as well as the ability to publish in top journals often necessary for earning tenure if a tenure-track job is secured. Increasing numbers of Black Ph.Ds. are not translating to increases in tenure-track positions, or tenured faculty, as a result. Instead, Black students face perpetual traumas in institutional structures and campus community cultures dedicated to our continued marginalization. The social media hashtag #BlackInTheIvory, started by two Black communications scholars in June 2020 generated more than 40,000 tweets from other Black scholars from around the world (Diep 2020) detailing individual experiences en mass to highlight, in real time, clear systems of institutional racism in higher education. Thousands of the hashtag participants discuss experiences of racism and misogynoirFootnote 4 specifically in the discipline of sociology. Many participants revealed that this is the first time they have spoken publicly about their experiences suggesting that the undercurrent of systemic racism in the discipline is made largely invisible by fears of professional punishment. Moreover, their silence allows white sociologists to be willfully ignorant of the prevalence of racism throughout the discipline. Academic publishing, both in presses and journals, is one mechanism used to maintain the overall whiteness of the discipline. In sociology, publication in top journals remain dominated by white scholars (Delgado 1984; Hermanowicz and Clayton 2020; Pedersen 2012), and scholarship on race, especially decisions on a project’s validity, reliability, and generalizability, are decided by the majority white editorial force who review the work. Moreover, there is a direct connection between Black scholars’ representation in top departments and publication in these journals. Through this process, white sociologists develop and decide, almost singularly, what is relevant or innovative in research on race; Black sociologists are perpetually disadvantaged in the discipline, as a result. But much of what blocks Black sociologists from developing a critical mass of representation in ranked departments, and subsequently become widely published and cited, is cultural and structural rather than explicitly empirical (Clemente 1974). This is not a widely researched topic because it benefits the discipline to ignore the lack of representation among sociology programs and academic journals when the majority of scholars are white people. Instead, crowd-sourced stories of Black graduate students being advised against race-focused research agendas, difficulty placing race-focused academic articles, and tenure and promotion denials based on the “rigor” of their research agendas (Sullivan 2020; Flaherty 2020) when focused on Black communities span decades. Continued attempts by white social scientists to undermine research done by Black sociologists on social issues within the Black community, pejoratively dubbed “me-search” or “me-studies” (Gordon 2002; Creswell 2003; McMillan and Schumacher 2010; Heath 2015; Ayoub and Rose 2016), as too subjective, and therefore unscientific, negatively impacts Black sociologists’ professional position, and their economic position among scholars at large. Minimizing “me-search” in favor of “objective” race research undertaken by white sociologists instigates difficulties Black sociologists have making professional progress in the discipline. The continued invalidation of research conducted by Black sociologists studying Black oppressions maintains disparities in salary, rank, and tenure decisions between Black and white sociologists across the discipline. This is not a new phenomenon; rather, it is reflective of a discipline whose American origins are built on urban research made famous by white sociologists in Chicago while actively ignoring the scholarship of Black sociologists, including W.E.B. Du Bois, in Atlanta.",11

As researchers analyze and document micro-, meso-, and macro-level social phenomena, studies on topics from racism to poverty include academic and applied implications and corresponding strategies for redress often borne out of the experiences and interests of the researchers. Moreover, some studies feature the lives of Black sociologists in ways that inform the discipline about how they navigated various forms of inequality to forge singular sociological careers, add to existing literature in seminal ways, and encourage readers to apply their research for community change. A model of academic-informed civic engagement is first, and quite possibly best, exemplified by the life and legacy of W.E.B. Du Bois. Works such as The Philadelphia Negro (1908[1969]), The Negro Church (1903[2003]), The Negro American Family (1908[1969]), and The Negro (1908[1969]) represent empirical, mixed-methodological scholarship on the trials and triumphs of the Black experience and suggestions for possible reform for both Whites and Blacks, yet Du Bois’ Dark Princess: A Romance (1928[1974]) and finally, The Autobiography of W.E.B. Du Bois (2007) enable readers to glimpse some of his personal experiences, challenges, and growth areas that inform his life’s work—to use knowledge to improve the conditions of Blacks—and much of Du Bois’ charge included how Blacks could and should engage in civic/community work to foster individual and collective improvement. Civic engagement is indelibly connected to the research of other Black sociologists. For example, in Black Sociologists: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives (1974), Blackwell and Janowitz document some of the historical challenges and achievements of Black sociologists in the USA. As they note, “to be a Black sociologist also entailed civic activity” (p. xv). In addition, the legacy of the founder of the Association of Black Sociologists suggests that Blackwell “was propelled by his advocacy and activism into roles as organizer, planner, human rights leader, mentor, urban strategist, academic administrator, civil rights leader, and community organizer” (Dennis and Reed 2018: 7). Blackwell’s influence, particularly during the turbulent 1960s–70s, includes illumining racial and social inequities inside and outside of academia, studying dimensions of Black life from a culturally sensitive perspective in works like The Black Community (1975), and disseminating his work to foster activism in the Black community (Dennis 2018). Moreover, his work in the Peace Corps, United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Southern Education Foundation provide examples of how Black sociology can inform community activism (Reed 2018). Sociology and social justice work have also been championed by Balck women scholars. Aldridge’s ground-breaking book, Imagine a World: Pioneering Black Women Sociologists (2009) examines the experiences of five nationally-reputed sociologists. Jacquelyne Johnson Jackson, LaFrancis Rodgers-Rose, Joyce A. Ladner, Doris Wilkinson, and Delores P. Aldridge were pioneers during the same period as their male contemporaries such as James Blackwell, but were not formally included in the Black sociological “canon.” In addition to being some of the first Black women recipients of doctorate degrees in sociology, some went on (example, Aldridge) to become the first tenured Black sociology faculty at a predominately White university, the first female leader of a national sociological organization (example, Johnson Jackson), and pivotal community servants (example, Rodgers-Rose). Moreover, using the voices of these women scholars, Aldridge’s book chronicles their challenges navigating racism and sexism to forge unique places in the discipline and engage civically in non-academic spaces. Similarly, Washington and Cunnigen’s (2002) Confronting the American Dilemma of Race: The Second Generation of Black American Sociologists depicts how Black sociologists during the mid-twentieth century navigated racial segregation in ways that informed and undergirded sociological scholarship on racism and race relations. They suggest that for “second generation” Black sociologists such as E. Franklin Frazier, St. Clair Drake, Horace Cayton, and Charles Johnson, the imperative to engage in research with broader applied implications was crucial for their peers and the Black community. Recent research details the legacies of more contemporary Black sociologists such as William Julius Wilson and Mary Pattillo to illustrate how disciplinary inquiry around topics such as religion, feminism, racism, class, the urban experience, and inequality has been enhanced by the efforts of Audre Lorde, James Baldwin, Ida B. Wells, and August Wilson (Hunter 2018). The above synopsis is not exhaustive. Alexander Crummell, Anna Julia Cooper, Walter Wallace, Oliver Cornwell Cox, and Sojourner Truth represent other examples of historic Black sociologists whose work intentionally influenced community change. Contemporary Black sociologists are continuing this tradition. In 2018, about 9.0–10.0% of the approximately 3000–3500 sociologists in the USA are Black/African American (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2020). Although seemingly a relatively small number, their impact is prodigious in terms of: performing research on race, inequality, and marginalization of Blacks and other people of color; creating social policy to address such disparities; providing methods of redress for the broader society; serving as a compass around social justice in non-academic spaces; informing governmental agencies about racial inequities; and recruiting and mentoring Black students in higher education (American Sociological Association 2020; Barnes et al. 2014; Bhambra 2014; Blackwell and Janowitz 1974; Bracey et al. 1971; Young 2001). The current study extends these contributions by examining ways in which the professional lives of a cadre of Black sociologists play out personally. Moreover, these findings may inform readers about some of the demographic and attitudinal factors and pre-existing ties that can affect the ability of race scholars to address challenges they often personally experience. In sum, this section illustrates how research on issues such as race, economics, and gender has and continues to inform civic engagement when these dynamics are intertwined in the lives of Black sociologists. But what about the civic efforts of Black sociologists today?",

In its origin, the education system only permitted 20% of American citizens to enter into colleges and universities, most of whom were White males. Through many political wars resulting in small victories, access has now been granted, with an overemphasis being given to “diversity and inclusion” for the student population, without giving proper attention to the conceptualization of such terms. Representation matters. Students of color are often stigmatized with notions of under-preparedness and having a lack of motivation. In this paper, we contend that the issues that currently face the higher education institution both begin and end at the foundation of the structure itself, administration. Students of color make up approximately 45% of the population of predominantly White institutions (PWIs); of those, approximately three-fourths are Black college students (Allen 1992; Fleming 1984). Since the 1960s, the enrollment of Black students at PWIs has improved considerably (Fleming 1984; Thomas 1991). Black women are the largest growing population of students being credentialed at those institutions, and yet recent data shows that Black women faculty makes up 3% of the population. The Survey of Earned Doctorates reports that just 31 Black women graduated with doctorates in sociology in 2016. According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, “75 out of every 100 full-time faculty members at four-year colleges are White” (Myers 2016). In a recent study by Li and Koedel (2017), Whites are overrepresented across numerous departments, including sociology. Similarly, a survey conducted by the American Economics’ Association (AEA) reported that nearly half of women in the field of sociology received unequal treatment by having the value of their intellectual work minimized (American Economic Association 2019). A report by the National Center for Education Statistics shows that across all institutions, including community colleges and 4-year institutions, full-time professors who are men receive eighteen thousand more than women on a 9-month contract in degree-granting postsecondary institutions. Research shows that there are substantial race and gender differences in salaries and treatment to the extent that Black women gross less than White and Black males. On average, Black faculty received lower salaries and earned approximately $10,000 to $15,000 less per year compared to their White counterparts. Strangely, in an institution as prestigious as the academy, those ratios are still reflected in the disproportionate pay for work overload and salary gaps between Black women and their White, male counterparts. Though many institutions seem to be diverse from within, many institutions face barriers in keeping and graduating faculty and students of color (McClain and Perry 2017). While studies have explored the experiences of Black doctoral students and faculty, research on gender and race inside the sociological house is limited (Wingfield 2019). The leak that exists in the academic pipeline is centered around the gatekeepers, a lack of mentoring, and salary differentials, which all lead to job dissatisfaction, decreased retention, higher rates of battle fatigue, and workplace stress, which all create a climate of distrust in higher education in general (Edwards and Ross 2018; Pitt 2016). If we are to improve the academy, pipe patching is not enough. Sociology, like many of the social sciences and humanities, has long histories of excluding Black faculty (Bayer and Rouse 2016; Cooper 2017; Giddings 2008; Hurtado 1996; Zavella 1988). This article offers solutions on how to fix the pipes that are responsible for the leak in the academic pipeline on Black women sociologists.",3

Bishop,Juan Gabriel Rodríguez,Lester A. Zeager,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Social scientists have long sought to understand the persistent disparities in racial outcomes in the United States. The disparities involve numerous outcomes: high school dropout rates, college attendance rates, incarceration rates, marriage rates, individual labor earnings, family or household incomes, and some of these outcomes are surely linked (e.g., education choices with labor earnings and marriage rates with family incomes). It is also clear that these disparities will diminish only if, within the distributions of outcomes, there is mobility over time for persons in the disadvantaged group. Chetty et al. (2020) investigated the mobility between generations for racial and ethnic groups. We focus on a shorter time frame: earning mobility during a worker’s lifetime. In their comparisons Chetty et al. (2020) investigate some potential intergenerational (between generations) transmission mechanisms for racial disparities: residential segregation, differences in family structure, parental wealth, etc. When they partition their sample by race and gender to see the racial disparities within each group, they find that black and white men are the source of the disparity.Footnote 1 After controlling for parental income, the black–white income gap is driven by the racial differences in wages and employment rates for men, which determine labor earnings. Therefore, in our intragenerational (within a generation) mobility comparisons, we follow Chetty et al. (2020) by comparing the earning mobility for whites and blacks and breaking down the results for men and women separately. Intergenerational and intragenerational mobility use different reference points to make earnings comparisons. The former compares the earnings of an individual and a parent at comparable ages; the latter compares the earnings of the individual to himself or herself at an earlier age. To compare the two perspectives on racial disparities, it is helpful to use an analogy to a relay race. The current generation of earners are the anchor legs (final runners) in a race and previous generations run the earlier legs. Following a longitudinal sample of the current generation is like watching the final leg of the race. Some anchor legs receive batons before others, conferring an advantage gained by their team members in earlier stages of the race. Likewise, some earners begin with advantages conferred by earlier generations, including better schooling, greater expenditures on enrichment activities, and better health (Duncan and Murnane 2014, Chapter 3). These advantages can lead to better initial job placements—higher initial positions in the earnings distribution—and better opportunities for advancement later. In such cases, we would expect the initial advantages to widen over time. But we can imagine other possibilities. Some earners face initial disadvantages because earlier generations experienced more severe discrimination, which impaired their ability to prepare their children for labor market success. If discrimination is less severe in the current generation, an initial disadvantage may narrow over time. In any of these cases we would see racial differences in intragenerational earnings mobility. Investigating intragenerational mobility allows us to ask an important question: given the positions of individuals in the distribution of earnings when a time interval begins (i.e., when they receive the baton in the relay race), what happens to racial earnings disparities during that interval (or leg of the race)? Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), we track cohorts of white and black prime-age workers over 6-year intervals spanning 1973–2015. As in the Chetty et al. (2020) analysis, using longitudinal data implicitly controls for confounding influences (e.g., unobservable characteristics such as ability), which is important in a study of earnings mobility, as earnings can depend on a variety of unobserved personal characteristics, many of which remain constant over time. By using individual data, we also avoid having to deal with changes in household situations, such as marriage and divorce. Our primary purpose is to identify empirical facts about racial differences in intragenerational earnings mobility. The literature on earnings mobility within a generation is reviewed helpfully by Burkhauser and Couch (2009) and provides a useful foundation for our study. First, cross-section inequality is greater for US earnings than for either pre- or postgovernment equivalent incomes, but a longitudinal analysis shows that mobility over time mitigates the inequality found in a single cross-section survey. When the income time frame is extended across several years rather than a single year, inequality in earnings falls by about one-quarter (Burkhauser et al. 1997; Burkhauser and Poupore 1997), reflecting gains from mobility for individuals with low initial earnings. Much of this decline occurs in the first few years (Burkhauser and Couch 2009), which allows us to use relatively short panels for this study. Using short panels also helps to limit sample attrition. Dahl et al. (2011) and Kopczuk et al. (2010) find no evidence of changes in US earnings mobility over time, in contrast to the rising trend for earnings inequality (and for more comprehensive income inequality) in the US. While much progress has been made in measuring US earnings mobility, racial differences in mobility have received less attention.Footnote 2 We find that blacks have a higher percentage of the sample trapped in the bottom 25% of the earnings distribution than whites for all the intervals we examine. Whites also experience significantly larger mean movements between the initial and final earnings distributions for some of these periods. Breaking down both findings by gender reveals that they arise primarily from the labor market experiences of black men, who face larger earnings mobility disparities than black women. Hence, our findings for a shorter time frame (the anchor leg of the relay race) are in line with the findings of Chetty et al. (2020) for a longer horizon (multiple legs of the race). The “Data and Methods” section describes our data and methods for measuring and comparing earnings mobility across racial groups. We present the comparisons and our findings in the “Empirical Analysis” section. The “Discussion” section discusses ways to interpret our findings by drawing upon several theories of racial disparities and related empirical studies and draws out the policy implications of the most promising theories.

Burnette,Jason T. Younker,David P. Wick,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The debate concerning the best way to divide the US population has informed the Census from the beginning. In 1790, there were five distinct reported categories (free white males 16 or older, free white males under 16, free white females, all other free persons, and slaves.). Since that time, the number and names of the various categories have reflected American society’s evolving understanding of race, ethnicity, and statistical methods. The discussion concerning the appropriate level of disaggregation for race and ethnicity data has continued with many advocating that communities from historically marginalized populations be enumerated under their own category. The need for additional Asian American and Pacific Islander categories has been made by Nguyen, Nguyen, & Nguyen et al. (2013) and Teranishi et al. (2013). Both cases demonstrate that the diversity of economic and educational experiences between East Asian, Southeast Asian, South Asian, and Pacific Islander necessitate disaggregation to ensure effective planning, implementation, and delivery of services and enhance student experiences within higher education. In contrast, other work has explored differences between non-Hispanic, single-race AIANs and those identifying with another race or ethnicity category (Burnette and Zhang 2019; Liebler et al. 2016). Both of these studies use Census data to conclude that the measured statistical differences between non-Hispanic AIANs are small enough that aggregating non-Hispanic AIANs into a single category may be appropriate. This is because the distortionary impacts of aggregating individuals from separate groups into a single category are compensated by the benefits associated with larger sample sizes. Research on data disaggregation has tended to concentrate on the issues associated with a specific group but is now considering using social inequality to determine if the explanatory benefit from additional categories is large enough to justify increasing the number of race and ethnicity categories. Howell and Emerson (2017) test the ability of multiple identity classification systems to explain inequality in household income, education, and self-rated health data. Their study compares the tri-racial measure argued by Bonilla-Silva (2004); a skin tone-based measure with seven categories; a seven-category race and ethnic hybrid measure; and the ethnoracial pentagon. Overall, they find that asking individuals to self-select into either the white, black, Hispanic, Asian, or a Native American category yielded the best results. Shiao (2019) uses a different dataset that includes data with repeated measures of racial and ethnic identity for the same individual spanning from 1994 to 2008 but employs a similar technique as Howell and Emerson (2017). His results emphasize the value of classifying multiracial, changed-race, and other-race respondents separately and using the specific data to determine the appropriate race and ethnic classification system. One particular recommendation he makes for self-rated health data is to “consider classifying respondents with consistent Native information as Native American, regardless of other racial information” (Shaio 2019, p. 14). He offers a different recommendation for educational attainment data; multiple-race respondents should be classified based upon their preferred single-race category. These results suggest the importance of a diversified approach toward collecting race and ethnicity in federal datasets. In 1872, Francis A. White, Superintendent of the 1870 Census, raised a question that the federal government is still trying to answer. Which individuals should be counted as part of the American Indian population? Essentially, he decided the fundamental issue comes down to two overlapping sub-questions: Should the government count only those who maintain their tribal relation and how do you appropriately classify individuals with mixed parentage? (Walker 1872, p. 19). Then as now, the relationship between federal and tribal governments caused confusion for enumerating American Indian identity. The current federal definition of Indian comes from the Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. Passed in 1975, it changed the 1934 definition from “members of any recognized Indian tribe now under Federal jurisdiction, and all persons who are descendants of such members who were on June 1, 1934, residing within the present boundaries of any Indian reservation, and shall further include all other persons one-half or more Indian blood” to “a person who is a member of an Indian tribe.” It should be noted that this definition is not the only one used by federal agencies to determine if individuals are eligible for federal services. For example, the Indian Health Service extends their definition to include non-tribal members of AIAN descent who are able to document their connection to an Indian community served by the Indian Health Service (US Department of Health and Human Services 2017). Meanwhile, the OMB provides an even more inclusive definition where AIAN “refers to a person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America) and who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment” (Norris et al. 2012, p. 1). The variance in these definitions demonstrates a complexity specific to enumerating AIANs not associated with other American groups. Their identity is shaped not only by the agents of socialization typically associated with the social construction of racial identity but also by changing legal definitions. Information that documents an individual’s eligibility for tribal services is only collected by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Bureau of Indian Education within the Department of the Interior. Publications and data using this level of specificity are collected by the Indian Health Service and Bureau of Indian Education schools. All other federal agencies and datasets limit their collection of race and ethnicity data without making an effort to distinguish between the typical social construction of these categories and those eligible for services because of the federal trust responsibility. This leaves policymakers developing initiatives for AIANs (as defined in federal legislation) with a predicament. What is the appropriate way to use existing data to describe the socioeconomic conditions, lived experiences while providing the ability to estimate the total number of individuals eligible for federal resources allocated for AIANs? Government agencies and researchers have at times chosen to use geography in an attempt at to resolve this problem. An example of this is the report produced by the Secretary of the Interior to fulfill the requirements dictated by the Indian Employment, Training, and Related Services Demonstration Act of 1992. This act requires consultation with the Secretary of Labor to summarize the labor market conditions faced by those eligible for services the Department of Interior provides to Indian people. In years prior to 2013, their American Indian Labor Force Report was based upon data from individual tribal nations. The last time this report was produced, it used ACS data to count all individuals indicating an AIAN identity as part of the AIAN total as long as they resided in a Tribal Statistical Area. More recently, Cattaneo and Feir (2019) took advantage of geographic location to analyze Home Mortgage Disclosure Act Data. They include all primary borrowers indicating AIAN alone or in combination with another identity category living in or adjacent to census tracts that border reservation tracts. Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data reports up to five races of both the primary and secondary borrower for each mortgage application. Using residence to isolate different AIAN populations has proven to be valuable but it may not always be available or appropriate. Those eligible to receive tribal services may live outside a traditional homeland area, thus resulting in an undercount of their population and potentially excluding many individuals from analysis.Footnote 1 Data collection in higher education takes place at the institutional level with colleges reporting student totals for an assortment of categories. Consequently, geographic location is rendered useless as a filtering tool by the ability of colleges located large distances from tribal nations to draw those eligible for tribal services. Tribal citizens and those eligible for federal resources allocated to support AIANs are only one component of the AIAN population. Evidence suggests that a significant number of individuals who identify as AIAN in government surveys do not meet either of these standards; instead, they fulfill the definition used by the OMB that requires individuals maintain tribal affiliation or community attachment.Footnote 2 Because of their reliability, policymakers or researchers interested in understanding the AIAN population often take advantage of federal datasets which use this more general definition of AIAN and are impacted by the agency’s decision concerning the categorization of multiracial individuals. In 1997, the OMB advised that tabulations for multiracial individuals need to allow government agencies to carry out constitutional and legislative mandates; enforce civil rights laws; monitor progress in anti-discrimination programs; and monitor and analyze economic and social conditions and trends. It then offered the following guiding principle: “In general, OMB believes that, consistent with criteria for confidentiality and data quality, the tabulation procedures used by the agencies should result in the production of as much detailed information on race and ethnicity as possible.” (OMB 1997, p. 58788) Out of all the government agencies, the U.S. Census produces datasets, like the ACS, with the most robust array of options for those analyzing race and ethnicity data. It reports the data using both a partially collapsed and a more inclusive approach that counts individuals if they identify with an identity category alone or in combination with another identity category. Their large number of partially collapsed categories offers researchers the greatest amount of granularity to understand how outcomes vary across specialized sub-populations. Overall, they present three different partially collapsed race-based variablesFootnote 3 and provide a completely separate variable that distinguishes Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. This is possible because the ACS contains an extremely large number of observations; since 2000, each survey has included more than one-half million respondents and more recent surveys contain more than two million participants. The Department of Housing and Urban Development deals with a much smaller set of data. So naturally, it does not collect data at the same granular level as the Census. It does, however, maintain a much more detailed reporting of AIAN identities than is done by the ED. Their program offices and funded recipients are advised to report any multiple-race combination exceeding 1% of the local population in addition to twenty-two mutually exclusive categories.Footnote 4 Their standard reporting methodology allows for individual totals of those identifying as AIAN and white; AIAN and black; and AIAN alone for Hispanic and non-Hispanic populations. Data collection in Higher Education has a much shorter history than that of the Census. When surveys were initially collected in 1965 by the Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS), schools were asked to report the predominant race of the student body and were limited to either white or black. The first time HEGIS collected race and ethnicity information from institutions it used self-identified data, for those graduating during the 1976–1977 academic year.Footnote 5 In 1985, the ED began the 2-year phase-in of IPEDS but still kept reporting optional. It was not until 1992 that it become mandatory for all institutions receiving federal student financial aid (Title IV) funds to complete surveys conducted by IPEDS, as part of its postsecondary institution data collection effort (Aliyeva et al. 2018). The largest change to race and ethnicity reporting in IPEDS came in 2008, when schools were allowed to begin implementing the multiple-race reporting that was established during the 2000 Census. Notice of the new reporting rules was delivered in 2007 via the Federal Register in “Final guidance on maintaining, collecting, and reporting racial and ethnic data to the US Department of Education” and involved a response to solicited comments (US Department of Education 2007). Respondent’s concerns primarily revolved around the potential of undercounts for single-race reporting categories due to the ED’s tabulation instructions. Mandatory implementation for this new methodology began in 2010 and extends to present time. Since 2010, institutions have been required to aggregate any individual that expressed Hispanic ethnicity into Hispanic totals, regardless of whether that individual also communicated a racial identity. Similarly, individuals selecting two or more race categories no longer have any association with any of their individual self-identified races. Instead, they are reclassified under the moniker “two or more races” (US Department of Education 2007), where their only remaining categorical association is that they are multiracial. Furthermore, the ED discounted the warnings of scholars as it explained that while totals in single-race categories may decrease, proportional representation for these groups was unlikely to change due to the comparatively small number of individuals expected to be assigned two or more races. IPEDS data serves as the cornerstone of research used to understand higher education. Its data contributes to studies analyzing the effect of tuition increases on an institution’s racial/ethnic composition (Allen and Wolniak 2019), as a validation check for racial and ethnic proportional representation in researcher-created datasets (Giovenco et al. 2016; Li and Koedel 2017) and gaps associated with composition of an institution’s race and ethnicity profile (Ross et al. 2012; Kelchen and Li 2017). Many studies using IPEDS data often aggregate AIANs into a larger category (Li and Koedel 2017) or do not even mention AIANs (Giovenco et al. 2016; Kelchen and Li 2017) likely because their small population size makes it difficult to maintain reliability. The ED’s change in race and ethnicity tabulation places AIAN students and Indian country in a precarious position by making quantitative research even more difficult to conduct. Lastly, it also has the potential to impact research like that done by Allen and Wolniak (2019), who used a student racial diversity index score to measure the impact of tuition increases on racial and ethnic diversity. Research concerning the impact of the ED’s changes to maintaining, collecting, and reporting race and ethnicity information is limited. The majority of this literature has focused on its potential impact with only two studies including data from 2010 or later. Broh and Minicucci (2008) produced one of the earliest projections concerning the impact of the ED’s changes. Using data collected in 2007 from the Consortium on Financing Higher Education’s 31-member institutions, they compare the percentage of enrollment for each race and ethnicity group produced by alternate specifications. Overall, they are highly critical of the new guidelines as they demonstrate the loss of information that comes from combining mixed-race individuals into the new two or more races category. Their final recommendations focused on altering the ED’s new classification of data for mixed-race Asians, African Americans, and AIANs. They argued that Asian and African Americans who also identify as white or AIAN should be classified as Asian or African American, respectively. This contrasted to their suggested categorization of mixed-race AIANs whose identity should be enveloped by the other classification they selected unless it was Hawaiian. In that case, they were to be classified as two or more races. The crux of their argument for mixed-race Asians and African Americans was based upon the size of each group and the need to preserve each group’s identity and reflect school recruitment efforts in addition to affirmative action reporting. Given the unique relationship between Native American nations and the US federal government, their recommendations help demonstrate the relationship between policy recommendations, history, and population size. Byrd et al. (2013) compare ACS and IPEDS data to analyze distortions in race and ethnicity data within IPEDS. Their fundamental concern was the potential impact from ignoring race and ethnicity information for those classified in IPEDS data as non-resident aliens. Examining degree completions by those in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, they perform t tests to determine differences between ACS and IPEDS data. Their preliminary analysis finds that including non-citizens within race and ethnicity totals would change the current proportional representation of many individual categories. Both of the studies using 2010 data or later investigate the potential undercount of AIAN students. Rose (2012) conducts an analysis of AIAN undercounts for primary and secondary schools in New York state (NYS) by comparing 2010 National Center for Education Statistics totals for individual school districts to those from the NYS School Report Card. His interest concerns inconsistencies between the two datasets, not the impact of the ED’s methodological change. The only analysis connecting student enrollment totals to the ED’s new racial categorization is done by Burnette (2020) with the purpose of estimating the number of AIAN students eligible for the Johnson-O’Malley Program (JOM). This program was established in 1934, to support the educational needs of AIAN students between the age of 3 and grade 12. To comply with the Johnson-O’Malley Supplemental Indian Education Program Modernization Act of 2018, the Bureau of Indian Education issued a preliminary report estimating the number of AIAN students eligible or potentially eligible for JOM services (US BIE 2019). Its 2019 preliminary report examined multiple sources and noted a low-end estimate of 502,152 that come from a dataset using the ED’s new racial reporting rules but ultimately recommended the estimate from the ACS’s Education Tabulation (570,825). Burnette (2020) analyzes data from the National Center for Education Statistics, the ACS – Education Tabulation, and the ACS to argue that the best approach combines data from the ACS and National Center for Education Statistics. He recommends that AIAN student totals be estimated by using ACS data to adjust the percentage of AIANs in the current student population and multiplying that estimate by the total student population from the National Center for Education Statistics. The value to this approach is that it uses ACS data in accordance with its designed purpose. It also takes advantage of nearly all educational institutions reporting their data and then being made available by the National Center for Education Statistics instead of relying on representative samples to infer population size.",

To a large extent, economists have focused on analyzing the case of the USA, identifying the persistence of gaps in outcomes for individuals of different skin tones and races. The African-American population in particular faces a disadvantage in comparison to the white population (Corcoran et al. 1992; Darity et al. 1996; Bayer and Charles 2018; Heckman et al. 2000; Neal 2004; Bhattacharya and Mazumder 2011; Mazumder 2014; Chetty et al. 2019). Although most of this literature has focused on the national level, several studies, such as Cutler and Glaeser (1997) and Chetty et al. (2019), have focused on the relationship between regional variance and racial disparities, identifying a compounding effect between the two. The gap between white and black individuals is larger in poorer communities than in more affluent ones.However, the historical experience of race in Latin America is substantially different than that of the USA. Colonial regimes in Latin America imposed a heavily stratified caste system based on national origin and parental lineage (Loveman 2014; Navarrete 2016). With the victory of independence movements these caste systems were formally abolished, but the associated societal stratification remained in place (Telles 2014). Most studies have focused on comparison of the indigenous and non-indigenous populations, but more recent analyses, beginning with studies of Brazil,Footnote 1 have examined skin tone as a criterion for stratification in Latin American societies. In Mexico, the study of the association between skin tone and socioeconomic status is not new (Navarrete 2016; Flores and Telles 2012; Telles 2014; Villarreal 2010; Aguilar 2011, 2013; Solís et al. 2019), but there has been a recent increase in interest on the topic on the part of economists. Since the seminal audit study by Arceo-Gómez and Campos-Vázquez (2014) on the effects of skin tone on job applicant callback rates in the Mexican labor market, the literature has expanded in several directions, shedding light on important aspects of the relationship between darker skin tones and life outcomes. The first of these findings is that individuals with darker skin tones are treated less favorably by their peers than their counterparts with lighter skin. This has been reported both in studies of survey data (Aguilar 2013) and in different experimental designs (Aguilar 2011; Martínez-Gutiérrez 2019). Aguilar (2011) analyzes whether the skin tone of political candidates affects voter opinion and finds that voters tend to ascribe less favorable traits to darker-skinned candidates, which affects their preferences in favor of white-skinned candidates. Martínez-Gutiérrez (2019) studies the effects of skin tone discrimination on financial access and finds that individuals with darker skin tones receive less information and less courteous treatment by bank employees than those with light skin. In the labor market, this difference in treatment translates into different callback rates depending on an applicant’s skin tone. The audit studies by Arceo-Gómez and Campos-Vázquez (2014, 2019) find that women with darker skin tones tend to receive fewer callbacks than their lighter-skinned peers. Moreover, Arceo-Gómez and Campos-Vázquez (2019) find that by listing desired physical characteristics in job advertisements, employers reduce their recruitment costs, which generates an incentive for explicit discrimination against dark-skinned women. Campos-Vázquez (2020) further analyzes the preference for light-skinned women in a study of the relationship between the prices of female escorts and their physical characteristics, finding a positive correlation, which suggests that white or whiter women are deemed more desirable by those seeking such services. It is worth noting, however, that although dark-skinned persons of both sexes report being treated less fairly than their lighter-skinned counterparts (Aguilar 2011, 2013; Martínez-Gutiérrez 2019), the effects on the labor market are observed only in the case of women (Arceo-Gómez and Campos-Vázquez 2014, 2019). As the experiment by Campos-Vázquez and Medina-Cortina (2018) shows, this phenomenon has been internalized by junior high school students. Their study analyzes the effects of highlighting differences in social recognition between light- and dark-skinned persons on test performance and aspirations and finds that the salience of these disparities diminishes dark-skinned students’ aspirations and performance, especially that of girls. The skin tone gradient is also observable in long-run life outcomes. Flores and Telles (2012), Telles (2014), and Villarreal (2010) find that individuals with darker skin tones tend to have lower educational attainment than their lighter-skinned peers. Focusing on socioeconomic status, Campos-Vázquez and Medina-Cortina (2019) find that upward rank mobility rates are lower for darker-skinned individuals than for lighter-skinned ones. This is the result of differences in the steady states to which individuals of each skin tone are converging and not of differences in the rank correlation between their original and current positions. We reported similar evidence in a previous paper (Vélez-Grajales et al. 2018a), which found that persistence rates at the bottom of the socioeconomic status distribution are higher for darker-skinned persons than for their lighter-skinned counterparts. At the same time, persistence rates at the top of the socioeconomic distribution are greater for lighter-skinned individuals than for the rest of the population. Together, these results suggest that lighter-skinned individuals have an advantage over the rest of the population both in moving upwards and staying at the top of the socioeconomic distribution. However, none of these studies are able to capture variation across different regions of Mexico. By design, the experimental evidence (Aguilar 2011; Arceo-Gómez and Campos-Vázquez 2014; Campos-Vázquez and Medina-Cortina 2018; Arceo-Gómez and Campos-Vázquez 2019) can only be generalized to populations that are similar to the specific sample that participate in the experiment. In the studies based on survey data (Aguilar 2013; Flores and Telles 2012; Telles 2014; Villarreal 2010; Campos-Vázquez and Medina-Cortina 2019; Vélez-Grajales et al. 2018a), the information is only representative at the national level. This body of research is thus unable to disentangle the compounding effect of regional differences and skin color that has been observed in other countries (Cutler and Glaeser 1997; Chetty et al. 2019). This inability is a serious limitation in Mexico, given the magnitude of regional disparities. Since the nineteenth century, the southern part of the country has lagged behind other regions in living standards, measured through the height of the population (López-Alonso and Vélez-Grajales 2017), GDP per capita (Ruíz 2010), and through a human development index (Campos-Vázquez et al. 2017). Another dimension of the gap in economic performance and living standards are the differences in social mobility between regions. As shown by Monroy-Gómez-Franco and Corak (2019); Delajara et al. (2020); and Orozco-Corona et al. (2019), individuals with origins in southern Mexico have lower rates of upward mobility and converge to a lower steady state that those from all other regions. Thus, if a specific group of people is heavily concentrated in southern Mexico, that group would experience a more precarious economic environment than other groups. Any estimation that fails to properly control for this regional effect will confound it with the effect of group-specific characteristics such as skin tone. We suspect this to be the case for skin color in Mexico, as dark-skinned groups (the indigenous and Afro-Mexican populations) have historically lived primarily in the central and southern parts of the country (García-Martínez 2010; Hausberger and Mazín 2010; Bennett 2010).Our objective in this paper is to provide the first set of estimates on the rate of social mobility by skin tone that correctly separates the regional from the skin tone effect. To do so, we employ a novel dataset that allows us to analyze the social mobility patterns in each region of Mexico and separate the regional effect in the difference between lighter and darker skin tones. We find that after doing so, the differences in social mobility between the darkest and medium skin tones disappear. However, importantly, in all of the regions analyzed, the group with the lightest skin tone consistently has an advantage in social mobility over the rest of the population. The same holds at the national level, even after controlling for the region of origin. This suggests the existence of a stratification regime that disproportionately favors individuals with lighter skin tones.",8

Blake,Daniel R. Walter,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The connection between language ability and economic returns is one that is difficult to tease apart, but widely discussed.Footnote 5 Language is not only the way we communicate with our network, but the different languages we speak and how we speak them to whom are all indicators to our interlocutors during communication. Thus, a language does not only indicate to someone which code we want to communicate in, but also reveals (or at least is interpreted as revealing) an abundance of information about ourselves, including age, gender, socioeconomic status, education level, emotional state, and more. All of these perceived factors play a role in the way others interpret our language, and all of these factors are important indicators of economic returns. In this section, we review studies that have tried to isolate language use, or the use of a particular language in relation to others, and the ways in which language as a complex variable can affect an individual’s returns. Initial and formative economic studies on the topic, such as Lazear (1999) focus on the benefits of language and cultural assimilation. This model is set up in the framework of a comparison between costs and benefits of an individual choosing which language to speak and comparing these with the potential for overall social benefits. The primary conclusion of this paper is that larger non-English-speaking networks lead to lower English proficiency. As a result, sizable linguistic networks would then prevent the generation of social benefits associated with more efficient communication and increased opportunities for trade. Central to this argument is the assumption that an individual chooses which language to speak on the basis of their own perceived individual costs and benefits. Subsequent extensions look at majority language acquisition as a benefit to migrant groups (Chiswick and Miller 2005; Chiswick 2009; Dustmann and Fabbri 2003), yet none (to our knowledge) have attempted to quantify the benefits of maintaining a heritage language for a particular individual. Others have added a spatial dimension to the analysis. Florax et al. (2005) extend Lazear (1999) with the explicit incorporation of space and find that the clustered nature of immigrants cannot be ignored in discussions of language assimilation. Bauer et al. (2005) expound these findings, looking at the relationship between English language proficiency and immigrants’ destination of choice for resettlement. The authors describe an endogenous relationship between Mexican immigrants and location choice upon immigration to the USA. This result is fundamental to our paper, as any econometric model needs to disentangle whether location affects observed demographic characteristics, or vice versa. As discussed later in the paper, our approach is not able to verify the direction of causality due to endogeneity. But rather, we focus on providing strong suggestive evidence of our hypothesized relationship as a means to contribute to the larger linguistic debate in the USA. The spatial dimension also has tangents to labor markets and language enclaves. Much of this work has focused on how the majority of minority languages become focused in distinct geographic regions within a country, particularly urban environments (Bauer et al. 2005; Laliberté 2019). These studies tend to look at behavioral patterns towards labor within pockets of ethnic communities living in relative isolation from the larger population. On a more individual level, Gonzalez (2005) looked at useful upper and lower bounds on limited English proficiency returns. For their data, Gonzalez (2005) looked at English proficiency as a self-reported measure of Hispanics living in the USA. The author found that meaningful upper bounds on the effect of English proficiency on returns were education, occupation, and immigration status, while age of arrival was a useful lower bound. A finer-grained reporting shows that returns on limited English proficiency are highly influenced by within-category differences. For example, differences in wage between well- and very well-spoken English is small at high education levels, but broader at other education levels, or differences between good and well-spoken English within a particular occupation might be small, but large in another occupation. While this study provides some useful insights, it is limited in scope to Hispanic populations and focuses wholly on the use of the majority language by speakers of other languages, rather than their use of Spanish or other indigenous or heritage languages spoken by this population. In another study looking at language use and its relationship to returns, Garrouste (2008) investigate a European context. The population of focus for this author is the returns for additional (i.e., second, third, and beyond) languages. Using three human capital specifications to evaluate returns and a Mincer approximation for experience, Garrouste (2008) find that for each of the eight countries compared, skills in a second language are estimated to be a major factor constraining wage opportunities. The two countries in the study have a national policy of bilingualism (Finland and Norway) and the results demonstrates both that linguistic skills in the national, official language and in a second language have a significant effect on wages. In relation to our own study, the linguistic context of the speakers is quite different, but that is only the case if one perceives the USA as a fairly linguistically homogeneous society. Broadly speaking, English is ubiquitous in the USA, but on the local level, the regional differences in languages is quite stark. Turning specifically to the Nordic countries, Rooth and Saarela (2007) show that prior knowledge of the country of immigration prior to arrival can be an important estimator of returns to language. In their study, Rooth and Saarela (2007) investigate two groups of immigrants from Finland that had moved to Sweden. The first group had Finnish as a first language and the second group came from an area of Finland where a dialect of Swedish is used as the primary language of communication. There were significant differences in the returns to each group, which is to be expected. However, the researchers found that educational distribution between the groups was the largest indicator for the outcome differentials. There was also a difference within the Finnish-as-a-first-language group by sex, where women had, on average, better second language Swedish abilities than men. One important implication from their research on policy is their claim that, because “decisions about how much governments should spend on language training for immigrants should be based on correct estimates for the returns to language skills, these issues are highly relevant also from a policy perspective,” (Rooth and Saarela 2007, pg. 209). Another aspect that this paper highlights, which we previously mentioned, is the connection between language and demographic information. In this study, the authors specifically point to the Finnish immigrants with a Swedish dialect as their first language and discuss how, despite having the same first language, native Swedish citizens identify the Finnish immigrants as such and therefore belonging to a non-citizen group. This is an important touch-point that we will return to in our analysis of our findings. Finally, several papers directly impact our approach and analysis as we explain how our study contributes to the existing literature. First, Bertrand et al. (2000) use language as the marker for culture in order to model the relationship between one’s culture and the likelihood of that person ending up on welfare in the USA. While the use of language for a singular cultural marker is a bit tenuous, Bertrand et al.’s analysis is useful in our purview, in that language is clustered by location across the USA. This analysis of language and economic outcomes through a spatial dimension has significant potential to inform the incorporation of space in our own methodology. Secondly, there are several works that focus on the direct link between the size of ethnic enclaves and economic outcomes (Edin et al. 2003; Damm 2009; Li 2013). These studies focus on Sweden, Denmark, and Canada, respectively, with each finding significant evidence of enclave size statistically impacting wages or earnings. As a result, each contributes to a larger discussion of immigration policy and the potential benefits of clustered immigrant populations. With this, our paper fills two primary gaps in this sizable branch of literature. First, studies that have directly estimated the effect of language networks on economic outcomes primarily focus on either countries outside of the USA or are city-specific within the USA. By looking across states within the USA, we can compare our results with previous studies of other countries while contributing to a greater understanding of labor market outcomes within the country. Secondly, the majority of previous work in the USA focuses on the benefits of assimilation and is oriented towards the immigrant population becoming one with the majority language population. There are clear policy implications of these analyses: (1) Bilingualism is socially inefficient in that it requires individuals to communicate in multiple languages and spend time learning them rather than assimilating to a common language of communication. Linguistic assimilation would then provide theoretical social benefits through gains to efficiency (i.e., reduce the need to invest energy communicating a singular message in multiple ways); (2) Individuals will not account for the positive externalities associated with majority language assimilation and so the rate will be sub-optimally low; and (3) Immigration policy should target small minority groups to increase the rate of assimilation. By focusing on the benefits of maintaining linguistic heritage, our paper shifts the discussion away from assimilation and towards the potential benefits of not assimilating. This is inline with studies of other countries and contributes to a more complete understanding of the choice a heritage language speaker must make with regards to linguistic assimilation.",

We also describe how this changes over time and how it varies by geography, including on reservation lands, nearby reservation lands, and in Hawaii and Alaska. We use the available data to determine the extent to which any differences can be accounted for by observable factors including gender, income, loan amount, loan-to-income ratio, bank branch presence, loan type,Footnote 3 whether a loan is for a manufactured home, and other time-invariant, geographic unobservable characteristics. We find that first-lien home purchase loans are far more likely to be higher-priced if the primary borrower is identified as Native American and the property is in a census tract associated with a reservation. For example, in 2016, almost 30% of loans made to American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) borrowers for properties associated with a reservation (AIAN-reservation loans) were higher-priced relative to only 10% of loans made to other borrowers for properties in nearby geographies. In addition, conditional on the loan being a higher-priced loan, AIAN-reservation loans had a significantly higher rate spread.Footnote 4 In 2016, the mean rate spread for AIAN-reservation loans was over 5%, while for non-AIAN-reservation loans, the mean rate spread was 2.5%, conditional on the loan being higher priced. Assuming a mortgage term of 30 years, an average prime offer rate (APOR) of 4.5%, and the average loan size for AIAN people on reservation lands, this rate spread difference translates into AIAN people on reservation lands paying over $107,000 more over the life of the mortgage. We demonstrate using regression and decomposition methods that a large part of the difference in the cost of mortgage finance is associated with the number of AIAN-reservation loans that are made for manufactured homes. Previous work has demonstrated that the mortgage lending industry for manufactured homes in tribal areas is highly concentrated (Todd and Johnson (Todd and Johnson a)) and concerns have been raised around manufactured housing financing practices generally (Todd and Johnson (Todd and Johnson a); Baker and Wagner (Baker and Wagner)). The larger number of manufactured homes on reservation land may be partly driven by differences in regulatory, property, and other legal institutions on reservation lands (Shoemaker 2020; Brown et al. 2017; Wellhausen et al. 2017; Brown et al.2019; Jorgensen (Jorgensen)). Our findings suggest that either reforms in manufactured housing markets specifically or reforms to deal with the underlying structural factors that result in Native Americans being more likely to received loans for manufactured rather than stick-built homes are necessary to support equitable access to mortgage finance for Native peoples, specifically for those wishing to have homes on reservation lands. However, the prevalence of manufactured housing is only part of the story for the AIAN-premium. A significant difference in the cost of financing remains unexplained even conditional on the loan amount and type, primary borrower income, and gender, census tract population, percentage of the population that is identified as a minority, bank branch presence, and fixed unobservable census tract characteristics. We find a large variation in the extent to which different Native American populations face a higher cost of mortgage loans. For example, we find that conditional on observable factors, Native Americans living on census tracts that border reservation lands actually face a lower probability of having a higher-priced loan than non-Native people living in the same geographies. We also show that Alaskan Natives may actually have a lower probability of having a higher-priced loan than others living in Alaska and that Native Hawaiians have the same probability of having a higher-priced loan as other populations living in Hawaii. Our results contribute to the literature on mortgage lending to Native peoples and thus more broadly to the literature on Native American access to capital (Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (Community Development Financial Institutions Fund); Jorgensen and Akee 2017; Jorgensen (Jorgensen); Dimitrova-Grajzl et al. 2015). In the 2001 Financial Survey from the Native American Lending Study from the CDFI Fund at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, 65% of Native American and Native Hawaiian respondents reported that conventional mortgages are “difficult” or “impossible” to obtain (Community Development Financial Institutions Fund ((Community Development Financial Institutions Fund), p. 2). Other more broadly focused work has shown Native Americans are more likely to be denied mortgage loans (Dymski 1999; Schumacher et al. 2006; Todd and Johnson (Todd and Johnson b)). While home ownership rates have increased in recent years (Pettit et al. (Pettit et al.), p. 54) perhaps partially due to recent initiatives, such as the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Office of Native American Programs Section 184 Indian Home Loan Guarantee Program, existing evidence suggests that the Section 184 Guarantee Program and other loan guarantee programs have been largely ineffective on tribal lands (Laderman and Reid 2010; Cyree et al. 2004), with a few clear exceptions (Kunesh 2018). Both Cyree et al. (2004) and Laderman and Reid (2010) suggest that this loan guarantee program has virtually no statistically observable impact on the mortgage loan denial rates for Native Americans living on reservation lands.Footnote 5 This literature points to the difficulties of lending on reservation lands as one possible cause for the program’s lack of success. This is complemented by the work of Parker ((Parker)) and Wellhausen et al. (2017), which suggests that institutional arrangements on reservation lands that lower lender transaction costs and increase lender-perceived security are associated with greater access to mortgage finance. We add to this literature by demonstrating that there are additional challenges facing borrowers beyond denial: Even conditional on being approved for a mortgage, Native American people, particularly those living on census tracts associated with a reservation, face a higher cost of financing than other populations living nearby.Footnote 6 We also more broadly contribute to the large literature on racial discrimination in mortgage lending which has largely focused on the Black-White dimension of discrimination.Footnote 7 While this literature has established that Black Americans are more likely to have higher-priced loans and have these loans at higher interest ratesFootnote 8 to our knowledge, this has not been established for Native Americans, specifically for those living on reservations. Finally, we contribute to the literature on racial wealth disparities and the role of home ownership. While the existing empirical literature on the Native-White wealth gap is sparse, existing evidence related to Native wealth suggests a substantial divide exists. For example, while 45% of White Americans said they were certain they could come up with $2000 if an unexpected need arose within the next month, only 25% of American Indian and Alaska Natives answered the same way (Dewees and Mottola 2017, p. 4). Given the possible wealth gap between Native Americans and White Americans, differences in home ownership and equity accumulation may be a substantial factor in creating the gap. The higher financing costs identified in our work may partially explain both the lower rates of home ownership among Native Americans (Todd and Burlon (Todd and Burlon); Pettit et al. (Pettit et al.); Pindus et al. 2017) and any differences in equity accumulation. Existing literature suggests that differences in home ownership rates between Black and White Americans account for the largest share in the Black-White wealth gap. However, there is also evidence that Black Americans accumulate equity more slowly and this poses a challenge to the strategy of increasing home ownership to close the racial wealth gap (Shapiro 2006; Shapiro et al. 2013; Sullivan et al. 2015; Long and Caudill 1992). Our results suggest that this may also be true for Native peoples in the 48 contiguous states.",4

However, little attention has been given to the potential effect of the business cycle on immigrants’ contemporaneous wages, especially on a severe downturn such as the Great Recession. The Great Recession (2007–2009) was the longest and deepest recession in the USA since World War II. Approximately, 8.8 million jobs disappeared, and the unemployment rate rose to a peak of 9.5% in October 2009 (Bureau of Labor Statistics (United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2012). The downturn has affected labor market outcomes of some demographic groups more than others. Orrenius and Zavodny (2010b) find that immigrant men’s (un) employment is more strongly tied to the business cycle than those of native workers because immigrants are overrepresented among workers with low levels of education and in occupations that are sensitive to changes in economic conditions. Given the fact that immigrants have a different wage profile than natives, it is possible that the recession could have affected their wages differently. The considerably severe and prolonged nature of the downturn provides an excellent opportunity to examine how immigrants’ wages fare, relative to the wages of natives, over the business cycle. Knowing the extent of the wage gap between immigrants and natives could shed light on the dynamics of the wage differential between the two groups in the short run. It also could inform on how relative wages of immigrants might respond to the current COVID-19 Pandemic Recession. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study that has analyzed the potential changes in relative wages of immigrants in the USA over the business cycle. Our paper therefore contributes to the literature by examining how downturns in the economy could immediately affect the wages of immigrants, especially in the context of a severe downturn like the Great Recession. Immigrant wages could differ from those of natives, especially if immigrants have a different education profile and/or ability to transfer skills into the labor market, and if those differences lead to differences in occupational sorting between groups. Even after adjusting for these factors, however, a wage differential between immigrants and natives could still persist in the recession period if unobservable factors, such as reservation wage and worker flexibility that are correlated with unemployment, affect wages of immigrants and natives differently. Our analysis, which is based on data from the Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) of the Current Population Survey (CPS), shows that immigrant men’s pre-recession wage disadvantage is slightly larger during the recession period, regardless of model specification. In the post-recession period, immigrants’ relative wages largely recover from the recession-induced decline, but the wage disadvantage does not completely return to its pre-recession level. When we break down the sample into various educational groups and re-estimate the main model for these subsamples, we find a similar modest relative wage decline in the recession period, except for college graduate immigrants, whose relative wages see a larger decline. It is possible that changes in the immigration flow over the business cycle could contaminate our estimates. To avoid this potential contamination from immigration changes, we exclude Mexican dropouts and recently arrived immigrants from the sample. A similar issue could arise if natives become more selected during the recession because of more generous unemployment insurance benefits. To check for potential native self-selection, we compare changes in wages of natives in the recession and post-recession periods. The results remain similar in both cases, so changes in worker composition such as selective in- and-out-migration by immigrants or differential selection of natives into employment do not seem to drive the results. Given the higher growth in immigrants’ unemployment rate and their shorter unemployment spell in the recession period, it is possible that immigrants may have traded higher employment with lower wages and that employers might have been willing to hire them as a cost-saving measure. These results are consistent with the findings of the literature on how wages respond to economic downturns in general. During past recessions, employers responded to the shock by primarily adjusting the employment margin rather than the wage margin as they were reluctant to cut wages. Cutting wages could negatively affect morale among workers and could therefore lower employee productivity. Using data from 1970s to early 1990s to analyze differences in labor market responses to economic downturns between immigrants and natives in Germany and the UK, Dustmann et al. (2010) show that there is a significantly larger employment response to economic shocks for immigrants than for natives, but they find only a small difference in wage responses for the two groups. Similar to previous recessions, the Great Recession is characterized by substantial employment declines and much smaller wage cuts (Eslby et al., 2016; Cadena and Kovak, 2016). These results could inform the potential question of how wages of immigrants would fare during the COVID-19 Pandemic Recession, relative to the wages of natives. We speculate that the COVID-19 Pandemic Recession will cause a larger decline in immigrants’ relative wages, as compared to past recessions, including the Great Recession. Workers are twice more likely to face pay cuts during the COVID-19 downturn than they were during the Great Recession a decade ago (Cajner et al., 2020). However, given the unique nature of the currently ongoing recession, employers anticipate that the economy will rebound faster than it would under typical recession times.

Weller,David Madland,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Household wealth, the difference between what people own, including their house and cars, and what they owe in mortgages, credit card debt and student loans, among other debt, is highly unequally distributed, especially by race and ethnicity. In 2019, for instance, Black households had a median wealth of $24,100 (in 2019 dollars), Latinx households a median wealth of $36,100, and White households a median of $188,200 (Bhutta et al. 2020). And, wealth among Asian American households is more unequally distributed than among White households, even if the median and average wealth are comparable between the two groups (Weller and Thompson 2018).Footnote 1 People of color are much less well prepared for an emergency such as a layoff or a family member falling seriously ill (Despard et al. 2018). They also have less money available to give a down payment on a house, to finance a start-up or ongoing business, to pay for their children’s education or to move to a new job when better opportunities arise elsewhere. The lack of wealth can hamper families’ immediate financial security and impede their future economic mobility. These racial and ethnic wealth differences may vary with economic institutional settings such as collective bargaining coverage. Union membership already correlates with smaller racial income gaps (Rosenfeld and Kleykamp 2012). It is possible that wealth is more equitably distributed by race and ethnicity among union members than non-members. The US labor movement has not always aggressively and consistently promoted racial equity. Early on, many labor leaders and union members were openly racist. Federal law also frequently promoted or reinforced discrimination. For example, the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 excluded domestic and agricultural workers, mainly Black workers, and in the beginning, it did not prevent unions from discriminating on the basis of race (Meltzer 1974). Moreover, the 1947 Taft-Hartley amendments were partly intended to keep unions from organizing Black workers in the South (Farhang and Katznelson 2005). Still, while many unions excluded workers of color, especially Black or Latinx workers, from their ranks in the past, they are nowadays represented by unions at similar or even higher rates than White workers (Bivens et al. 2017). The labor movement is now considered the largest mass membership organization of African Americans, Latinx workers, and Asian workers in the country (Bronfenbrenner and Warren 2007). Union membership could theoretically go along with more wealth, especially for communities of color, through a number of channels.Footnote 2 Union members receive higher wages (Belman and Voos 2006; Blanchflower and Bryson 2004; Budd and Na 2000; Mayer 2004; Rosenfeld and Kleykamp 2012; Western and Rosenfeld 2011; Wunnava and Peled 1999) and better retirement benefits (Allen and Clark 1986; Ghilarducci and Saad-Lessler 2015; Walters and Mishel 2003) than is the case for nonunion households. Black and Latinx workers also see an added union wage premium in their paychecks (Bivens et al. 2017).Union membership may also boost benefit coverage more for people of color than for Whites; Whites have more access to such benefits outside of collective bargaining agreements than people of color do. Both higher wages and better benefits make it easier for union members to save. Union members also have more stable jobs (Freeman 1980; Polachek and McCutcheon 1983; Hsu and Weng 2014) that facilitate planning for the future and thus increase savings. And, that difference is likely greater for people of color since White workers are more likely to have stable jobs outside of collective bargaining agreements than people of color. The difference in job stability by union membership for Black, Latinx, and other workers may then be greater than for White workers. Moreover, union members also receive other benefits such as health and life insurance for themselves and their children at work (Union Plus 2018) which could leave them with more money to save. Because collective bargaining agreements give all covered workers access to similar wages and benefits and because people of color have lower wages and fewer benefits than White workers outside of collective bargaining agreements, collective bargaining coverage could boost savings and wealth more for Black, Latinx, and other workers than for White ones. It is, however, possible that union members do not have more wealth than nonunion members. Union members may get higher wages at the expense of lower benefits. Because higher wages would come at the expense of lower benefits, it would suggest less wealth than would be the case for nonunion members after accounting for differences in income. Moreover, union members’ greater job security and better access to ancillary benefits lower their need for precautionary savings, reducing their total wealth. Union membership would then have no measurable correlation with wealth inequality in general and the racial wealth gap in particular. We find that union membership goes along with more wealth for all households. The median wealth difference associated with collective bargaining agreements is somewhat larger for Black, Latinx, and other households than for White ones. The average wealth difference, though, appears to vary less with race or ethnicity. The smaller racial and ethnic median wealth differences among union members go along with higher wages, greater retirement savings coverage, more contributions to retirement plans and more job stability. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We summarize the relevant literature in the “Literature Review” section and present the data, variables and empirical strategy in the “Data, Variables, and Empirical Strategy” section. Our results follow in the “Empirical Results” section and we conclude in the “Discussion and Conclusion” section with a discussion of the findings and implications.",1

A large body of previous research examines self-selection of economic migrants (Butcher 1994; Kalmijn 1996; Dodoo 1997), immigrants’ ability to address structural racism (Waters 1999), and different cultural norms (Sowell 1978; Sowell 1984). In addition to these factors, some employers explicitly state they prefer to hire Black immigrants rather than native-born Black Americans (Waters 1999). For example, an employer was asked why he preferred to hire Black immigrants over Black Americans; he stated that he valued immigrants’ “reliability, their willingness to do the job or what has to be done” (Waters 1999). Likewise, Deaux (2006) finds that people are affected by a process known as “accent prestige”—she describes how the same Black man was rated as a better job candidate when he spoke with a Caribbean accent than an American accent. However, numerous resume audit studies or correspondence studies have found that immigrant groups experience substantial discrimination in the labor market. For example, highly skilled Asian immigrants in Canada were contacted far less often than similar white applicants (Oreopoulos 2011) and foreign sounding names were contacted far less than Anglo-Saxon names in Chicago (Jacquemet and Yannelis 2012). Similarly, Gorzig and Rho (2021) find that employment discrimination against Somali American refugees in Minnesota increased after the 2016 election. Additionally, immigrants are over-represented in occupations that are intensive in manual-physical labor skills (Peri and Sparber 2009), and employers hold stereotypes that immigrants are a better fit for these lower status, more physically taxing occupations (King et al. 2006; Shih 2002). There is also substantial prejudice against Muslims in the labor market, which would affect many Somali American immigrants and refugees (Kaushal et al. 2007; Wallace et al. 2014; Adida et al. 2010; Weichselbaumer 2014). In this project, our first research question directly examines whether employers discriminate differently against Black immigrants relative to African Americans. By applying to jobs with equivalent resumes that are manipulated to be from African American, Somali American, and white American applicants, we are able to test whether employers have a pro-immigrant bias among Black applicants. Because Somali Americans largely arrived as a refugee population, they are less self-selected on economic factors than voluntary economic migrants. We also include manipulations of religious activities, language skills, and education quality on the applicants’ resumes, to examine why different levels of discrimination may occur. It is important to note that Black immigrants, as well as their native-born children, engage in strategic behavior and actively negotiate how employers perceive them. For example, many Black immigrants report using language or accent to distance themselves from the pre-existing African American community or strategically choose to emphasize their immigrant identity in the labor market (Deaux 2006; Waters 1999; Portes and Zhou 1993; Waters 1994; Kasinitz et al. 2008). Numerous qualitative studies find that Somali Americans use religion and other methods to intentionally distance themselves from the pre-existing African American community (Guenther et al. 2011; Kapteijns and Arman 2008; Ajrouch and Kusow 2007; Kusow 2006). In this project, we focus on employer’s behavior and leave the question of employees’ strategic reaction to employers’ prejudices to future research. In addition to discrimination, many elements of human capital influence immigrants’ labor market outcomes. For example, language fluency and social contacts are key determinants of immigrant labor market outcomes (Chiswick and Wang 2016; Patel and Vella 2013; Chiswick 1991; Dustmann and van Soest 2002; Bleakley and Chin 2004). However, a recent study highlights the complex role of language skills. Oreopoulos (2011) implemented a resume audit study and also interviewed employers about their interview process. Employers stated that language was a key element of why they did not interview immigrants, yet in the field experiment, employers had little response to an indication of language fluency. Likewise, for immigrants, obtaining a degree in the US leads to higher returns than a similar degree from their home countries (Bratsberg and Ragan Jr 2002). Age at immigration is also important: immigrants who arrived in America as children have gone to school in the USA and will have stronger language skills, leading to better labor market outcomes (Bleakley and Chin 2004; Grogger and Trejo 2002). Refugees have different human capital, reasons for coming to the USA, and ties to their country of origin than traditional immigrants (McGown 1999; Portes and Stepick 1985). Because refugees are unlikely to return to their home countries, they are more likely to invest in US-specific human capital such as English language skills compared to other foreign-born workers (Cortes 2004; Borjas 1982). The effects of traditional measures of human capital may also differ. Investing in education may have a low return for immigrants who employers believe are likely to return to their countries of origin but a higher return to refugees who employers think will stay in the USA. Our second research question focuses on the importance of human capital in the overall difference between how often employers contact Somali American, African American, and white American applicants. We altered the language skills, education, and work experience of the applicants and examine if employer contact is affected by these elements. The USA has received refugees from the civil war in Somalia since the early 1990s. The Twin Cities has served as a major destination for these refugees. In 2017, over 30% of all people in America who identified as SomaliFootnote 2 in 2017 lived in Minnesota and approximately 30,115 Somali Americans lived in Minneapolis and St. Paul, comprising an estimated 4.2% of the Twin Cities population (authors calculations from IPUMS 2017 5-year pooled ACS data (Ruggles et al. 2015)). Figure 1 presents the proportion of the population that identifies as Somali American over time. As shown in Fig. 2, Somali Americans in Minnesota are young relative to the overall age distribution of Minnesota so they will comprise an increasing share of the working age population. Figure 3 presents the age-at-migration distribution by age for Somali American immigrants in Minnesota. While nearly all of those 40 years or older were born outside the USA, among the youngest Somali American adults, there are those who were born in the USA, those who arrived as children, and those who arrived as adults.

Figure 4 displays the geographic concentration of individuals who identify as “Black or African American” in Minneapolis (Gorzig and Rho 2021). There are two predominantly Black areas, the neighborhoods to the northwest of downtown, which are historically African American and the area south of downtown, which includes a Somali American enclave in the Cedar Riverside neighborhood. Cedar Riverside includes a well-known apartment complex that houses recent immigrants, known as “Little Somalia.” Students can attend charter schools that incorporate Somali cultural practices and focus on the needs of refugee children. The enclave is also home to a Somali cultural museum and businesses that cater to Somali Americans.

Private transportation in the USA is often a precondition for access to work (Hendricks 2014), and it significantly improves drivers’ employment status and earnings (e.g., Ong 1996, 2002; Gurley and Bruce 2005; Baum 2009; Bansak et al. 2010). But until recently, driving legally was impossible for an estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the country (Warren and Warren 2013). This changed when a dozen states—such as California, Connecticut, Nevada, and New York—allowed unauthorized immigrants to obtain driver licenses (Pew Charitable Trusts 2015; Mendoza and Polkey 2019). A main goal of these reforms was to enable unauthorized immigrants to better participate in economic life (King et al. 2011; Guelespe et al. 2016; Gonzalez and Margulies 2017; New York State Senate 2019). How, then, do driver licenses impact labor market outcomes among unauthorized immigrants? According to standard models of job search and labor market participation, driver licenses improve employment and earnings. They provide access to private transportation, which gives drivers more flexibility in their work commute (Holzer et al. 1994; Ong 1996; Raphael and Stoll 2001; King et al. 2011) and helps overcome the “spatial mismatch” between low-income inner-city residents and low-skill suburban job opportunities (Kain 1968, 1992). However, the precarious legal status of unauthorized immigrants may reduce the labor market benefits of driver licenses. Because paid work is their only source of income, the labor market participation of unauthorized immigrants may be less elastic to the availability of private transportation. Additionally, the lack of employment authorization restricts the number of jobs available to unauthorized immigrants. This paper adjudicates between these opposing views about the possible effects of driver licenses for unauthorized immigrants. The focus is on the labor market consequences of a recent policy change in California. Implemented in January 2015, Assembly Bill (AB) 60 gave Californians unable to provide proof of citizenship or legal immigration status access to driver licenses. These licenses are not a valid form of identification for federal purposes, but allow license holders to drive legally within the state. The law explicitly prohibits the use of this license to infer the license-holder’s immigration status in criminal investigations. The focus on California’s AB60 has several advantages. AB60 gave about 2.6 million unauthorized immigrants (Passel and Cohn 2011)—an estimated 8.6 percent of California’s labor force (Pew Research Center 2019)—access to driver licenses. Take-up of the policy was large; more than one million licenses have been issued to date (DMV 2018). It is thus by far the largest-scale policy of its kind, impacting about one-quarter of the total unauthorized population in the USA (see Table A1 in appendix A.1). In addition, unlike in states such as Illinois, Nevada, or New York, unauthorized immigrants are less concentrated in a few urban areas (Hill and Johnson 2011). The lack of public transportation in many parts of the state should make unauthorized immigrants particularly responsive to changes in access to private transportation. The paper uses American Community Survey (ACS) microdata from 2010 to 2019 and focuses on unauthorized immigrants of Mexican origin, who constitute about two-thirds of California’s unauthorized population. My results show that driver licenses improve likely unauthorized Mexican immigrants’ access to private transportation: driver licenses increase the likelihood that this population owns a car by 1.9 percentage points and that it drives to work by up to 2.6 percentage points. While improved private transportation use does not come with a higher employment propensity, it raises hours worked by up to 1.3 percent and earnings by up to 4.5 percent among those likely unauthorized Mexican immigrants who are already employed. I probe the robustness of my results in several ways. The effect on employment remains insignificant across genders, age groups, and measures of local labor market accessibility. A power analysis rules out that my research design lacks the statistical power to detect effects of driver licenses on the employment of likely unauthorized Mexican immigrants. Additional robustness checks and a placebo test suggest that my results are not driven by spillovers between unauthorized and authorized immigrants. Taken together, my results imply that driver licenses improve labor market outcomes only for already employed unauthorized Mexican immigrants. Driver licenses do not provide better access to the labor market because they do not remove the most significant barrier to employment: the lack of employment authorization. The paper joins others who have studied the effect of driver license policies for unauthorized immigrants on traffic safety (Lueders et al. 2017) and automobile insurance (Cáceres and Jameson 2015; Churchill et al. 2020; Lueders and Mumper 2021). My work is most closely related to research by Amuedo-Dorantes et al. (2020) and Cho (2020), who explore the labor market effects of driver licenses for unauthorized immigrants in a nationwide sample. I, by contrast, focus on one state. Given the large size of the unauthorized population and large take-up of AB60, California is a likely case to find effects of driver licenses on unauthorized immigrants’ labor market outcomes. The focus on one state allows me to better account for the potential confounding effects of other immigration-related policies. I expand on Amuedo-Dorantes et al.’s (2020) work by providing new evidence on the impact of driver licenses on private transportation access and usage among unauthorized immigrants. This finding is consistent with research by Cho (2020). But unlike this author, I do not find an effect on employment. These differences call for increased attention to the way in which state and local policies condition the effect of otherwise similar immigration policies.",1

The negative impacts of COVID-19 on health and economic outcomes have been felt disproportionately among communities of color (Pastor and Segura 2020). As a result, pandemic-related stress is likely to be more prevalent among African American and Latino communities than among Whites, with important implications for mental health (Grooms et al. 2020). We study the impact of COVID-19 on stress, and especially financial stress, among Latino adults in California. We took a mixed methods approach and rely on quantitative and qualitative data for our analysis. We recruited a convenience sample of low- and moderate-income (LMI) Latino adults in California through the Understanding America Study (UAS) Internet Panel who also participated in the Mobile Financial Diary (MFD) project. For the MFD project, we collected data in 2018–2019 during a period of 8 months among a convenience sample of LMI Latinos in California (sample stratified by income and age) who were part of the UAS. The main goal of the MFD project data collection was to better understand the relationship between financial well-being and stress among Latinos. We invited all participants who were part of the MFD to complete our survey about the impact of COVID-19 on finances and stress in November 2020. We had 84 of 134 MFD participants complete our survey (63% response rate). We report findings about personal experiences during COVID-19 in October 2020 and compared this to data collected from August to October in 2018. Our study portrays the experiences of California Latino adults who were predominantly born in the USA and are likely to be working and speak English. We also observe that a large percentage of our participants had health insurance and relatively high levels of educational attainment. We find contradictory results from our quantitative measures, where one of our indicators of financial behavior and well-being showed a significant increase (Financial Health Score), and the other (Financial Well-Being Scale) showed a significant decrease during COVID-19. Anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (PHQ) measures show no significant changes during COVID-19 in comparison to 2018. Nonetheless, our qualitative data analysis shows that our participants were experiencing major stressors during the pandemic associated with labor market experiences and family circumstances. In our qualitative data analysis we also observe that women seemed to have been affected the most by the pandemic. Our paper is organized as follows. We provide a background section where we discuss public data and previous work on racial, ethnic, and gender disparities during COVID-19. In this section, we also discuss Latinos’ experiences in California during COVID-19 to provide a context for the reader who might not be familiar with the policies and environment in this state during the pandemic. Then, we discuss in the methodology section our data, measures, and methods. We discuss the findings of our quantitative and qualitative data analysis in the results section. We end with a discussion of our findings and a conclusion.",9

The recent adoption of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing (commonly referred to as “fracking”) has made these areas even more productive. Indeed, since 2009, monthly oil and gas production has more than tripled with as much as 147,112 million barrels per month more in production in Oklahoma and Texas alone. Because there is a potential for this new economic activity to not flow to all labor market participants (Cai et al. 2019), we focus on this region so that we are able to assess how Native and non-Native workers’ outcomes differ. In this research, we determine how the sudden and unexpected increase in drilling activity brought about by fracking has affected labor market outcomes for Indigenous workers in Oklahoma and surrounding states.Footnote 1 This setting is particularly important to understand given the historic struggle for land rights, as well as mineral rights, following the Indian Removal Act and subsequent “land run” in Oklahoma—a struggle that has been captured in the best-selling book and movie, Killers of the Flower Moon, which documents how white men sought out Native women for marriage so that they could gain access to their mineral rights (Grann 2017), which documents how white men sought out Native women for marriage so that they could gain access to their mineral rights. According to the book, on April 3, 1926, a national publication called the Osage murders the “Black Curse of the Osages.” Facilitated by the complicity of various sectors, Grann (2017) also references a survey that estimated court-appointed guardians of the Osage Indians’ estates had pilfered approximately $8 million from their wards by 1925. How these men secured the mineral rights for themselves into the future is obvious from the non-subtle title of the book. To study how labor markets have responded to the dramatic shift in oil production, we use standard difference-in-differences methodology and make use of quarterly data on employment and earnings at the county level from 2003:Q1-2020Q1. These data are granular to the NAICS industry sector as well as the race of each worker, so we can measure how employment and earnings have changed in the oil and gas extraction sector by race specifically. Our identification strategy relies on the fact that the location of geologic formations (e.g., a shale formation) is exogenous to the existing population of people and their native status. We believe this is a valid assumption given that the Indian Removal Act that forced tribes into present-day Oklahoma was passed in 1830, pre-dating the shale boom by 179 years. Moreover, the geologic formations responsible for shale oil and gas production predate colonization in the Americas. Our estimates quickly point to a divergence in labor market outcomes for Native workers compared to white workers. Specifically, we find that earnings rose following the shale boom for white workers by almost 10%. There is no such change for Native or black workers. We are not able to uncover the exact mechanism that causes this schism. This finding could be driven by the fact that white employees make up a disproportionate share of corporate-level jobs, and could also be driven by a divergence in workers’ abilities to travel to work-sites. This could also be a function of past network building in the oil and gas sector. Griesbach (2021) examined the similarities and dissimilarities between oilfield workers and agricultural workers, acknowledging the necessity of reliable transportation in the oilfield industry and suggesting that oilfield workers’ close relationships—referenced as fictive kin—impact outsiders’ ability to obtain employment or promotions within this particular field. In addition to the oil and gas sub-sector analysis, we also measure spillover effects into sectors that could be affected by this sudden increase in economic activity such as food and accommodations or manufacturing. On the one hand, these effects could be positive for retail trade and accommodating sectors (e.g., food services, hotels) because there are now new workers and more income and wealth in the area. On the other hand, industries that compete for workers in the same pool of all workers, but are otherwise not connected to oil and gas operations, may face difficulties in hiring. We find that employment and earnings have generally changed for the positive due to the resource boom for Native, black, and white workers in the construction, retail trade, and accommodation sectors - though there are still cases in which the benefits of the resource boom are not evenly shared. In the manufacturing sector we find that the resource boom led to increased earnings for Native, black, and white workers while not changing employment. This is consistent with the notion that firms in this sector faced a tight labor market and increased wages to attract or retain employees. On balance, we find that the shale boom offered an unusual change in economic activity which added tightness to labor markets that led to new employment and earnings opportunities. And yet, the fact that we find no effect for Native workers in the primary sector that this occurred, oil and gas extraction, and mixed evidence in the spillover sectors draws attention to long-standing disparities. As Button and Walker (2020) highlight, Native groups have the lowest employment-to-population ratio and highest unemployment rate in the country, and also earn nearly $15,000 less than the median income. Courts have often sided with non-indigenous parties in economic disputes. In a US Supreme Court ruling that described the transfer of land from indigenous people to the federal government (and subsequently private parties) it was noted in the record that, “...the tribes of this continent were deprived of their ancestral ranges by force and that, even when the Indians ceded millions of acres by treaty in return for blankets, food and trinkets, it was not a sale but the conqueror’s will that deprived them of their land” (Echo-Hawk (2012))Footnote 2 Obviously, this forced migration of Indigenous people stands to have long-lasting negative consequences (Becker and Ferrara 2019). Dippel (2014) find that the forced integration of autonomous tribes into a system of shared governance had large negative long-run effects. Specifically, reservations that combined multiple sub-tribal bands when they were formed are 30% poorer today. One critical mechanism to understand diverging outcomes between Native and non-Native groups is the role of property rights, and this has been a primary focus within the literature. Aragón (2015) uses the case of First Nations’ modern treaties which clarified ownership of land and natural resources near Aboriginal communities and finds evidence of a positive impact of modern treaties on real income. This effect is primarily driven by employment income and even spreads to workers in industries not directly affected by the reform. Restrictions governing the transfer of property rights have also had long-lasting negative effects. Dippel and Frye (n.d) make use of a natural experiment in which millions of acres of reservation lands were allotted to Native American households under differing land-titles between 1887 and 1934. They compare non-transferable land plots with neighboring plots that have full property rights and use fine-grained satellite imagery to measure changes in land development and agricultural activity from 1974 to 2020. These authors ultimately find that “non-transferable allotted-trust status reduces overall land utilization by 0.2 standard deviations, which translates into a 4 percentage point lower share of land in agricultural cultivation, and a 0.2 percentage point lower share of land in development” (Dippel and Frye (n.d). Leonard et al. (2020) show that the federal government facilitated land titling and non-Indian settlement through the General Allotment Act of 1887. They find that there is a U-shaped relationship between American Indian per capita income and the reservation’s share of prime agricultural land, which stands in contrast to the strictly positive relationship across US counties. The connection to natural resources in indigenous cultures is important for a myriad reasons, and Feir et al. (n.d) show how bison-reliant societies have fared since the near extinction of bison just before the start of the twentieth century. These authors show that formerly bison-reliant societies have 20–40% less income per capita.Footnote 3Feir et al. (n.d) further argue that this is related to other long-run disparities like suicide and unrest. Specific to the recent fracking resource boom, Leonard and Parker (2021) study the patchwork of private, jointly owned and tribal government parcels on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in the Bakken shale region. They find that all three forms of fragmentation reduced production during the oil boom, especially joint ownership and the interspersion of small parcels of government and private land. Frye and Parker (n.d) studies the decentralization of governance across American Indian reservations and measures the long-run development differences for reservations that were granted less sovereignty through the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA). These authors find that IRA adoption stifled economic development which ultimately resulted in lower per capita income and higher inequality. They further find that these income differences develop within the first decade of adoption, and even persist in the long run. Wright and White (2012) specifically notes that development of resources on and near Indigenous territories has many potential benefits including new employment and wealth, but that the development of oil and gas resources can also lead to economic inequality, loss of traditional lifestyles, displacement, and environmental damage. Indeed, recent disputes over pipeline development is indicative of these tensions; Spice (2018) and Hurlbert and Fletcher (2020), and Zentner et al. (2019) show how Indigenous populations are on the front-lines of climatic change. We are able to add to this literature by specifically examining how employment and earnings for Native and non-Native workers have changed as a direct result of the fracking boom. We first investigate how these outcomes have changed within the oil and gas extraction sector, and then explore how employment and earnings for Native workers in other accommodating and competing sectors. There is a rich history in the economics literature devoted to studying the effects of sudden resource booms and the persistent effects of reliance on natural resource wealth. One vein of the resource boom literature describes what has been termed a “resource curse” or “Dutch Disease”—the unexpected outcome that countries with large resource endowments have slower long-run economic growth (for example, see Kim and Lin (2017) and Sachs and Warner (2001). It is named as such to highlight the case of the Netherlands after the discovery of extensive natural gas deposits in the North Sea in 1959. Much of the literature has used national-level data to discuss this phenomenon, but in the USA sub-national studies have become more common (Gittings and Roach 2020; Jaimes and Gerlagh 2020; Abboud and Betz 2021). One mechanism behind findings of a ‘resource curse’ is that new demand for labor increases wages in the resource extraction sector (e.g., a country with ample timber increases wages for loggers), which then creates an incentive for workers in other sectors to move into the resource extraction sector. In order to keep employment from exiting towards the resource sector, other sectors must also offer higher wages to retain or attract new employees to replace those that have left (Sala-i Martin and Subramanian 2013). There are two potential outcomes that could then occur in the outside (non-resource extraction) sectors that sell products outside of the resource rich area: (i) these industries pass-on higher labor costs through their prices and lose market share by having higher prices, or (ii) output falls because they are unable to fulfill their demand for labor when keeping wages constant because employees leave for other industries. There are also other potential drivers for why areas that are resource abundant witness lower than average economic growth. Blanco and Grier (2012) find that educational attainment and human capital investment and development is lower in areas that are resource dependent, and Rickman et al. (2017) finds that this reduction in education and human capital investment is taking place in shale rich regions. Another cause that has been found is due to changes in entrepreneurship outside of the resource extraction sector (Betz et al. 2015; Tsvetkova and Partridge 2017). A complete resource “curse” is not the consensus of the literature, though, because a number of papers find that resource rich areas actually drive employment and income gains. The primary mechanism behind positive changes due to a resource boom is that demand for locally traded goods (e.g., food and accommodations) increases because of an increase in the population and sudden income gains from new jobs or royalty payments. Brown et al. (2019) show that a one dollar increase in royalty payments is associated with an additional $0.50 in local income created. Alexeev and Conrad (2009) find that a large resource endowment has been positive for long-term economic growth. Michaels (2011) find that counties in the southern USA that had a large oil endowment have had higher population and per capita income growth than others. In contrast to the theory that a boom in mining sector employment crowds out investment in non-mining sectors, Weber (2014) finds that mining and non-mining employment are positively correlated, and Allcott and Keniston (2018) show that mineral resource extraction drove new manufacturing employment. In our work, we find evidence to support both hypotheses. That is to say, we uncover evidence that points to benefits of a resource boom—spillover increased wages and employment in non-oil and gas sectors; and evidence that hints of a resource curse—higher earnings in the manufacturing sector which may be passing through to product costs and reduced market share. A robust literature on the labor market effects of the shale boom has developed because the new drilling technique offers a unique policy experiment to study a sudden (and unexpected) increase in economic activity. To the best of our knowledge, our work adds to this literature by being the first to study differential labor market impacts by race. Munasib and Rickman (2015) study the economic impacts of fracking in Arkansas, North Dakota, and Pennsylvania. They find that North Dakota witnessed an increase in employment for nearly all sectors following the boom, but that was not the case in Arkansas or Pennsylvania. Tsvetkova and Partridge (2016) find that the shale boom has had small or negative impacts on traded goods (e.g., Manufacturing) and positive spillover effects in the non-tradeable goods sector (e.g., Accommodation and Food Services). In our study, we uncover similar spillover effects in non-tradeable goods and an increase in earnings in the manufacturing sector. We note, though, that these changes do not acrue evenly to each race. Agerton et al. (2017) use changes in rig counts to determine the short-run and long-run impacts of upstream oil and gas investment. They find that each additional rig results in 31 new jobs immediately, and up to 315 jobs over a longer time horizon. Miljkovic and Ripplinger (2016) estimate the effect of the boom on employment specifically within the mining sector and further determine that there has not been spillover effects on agricultural wages. We first analyze the Oil and Gas Extraction subsector to determine how the shale boom has affected employment and earnings. In this subsector we ultimately find that employment is stable across race groups, but that earnings increase by 10.2% for white workers only. In fact, not only are earnings not statistically different for Native or black workers, the point estimate is near zero. Thus, this finding is not an artifact of statistical noise. Feyrer et al. (2017) is perhaps the seminal work assessing labor market effects due to fracking. They find that new oil and gas production increases income within a county, and further find that there are geographic spillovers with wages increased for areas within 100 miles of a well. Gittings and Roach (2020) make use of a novel data product that identifies workers based on both where they live and where they work. They focus on the Marcellus and Utica formations in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia and find that many of the new jobs go to workers that live 25–200 miles away. Green et al. (2019) and Wilson (2020) also study migration due to the shale boom. Cai et al. (2019) is perhaps the study that is most similar to our work here. These authors study how oilfield employment changed for black and Hispanic workers in Texas during the fracking boom. In their work, Cai et al. (2019) do not find a significant difference between races/ethnicity for males in many of their models, though they consistently find that there are disparities in female employment by race/ethnicity. Green et al. (2019) show that commuters were part of the reason why there were much larger spillover effects in Canada. Wilson (2020) makes use of pre-fracking newspaper articles to show that there was a 3.8% increase in in-migration rates in North Dakota due to the resource boom. In our setting, we expect there to be less in-migration to the oil and gas sector because the industry is much more well-established given previous production records.
 We are also interested in spillover effects that the shale boom has had on non-oil and gas sectors. Komarek (2016) finds some spillover benefits in non-oil and gas sectors while Paredes et al. (2015) does not. In our study, we define our “treatment” group as counties that lay atop a shale formation, and counties that do not lie atop a shale formation are our “treatment-free” comparison group. We measure the effect of the fracking boom on employment and earnings by measuring how these outcomes have changed for each race group before and after hydraulic fracturing became commonplace in 2009. Komarek (2016) instead denotes a county as “high-fracking” or “low-fracking” based on well counts and finds that for “high fracking” areas, there are two main effects: (i) non-traded industries were helped by shale gas development with employment increasing by 3–6% and wages increasing by 8–12%, and (ii) that there was no statistically significant effect on manufacturing. Conversely, Paredes et al. (2015) find that there are no spillover effects when using propensity score matching methods. When they use panel data methods, they find statistically significant effects on employment, but not for income, concluding that the spillover effects from shale gas development may be minimal. In our study, we use a longer time horizon of data and find that there are spillover effects for both employment and earnings in construction, retail trade, and accommodation and food services. In all of the aforementioned sectors, white workers have higher employment and higher earnings, but for Native and black workers we find mixed evidence of an increase in employment and earnings.",

A. Churchill,Godwin Kavaarpuo,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Male,"Housing is recognised as a fundamental human necessity required for shelter, and without an appropriate form of housing, there are several health implications for individuals (Bonnefoy 2007; Shaw 2004). Housing is deemed as an essential determinant of health (Krieger and Higgins 2002). Evidence suggests that short-term and long-term health impacts are associated directly and indirectly with poor housing (see, e.g. Dockery et al. (2010); Marsh et al. (2000); Thomson et al. (2013)). Similarly, poor housing conditions are associated with a wide range of health outcomes such as respiratory infections, asthma, lead poisoning, injuries, and mental health (Krieger and Higgins 2002). Therefore, housing quality is a significant contributor to the health outcomes of residents in a specific home. The relationship between housing and health arises from two primary sources; poor housing and overcrowding due to housing shortage (Bailie et al. 2010). It is argued that poor quality housing serves as a conduit for infectious diseases' transmission via unhygienic conditions, inadequate water and sanitation systems, poor ventilation, dampness, and mould (Fuller-Thomson et al. 2000; Shaw 2004). Poor quality aged dwellings are usually infested with disease-causing cockroaches and rats, leading to residents' poor health outcomes. Bailie et al. (2010) argue that the spread of infections such as scabies and respiratory diseases are promoted through frequent interpersonal contacts of residents due to overcrowding, and interpersonal contacts exacerbate stress levels associated with poor housing conditions. Similarly, overcrowding breeds stressors (lack of privacy, loss of control, noise and poor sleep quality) (Evans et al. 2001; Fuller et al. 1993; Lepore et al. 1991) that are associated with poor mental health (physical and psychological withdrawal aggression and depression) (Evans et al. 2000; Gove et al. 1979). Conversely, health also impacts housing. The health of individuals has a considerable impact on labour market decisions and outcomes, including incomes and hours worked by individuals in various households (Chirikos 1993; Pelkowski and Berger 2004). Employment, and hence wages paid, has been shown to significantly impact the homeownership/housing tenure transition of households (Munyanyi et al. 2021). To this end, it can be argued that healthy people are more likely to have secure employment and more working hours, leading to relatively higher wages. Such higher wages can engender higher savings, a significant prerequisite for homeownership and the ability to meet mortgage repayments (Mundra and Uwaifo Oyelere 2017; Nwuba et al. 2015). On the contrary, evidence suggests that individuals with poor health status have reduced working hours and health conditions have a significant negative impact on workers' average hourly wages (Pelkowski and Berger 2004). Lower wages mean relatively lower savings that can negatively affect the likelihood of homeownership (Helderman 2007). In this study, we focus on the health of Indigenous Australians and their housing tenure transition decisions. The study contributes to at least three strands of literature. First, we contribute to the broader suite of studies that examine the housing decisions of general populations and explore the array of factors that influence these decisions, including institutional factors, income inequality, wealth, income shocks, parental characteristics, location choice, and disparities in demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, among many others (see, e.g., Awaworyi Churchill et al. (2021); Baako (2019); Diaz-Serrano (2005); Gyourko and Linneman (1996); Hilber and Liu (2008); Lux et al. (2018); Mulder (2006); Ortalo-Magne and Rady (2006); Painter et al. (2001); Wang and Otsuki (2015)). Given the peculiarity of the characteristics and needs of indigenous people, as compared to the general population, our study contributes to a second strand of the literature that has investigated the factors that influence the housing outcomes of indigenous people, including poverty (i.e. income), crowding, construction costs, location, difficulty in accessing finance, communal tenure, large family sizes, cultural differences, among others (see, .e.g, ABS (2011); Ali et al. (2018); Fien and Charlesworth (2012); Minnery et al. (2000); PMC (2017); (Rawlinsons 2011); Wensing (2016)). The general consensus in the literature is that indigenous people are the most disadvantaged cohort in terms of housing provision, leading to over-representation in homelessness and crowding levels, and these can in turn affect their health status. For example, Ali et al. (2018) find that poor housing conditions, owing to poor maintenance and crowding, lead to higher transmission rates of infectious diseases among Indigenous Australians. By Indigenous Australians and for census purposes, these are people who self-identify or other household members identify, and their respective communities accept them as being of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander origin (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2021). These people are descendants of Australia's first settlers and live across the country. They are diverse, with distinct cultures, languages, histories, and practices (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2015). As of 2016, an estimated 798,400 people (3.3% of the country's population) were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2019). Several studies have observed persistent disparities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. The former has poor outcomes and access to health, employment, and education due to histories of economic, social, and political marginalisation (Hetzel 2000; James et al. 2008; Ring and Brown 2003). The third strand of literature we contribute to consists of studies that focus on the relationship between health status and housing decisions of indigenous people (Andersen et al. (2018); Bailie et al. (2010); Bailie et al. (2011); DoH NSW (2010); Grant et al. (2016). The results are mixed; with some studies indicating that housing conditions are a key contributor to the health gap between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians (see for e.g., Andersen et al. (2018); Bailie et al. (2010); Bailie et al. (2011); DoH NSW (2010); Melody et al. (2016); Spurling et al. (2014)), while other studies find no conclusive evidence of a linkage between housing and health among Indigenous Australians (see for e.g., Bailie et al. (2012)). A recent literature review by Ali et al. (2018) indicates that housing conditions of indigenous people are linked in manifold ways to their health status (see for e.g., Bailie et al. (2010); Bailie et al. (2012); DoH NSW (2010); Jacoby et al. (2011); Jacoby et al. (2008); Massey et al. (2011); FaHCSIA (2014); Andersen et al. (2018); Melody et al. (2016); Spurling et al. (2014)). While these studies expand on the housing needs of indigenous people and emphasise that quality housing is necessary for maintaining the health and well-being of indigenous people, they do not speak directly to the impact of health on housing tenure decisions among Indigenous Australians, which is the focus of this paper. Our study, thus, differs from this strand of literature given that we do not attempt to explain the health implications of inadequate housing on Indigenous Australians, but, rather, we look to examine whether changes in health status of Indigenous Australians influence their decision to own a home or rent, and upsize or downsize. The closest to our study in the literature is Foster and Hall (2021), which examines housing conditions and health in Indigenous Australian communities. Although this study provides insights as it investigates through a housing policy lens, it differs from ours in terms of scope and focus. For example, the authors provide insights into indigenous housing in Northern Territory only, using a mix of census and survey data from multiple sources spanning 2001 to 2016. Culled from multiple sources, the data is limited in terms of reliability, inadequacy of some estimates and incompatibilities. We, on the other hand, use a nationally representative longitudinal survey spanning 19 years, as opposed to one year, and focus on all states across Australia. Another study of striking similarity to ours is Awaworyi Churchill et al. (2021), which examines the relationship between health status and housing tenure decisions of older Australians. While this study uses similar data to ours and considers the health status of a segment of the Australian population, our study remains completely distinct. Importantly, our focus on Indigenous Australians, which as highlighted earlier is crucial, differentiates our paper and enables us to contribute significantly and uniquely to the literature. Our results suggest that better health is associated with a higher probability of homeownership and transitioning from renting to homeownership among Indigenous Australians. Specifically, an upward movement from one category of general health to another (i.e., better health) is associated with a 2.2% higher probability of owning a home and a 4.3% higher probability of transitioning from renting to homeownership. We find that preference to continue living in an area, neighbourhood satisfaction, and home satisfaction are channels through which health influences housing tenure decisions. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first study to examine the empirical effects of health on the housing decisions of Indigenous Australians. Australia makes for an interesting case study for a number of reasons. There are well-documented inequalities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians (Ali et al. 2018), leading to the government's efforts to ""close the gap"" in health, among other inequalities (Commonwealth of Australia 2018). The Australian government recognises the impact of quality and functional housing in supporting the health of inhabitants (Ali et al. 2018; Commonwealth of Australia 2018), and hence with a health inequality this wide, it will be interesting to understand what the impacts on housing tenure decisions are for Indigenous people, separate from the general population (see for e.g., Baker et al. (2014)). Additionally, as Awaworyi Churchill et al. (2021) noted, Australia's housing market is characterised by unique dynamics. In addition to lowering housing affordability which has resulted in relatively lower homeownership rates, some segments of the Australian population have been found to own less and less housing, with homeownership rates declining from 84 per cent in the early 1980s to a projected 64 per cent by 2020 (Ong et al. 2015). The indigenous population, in particular, suffers from less adequate and affordable housing than any other group (AIHW 2014; Neutze 2000). These unique dynamics of the Australian housing market in general, and its indigenous population in particular, make this study a crucial one, with potentially manifold policy and practical implications. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 explores the conceptual relationship between housing and health. Section 3 provides a description of the data and variables. Section 4 provides the empirical methodology. Section 5 presents and discusses the estimation results. Section 6 concludes.",1

L. Feir,Olivia Matzke,Female,Unknown,Female,Female,"There are well-documented historical disparities in health outcomes and mortality rates between Native Americans and other groups in the USA (Barnes et al. 2010; Gracey and King 2009; Indian Health Service 2019; Jones 2006; Sequist 2017). For example, age-adjusted mortality rates are 40% higher for American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) populations than all other racial groups (Sarche and Spicer 2008). In the era of COVD-19, Native American mortality from COVID-19 were estimated to be approximately 2.5 times that of non-Hispanic Whites (Akee and Reber 2021) in part due to systemic differences in health care access and basic housing resources (Rodriguez-Lonebear et al. 2020). Despite the evidence of health disparities facing Native Americans, existing data sets for American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian (AIANNH) mortality often are quite limited in their subnational geography, time series dimensions and/or lack a consistent race definition over time. This makes it difficult to conduct detailed analysis of the factors associated with mortality outcomes for Native Americans and assess regional variation using standard data sets. In this paper, we use restricted-use National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) data to document Native American mortality trends over time and by geography which are not often provided in public use data or reports. This data allows us to document and control for geographic variation in Native American causes of death and average age at death by genders in the USA. We include White Americans in this analysis as a illustrative comparison group.Footnote 1 These data also allow us to speak to how regional variation in local conditions impact the average age of death of Native peoples. In recent years, advocacy groups have highlighted that homicide is a disproportionately high cause of death among Native American women and girls (Lucchesi and Echo-Hawk 2018). Native American men are also more likely to die from homicide than their non-Native counterparts. There is specific evidence that extraction industries are associated with increased violence against men; the oil boom in the Bakken region of North Dakota and Montana was associated with 30% increase in violent crimes where both the perpetrator and victims were male (Martin et al. 2019). The local gender imbalances that result from occupational segregation in the extraction industries near tribal lands have been a proposed cause of the disproportionate violent deaths of Indigenous people (Honor the Earth 2018). Our data allow us to explore how the local, White American male to female ratioFootnote 2 is associated with the average age of death, and the proportion of deaths due to homicide, of Native peoples. Although the White male to female ratio is an imperfect proxy for the measurement of extraction industries, the male to female ratio has been shown to be directly correlated with violence. For example, see Hesketh and Xing (2006) for a summary of early literature. More recent papers that empirically establish the correlation between the male to female ratio and violence include D’Alessio and Stolzenberg (2010), Diamond-Smith and Rudolph (2018), and La (2017). In this paper, we start by confirming the findings of previous research that Native Americans die at younger ages than White Americans (Abbasi 2018). This finding holds across all years in our data and for both genders. We then investigate what factors may be driving these disparities in age at death. We implement a counterfactual analysis showing that Native Americans die at younger ages even when dying from the same cause of death as White Americans. We also show that Native American men tend to die from different causes of death than White Americans; these causes are more prevalent among people who die young. We then examine the concern that deaths for Native Americans are related to the expansion of extraction industries (for example, fossil fuels) and the corresponding influx of men to an area. We specifically analyze the relationships between the White male to female (M/F) ratios on average age at death and the proportion of deaths attributed to homicide. We use county fixed effects to compare how age at death is related to both within-county and between-county variation in the White American M/F ratio. We find that Native American men and women die at younger ages and more often from homicide in counties with higher White American M/F ratios. For women, this relationship only appears for long-term changes, whereas men die younger and more often from homicide even with short-term changes in the White M/F ratio. This analysis contributes to the literature on disproportionately high death rates for certain racial and ethnic groups in the USA. Our work is perhaps closest to that of Espey et al. (2014) because of its temporal nature and its focus on mortality among Native peoples although we focus specifically on just American Indians and Alaska Natives. Espey et al. (2014) use US National Death Index records linked with Indian Health Service (IHS) data and focus on IHS Contract Health Service Delivery Area counties (in which less race misclassification occurs) to examine American Indian mortality relative to Whites from 1990 to 2009. The authors found that the death rate for American Indians was 46 percent higher than that of Whites. While Whites saw decreases in all-cause mortality over this time period, American Indians did not. We extend the work of Espey et al. (2014) in several ways. First, we examine whether the disparities in expected years of life are driven by differences in causes of death or the age at death for the given cause. Second, we cover a more recent time period (up to 2017), include all Native peoples, and have a more expansive geographic coverage. Finally, we examine whether age at death is correlated with local M/F imbalances. Our work is also similar to Feir and Akee (2019) given our use of administrative data. However, they focus on Indigenous mortality in Canada and we focus on Indigenous mortality in the USA. Our research is able to address which causes of death show the largest differences across race groups and we have the county of death which Feir and Akee (2019) did not have access to in their data.",

Rushford,David N. Weaver,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Law enforcement killings of civilians and the possibility of discriminatory use of lethal force against Black, Indigenous and other people of colour (BIPOC) are well-studied topics in the USA (Ang 2021; Cunningham and Gillezeau 2018; 2019; Desmond et al. 2016; Jacobs and O’Brien 1998; Masera 2019; Pang and Pavlou 2016), but have gone largely unstudied in Canada.Footnote 1 This has likely occurred for a number of reasons, including a historical lack of interest from academics, the cross-disciplinary nature of the topic, and an absence of quality data from the RCMP, police departments, and Statistics Canada or crowd-sourced data similar to those available in the USA (Finch et al. 2019; Swaine et al. 2016). Even with this lack of data, there has been broad recognition that BIPOC civilians are disproportionately killed by law enforcement. In the Canadian context, there are particular concerns regarding not just the absolute level of the use of lethal force, but the particular use of lethal force against Indigenous peoples. This concern was manifested in nationwide protests in 2020. During the groundswell of political activism after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Chantel Moore and Rodney Levi, two Indigenous civilians, were killed within weeks of each other. These killings ignited dozens of protests against police officers’ use of lethal force across Canada. In this work, we use recently collected and released data from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s (CBC) Deadly Force team, spanning the 2000–2020 period, of all civilians killed by law enforcement in Canada to conduct the first, comprehensive event history analysis of the local conditions that are associated with when and where civilians are killed by law enforcement in the Canadian context with a particular emphasis on when and where Indigenous peoples are killed.Footnote 2 We link this information to the Police Administration Survey, the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey, the Community Well-Being Index, and the Census to fully capture the picture of how local communities and institutions shape the use of lethal force. Ex ante, given the limited existing work in this space by Carmichael and Kent (2015), our prior is that killings are likely to be concentrated in urban communities with meaningful minority populations where a racial threat effect may bind. However, the Canadian literature has only focused on large cities and, in line with American work by Feigenberg and Miller (2021), killings may actually follow a U-shape, occurring primarily in communities with smaller or very large minority populations. As such, there may be meaningful levels of police killings occurring in Indigenous communities, which are regularly under RCMP policing jurisdiction. Our results indicate that civilians are largely killed in urban centres with lower incomes, employment levels and housing quality, and higher rates and severity of crime. Killings tend to occur in communities with either a very small Indigenous population or larger Indigenous majority. Notably, killings are substantially more likely in higher education communities. With respect to the role of police departments themselves, police ratios have no impact on civilian deaths. However, policing jurisdiction is found to be meaningful, even controlling for population, with the risk of civilian deaths being lower in regions under RCMP jurisdiction. This is a surprising finding, suggesting that future work should investigate policy differences across jurisdictional lines regarding the use of force. Consistent with the RCMP finding, police departments with more civilian staff are associated with higher rates of civilian deaths. The pattern for killings of Indigenous civilians largely mirrors that for the general population. Of note, even when limiting the sample to Indigenous killings, deaths in Indigenous communities are relatively rare. Rather, Indigenous people are disproportionately killed in urban centres, policed by municipal police forces. The most notable difference in factors influencing Indigenous civilian deaths is that the presence of a greater ratio of female officers appears to meaningfully lower these killings. This is an important finding that merits further, causal investigation. Overall, our results broadly mirror the structural literature from the USA (Jacobs and O’Brien 1998). In particular, our findings align with racial and economic threat theories and reactive theories in which force is used in response to more unsafe conditions on the ground. As such, one core implication of our work is that findings from the US-based literature on reducing police killings of civilians may hold external validity in the Canadian context. These results are meaningful given the drastic increase in civilian deaths over the last two decades, including a marked increase in Indigenous civilian deaths in the last 5 years. There is also substantial spatial variation in where civilians are killed in the country. Reducing civilian deaths should be a particularly pressing concern for policymakers in Western Canada, which not only leads the country in police killings of civilians per capita, but frequently in absolute terms with a substantial over-representation of Indigenous peoples. In “Background”, we provide a brief overview of the Canadian and the American literature on police violence against civilians. In “Data”, we discuss the sources of data we use to examine the factors underlying civilian deaths. We then discuss top line trends in these data in “The Evolution of Killings by Law Enforcement in Canada”. We detail our empirical strategy in “Empirical Approach” and present our core results in “Results” alongside a series of robustness checks. We conclude in “Discussion” and “Conclusion” with a discussion on the implications of our findings.",

DelaCruz,Christos I. Giannikos,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Infectious disease outbreaks spread rapidly across countries and get deep into nations reaching urban and rural communities, often affecting the most vulnerable populations across race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and age. We argue that COVID-19 had a strong negative impact on domestic economies worldwide and that the use of health technologies is instrumental in reversing this adverse trend. During the previous decade, the global pandemic caused by the influenza A (H1N1) strain reinforced a discussion about the control of future pandemics. A lot of studies emphasize that an effective global response is related to how healthcare technology is distributed, including vaccines and the support of low-income countries (Fineberg 2015; Ross et al. 2015). Furthermore, the role of health disparities and how pandemics most affect vulnerable populations was indicated from the H1N1 pandemic (Balter et al. 2010; Quinn et al. 2011). Large metropolitan concentrations provide infinite scenarios for the spread of pulmonary viruses such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which causes CoronaVirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The SARS-CoV-2 strain is a viral infection causing respiratory illnesses that can lead to death, particularly for older adults with pre-existing conditions (Guo et al. 2020; Hamed 2020; Driggin et al. 2020). This virus is highly transmissible from person to person through aerosolized respiratory droplets and may cause death in a median time of 18.5 days since the time of the infection among people with severe underlying medical conditions (Zhou et al. 2020). The first case of COVID-19 was identified in Wuhan, China, but the virus moved fast across the rest of the world, including the USA. Worldwide, the number of confirmed cases and the number of total deaths are both increasing at alarming rates, particularly affecting the developed countries plus India, Mexico, and Brazil. As of September 2020, the USA alone accounted for more than 23% of the diagnoses and about 21% of the deaths globally. New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts are the states with the highest mortality rates per 100,000 inhabitants (Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2020; Coronavirus Resource Center at John Hopkins University 2020). The human cost of COVID-19 epitomizes the vulnerability of the social fabric and the fragility of the economic structure to health shocks. This epidemic started as a public health concern of unusual high morbidity and mortality rates and rapidly turned into a sui generis pandemic which induced a recession of sizable dimensions. COVID-19 poses a trade-off between disease and the economy: an increasing number of cases and deaths associated with this novel virus triggers social distancing and travel restrictions to decrease community transmission, slowing down economic activity. Restrictions on social and interpersonal contact have caused severe reductions in aggregate demand, high unemployment, and household income losses. Isolation and enforced quarantines have reduced the likelihood of new infections but caused severe aggregate demand and aggregate supply shocks across the US markets. In this trade-off between health and economics, medical technologies along with targeted government policy are key to reducing the negative impact of COVID-19 and can expedite economic recovery. The federal government mandated a nationwide ban on travel from or to China on January 31, 2020, even though the number of confirmed cases was very low. The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global epidemic on March 11, 2020, and recommended isolation and social distancing for people with mild respiratory symptoms, even for areas with no cases reported at the time (Cucinotta and Vanelli 2020). However, on March 20, 2020, the New York State government mandated closing down non-essential business triggering a drastic reduction in economic activity; however, public transportation remained open. Similar to other epidemics, for this novel COVID-19 outbreak, big differences have been recorded in the impact across the various neighborhoods of a metropolis, such as New York City, that motivate our study. The NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) (2020) reported that the most affected zip codes were located in underserved communities of color, such as working-class Hispanics and African Americans with low income.",1

Enns,Janette Dill,Unknown,Female,Female,Female,"Multidisciplinary scholars have observed health inequities between Black and white workers for as long as the data have been collected. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the evidence of these inequities has been brought to the spotlight (Chen et al., 2021; Hawkins, 2020; Matthay et al., 2021; Reitsma et al., 2021). Recent data show that Black workers are more likely than their white counterparts to work in essential industries (e.g., healthcare, social assistance, or meat processing) and perform tasks in an environment with frequent exposure to infections with limited protective equipment (Hawkins, 2020). Racialized exposures to occupational health risks and workers’ health inequities are not new phenomena nor specific to COVID-19. To eliminate workers’ health inequities, researchers and policymakers must critically examine the role of work as a social determinant of health (Ahonen et al., 2018; Lipscomb et al., 2006). The inverse hazard law characterizes that exposure to occupational health risks is inversely linked to workers’ power (Krieger et al., 2008), which can be proxied by workers’ occupational status in the organizational hierarchy. High-status workers—those with high education and high skills—receive high wages and can muster resources to avoid exposure to occupational hazards. They also face a lower risk of job loss and are less likely to lose access to health-promoting resources than low-status workers. In addition, although high-status workers tend to have a higher job demand, their job tends to offer higher levels of control over what, when, and how they conduct their tasks, which further minimizes work-related stress that could have negatively affected their health (Gilbert-Ouimet et al., 2014; Marmot et al., 1991). Because work influences health status through access to social and material resources and patterns of exposure to high-risk work conditions, occupational segregation is a fundamental driver of racial health inequities (National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, 2017). However, interventions to eliminate workers’ health inequities have focused primarily on redesigning jobs or changing workplace environments to minimize occupational health risks, with limited attention given to structural changes to eliminate occupational segregation (Ahonen et al., 2018; Lipscomb et al., 2006). This study uses a microsimulation to examine the extent to which the elimination of occupational segregation in the workforce narrows the racial gap in workers’ health. We used hypertension among healthcare workers as a case study. This paper is organized as follows. In the background section, we start by describing the concept of work as a social determinant of health and reviewing broadly the mechanistic linkages between work and hypertension in the current literature. Next, we discuss the inverse hazard law, relating hypertension gradient to predicted patterns of work-related exposure among healthcare workers by occupational classes. Subsequently, we discuss our microsimulation experiment in the method section. Next, we describe hypertension prevalence trends under four hypothetical desegregation scenarios, comparing those to the trend from the occupational segregation simulation. Finally, we discuss the real-world impact and potential implications for future policies.",1

Rahul,Deepika Srivastava,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"Gender differences in the labour markets are widely recognised. While globally gender disparities have come down, they continue to persist across countries at different stages of economic development. The transition of women into labour force is one of the most important social and economic changes. However, much of the rise in women’s labour force activity does not appear to be matched by a narrowing of the gender gap in pay. The World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report 2020 identifies economic participation and opportunity being a major area of disparity (WEF 2020). The said report finds a low proportion of women in sectors that have a high potential of job creation in the coming years in some major economies. The most stark disparities are in Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI), Engineering and Cloud Computing sectors with only 26%, 15% and 12% share of women in workforce, respectively. The numbers for India were 24%, 20% and 17%, respectively. There is little or no evidence on the gender pay gaps in these technology fields in India which are likely to be the future engines of employment generation. This paper explores gender pay gap in the software development field using data for Indian software developers from a survey of software developers conducted by Stack Overflow in 2019. There has been a tremendous economic and social change brought about by the transition of women into labour force over the past century. However, even in advanced economies such as the USA, the dramatic rise in labour force participation over the decades has not been matched by a narrowing of the gender pay gap (O’Neill 2003). As far as productivity differences between similarly educated males and females are a reason for gender pay gap, gender-based division of work within the family has a major role. Since women are expected to take on a greater burden of household work and childcare, they are relatively less able to invest time and energy in career oriented activities and training (O’Neill 2003; Becker 1985). This also leads to women choosing to be employed in certain sectors which provide flexibility to tend to childcare activities. Childcare related activities also imply that they are less able to have an uninterrupted career and therefore less likely to earn work experience. Mincer and Ofek (1982) contend that the interruptions in labour force participation lead to the phenomenon of “depreciation of human capital”. This results in the lower earning capacity of women who face interruptions in their labour force participation, with longer absence from labour force leading to a greater fall in earning potential. Male and female workers with similar human capital endowments and productivity being paid differently for the same work leading to a gender pay gap may indicate some form of gender-based discrimination. The beginnings of economic analysis of differential payments for persons with similar productivity attributes can be traced back to Becker (1957) who analysed the gender/racial wage gap in terms of the preferences of the employers for the gender or race of the employees. Employers may not prefer employees from a particular gender, though they may be as productive as others. Becker concludes that employers would employ individuals of the discriminated group with same level of productivity as others only if the employers can pay a lower wage to them compared to others. The other strand of theoretical literature looks at statistical discrimination as a result of signal extraction problem (Arrow et al 1973; Phelps 1972; Aigner and Cain 1977). Through the years the gender gap in wages has been a source of concern for policy makers and a matter of intrigue to researchers. Weichselbaumer and Winter-Ebmer (2005) have done a meta study of international gender wage gap and concluded that from the 1960s to the 1990s, raw wage differentials worldwide have fallen substantially from around 65 to only 30%. They attributed this to better education and training for women. In the context of the gender wage gap in European countries especially in France, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain in 2001 and 2006, Nicodemo (2009) found that a positive wage gap is present in all countries and periods, most of which cannot be explained by observed characteristics. The gender gap is larger at the bottom of the distribution and smaller at the top in most countries in 2006. In the same vein, Arulampalam et al. (2007) examined the gender wage gap in Austria, Belgium, Great Britain, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain using the ECHPS for the years 1995–2001. They also find a glass ceiling in the European countries and concluded that factors such as work–family reconciliation policies and wage-setting institutions account for the variation in wage gaps. The empirical literature on gender wage gap in India is quite extensive. Deshpande et al. (2018) using Employment Unemployment Survey data for 1999–2000 and 2009–2010 find existence of gender wage gap in regular wage/salaried jobs in India. They find that much of the gap is unexplained, possibly indicating discrimination. Chinara (2018) finds that two-thirds of gender gap in wages cannot be explained based on observed characteristics, possibly indicating discrimination. Madheswaran (2007) find that the gross wage gap between males and females declined over time. The overall wage growth of female workers has been lower than that of males, which has led to the persistence of the gender wage gap (Padhi et al. 2019). A “sticky floor” (greater gender discrimination at the lower end of the distribution) rather than a “glass ceiling” has also been observed in the context of Indian labour market (Duraisamy and Duraisamy 2016; Deshpande et al. 2018; Agrawal 2013). Mahajan and Ramaswami (2017) confirm the hypothesis that gender wage gap is greater in the southern states of India owing to greater female labour supply in these states, which also have relatively better social and developmental indicators. Chakraborty and Chakraborty (2010) find in the case of West Bengal state that female work participation was inversely related to female literacy. With regard to returns to education, studies find that women have a higher return to education compared to men, while return to education rises with the level of education (Kingdon and Unni 2001; Mitra 2019). The traditional approaches suffer from the problem of bias due to differences in the supports of the empirical distributions of individual characteristics for females and males. That is, the individuals are different not just because they have different genders but also there are other systematic differences between the group of females and males (Meara et al. 2020; Ñopo 2008). For example, Ñopo (2008) states that there could be combinations of individual characteristics for which it is possible to find males in the labour force, but not females. This problem of comparability, which leads to a bias in estimates, is accentuated when job characteristics are included in the explanation of the wage gap. The solution is to do a like-to-like comparison. In our study, while we focus on a particular profession of software developers, there still remain variations between genders in terms of both personal as well as professional characteristics. To achieve a like-to-like comparison, in this study, we address this problem by using entropy balancing weights in our analysis. We undertake detailed decomposition of the gender pay gap based on recentered influence function (RIF) regressions. Further, to our knowledge there are no previous studies which study the gender pay gap among software developers in India. Given the importance of the Information Technology (IT) sector in India’s future development and structural change, this study would thus fill a void in literature on gender gap in earnings. We organise the rest of the paper as follows. In “Background”, we present the background on gender gap in enrolment in technical subjects and gender gap in the IT sector in India. “Data and Empirical Strategy” describes the data and empirical strategy, “Results” presents the results, “Discussion” discusses the results and “Conclusion” concludes the paper.",

Evidence from a Pre-registered Analysis,March 2023,Michelangelo Landgrave,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"“Must a name mean something?” Alice asked doubtfully. “Of course it must,” Humpty Dumpty said. “My name means the shape I am. With a name like yours, you might be any shape.” Alice Through the Looking-Glass (1871) Distinctively ethnic names come with a significant penalty for those who bear them. Individuals with distinctively ethnic names are penalized when looking for housing (Turner et al. 2002), applying for work (Bertrand and Mullainathan 2004), communicating with government officials (Butler and Broockman 2011; Costa 2017; Landgrave and Weller 2020, 2022), running for political office (Broockman and Soltas 2020), and other activities (Neumark 2018). Despite these costs, at least at the micro-level,Footnote 1 distinctively ethnic names have been a persistent feature among minority populations in the USA since at least the 1800s (Abramitzky et al. 2020a; Cook et al. 2014). This leads to the manuscript’s titular why question: Why do migrant parents give their children distinctively ethnic names? This question is not only important for its own sake, but is also important for helping us better understand migrants’ willingness to assimilate to their host country’s socioeconomic culture (Abramitzky et al. 2020a; Fouka 2019, 2020) and, more broadly, parental decision-making about their children’s human capital development (Doyle et al. 2013; Lerman 1996). The parentalFootnote 2 decision to give children non-ethnic names is associated with other assimilationist behaviors, such as adopting the host country’s language or becoming civically engaged (Carlos 2018). Fryer and Levitt (2004), which I use as the theoretical base of this manuscript, proposed four potential hypotheses for why parents give their children distinctively ethnic names: the ignorance hypothesis, the price theory hypothesis, the signal hypothesis, and the identity hypothesis. I find evidence in support of the signal and identity hypotheses among the foreign-born Latinx and Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) population but fail to find evidence in support of the price theory hypothesis. The empirical results suggest that distinctively ethnic names are given as acts of expressive identity among Latinx and AAPI migrant populations. These results support Fryer and Levitt (2004)’s findings that expressive identity is one of the primary determinants of distinctively ethnic names among African-Americans. The consistent results across population groups increase our confidence in a general hypothesis of names as expressive identity. I use Fryer and Levitt (2004) as the theoretical foundation of this manuscript but emphasize that I use a different population for empirical analyses. Fryer and Levitt initially tested their hypotheses looking at naming patterns among African-Americans in twentieth century California. I test Fryer and Levitt’s latter threeFootnote 3 hypotheses among the largest non-Black migrant-origin groups in the twenty-first century USA—Latinx and Asian American Pacific Islanders (AAPI), respectively. Given the numerous group and temporal differences in our samples of study, the results alone cannot necessarily be generalized to other groups. That said, this study advances our knowledge by testing Fryer and Levitt’s hypotheses using contemporary Latinx and AAPI migrant populations. For empirics, I use data from the 2020 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey’s foreign-born sample of the Latinx and Asian American Pacific Islander populations. The Latinx and Asian American Pacific Islander samples are used because they are the largest migrant origin groups in the contemporary USA. According to the 2020 US Census, approximately 19 percent of Americans identify as Latinx and 6 percent identify as AAPI. An advantage of the present study’s sample population is that the two groups differ substantially in their demographic characteristics (see descriptive statistics Appendix C Tables 3–4) and preferences (see Figs. 1, 2, and 3). The fact that results are similarFootnote 4 between the two increases our confidence in the generalizability of our results, at least in the twenty-first century US context. Percent hopeful of race relations by race/ethnicity Percent living in co-ethnic majority community by race/ethnicity Percent close to country of origin by race/ethnicity Prior quantitativeFootnote 5 studies attempt to better understand why parents give their children distinctively ethnic names, but rely primarily on administrative demographic data (Algan et al. 2021; Arai and Skogman Thoursie 2009; Biavaschi et al. 2017; Carneiro et al. 2020). A disadvantage of using administrative data is that it does not include the survey items necessary to allow the measurement of parents’ identity attitudes, which are necessary to adequately test the identity hypothesis. While others have tested the identity hypothesis, this article is among the first to formally test it with survey items intended to measure identity attitudes.",

Presumably created in 2008 by a Japanese hacker, Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin is one of the most famous types of virtual money (Cheah and Fry 2015). The inherent characteristics of blockchain architecture and design provide properties such as transparency, robustness, auditability, and security (Casino et al. 2019), which are favorable characteristics in achieving equity in wealth distribution. Cryptocurrencies have been increasingly recognized as an emerging channel for private wealth accumulation despite the risks of investors trading in highly volatile markets and often under unfavorable government scrutiny (Atkins et al. 2021). The two most prominent cryptocurrencies in the market are Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have provisioned a decentralized blockchain ecosystem to facilitate cryptographically secured peer-to-peer transactions for digital inclusion. The decentralized blockchain ecosystem that promises high returns for private wealth accumulation in highly volatile and risky cryptocurrency markets may be associated with a more complex interplay of social interactions with people and institutions. Trends and research indicate that the world population, both rich and poor, is increasingly attracted to the cryptocurrency markets. However, traditionally, the financial markets tend to favor high-income regions and marginalize low-income regions (Honohan 2008). According to Weller and Hanks (2018), the widening racial wealth and inequality gap in the USA between Whites and minorities has increased over recent decades. Using the data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, Addo and Darity (2021) investigate the wealth holdings of Black, Hispanic, and White working-class households from the Great Recession to pre–COVID-19, the period that spanned 2010 to 2019. They find that, in terms of net worth, fewer Black working-class households benefitted from the economic recovery than White working-class households. Working-class households were less likely to be middle class as defined by their wealth holdings, while Black and Hispanic households were also less likely to be middle class. For Black households, racial identity is a strong predictor of wealth attainment in the occupational sector. Specifically, significant wealth disparities exist by age, education, marital status, income, and race despite persistent government policy and efforts to improve disparate outcomes. The controversies on how to address wealth inequality continue. For example, although favorable arguments for increasing the rate of entrepreneurship to improve disparities exist, Kroeger and Wright (2021) believe that the economic cost of doing business would exacerbate the wealth disparity issue. Conversely, Darity and Hamilton (2017) argue that the racial wealth gap is rooted in socioeconomic and political structure barriers heralding from disdain for minority underachievement in education or financial literacy. The COVID-19 pandemic increased the wealth gap because billionaires in the USA have become unfathomably richer, while the poor are struggling to keep their homes (Taylor 2021). Minorities see fintech technology as a mechanism to close the persistent wealth gap. The wealth gap has been well researched, but the current empirical literature has not reached a consensus on how to address those inequalities. Currently, Black and Hispanic investors, who have traditionally stayed away from the stock market, are finding digital coins more attractive because of their potential to address inequality (Zhang et al. 2020). The August 17, 2021, USA Today Harris Poll indicates that 23% of Blacks and 17% of Hispanics, as compared to 11% of White Americans, are currently investing in digital assets. Roşu and Saleh (2021) indicate random selection in the market for cryptocurrency can encourage equitable outcomes where rich and poor stakeholders are enabled to amass stable investment shares. It is possible that investment in digital coins may help to circumvent discriminatory practices that marginalized groups have historically experienced with financial institutions in the USA and change the wealth trajectory for minorities. This paper explores cryptocurrency and digital asset investment during the COVID-19 pandemic among different demographics of investors and their portfolio choices. Over the past 2 years, many investors have reassessed their portfolio mix as traditional investment strategies may not be optimal. While portfolio diversification may be necessary to optimize the return for all investors, little is known regarding the portfolio strategies for emerging digital assets, especially within minority groups. The results in this study will inform the extent to which maginalized populations in the USA may benefit from asset allocation incentives. The “Data and Methodology” section of the paper examines the data and presents our stylized capital asset pricing model and methodogy. The “Results” section analyzes the result and decomposition of investment in cryptocurrency investment by race, and the “Conclusion” section concludes the paper.",

Yen,Ernest M. Zampelli,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Affirmative action in employment (AAE) consists of policies and procedures affording preferential treatment in the hiring and promotion of historically disadvantaged groups, typically racial minorities and women. Its specific intent is to redress the consequences of past labor market discrimination while discouraging discriminatory employment practices in the present. Though AAE has been shown to increase the racial and gender diversity of an organization’s workforce and/or management team (e.g., Harris 2009; Herring and Collins 1995; Holzer and Neumark 1999; Holzer and Neumark 2000; Kalev et al. 2006), it should not be conflated with workplace “diversity policies,” the intent of which is to hire and promote employees who are “different” from the traditional employee so that organizations might benefit from pooling across diverse talents and skills. That said, such conflation is exactly what has occurred over time (Herring and Henderson 2012). Specifically, “…neoliberal elites used diversity ideology to frame racial inclusion in language that was more politically palatable to whites and to broaden the politics and discourse of inclusion beyond concerns about race or inequality.” (Herring and Henderson 2012:632). While such rhetoric has fostered greater organizational inclusion of racial minorities and women, it has also been used “…to accommodate and even support privileged people and to minimize the threats of integration to their own institutional interests.” (Herring and Henderson 2012:632). From interviews with upper-level managers of Fortune 1000 companies, Embrick (2011) concludes that “…diversity ideology has enabled many organizations to curtail deeper investigations into the gender and racial inequalities that continue to persist in the workplace” (Embrick 2011:541) and even finds that “…managers tend to exclude race and gender in their definitions of diversity.” (Embrick 2011:541). The implication is that diversity ideology disconnected from AAE will generally be ineffective in bringing about race and gender equity in the workplace. As Herring and Henderson (2012) argue, “…to bring about a ‘colorblind’ and gender-equal society, diversity efforts must be color and gender conscious; to deliver equality of opportunity, there must be calls for greater efforts to educate, recruit, train, employ, and promote only some citizens…” (Herring and Henderson 2012:640). Unless reconnected to AAE, diversity ideology may serve both to defend the status quo and impede progress in achieving true workplace equality (Smith and Mayorga-Gallo 2017). Lest one be lulled into a sense that enormous progress has already been made in the struggle against labor market discrimination, a recent review of experimental research on labor market discrimination by Neumark (2018) and a meta-analysis of labor market field experiments by Quillian et al. (2017) strongly suggest that employment discrimination remains widespread. Indeed, based on the evidence, Neumark (2018) concludes that to move forward, hiring policies must be more proactive than reactive, and cites AAE explicitly as one possibility. Similarly, Burns and Darity (2019), in examining the diversity rationale for affirmative action, point out that viewing employment discrimination as a thing of the past is contradicted by statistics from the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Specifically, in FY2017, EEOC reported that 33.9 percent of charges (28,528 cases) were related to race and 30.4 percent (25,605 cases) to sex, The authors conclude that “…the strongest case for affirmative action should include the necessity of anti-discrimination measures to provide broad access to members of groups who have been historically excluded. And even if inclusion has historical precedence, affirmative action may not be about restitution for historical discrimination but may, primarily, emend present barriers to inclusion” (Burns and Darity 2019:351). Evidence of persistent inequalities in the workplace is also provided by Thomas et al. (2021). In particular, their analysis of representation in the corporate pipeline by gender and race at the start of 2021 found that:  Forty-two percent of manager positions were held by White men, 17% by men of color, 28% by White women, and 12% by women of color;  Fifty percent of senior manager/director positions were held by White men, 15% by men of color, 27% by White women, and 9% by women of color;  Fifty-six percent of VP positions were held by White males, 13% by men of color, 24% by White women, and 7% by women of color;  Sixty-one percent of senior VP positions were held by White men, 12% by men of color, 22% by White women, and 5% by women of color;  Sixty-two percent of CEO positions were held by White males, 13% by men of color, 20% by White women, and 4% by women of color. The report concludes that “…promotions at the first step up to manager are not equitable, and women of color lose ground in representation at every level. There is still a “broken rung” at the first step up to manager…and this makes it nearly impossible for companies to lay a foundation for sustained progress at more senior levels.” (Thomas et al. 2021). Accordingly, we believe that deepening our understanding of the factors shaping public attitudes toward the preferential treatment of racial minorities and women in hiring and promotion decisions remains an important research objective. To that end, this paper examines much more closely than in the past, the roles of biological sex, race, racist and sexist attitudes, social class, education, political ideology, and partisanship in forming individual attitudes toward AAE of women and Black people. Unlike previous research, our empirical approach treats these attitudes as jointly determined. This not only improves the statistical efficiency of empirical estimates, but more importantly affords the opportunity to examine salient joint probabilities, a capability which past research lacks. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section offers a review of previous empirical research on attitudes toward affirmative action in employment and highlights the unique contributions of the current effort. Data and variables are then discussed and summary statistics presented. This is followed by an exposition of the statistical model, together with explanations of how relevant probabilities and estimated effects of predictor variables are derived therefrom. Results are then reported. The final section offers a general discussion and concluding remarks.",

The observed large racial disparity reflects a long legacy of past discrimination in the USA as well as ongoing discrimination within the criminal justice system.Footnote 1 While both black men and black women face discrimination, the effect of this discrimination on disparities within the criminal justice system may differ by gender. This paper uses state-level data to compare the racial disparity for black men and black women over the 1978–2016 period. This analysis provides insight into the extent to which the factors leading to racial disparities in imprisonment affect black men and women in common or differentially. Even though women are incarcerated at a much lower rate than men in the USA, the female incarceration rate in the USA is extremely high by global standards. While they make up only 4% of the world’s female population, women in the USA constitute 30% of incarcerated women worldwide.Footnote 2 This underscores the importance of understanding the racial dynamics of female imprisonment within the USA. There are very large increases in incarceration for black men and black women between 1978 and 1999, with the rate per 100,000 of the population rising from 1063 to 3358 for men, and the corresponding increase for women being from 42 to 204 (Figs. 1 and 2).Footnote 3 Between 1999 and 2016, both groups experience a decline, but while the male rate falls by about 25% to 2508, the female rate drops by almost 50%, falling to 108. Notably, the rate for both groups is much higher at the end of the sample compared to the beginning. Male and female Black-White ratio
 Incarceration rates for females (per 100,000) From the beginning of our sample in 1978 until the mid-1990s, the racial disparity for black men and black women is very similar in magnitude. We measure the disparity as the per capita black imprisonment rate divided by the per capita white imprisonment rate for each group.Footnote 4 At the beginning of our sample in 1978, the female disparity at 7.7 is higher than the male disparity of 6.7 (Fig. 1). The disparities for men and women exhibit similar dynamics, with a fall into the mid-1980s, followed by an increase until the mid-1990s, at which point the disparities for men (7.9) and women (7.0) are still of a similar magnitude. From 1995 to the end of the sample in 2016, there is a sustained decrease in the racial disparity for both men and women, but the decrease for women is much more dramatic. Between 1995 and 2016, the male disparity falls from 7.9 to 5.2, while the female disparity falls from 7.0 to 1.8 over the same period. Thus, while the directional movements in the racial disparity have been similar, the magnitude of the reduction for black women has far outstripped the reduction for black men. Enders et al. (2019) analyze the male racial disparity. They perform two exercises in the paper. First, they decompose the run-up in black male incarceration between 1978 and 1999 into changes in the racial disparity, changes in overall incarceration, and changes in demographic weights.Footnote 5 They find that the run-up in incarceration is driven almost entirely by increases in the overall incarceration rate. The racial disparity is high in 1978, and while it exhibits some dynamics, it does not change much over the 1978–1999 period. They also analyze the reduction in black male incarceration in the 1999–2014 period. Reductions in racial disparity explain more than 50% of this reduction. Next, they use Fourier approximations to date turning points in the racial disparity at the state level. The racial disparity turns upward in many states in the early to mid-1980s, a timing that suggests a role for the crack epidemic. Many downturns in the disparity date to the early and mid-1990s, including the period after the 1994 Crime Bill was passed. Thus, they find no prima facie evidence that the crime bill exacerbates the racial disparity. We use the techniques from their paper in comparing the racial disparity for men and women. The decomposition of changes in the black female incarceration rate between 1978 and 1999 is similar to the male results, with somewhat more than 100% of the increase in black female incarceration being due to an increase in the overall female incarceration rate. A reduction in the racial disparity makes a modest contribution towards reducing black female incarceration during this period. Over the 1999–2016 period, reductions in the racial disparity explain almost 100% of the reduction in the black female incarceration rate. Regionally, the south plays a large role in both the 1978–1999 and 1999–2016 periods for both men and women, but this is simply a reflection of the fact that more than half of the country’s black population is located in the south. Between 1978 and 1999, an increase in overall incarceration in the south explains 58% of the national increase in black female incarceration and 51% of the national increase in black male incarceration. Between 1999 and 2016, a reduced racial disparity in the south explains 57% of the reduction in the national black female incarceration rate and 21% of the reduction in the national black male incarceration rate. Reduced overall incarceration in the south explains an additional 19% reduction of the national black male incarceration rate during this period. Our results shed some additional light on the possible effects of the 1994 crime bill on the racial disparity in imprisonment. Some of the provisions of the crime bill only affected federal offenses, while we analyze state-level data. However, the bill also contained provisions to hire more police and incentives for states to build more prisons and adopt truth in sentencing laws.Footnote 6 Thus, there is some prospect for the bill to have aggravated the racial disparity in imprisonment at the state level, but our evidence does not support this view. The results for women confirm Enders et al.’s (2019) result for men: There is no prima facie evidence that the 1994 crime bill exacerbated the racial disparity in imprisonment. For both men and women, upturns in the racial disparity were about as likely as downturns in the disparity at the state level in the 10 years prior to the crime bill. In the 10 years after the bill, this remains true for women, while for men, downturns in the disparity at the state level were almost four times as common as upturns. At the aggregate level, the period after the bill was enacted is marked by declining disparities for both men and women. Moreover, the decline for women is very steep. Chetty et al. (2020) have noted an important asymmetry regarding the racial disparity in earnings over the 1989–2015 period. Conditional on parental income, black women as adults have earnings that are quite similar to white women as adults. By contrast, conditional on parental income, black men have substantially lower earnings than similarly situated white men. The recent data on imprisonment also reflects a sharp asymmetry between black men and black women. Notably, we find that this asymmetry does not exist at the beginning of our sample in 1978 but only begins to emerge in the 1990s. Ultimately, this timing may help us understand how social and economic forces impact black women and men differently.",
