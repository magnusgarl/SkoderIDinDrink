Chorus,Theo A. Arentze,Harry J. P. Timmermans,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The interest in Advanced Traveler Information Services (ATIS) has grown rapidly over the last years, already culminating in a large body of academic literature on this topic (see for some notable contributions Ben-Akiva et al. 1991, Polak and Jones 1993, Emmerink et al. 1995, 1996, Hato et al. 1999, Denant-Boèmont and Petiot 2003 or for a review Chorus et al. 2006a). Furthermore, a stream of policy initiatives has been built on the deployment of ATIS in transport networks (e.g. Commission of the European Communities 2001; Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management 2002; Department for Transport 2004). A main underlying justification for this large and growing interest, and for the huge investments needed for the development and deployment of such services, is the following line of argumentation: multimodal urban transport networks become more and more complex and unreliable, so that it becomes practically impossible for travelers to attain complete knowledge of all relevant factors influencing travel choice. This lack of knowledge predominantly exists along two dimensions (Bonsall 2004; Chorus et al. 2006b): firstly, travelers may not know all available and feasible travel alternatives (in terms of mode-route combinations) that may bring them to their destination (e.g. Ramming 2002; Hoogendoorn-Lanser and Van Nes 2004). Secondly, of the alternatives they do know, they may not know their precise attributes in terms of travel times, costs and other relevant factors (e.g. Ouwersloot et al. 1997; Bonsall 2001; Rietveld et al. 2001; Bates et al. 2001; Avineri and Prashker 2003). These conditions of incomplete knowledge are assumed to lead to decreasing quality of travel choices. It is hoped for, and by many expected, that travel information provision may assist travelers in making better choices in these increasingly uncertain and complex multimodal travel networks by increasing travelers’ knowledge levels (e.g. Khattak et al. 1993; Walker and Ben-Akiva 1996; Adler and Blue 1998; Golledge, 2002; Abdel-Aty and Abdalla 2004; Jou et al. 2005). One would expect that a substantial body of knowledge has been acquired over the years to test whether these expectations are correct. A first body of research, based on empirical data obtained from surveys or choice experiments, has focused on travelers’ subjective perceptions of the potential of information to improve their choices. These research efforts either studied travelers’ willingness to pay for information (e.g. Polydoropoulou et al., 1997; Khattak et al. 2003; Denant-Boèmont and Petiot 2003; Molin and Chorus 2004) or their ex-post judgments of how available information helped them make better choices (Chatterjee and McDonald, 2004; Benjamin 2006). These approaches, notwithstanding the valuable insights they present, lack an objective measurement
Footnote 1 of information impact on choice quality. This disadvantage is addressed in a second body of research, that studies the potential of information to improve travelers’ choices by deriving theoretical models and illustrating these with numerical examples based on synthetic data (e.g. Mahmassani and Jayakrishnan, 1991; Arnott et al. 1991; Al-Deek et al. 1998; Levinson 2003; Gentile et al. 2005; Szeto and Lo 2005). This latter approach allows the objective measurement of information impact on choice quality (e.g. in terms of mean travel time reductions), but suffers from an inherent lack of external validity as no real life behavior is observed. Exceptions are found in Adler (2001) and Bogers et al. (2005), where the impact of information on travel times is studied empirically. All these research efforts have focused on either travel by car (predominantly) or by transit, and were predominantly concerned with travel time information only, and its effect on travelers’ realized travel times. This limited scope fails to acknowledge that travelers generally make their choices in a multimodal environment where a variety of travel information types might be available to them, and that they generally base their choices on many more attributes than travel times only. This paper presents a study that aims at (1) combining the advantages of the different streams of research presented above, and at (2) providing a broader scope of research, one that better fits the full dimensionality of traveler behavior. This is done by empirically investigating the impact of a variety of travel information types, including the assessment of known alternatives and the generation of unknown alternatives, on the quality of observed multimodal travel choices. Furthermore, an objective measurement of choice quality is applied that is based on the following general notion: a traveler’s choice for an alternative (e.g. a mode-route combination), made under incomplete knowledge, is of a high quality if the traveler, given complete knowledge, would choose the same alternative. Finally, the potential impact of travel information is considered along multiple attribute-dimensions of alternatives, such as travel times and travel costs of car and transit alternatives, as well as seat probabilities in transit. Data needed for empirical analysis is obtained from a choice experiment in a multimodal travel simulator with information provision, where 261 participants together made 4536 travel choices under conditions of incomplete knowledge, in combination with a web-based mode-choice experiment where the same participants made choices under conditions of complete knowledge. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: in “Hypotheses on travel choice quality and the role of travel information” we briefly illustrate the proposed general notion of travel choice quality with an example. Subsequently, hypotheses are formulated that are to be tested in this study; they relate to the determinants of travel choice quality in general and the role of information acquisition in specific. “Data-requirements and -collection” discusses data requirements that follow from the hypotheses to be tested and the general notion of choice quality proposed here. Subsequently, the data-collection effort is presented. “A measure of travel choice quality” derives from the proposed general notion an operational measure of travel choice-quality that is compatible with the obtained data. “Empirical analysis of the impact of travel information on travel choice quality” presents the empirical analysis of the impact of travel information on travel choice quality by estimating a structural equation model that is based on the obtained choice data and the derived choice quality measure. Estimation results are discussed in depth. Finally, “Conclusions and discussion” presents conclusions and directions for further research.",25

Scenario-based simulations of elderly activity travel patterns in 2020,August 2008,Theo Arentze,Harry Timmermans,Arnout Schoemakers,Male,Male,Male,Male,"As many other developed countries, The Netherlands is experiencing a rapid growth in its elderly population, and this trend is expected to continue. By 2030, about 25% of the Dutch will be over the age of 65. The growing number and proportion of older people will have significant impacts for different facets of society. The working population may be too small to support the elderly and there is a discussion about the increasing costs of medical care CPB (2000). Pisarki (2003) has argued that an aging society will also cause major challenges for transportation planning. Although people tend to drive less as they get older, elderly drivers are more accident-prone and have an increased risk of injury, given a crash. For the Netherlands, it is predicted that the total number of seriously injured car drivers will increase from 11.8 to 18.43% in 2030 (Davidse 2000). Reduction of transportation resources in rural and suburban areas as a result of commercialisation of public transport may imply that the elderly as a vulnerable segment of the population may be hit the hardest (Stern 1993; Franklin and Niemeier 1998; Smith and Sylvestre 2001). Elderly may forego needed services leading to increased isolation and perhaps to social exclusion (e.g., Cvitkovich and Wister 2001; Harrison and Ragland 2003). Public transport may be infrequently used by the elderly as they grow older, often due to problems in boarding and disembarking from buses or to concerns about personal safety. Transport mode options such as walking or biking also tend to cease at some point in time. All these trends imply that the elderly may loose their independence and become socially excluded. On the other hand, the growth of the elderly population can also be viewed as an opportunity in the sense that the growing number of elderly may constitute an increasing market segment, should public transport companies be able to provide their transportation needs. Little however is known about the impact on transportation of an aging society. Although several studies have examined current travel patterns of seniors in general (e.g. Tacken 1998; Alsnih and Hensher 2003; Siren and Hakamies-Blomqvist 2004, Newbold et al. 2005) or have examined their leisure activities (Föbker and Grotz 2003; Kemperman and Timmermans 2006), it is not readily evident that current observations can be extrapolated to the future. There are significant cohort effects. Whereas a substantial percentage of current seniors use public transport, the future generation has become less dependent on public transport as a larger percentage has a driver’s license and owns a car. They tend to be more mobile with a tendency to make more and more varied trips, because of a different lifestyle, than previous elderly cohorts (Rosenbloom 2001; Waldorf 2003). Moreover, they are better-off in the sense that they are more healthy, more independent and have accumulated wealth. Further, many companies see the elderly as a target market and offer special discounts and programs. Hence, the combined effects of these trends may imply an increased mobility. Some of this may be long-distance (vacation travel, second house and temporarily moving to warmer countries), but some will also impact daily, regional travel, potentially leading to more congestion, congestion at other hours of the day, with negative externalities to the environment. Despite the relevance for society, there is a paucity of research examining the effects of an aging society on future activity-travel patterns. To address this issue, the present paper reports a study based on a series of future-development variants that in addition to assumptions about economic growth reflects an aging society and elderly with a different behaviour. The study is rather unique in the sense that to the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies applying an activity-based model (Albatross). This implies that unlike previous research, the focus is not on isolated trips, but on comprehensive daily activity-travel patterns and time use. More specifically, the Albatross model system (Arentze and Timmermans 2000, 2004, 2005) was used to simulate future behaviour of different cohorts for a series of accumulative, behavioural variants. Previous versions of Albatross were based on activity diary data collected in different regions of the Netherlands. In the context of the present study, the decision rules, which constitute the basis of the model were re-induced, using the national MON data (the latest travel survey in the Netherlands, involving a sample of 29,221 households). A finer classification into age groups was implemented to distinguish subgroups within the group of elderly (i.e., 55–64, 65–74 and 75+ year). Furthermore, small adaptations in the classification of activities were needed, given the new dataset. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. First, we will discuss the nature of the scenarios that were used as the basis for the simulations. In addition to a demographic, economic and spatial prognosis for the year 2020, these include several scenarios or more precisely possible variants regarding behavioral aspects of elderly in that year. Next, we will explain how these variants were translated into input required for Albatross. This is followed by a discussion of the main results of the scenario-based simulations and possible policy implications. The paper is completed with a summary of main conclusions and a discussion of merits of the activity-based approach.",37

However, problems with that survey collection process are well documented, from consumer resistance and language impediments to response ambiguity and increasing percentages of cell phone-only households. Many large regional surveys do not sample from particular rural and suburban areas, and do not offer a sufficient number of observations to conduct detailed analysis at the sub-regional level. Along with the rising cost of surveying households, these problems have motivated researchers to consider alternative data gathering methods, such as simulating travel surveys (Pointer et al. 2004) or accessing public microdata surveys (Purvis 1994). One way to obtain data for disaggregate choice modeling while avoiding surveys is to enhance state department of motor vehicles (DMV) micro-level ownership records with socioeconomic and demographic information from the United States census. In that way, characteristics of the local community serve as proxies for information missing about the households, such as income or ethnicity. Although the use of zonal data is widespread in transportation research, using zonal proxies is not common. However, the technique is regularly used in the study of epidemiology, because public health data are often missing important elements due to privacy concerns. To assess its validity, we simulate the proxy method by supplementing limited information from a recent household auto ownership survey with zonal census aggregates, resembling data that could be constructed using information from the DMV and the Census. Census information is reported at a range of spatial levels, specifically census block group, tract, and zipcode. A census block group, representing about 1,000 people, is the smallest unit for which detailed socioeconomic and demographic information is aggregated. Census tracts, composed of a set of block groups, contain 4,000 people on average. Census tracts are specifically designed to group individuals relatively homogeneous in terms of demographics and economic status (US-Census-Bureau 1994). According to the U.S. Census Bureau, census tracts are intended to be permanent statistical subdivisions, increasing their usefulness in empirical applications. Zip codes, which were introduced by the U.S. Postal Service for operational reasons rather than to represent similar individuals, contain on average 30,000 individuals. Accordingly, we estimate three ownership choice models using these three separate zonal proxy groups and compare our results to a parallel model using only data drawn from a household survey. We evaluate the proxy models on the bases of their predictive ability and their approximation of household model coefficients. Traditionally, research into vehicle choice has taken one of two general approaches, differing by the degree of aggregation. In the aggregate approach, the existence of a representative consumer or more flexibly a known distribution of preferences across the population is assumed by the researcher, allowing the use of broad aggregates of demand and supply in estimating the significance of a set of automobile attributes. Such models adequately forecast future car ownership at an aggregate level (Salon 2006). This aggregate approach is considered cost-efficient in terms of computation and data requirements, but it can hamper the ability to distinguish among the presumed explanatory variables in terms of their effect on vehicle choice (Potoglou and Kanaroglou 2008). In the disaggregate approach, the researcher considers the household as the decision-making entity, gathers micro-level data on its characteristics and recent vehicle choices, estimates the contribution of various components to automobile choice, and then sums over households to project the composition of future vehicle fleets. The disaggregate approach has the advantage of better capturing consumer behavior, and as a result, the relationship between vehicle attributes, household characteristics and ownership choice. Although the data requirements are more exhaustive, disaggregate models are the preferred method of modeling vehicle choice (Bhat and Pulugurta 1998), particularly if policy efficacy is considered. Annually, each U.S. state’s motor vehicles division collects a wide range of information from its registered drivers. For example, the local vehicle stock is implied by registration fees paid annually to the DMV. The typical DMV records intra- and inter-state vehicle transactions. The DMV knows the population of individuals licensed to drive a car, including certain demographic information about them, their type of license and their home addresses. Yet neither the typical DMV nor localities regularly collect detailed information on the makeup of the automobile fleet as well as their operators for the express purpose of studying transportation choices. As a result, those researchers interested in the disaggregate approach to estimating the factors associated with the question of how people determine which automobile to purchase must resort to surveying individual consumers, a process that can be expensive in terms of time and money. Potential difficulties encountered include selection of the appropriate sample, unresponsiveness of targeted subjects, and mistakes or ambiguity in responses. Researchers have also noticed troubling trends in survey response: growing consumer resistance, proportion of homes unavailable to be reached by telephone, and per-home survey costs (Stopher and Greaves 2007). The supposed choice set is often narrowed out of concerns over the cost of customized surveys (Train and Winston 2005). Another possible source of socioeconomic and demographic data is the U.S. decennial census, which is freely available. Information such as age, ethnicity, education, poverty status, and income level are collected, aggregated and reported at multiple spatial scales, from statewide averages to groupings by residential block. Additionally, the census collects other information directly relevant to the study of vehicle choice, such as average travel to work time and the percentage of residents that use various modes of transit. By using a proxy approach, merging zonal census-level information with data on household vehicle ownership or purchases could result in important, novel insights into the vehicle choice decision, expanding not only the viable topics available for research but also the size of the population considered. Neighborhood characteristics, which have been found significant in automobile choice (Zegras 2007), could be obtained easily. Furthermore, a vehicle choice model combining aggregated characteristics with disaggregate choice data may help improve on the traditional role of inexpensively generated aggregate models to forecast car ownership, while still allowing the researcher freedom to consider policy analysis as allowed by disaggregate models. Although the use of zonal aggregates to proxy for missing micro-level data is not common in vehicle choice research, it has been applied for nearly a century in the study of health outcomes (Krieger et al. 2003). Whereas residential address and individual health status, such as disease cases or discrete self-reported health scale measures, are often available in public health records, important possible predictors of disease susceptibility such as educational attainment, occupational status, and income often go uncollected (Berjon et al. 2005). To investigate the role of socioeconomic status in predicting health outcomes, researchers frequently match individual addresses to one or more spatial levels for which census information is collected, whether at the level of zip codes, tracts, or block groups. These area-wide aggregates are then used to substitute for missing data in order to control for important explanatory variables that would otherwise not be included, with final analysis conducted on the resulting unified data set (Gowrisankaran and Town 1999). The U.S. does not report census data at the household level. Use of proxy aggregates in place of micro-level variables does not suffer from the ecological fallacy by the classic definition (Krieger 1992), but it does bias the results of statistical analysis. In the study of the effect of socioeconomic status on health outcomes, this point has lead some researchers to advise caution in the interpretation of the results it yields (Geronimus et al. 1996). Others have found that the proxy method has unique advantages, and that the degree of bias diminishes when researchers derive census information from smaller geographic units of aggregation (Soobader et al. 2001). According to Subramanian et al. (2006), area-based proxies provide conservative approximations of the micro-level variables they are intended to represent. Before we can estimate and compare the results of our analyses, there are a few important points to consider regarding the statistical validity of using aggregate-level variables to proxy for household information. These concerns apply to the value and significance attached to parameter values estimated using the proxy method. If the researcher is solely interested in predicting the level of household automobile ownership, the following concerns will not affect the validity of the results. To control for household information unavailable in DMV data, values of missing explanatory variables are imputed from area-wide aggregates. According to Wickens (1972), the use of even a poor proxy is preferred to simply omitting the information. Nevertheless, the use of aggregate proxies likely biases household-level parameters. Geronimus et al. (1996) show that two sources of bias can affect the proxy estimates. First, since an aggregate variable is only partially correlated with its individual counterpart, its use introduces a measurement error related to the degree of correlation. Second, aggregate variables may themselves represent information useful in the micro-level analysis. Perhaps households consider both their own characteristics as well as those of their neighborhood in making the vehicle choice decision: beyond individual income, local income level may be an important factor. In that case, the magnitude of estimated coefficients will increase. Of course, if neighborhood contextual effects themselves factor into household vehicle choice, the absence of local aggregates from traditional models leads to a similar set of problems. Additionally, Geronimus et al. demonstrate that estimates of the remaining explanatory variables are also affected by the introduction of proxy aggregates, with bias resulting from their correlation with the proxy aggregates and the missing original variables, and the relationship between the missing variables and the outcome. Because aggregate explanatory variables tend to be relatively smooth with respect to their household counterparts, they may not exhibit enough variance to provide meaningful estimates. Indeed, if the spatial scale of aggregation were large enough so as to envelop all the observations, the census proxies would be identical for every individual. This obstacle should diminish as the geographic unit of aggregation narrows relative to the size of the studied region. Also, aggregate variables may exhibit a high degree of multicollinearity, making it difficult to estimate parameter values. Moreover, according to Moulton (1990), failing to account for potential error correlations at the aggregate level could bias standard errors downwards. As a result, if spatial aggregates are geographically correlated, the statistical significance attached to results found via the proxy method may be spurious.",8

One way to do so is to effectuate a shift in transportation mode use from the private car to rail transport, which implies that the competitive position of train, light rail, metro and related systems vis-a-vis the private car needs to be enhanced. This can be done in multiple ways, such as the extension of the supply of rail transport in space and time, increasing the speed and reliability of rail services, and the concentration of new urban developments along rail corridors (see, e.g. Banister 2008; Cervero 1998). However, another strategy would be to attract travellers to rail transport by promoting and exploiting the advantages travelling by rail offers to travellers compared to driving a car. More specifically, travelling by train offers users more opportunities to engage in multi-tasking—i.e. engage in meaningful activities while travelling—as travellers do not have to focus on driving tasks. As a consequence they can use travel time more productively (see, e.g. Lyons and Urry 2005). These opportunities have been enhanced significantly with the emergence of wireless information and communication technologies (Dijst 2004; Kakihara 2003; Lyons et al. 2007; Schwanen and Kwan 2008). Lyons et al. (2007) have examined ICT availability and usage in their study of travel time use by rail passengers in Great Britain. Using the 2004 National Rail Passengers Survey, they report that 85% of those aged 16–25 have a mobile phone with them compared to only 26% of those aged 65 or above. Those in the intermediate age groups are more likely than younger and older people to carry along mobile ICTs. Moreover, women were found to be less likely than men to have laptops or PDA’s with them. Although these figures indicate that many travellers carry ICTs along, Lyons et al. (2007) report that a majority of such ‘equipped’ rail passengers did not use them during their trip. In Japan, Ohmori and Harata (2008) found that ICT use in the train is dependent on the type of activity conducted. Services, such as e-mailing and web-browsing, for instance, were used more for leisure purposes than for work. Talking on the mobile phone while travelling, however, was not observed for work or leisure-related activities. In contrast, on the basis of a Hong Kong sample, Wei and Leung (1999) found that the public transportation system was the second most common location for making or receiving a call after communication on the street. These differences may be the result of variations in culture and/or regulations. Although the train offers more opportunities to carry out different meaningful activities while travelling, multi-tasking can also take place while driving a car. Cars can be transformed into private mobile offices (see, e.g. Laurier 2004), which provide, generally speaking, more privacy than trains; there are no strangers who can ‘overhear’ a conversation which makes it easier to communicate ‘sensitive’ matters via the phone. This may constitute a competitive advantage of the car over the train. Another advantage of the car is that there is no risk of disturbing unknown others, which may be rather common while travelling by train. Because lack of privacy in the train may restrict the types of communicative tasks people carry out while travelling (see, e.g. Axtell et al. 2008), we intend to gain more insight into the influence of the social environment on communication decisions while travelling by train. More specifically, we aim to study the intentions of train travellers to choose mobile phone or SMS/e-mail for a confidential conversation with a distant person while sitting in the train. A phone call is often a richer and a more expressive type of communication compared to written interactions (Licoppe 2004). This richness may turn a phone conversation into a preferred mode for communicating something confidential; one can more directly sense how the other person reacts. Nevertheless, silent modes may be preferred from a privacy point of view; others in the (train) environment cannot follow confidential details. Our research complements and extends the limited number of existing studies about activities conducted while travelling in at least three ways. First of all, we adopt a situational approach because we believe that decisions are made in concrete situations. In general, we define a situation as a space and time-specific set of interdependent individuals, tools, buildings and other material entities involved in one or a variety of activities and through which norms, intentions, emotions and other intangible phenomena circulate (Dijst 2009; Schwanen and De Jong 2008). In contrast, most studies on communication search for generic and universal—i.e. non-situation specific—behavioural rules and processes. These studies do not adequately account for the ways in which behaviours are mediated by the particularities of time and place. As far as differences in contexts are operationalised these refer to countries or cultures and not to concrete, local situations in which communication activities occur. Secondly, we extend the current literature by providing an in-depth study of the specific activity of communication with distant others via wireless devices. Finally, while previous work has been largely descriptive in nature, we seek to examine which attitudinal and socio-demographic factors drive the decision-making process prior to the act of communicating with distant others. To gain the needed insights we use an analytically rigorous study; we created a hypothetical experiment in which we asked train travellers to project themselves in a ‘train situation’ where they have to choose between the two mentioned wireless communication modes when considering to communicate something confidential. We denote this as a ‘quasi-experimental’ study because we control for some, not all, important characteristics of the situation. Train travellers within the experiment belong to single and dual-earner households in the Dutch region of Utrecht. For the analysis, we use attitude theory, in this case a simplified version of the Extended Model of Goal-directed behaviour (EMGB) (Perugini and Conner 2000). At the same time, we incorporate important commonly used (socio-demographic) factors that may further explain the assessment. The outline of this article is as follows. “Theoretical framework” reviews the literature about possibly important factors influencing the decision to communicate in public (transport). “Research design and methodology” describes the empirical data and the applied method of analysis. The results are presented in “Results”, and the conclusions in “Discussion and conclusions”.",13

The true problem is the life-style to which Americans aspire; the American dream is to live in a suburban single-family house on a half-acre lot with a three-car garage. If this is the root of the urban transportation problem, then obviously a fundamental solution to the issue of congestion cannot be reached without addressing the question of life-style. The concept of life-style is important to travel behavior because the automobile, the dominant mode of urban travel today, is basic to the American life-style. As Flink (1987) notes, patterns of “courtship, residence, socialization of children, education, work habits, and use of leisure time were radically altered by the adoption of the automobile.” The relationship of the automobile to American culture has inspired many authors. For example, focusing on “the car’s role in the larger dream/nightmare patterns dominating American life and thought,” Dettelback (1976) notes that “as the most favored—and problematic—offspring of that particularly American union of space, romance, and technology, the automobile occupies a central place in our fantasies as well as in our daily lives.” If the American life-style is inspired by such fantasies, the automobile is an end in itself as well as a means. Unfortunately, there has been no commonly accepted definition of the term “life-style” in the field of travel behavior analysis and demand forecasting. Little empirical evidence exists on how an individual acquires a particular life-style, how it is correlated with measurable attributes of the individual and his household, and how it is related to travel behavior. Nevertheless, the life-style concept extends the scope of travel behavior analysis and may possibly lead to improved predictive performance of forecasting models. For example, a recent analysis of trip generation behavior using longitudinal observations finds that there is an unexplained individual-specific effect, or idiosyncrasy (Kitamura 1988a). This idiosyncrasy, which is not explainable by sociodemographic variables, can be viewed as arising from the life-style of the individual. The term “life-style” as used in the literature has two meanings: (a) activity and time-use patterns and (b) values and behavioral orientation. These two are interrelated, but a critical difference exists: life-style as activity patterns may change as an individual adapts to a change in the environment, whereas life-style as orientation is one that the individual attempts to maintain by modifying behavioral patterns and adapting to the change. Change in life-style as orientation takes place in the long term through changes in values, attitudes, and preferences. Life-style changes with socioeconomic, institutional, and technological changes. Increasing real income, decreasing working hours, and new consumer technology all contribute to the ever-evolving life-style of urban residents. The seemingly ever-expanding consumer demand leads to new products and services, industries and institutions, and urban forms. To gain an understanding of life-style and to develop the capability to predict its changes in the future, it is necessary to examine changes that take place in various elements of urban life and see how these changes are related to changes in life-style and travel behavior. This will constitute a basis for a more fundamental approach to long-range travel demand forecasting. The objectives of this paper are (a) to offer a review of the monetary expenditure and travel characteristics of households across population subgroups defined in terms of variables believed to be correlated with life-style, (b) to determine the usefulness of this body of knowledge in long-term forecasting of travel demand, and (c) to identify factors that may influence life-style and travel behavior, but that have not been incorporated into travel behavior analysis and demand forecasting. The paper is organized as follows. The definitions of life-style found in the literature are reviewed in the next section and variables that have been commonly associated with life-style are identified. Then the life-styles of population segments are reviewed using consumer expenditure statistics. The findings in the literature on travel characteristics of these segments are summarized; trends in the variables associated with life-style are reviewed, and likely changes in travel behavior are noted using the travel characteristics identified earlier. The discussion is extended to include those contributing factors that are typically not considered in travel behavior analysis. The last section presents conclusions and recommendations.",60
36.0,6.0,Transportation,29 January 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11116-009-9241-9,"A dynamic model system of household car ownership, trip generation, and modal split: model development and simulation experiment",November 2009,Ryuichi Kitamura,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This paper presents the development of a simultaneous equations system of household car ownership, mechanized trip generation, and modal split, and its application to simulate future car ownership and mode use. The analysis is motivated by the concern that the increasing household car ownership in the Netherlands may lead to excessive car trip demand that cannot be reasonably met by expanding the infrastructure. Underlying this concern is the commonly held belief that an increase in car ownership leads to an increase in mobility and car use, and a decrease in public transit use. It is also believed that an increase in household income or licensed drivers will lead to an increase in car ownership. However, there are indications that an increase in income tends to lead to an increase in public transit use. A question that then arises is whether or not public transit patronage will diminish as income and driver’s license holding increase and, consequently, car ownership increases, or will public transit prosper with increasing car ownership? This issue can be best addressed by adopting an analytical framework in which household car ownership and travel behavior are treated as interactive elements: car ownership influences mobility, and mobility in turn leads to a decision to acquire or dispose of a car. Because this interactive relationship evolves over time, incorporating dynamism into the analysis is of extreme importance. Recent findings from dynamic analyses of travel behavior support this viewpoint by showing that inferences made using cross-sectional observation may lead to inaccurate characterization of travel behavior (e.g., Goodwin  1986
1987; Kitamura and van der Hoorn  1987). It is believed that a model system estimated using a panel data set will be capable of representing dynamic aspects of travel behavior more accurately and offer better prediction of travel behavior. There exist many studies that have addressed the issue of car ownership and car sales (e.g., Ben-Akiva and Lerman  1974; Mogridge  1983), or car acquisition and utilization (Train and Lohrer 1983; Mannering and Winston  1985; de Jong and Cramer  1987). The effort in this present study takes on the approach of modeling car ownership at the household level on the basis of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of households. This is based on the belief that the major factors that influence the acquisition or disposal of a family car are sociodemographic in nature, e.g., young household members forming a separate household, a member of the household gaining employment, etc. (see Town  1983; Onnen et al. 1987). A panel data set consisting of repeated observations of the same households over time is used in this study to develop a dynamic simultaneous equations system. The objective of this research is (1) to identify dynamic relationships among household car ownership, mode usage, and sociodemographic characteristics, and further (2) to show that such a dynamic model system can be practically used to forecast future travel demand. Throughout this study, the household is used as the unit of analysis. In the model system, trip generation and modal split are assumed to be functions of household car ownership. In addition to this conventional assumption, it is assumed that car ownership is influenced by trip generation and modal splits of the past. These three interactive measures of household travel behavior are endogenous to the model system. Accordingly, the system may be viewed as a dynamic model of mechanized trip generation and modal split in which household car ownership is an endogenous variable. The modeling effort assumes that observed behavior at time t depends on the behavior at time t − 1. One motivation for this formulation is to capture the dynamism among household characteristics, car ownership and mobility. In addition, an analysis that preceded the effort reported here (Kitamura  1987c) has indicated that a lagged dependent variable significantly contributes to the model’s fit. Because of the inclusion of a lagged dependent variable, the models of this study behave differently from conventional cross-sectional models in which observed behavior at t, say Y(t), is expressed as a function of contributing factors also observed at t, X(t). A change in X will be immediately reflected as a change in Y and behavior is depicted to be entirely independent of the past history of either X or Y in a cross-sectional model. With lagged dependent variables, a change in X will cause a change in behavior that continues over a certain period and the same change in X may show a different impact in the short run depending on the past history of Y. The structure of the model system of this study is similar to that in Hensher, Bernard, Smith, and Milthorpe (1987). The study emphasis, however, differs importantly between the two studies. Hensher, et al. propose a dynamic model system to describe vehicle type choice (fleet size, body type, and model) and utilization using a system of nested logit and linear regression models. In the model system of this present study, the car ownership component is concerned only with the number of cars accessible to the household and is formulated using the ordered-response probit. In contrast, the modal split between private car and public transit is incorporated in the present model system. Hensher, et al. consider a range of variables representing vehicle characteristics, while this present study is concerned with medium- to long-term impact of economic and sociodemographic changes on car ownership and use. The two studies take different approaches to account for household-specific effects. An error component scheme is used by Hensher et al. in the linear vehicle utilization model, while in the present study, serially correlated errors are used. Smith et al. (1986) address the issue of initial condition. In contrast, the present model system incorporates correlations among the error term of the car ownership model and those of the trip generation and modal split components. The effort reported in this paper toward a dynamic model system of household car ownership and mobility is ongoing. The model components, estimation methods, and forecasting procedures are continuously improved and refined. The results presented in this paper may not necessarily be the final outcome of the effort. Nonetheless, reporting the results available thus far is useful because they establish that a dynamic model system can be a practical planning tool. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The structure of the model system is presented in the next section, together with a brief discussion of the procedure for parameter estimation. Next, the results of model estimation are presented by model component. This is followed by a discussion of the results of simulation experiments. In the experiments, the model system is applied to predict the impact of increases in household income, number of licensed drivers, and number of workers in households upon car ownership and trip generation by mode. The last section is a summary of the study.",39

36.0,6.0,Transportation,26 January 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11116-009-9245-5,The effects of added transportation capacity on travel: a review of theoretical and empirical results,November 2009,Ryuichi Kitamura,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The addition of transportation capacity affects potentially all attributes of trips made by urban residents; i.e., time of day, destination, mode, route, and linking of trips. The impact could be more pronounced if unsatisfied or latent demand exists due to congestion (Cambridge Systematics, Inc., and JHK & Associates 1979). In the long run, added capacity may influence a household’s automobile ownership decision, residence, and job location choice. Firms’ location decisions will also be affected. Sooner or later, waves of development start filling the fringe area. It appears most certain that as long as the urban area continues to grow, fringe land with good transportation access will be converted to residential and commercial use. The addition of transportation capacity is one of the key contributors to urban growth.Footnote 1
 Perhaps the most fundamental impact of added capacity is attributable to urban growth stemming from the ability of transportation capacity to support a larger urban population and more extensive non-residential activities. Obviously, this growth has immediate impact on travel demand: an X percent increase in an area’s work force would probably lead to an increase in work trip generation by approximately X percent. Possible increases due to changes in departure times, destinations, modes, routes, or even induced trips, appear minute when compared with this primary growth effect. However, if growth were controlled by strict land-use measures or if growth in an urban area were supported by its political constituencies, then the secondary impacts of added capacity would no longer be a trivial issue. One would need to address the questions: What is the trip-inducing effect of added capacity? If highways were not congested, would people go out more often and drive farther? One may also be concerned with the long-term effects of added capacity upon the evolution of an urban area. Would people own fewer automobiles and use public transit more if the capacity of the transit system increased? Would radial expansion of the highway system merely contribute to ever-increasing trip lengths? Neither primary growth effects nor the secondary trip effects of added capacity are thoroughly understood. The growth effects are not incorporated into the standard urban passenger travel demand forecasting procedure in the sense that future land use is predetermined, essentially independent of the future travel demand and supply. Nor are the effects of improved accessibility on trip generation, trip chaining, and trip timing represented in the procedure. This is partly due to a lack of theory. Economic theory is often too simplistic to account for the complexity of travel behavior with its multitude of potential behavioral adjustments (e.g., one can change any one or combinations of trip frequency, destinations, modes, routes, trip timing, and linkages).Footnote 2 Attempts have been made to construct travel behavior models that draw on broader theoretical bases (e.g., Bhat 1991; Koppelman and Townsend 1987; Pas and Harvey 1991). Yet many steps need to be taken before these efforts can be reflected in the practice of travel demand forecasting. Furthermore, determining the effect of added capacity is not at all a trivial task because it is concerned with intricately and dynamically interrelated system components: transportation supply system, land use, accessibility, and travel demand. The transportation supply system affects land use, as evidenced by land use development that seems to inevitably follow the construction of new facilities. Together, transportation supply system and land use define accessibility. Induced trips represent the effect of accessibility on trip generation. Travel demand, in turn, affects the transportation supply system through the planning process. These interrelationships, with built-in lag time, imply an urban system that may be viewed as a labyrinthine “ecological system”. Consequently, an attempt to model one variable (i.e., travel demand) as a function of the rest encounters highly multicollinear explanatory variables, making the identification of each contributing factor’s effect impractical. This paper presents a review of theoretical and empirical results in the literature that shed light on the effect of added transportation capacity. The purpose of the effort is to establish a base from which future research effort can depart. The review of theoretical studies is limited only to those aspects of daily travel behavior for which empirical observations are available. Studies on network assignment and departure time choice are outside the scope of this study. Theories and empirical evidence on the long-term impact of added capacity are also outside the scope, except for a review of disaggregate choice models on household auto ownership. This paper is organized as follows: In the next section, several theoretical models and paradigms of urban travel behavior are discussed. The following section offers a review of empirical studies that examine the impact of highways on travel and addresses the limitations of the current demand forecasting procedure, while the last section presents conclusions and future research directions.",17

However, in the Netherlands (and in other countries) such integration is scarcely present in daily planning practice (see for instance Hull and Tricker 2006). If anything, one can speak of policy coordination rather than ‘integration’; i.e., it is dialogue or information exchange which is geared at avoiding conflicts between projects, but does not seek to establish similar policy goals (Stead et al. 2004). Achieving integration in earlier phases of planning (for example strategy development, goal orientation or visioning) can potentially produce shared policy goals, which would promote mutually reinforcing (instead of obstructing) land use and transport measures. A wide variety of barriers block such early integration, for example: distinctive budgets, different procedures, weak/contradictory incentives for cooperation, reluctant departmental culture or the lack of efficient management mechanisms (see Cabinet Office 2000; Hull and Tricker 2006; TRB 2004). Beside these institutional barriers there are large substantive differences between the domains of land use and transport planning in: planning objects (places vs. networks/flows); tools and instruments (e.g., spatial GIS vs. mathematical transport models); operational modes (holistic visioning vs. optimizing problem solving); and educational carriers. Hence, the two professions speak different professional languages (a point further elaborated in Te Brömmelstroet and Bertolini 2008; see also van der Bijl and Witsen 2000; Wachs 1985). In early planning phases, focusing on the development of new (and shared) knowledge and group learning, this lack of a common lexicon is particularly problematic (Couclelis 2005; Jones and Lucas 2005; Klosterman 2007). Tennøy recently used the concept of conflicting reference frames (Schön and Rein 1994) to analyze the conflicting ways that different parties (e.g., land use and transport planners) view the issue of sustainability (Tennøy 2009). This showed how this results in two different sets of planning languages, which are hard to integrate. Although we recognize the great importance of institutional barriers to LUT integration, in this paper we focus on these substantive barriers, while they have been addressed much less extensively in the literature. Many (computer based) tools and instruments have been developed to try and provide such a common LUT language for integrated visioning or strategy development, for example UrbanSim (Waddell 2002) and MARS (Emberger et al. 2006) (for extensive overviews see Wegener 2005; Wilson 1998). However, these instruments face serious implementation problems. Recent research shows that the gap between instrument development (by consultants and/or universities) and daily planning practice creates the main implementation bottlenecks. The present technology—rather than user—focus produces unsuitable instruments: focused only on scientific rigor rather than also on practical relevance; not adapted to the complex and dynamic planning context; not transparent; not user friendly and inflexible. Therefore, such instruments cannot link-up with the context specifics of early LUT integration (Te Brömmelstroet 2009). These findings mirror the wider academic debate on implementation bottlenecks of these so-called Planning Support Systems (PSS) (see for example Geertman 2006; Uran and Janssen 2003; Vonk et al. 2005) and on the role of transportation models in an increasingly communicative planning practice (see e.g., Timms 2008; Willson 2001). Similar problems are addressed in the knowledge management literature. In recognition of the limited role of scientific and technical information in decision-making, it introduced concepts which addressed the personal and softer dimension of knowledge. In their seminal study on innovations in Japanese companies, Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) introduced the concept of knowledge generation. Innovating companies designed enabling environments in order to provide a confrontation between technical information and the personal dimensions of knowledge. Iteratively going through these confrontations produced new knowledge and thus innovative potential. This provides useful insights for successfully linking the technical information of LUT PSS with personal knowledge. To assess this potential, we have used the concept of knowledge generation to structure two exploratory cases where a group of planners engaged in integrated LUT strategy-making in the Netherlands on a regional (Amsterdam) and local scale (Breda). This paper will (1) describe these applications, focusing on their divergence from existing practices, and (2) analyze the contributions of the knowledge generation concept. Our research methodology followed the logic of realistic evaluation (Pawson and Tilley 1997), which seeks to identify a solution for a particular class of problems, or a ‘technological rule’. A technological rule follows the general form: “if you have a context C, use an intervention type I, to achieve outcome O through the mechanisms M” (Denyer et al. 2008; Pawson and Tilley 1997). In Sect. 2 of the paper, we will introduce a division of knowledge and elaborate on the concept of knowledge generation, exploring its possible applicability to LUT strategy-making. Sections 3 and 4 will provide detailed examinations of the two cases, including: the context (LUT planners in LUT strategy design processes on the local/regional scale in the Netherlands), the intervention (the concept of knowledge generation) and the outcome (integrated strategies). The fifth section will further analyze the general relationship between the identified mechanisms and outcomes, after which the paper will close with conclusions and a discussion of possible implications for wider planning practice and support.",56

An analysis of in-home and out-of-home working schedules,May 2010,Bayarma Alexander,Martin Dijst,Dick Ettema,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"Work is an activity with a crucial role in shaping overall activity-travel patterns. Past studies have suggested that the work activity serves as a peg around which other activities are scheduled (Cullen and Godson 1975; Jones et al. 1983; Kitamura 1983; Schwanen and Dijst 2003). In addition, Hägerstrand (1970) and other researchers argue that activities that are fixed in space and time, such as work, determine the opportunities to conduct other flexible activities. Using the space–time fixity concept (which represents the degree of space–time fixity of daily activities), Schwanen and Kwan (2008) found that work tends to be the most binding activity in space and time. However, recent studies suggest that, with the widespread adoption of information and communication technologies (ICTs) together with an increase in the flexibility of work arrangements, people now schedule their work activities in a more flexible way (Handy and Mokhtarian 1996; Mokhtarian and Salomon 1997; Kwan 2002; Couclelis 2003; Graaff and Rietveld 2007; Schwanen and Kwan 2008). New forms of working with less conventional temporal schedules have already emerged (Pendyala et al. 1991; Mannering and Mokhtarian 1995; Vilhelmson and Thulin 2001; Lyons and Haddad 2008). Increasingly, urban and transport planners are interested in the impacts of this growing flexibility of working while travelling, because of its potential contribution to the reduction of peak period congestion (Lund and Mokhtarian 1994; Mokhtarian 1998) and the improvement of air quality. Most of the early studies in this area concentrated on the effects of telecommuting on travel demand (Pendyala et al. 1991; Mannering and Mokhtarian 1995; Koenig et al. 1996; Vilhelmson and Thulin 2001), although recently more attention has been directed toward work-hour arrangements (Yeraguntla and Bhat 2005; Vana et al. 2008) and different forms of working practice, for instance, part-day homeworking (combining working at home with working at the work place, Lyons and Haddad 2008). The studies have been primarily concerned with the frequency of homeworking as a function of sociodemographics, job related characteristics, and travel-behaviour variables. For instance, Pendyala et al. (1991) and Koenig et al. (1996) found a significant reduction in the amount of work-related travel (the total distance travelled by telecommuters). Lyons and Haddad (2008) observed that there has been an increasing incidence of part-day homeworking, which can displace the timing of a commute trip. Although many studies have addressed the impact that ICT has on commuting behaviour as a result of telecommuting, the relationship between ICT use and the flexibility of work has received much less attention. Nevertheless, this relationship is of interest for a couple of reasons. First, ICT may allow work to be organized so that work activities are less strictly bound to specific times and to the work place. More flexibility in work time would ensue and consequently might allow firms to offer jobs with flexible work hours and workers to accept these jobs. Potentially, the timing of work trips may shift, thereby impacting on traffic patterns and congestion. However, the extent to which the flexibility of work times leads to actual changes in the timing of work may be limited. Whereas for a long time work has served as a structuring element for the timing of other activities, with increased flexibility the timing of work becomes structured by constraints set by other activities, such as household or social obligations that take place at more or less fixed times. Thus, even though work may become fully flexible from a functional perspective, the earliest start and end times individuals would consider for working are bounded. To understand the impact of ICT on work scheduling, we need to find these boundaries. They could well be different for different work arrangements, such as working in the office or working from home. The aim of this study is therefore twofold. First, to gain insight into the impact of ICTs on offering and accepting flexible work schedules, we have explored the impact of ICT along with sociodemographic and work-related factors on the propensity to have a flexible work schedule. Second, we have examined how and to what extent the actual timing of work and the boundaries of acceptable start and end times are influenced by ICTs, work-related and sociodemographic characteristics. Aspects of ICT considered here include the ownership of ICT, the purpose of ownership, and the actual use. We concentrate on workdays, because the scheduling of work activities on workdays is different from that on non-workdays (Schwanen and Dijst 2003; Sall et al. 2005). To investigate the propensity of having flexible work hours, a binary logit model was estimated. Stochastic frontier models were applied to estimate the earliest possible start and the latest possible end times of work activities, based on the observed start and end times of work activities at home and the workplace. While survey data tell us when work actually starts and ends, they do not provide any information about when people would be willing to start and finish their work. Thus the earliest possible start and the latest possible end time are treated as unobserved boundaries that influence the actual start and end times of work. Based on past studies (Damm 1983; Bhat and Singh 2000; Schwanen and Dijst 2003; Koenig et al. 1996), we distinguish four categories of working arrangement: (a) in-home working, which represents whole-day homeworking without commuting; (b) out-of-home working, which represents working at a conventional work location or other location(s) outside the home on any given day; (c) before-commute
working, which refers to working at home at the beginning of the day until commuting; (d) after-commute working, which refers to working at home at the end of the day after out-of-home work. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we present the study’s background. In the following section, we discuss the data employed and the methodology. This section is followed by the empirical results. In the final section we put forward our conclusions.",22

Y. Lee,Paul Waddell,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Transportation planning has traditionally focused on travel demand forecast models that assume land use as exogenous inputs and ignore the feedback effects between changes in the transportation system and urban development (Waddell et al. 2007). Research advancements in this arena have been shifting away from these narrow views toward more holistic approaches (Miller et al. 1998). The developments of large-scale integrated transportation and land use microsimulation systems—such as ILUMASS (Strauch et al. 2005; Wagner and Wegener 2007), ILUTE (Miller and Salvini 2001; Salvini and Miller 2005), and UrbanSim (Waddell 2002; Waddell et al. 2003)—have generated increasing attention on the research of a wide assortment of travel-related econometric models. Two essential household behaviors that have been separately examined and modeled to a great extent in recent years are residential mobility and location choice and they are the subjects of this empirical study. Residential mobility and location choice are critical components in systems of integrated transportation and land use models. They are significant long-term household decisions that intimately connect with the daily activity and travel aspects of individual lives (Clark and Dieleman 1996; Dieleman 2001). Trade-offs between housing qualities and rents, activity opportunities, and travel costs have long been recognized as fundamental considerations in both the decision to move (Brown and Moore 1970; Rossi 1955) and the selection of a residence (Alonso 1964; Muth 1969). In the transportation-land use modeling context, there are a few recent contributions on residential mobility (e.g., Eluru et al. 2009; Habib and Miller 2008) and a considerable list of current research on residential location (e.g., Chen et al. 2008; Guevara and Ben-Akiva 2006; Guo and Bhat 2007; Lee et al. 2010; Waddell forthcoming). Some studies have linked short- and medium-term travel-related behaviors with residential mobility (e.g., Clark and Withers 1999; Clark et al. 2003; Prillwitz et al. 2006; Prillwitz et al. 2007) while numerous others made similar connections with residential location (e.g., Ben-Akiva and Bowman 1998; Eliasson and Mattsson 2000; Krizek 2003; Krizek 2006; Ng 2008; Pinjari et al. 2008a; Pinjari et al. 2008b; Sermons and Koppelman 2001; Waddell et al. 2008). Few studies have, however, explicitly modeled these closely related decisions together; one example used a stated preference approach (Kim et al. 2005). None, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, has modeled residential mobility and location choice jointly in a hierarchical structure using revealed preference data, even though these two parts of the housing decision process are most likely interdependent (Wong 2002). Households may partly base their decision to move from or stay at a current location on the price and quality of the available alternatives (Clark and Onaka 1983). Conversely, households that are on the market for a new home may use their most recent residence as a point of reference to help evaluate the location choices (Lee et al. 2010; Zondag and Pieters 2005). How and the degree to which these decisions relate to each other are not completely understood. Further, there remain opportunities for improvements in the modeling of this process. The state of the art integrated microsimulation systems mentioned above all currently rely on separately and sequentially executed sub-modules for simulating residential mobility and location choice; typically, the first sub-module uses estimates of mobility rates to identify proportions of households to move and the latter sub-module distributes them over space with models of location choice. An important computational barrier that has limited the development of hierarchical residential mobility and location models is the large number of potential alternatives commonly assumed to be considered in the location decision. Depending on the granularity of the location choices, the universal set of alternatives for a household looking to relocate can range from hundreds [e.g., neighborhoods or traffic analysis zones (Guo and Bhat 2007)] to hundreds of thousands [e.g., parcels or buildings (Lee et al. 2010)]. Such large numbers are computationally infeasible and behaviorally unrealistic. One practical solution to this intractability problem is to only use a sample of these alternatives for model estimation. In a seminal work on residential location modeling, McFadden (1978) demonstrated that the consistent estimation of choice models from a subset of alternatives is possible in the multinomial logit (MNL) form, where the property of independence from irrelevant alternatives (IIA) is assumed [see Ben-Akiva and Lerman (1985, pp. 261–269) for a textbook treatment of this topic]. In more advanced, non-MNL model forms suitable for the analysis of multi-dimensional problems, the IIA restriction is relaxed to allow for correlations among alternatives. Consistent estimators of non-MNL models based on a sample of alternatives have not yet been proven in the literature (Nerella and Bhat 2004). The latest research advances on this subject, however, are promising and suggest that a mathematical proof showing the consistent estimation of non-MNL choice models from a subset of alternatives may be possible (Bierlaire et al. 2008; Frejinger et al. 2009; Koppelman and Garrow 2005). This paper presents a two-tier nested logit (NL) model of residential mobility and location choice using household observations and building-level residences from the central Puget Sound region. It uses random sampling of alternatives and introduces a correction procedure to ensure that the NL maximum likelihood estimator provides consistent estimates of the parameters in the presence of random sampling, something that has not been done in prior research, to the authors’ knowledge. This work intends to contribute to the body of empirical evidence on residential mobility and location behaviors and improve upon the understanding of the connection between them. It also offers a means for integrated transportation and land use microsimulation systems to jointly consider these parts in the housing process. Following this introduction, sections detailing a review of the relevant literature on residential mobility and location choice are presented. They are then followed by a qualitative explanation of the NL formulation and the sampling correction procedure; a presentation of the data, model specification, and estimation results; and a discussion of the conclusions, limitations, and directions ahead.",112

It generates data on the economic efficiency of a transport project, which can be defined as the maximization of the net contribution of the project to the national income (Hill 1973; Campbell and Brown 2003). By its nature, cost–benefit analysis aggregates the costs and benefits generated by a transport project into net benefits (or net losses). It does not provide insight into the way in which these benefits and costs are distributed over different population groups. Yet, decision-makers and the general public alike are not only interested in the economic efficiency of a project, but also in its equity: in the extent to which a project is characterized by a fair distribution of benefits and costs over various population groups (see e.g. Schofield 1987). Given the dominance of cost–benefit analysis in the appraisal of transport projects throughout much of the world, it may therefore come as no surprise that the distributive question is a key issue in the discussions about the form and shape of cost–benefit analysis (Brent 1996). What is remarkable, though, is the fact that most of these discussions focus on the methodology to integrate distributive considerations into the existing CBA framework. This line of reasoning has resulted, among others, in the development of the methodology of distributive weights, in which benefits accrued by different income groups are ascribed different weights (see e.g. Mishan 1976; Campbell and Brown 2003). Another example is the common practice to base the value of travel time savings on equity values rather than market-based values, in an effort to level-out the impact of income differences (e.g., Gunn 2000; Jara-Diaz 2000; Mackie et al. 2001). The emphasis on methodology stands in sharp contrast to the limited attention in the CBA literature for the substance of the proposed equity analysis. Researchers hardly ever systematically deal with the question which distributive concerns should be addressed within the CBA context (but see Schade et al. 2004). Are we concerned that the rich accrue more net benefits from a transport project than the poor? Or are we concerned about the (lack of) mobility of women in comparison to men? Or about an unfair increase in air pollution in deprived neighborhoods? Without an explicit definition of what we are interested in, no proper equity analysis can be carried out. Before engaging into methodological questions, it is therefore of key importance to specify the substance of the equity analysis. The aim of this paper is to explore possible alternative specifications of the substance of an equity analysis, in an effort to provide a solid base for a more fruitful discussion about the distributive question within the CBA context. The exploration takes as its starting point the current dominance of cost–benefit analysis as an evaluation tool in everyday practice of transportation planning (e.g., Bristow and Nellthorp 2000). While some argue, based on theoretical arguments, that cost–benefit analysis should be done away with altogether (e.g., Kelman 2002), the paper starts from the de facto dominance of cost–benefit analysis. This suggests that any equity analysis of proposed transport projects should be closely linked to cost–benefit analysis, if it is to gain relevance for practice. This link could take the shape of a direct integration of efficiency and equity concerns within the existing CBA methodology, even though it has been argued that such an integration is at odds with the theory underlying cost–benefit analysis (see Johansson-Stenman 2005). The link could also be of more limited in character, in which case the equity analysis might be linked to the CBA framework in terms of the data used, the type of evaluation indicators generated, and/or the stage in the decision-making process in which the equity analysis is carried out and the results are presented to decision-makers and/or the wider public. The phrase ‘within the CBA context’ used throughout the paper refers to the latter meaning. The exploration of the possible substance of an equity analysis will start from the widely used definition of equity—also referred to as fairness or justice—as the morally proper distribution of goods and bads over members of society (e.g., Boucher and Kelly 1998; Miller 1999). From the perspective of equity, human society is perceived first and foremost as a distributive community in which people produce things that are shared, divided and exchanged in specific ways. The way these ‘things’—commonly defined as goods and bads or benefits and costs—are and should be distributed is the subject of study. While the distributive approach is certainly not the only possible conceptualization of justice (e.g., Young 1990), it is widely considered a key component of any notion of justice. The distributive approach to equity thus suggests that three questions need to be answered to determine the substance of an equity analysis: (1) Which goods and bads or benefits and costs should be at the focus of the equity analysis?; (2) How should ‘members of society’ be conceptualized, i.e. which population groups should be distinguished?; and (3) What constitutes a ‘morally proper distribution’, i.e. which yardstick or distributive principle should be used to determine whether a particular distribution is fair? In order to determine the substance of any equity analysis, explicit attention will have to be paid to each of these elements and to their interrelationships. The argument has to start from an explicit and well-motivated decision regarding the benefits and/or costs that should be addressed in the equity analysis. Based on this, members of society can be divided into meaningful groups. Finally, it is necessary to determine which distributive principle to use as a yardstick to judge the distribution of the selected benefits and/or costs. The paper starts with a discussion of three alternative conceptualizations of the benefits and costs generated by a transport project (“Net benefits”, “Mobility-enhancing benefits”, and “Single benefits and costs” sections). Based on these conceptualizations, also the way in which members of society should be divided into groups is addressed. Where relevant, these three sections build on the substantial body of literature addressing transport and equity (see for a review Schweitzer and Valenzuela 2004; Schweitzer and Stephenson 2007). Then, in “Possible distributive principles” section, three different distributive principles are discussed, each of which could be used as a yardstick for assessing the fairness of a distribution of a particular benefit or cost. The “Consequences for methodology” section explores the link between substance and methodology, and shows, through examples, the limitations of existing methodologies to address each of the equity concerns distinguished in this paper. The paper ends with a brief discussion of the implications of the findings for the practice of cost–benefit analysis. It will be concluded that the discussion about the adequate methodology to address equity concerns within cost–benefit analysis has to be preceded by a debate about the equity concerns that should be at the heart of the analysis. Furthermore, the example presented at the end of the paper stresses, in line with much of the existing literature (e.g., Beatley 1988; Levinson 2002), that an adequate evaluation of the distributional impacts of transport projects requires an assessment alongside but separate from cost–benefit analysis. This observation holds irrespective of the chosen substance of the equity analysis.",43

Pel,Michiel C. J. Bliemer,Serge P. Hoogendoorn,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Society is forced to deal with many natural and man-made disasters. These hurricanes, wildfires, floods, large storms, mudflows, terrorist attacks, chemical spills, industrial accidents, and many similar hazards cause massive economic and social damage as well as loss of lives every year. Studies, such as those by Hooke (2000) and Newkirk (2001), show that the frequency and intensity of natural disasters has been increasing over the past decades. Furthermore, other studies, such as those by Plowman (2001) and Barrett et al. (2000), argue that due to the population and urban development growing faster than road infrastructure capacity, mass evacuations will become increasingly more difficult and time consuming. This underlines the importance for hazard prone regions to invest in efficient disaster management strategies. Such strategies can focus on avoidance, where precautionary measures reduce the probability of such disasters (e.g., reinforcing dams, raising dikes, clearing fire control lines), or mitigation, where responsive measures reduce the impact of such disasters (e.g., evacuation). Lave et al. (1990) uses explicit cost-benefit analyses to show that the responsive option of evacuation allows preserving peoples’ lives at much lower costs. Nevertheless, in a later study (Lave and Apt 2006) it is argued that authorities might be reluctant to actually order an evacuation when warranted due to the uncertainty, lack of experience, and fear of financial liability involved in the process of evacuation. The success of an evacuation strongly depends on many factors, such as warning time, response time, information and instructions dissemination procedure, evacuation routes, traffic flow conditions, dynamic traffic control measures, etc. (Dash and Gladwin 2007; Lindell and Prater 2007). Given the complexity of the underlying processes and the multitude of factors influencing these procedures, traffic simulation models are helpful or even indispensible for the analysis and planning of emergency evacuations (Barrett et al. 2000; Hardy et al. 2010). These traffic simulation models can be applied to obtain a better understanding of the evacuation conditions and the effect of traffic regulations and control measures hereon, by predicting departure and arrival patterns, travel times, average speeds, queue lengths, traffic flow rates, etc. Insight into this dynamic process is necessary to make founded decisions on, for instance, the latest possible time to start evacuation, the best evacuation routes, or the most suitable traffic management measures. This contribution elaborates on the different (mathematical) model formulations underlying these traffic simulation models used in evacuation studies and the behavioural assumptions that are made. We look at both (commercial) traffic simulation models used in evacuation studies as well as evacuation research and proposed model formulations. The focus lies on how travellers’ decisions regarding the choice to evacuate, departure time choice, destination choice and route choice are modelled. Hence, this review article is complementary to other state-of-the-art review articles on aspects such as how these traffic simulation models are used to evaluate and design optimal evacuation instructions and management strategies (e.g., Yusoff et al. 2008; Abdelgawad and Abdulhai 2009), the issues that must be dealt with once implementing these evacuation plans in practice (e.g., Wolshon et al. 2005a, b), the data requirements to manage and model emergency situations (e.g., Wilmot et al. 2009; Henson et al. 2009), and driving behaviour under adverse conditions (e.g., Hoogendoorn 2010). In the ensuing discussion we consider the car as the main mode of transport for evacuation. In this view, this review article is complementary to other state-of-the-art review articles on other modalities of transport, for instance, pedestrian evacuation research (e.g., Schadschneider et al. 2008). Many of the evacuation modelling and simulation issues relating to car travel behaviour also relate to evacuation by public and organized transport, as well as multimodal evacuation. However, these modes of transport will not be discussed explicitly. Figure 1 shows the framework of a typical dynamic traffic simulation model that can be used in evacuation studies. Here, the black boxes on the left-hand side represent the model components: dynamic travel demand model, dynamic trip distribution model, and dynamic traffic assignment model. The white boxes on the right-hand side indicate the behaviour that is described by each of these model components: evacuation participation and departure time choice, destination choice, and route choice. The outline of the article follows this model framework as follows. We start with giving an overview of the history of evacuation simulation models and the current state of the practice in “Past and current evacuation traffic simulation models” section. After that, we discuss in “Traveller behaviour under evacuation conditions” section, the current view on travellers’ choice behaviour in case of evacuation, making reference to both a number of empirical studies on evacuation behaviour as well as insights from the behavioural sciences related to decision making under emergency conditions. Then sections “Travel demand modelling”, “Trip distribution modelling” and “Traffic assignment modelling” form the main body of this article, elaborating on the (implicit) assumptions regarding traveller behaviour that are generally made in evacuation traffic simulation models or proposed model formulations—including those models discussed in “Past and current evacuation traffic simulation models”—in light of the view presented in “Traveller behaviour under evacuation conditions” section. More precisely, we discuss travel demand modelling (i.e., travellers’ evacuation and departure time choice decisions) in “Travel demand modelling” section. We discuss trip distribution modelling (i.e., travellers’ destination choice decisions) in “Trip distribution modelling” section. And we discuss traffic assignment modelling (i.e., travellers’ route choice decisions) in “Traffic assignment modelling” section. Each of these sections ends with a critical discussion on current practices and promising future research directions. The final section then gives a concluding discussion on the main findings and makes some final remarks. Framework evacuation traffic simulation model and outline article",202

The meaning of the spatio-temporal organization of the work activities of various people, in terms of distance, fixity, and flexibility for travel, has received particular attention (Kwan 2000; Schwanen and De Jong 2008; Alexander et al. 2009). Considering this relevance of the organization of work activities, remarkably few studies have focused on developing an understanding of the importance of explaining occupations for work activities and related travel. One can expect occupations to differ markedly in the demand they put on work times and locations and on interactions with other people and artifacts. For example, a dentist is tied to a fully-equipped practice where patients are received while much of an airplane pilot’s time is spent on the move and high in the sky. Through technological and educational developments and economic demands over the last 60 years the labor force in Western societies has become highly specialized, diversified, and intellectually qualified. The growth of the service economy and the professionalization of the labor force have become particularly dominant characteristics (Schön 1983; Kakihara and Sørensen 2004). Through the supply and adoption of ubiquitous and pervasive fixed and mobile Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) the spatio-temporal organization of work activities is expected to change. Observation of the implications of the use of these techniques tempted Helen Couclelis to formulate the statement (1998, p. 321): “There is abundant evidence that human activity in post industrial societies is becoming increasingly person based as opposed to place based … ”. This statement actually means that the flexibility ICTs offer allows workers to choose the location and time of their work for themselves. This mobilization of activities stimulated the development of nomadic conceptualizations of work like the ‘mobile worker’ (Laurier 2002; Hurme 2005) who works at multiple locations, such as the office, home, public places or ‘on the road’ (Lyons and Urry 2005), and the ‘mobile professional’ or ‘e-lancer’ (Kakihara and Sørensen 2004), the freelancer who works as an expert independent of an organization on an ad hoc basis. However, the affordance of ICTs for professional work arrangements and its implications for travel is barely understood. The aim of this study was to increase our understanding of professional workers’ work arrangements and their relationship with electronic communications and face-to-face contacts. For that purpose, based on a large array of attributes of daily work practices, a typology of professionals was developed. The importance of this typology for the frequency and duration of electronic and face-to-face communications has been analysed. This research extends previous work in the arena of professional workers in a number of ways. First, unlike previous studies, we examine multiple aspects of work activities, namely temporal, spatial, planning, and commuting attributes. Second, we have adopted broad ranges of ICT-use variables to test how and to what extent the work of professional workers is associated with ICTs. In addition, we have included socio-demographic factors in the analysis to investigate the importance of professional work practices for communications in relation to these individual attributes. Finally, while previous studies have tended to be largely qualitative, we have used a dataset of 554 person-days of 427 professionals residing in the Netherlands who completed a unique 2-day activity-travel-communication diary survey. We have estimated multivariate models of communications based on this dataset. The structure of this article is as follows. In “Theoretical background” section, we discuss what professional workers are and how their daily work practices are organized, together with the role of ICTs in their work activities. In “Research design and methodology” section we describe the research design and methodologies applied. The empirical results are presented in “Types of professional” and “Multivariate analysis” sections. In “Conclusions and discussion” section, we put forward our conclusions and suggest avenues for further research.",8

Governments do not only set the regulatory framework, but also determine the size and scope of investments in transport facilities. Given the importance of transport in current highly mobile societies, the way in which governments distribute transport over their citizens becomes of the utmost importance. And yet, while an extensive body of literature exists on transport and (environmental) justice (see Schweitzer and Valenzuela 2004), little has been said about the desirability or (im)possibility of a distributive approach to transport. The goal of this paper is to explore transport as a field of government intervention through a distributive lens. While a wide variety of approaches to social justice can be distinguished (see Fabre 2007 for an overview), the explorations presented here start from Walzer’s ‘Spheres of Justice’ (Walzer 1983).Footnote 1 There are two main motivations for this choice. First, to the best of our knowledge, Walzer’s approach has not yet been applied to transport. Second, and more importantly, many of the major theories of justice, among which Rawl′s theory of  ‘justice as fairness’, relate to the basic structure of a society rather than to particular institutions within a society (Fabre 2007, pp. 19–20). While such theories can be applied to the field of transport (see Beatley 1988 for an application of Rawls’ difference principle to transport), such applications will not provide an answer to the question why a distributive approach is called for in the case of transport. In contrast, as will be argued below, Walzer’s theory can provide such a theoretical foundation for a distributive approach to transport. The paper starts with a brief account of Walzer’s theory of justice (“Walzer’s Spheres of Justice” section). This results in the identification of three questions: (1) What is the social meaning of the transport good (“The social meaning of the transport good” section); (2) Does the social meaning of the transport good justify the creation of a so-called separate sphere around the good? (“Transportation as a field of policy intervention” and “Transport as a separate sphere” sections); and (3) Which distributive principle should guide the allocation of the transport good? (“Towards a distributive principle for transport” section). Taken together, the answers to these questions provide a tentative theoretical basis for a distributive approach to transport. The character of the paper is explorative. It cannot address all the issues related to a distributive approach to transport, such as the importance of the land use–transport interaction or the personal responsibility of people in choosing e.g. their place of residence or means of transport, all of which directly affect justice in transport. As a result, the paper does not aim to provide final answers, but rather aims to trigger a debate about the need for a distributive approach to transport. The paper draws, amongst others, on the rather dispersed body of literature that connects transport and distributive justice. This literature includes papers that explicitly apply philosophies of social justice to transport (e.g., Lucy 1988; Khisty 1996), empirical studies into the distribution of a wide variety of transport-related benefits and burdens (see “The social meaning of the transport good” section for a number of references), studies into urban service delivery (e.g., Miranda and Tunyavong 1994; Talen and Anselin 1998; Neutens et al. 2010a), as well as the vast literature on spatial mismatch (see “Transport as a separate sphere” section), the growing number of publications on transport and social exclusion (see “Transport as a separate sphere” section), and more recent explorations into the ethics of mobility (e.g., Bergman and Sager 2008) and the ethics and distributive impacts of transportation planning (e.g., Martens 2006; Martens and Hurvitz 2011; Martens (2011); Van Wee 2011). It is well beyond the scope of the paper to provide a review of this diverse body of literature. For insightful reviews into a large part of the literature, see Schweitzer and Valenzuela (2004) and Schweitzer and Stephenson (2007).",152

The aim was to compare outcomes of these models on the same case, specifically their calculations of indirect economic benefits [in the UK mostly denoted as wider economic benefits, see Eddington (2006)], and to assess whether differences in results could easily be explained. This paper summarizes the main findings of this project. The case is a high speed passenger MAGLEV train connection from Schiphol Airport (Amsterdam; high population density) to Leeuwarden (capital of the province of Friesland in the north of the Netherlands; low population density). The case is fictitious, so that no model can have a comparative advantage from past studies or can calculate towards a result known before. Although fictitious, the case is based on existing proposed infrastructure projects so as to give reality to the exercise and to be able to make use of some existing information. Direct transport effects of the case are generated by the Dutch National Transport Model (LMS). These direct effects are inputs to the five models, on the basis of which they calculate additional wider economic benefits. Our case study takes inspiration from the ISGLUTI study on urban land-use and transport interaction models (Webster et al. 1988). The studies differ, however, in two important ways. First, all our models concern a single country, the Netherlands. Second, our case is basically one instead of many ‘simulations’ and we are interested specifically in direct and indirect welfare effects. The Dutch definition of indirect economic benefits was applied: costs and benefits that via market transactions are transferred to other markets than the transport market. Model owners were asked to explain the causes of the existence of additional wider economic benefits for the case and the main parameters in their model that influence the scale of these benefits. The objective of this paper is threefold: To present the formal framework used for the definition and evaluation of wider (indirect) economic benefits by the central government in the Netherlands. To give an overview of the wide range of models claiming to deal with indirect effects. To report how the case study has tried to accomplish a common assessment methodology.",9

According to the Dutch National Travel Survey more than 25 % of all person trips are made by bicycle. This percentage also applies to work trips and recreational trips separately (V&W/DVS (Ministry of Transport) 2009). In 2009 in the Netherlands 0.8 trips per person per day were made by bicycle, more than in most other European countries, whereas the total number of trips (3.0) was more comparable to other countries (e.g. 2.7 in Great Britain, see www2.dft.gov.uk). Cycling delivers considerable benefits to society. It is healthy, sustainable, and inexpensive, it increases social participation and it also may reduce the number of short car trips in urban areas and so even has the potential to reduce congestion (Heinen et al. 2010). It is therefore not surprising that cycling is supported by governments, and that several measures are taken to increase its demand. To determine to which extent the increase aimed for is realized, cycling demand has to be measured. Complicating factors, however, are spatial and temporal variations that are not at all related to policy measures. Several authors have used aggregated models to describe spatial variation in cycling demand according to census data. This was done in the US, e.g. Baltes (1996) and Dill and Carr (2003), in the UK, e.g. Parkin et al. (2008) and Waldman (1977), and in the Netherlands, e.g. Rietveld and Daniel (2004). Parkin et al. (2008) showed that hilliness, temperature and rain have a large influence on demand in the UK. Rietveld and Daniel (2004) found that cycling demand in Dutch cities depends on demographics such as ethnic composition, and policy-related variables like safety and modal competitiveness. Although these studies give insight in spatial variation in cycling demand, they do not focus on temporal variation. Temporal variations consist of short-term (hourly/daily), seasonal and long-term variation. The patterns are thought to depend largely on differences in weather conditions and differ between utilitarian and recreational cyclists. Compared to car traffic, for bicycle flows this variation is relatively large (Emmerson et al. 1998). This may even cause differences on the level of yearly average flows (Jaarsma and Wijnstra 1995), especially for recreational areas (Beunen et al. 2004). As a consequence, developments on specific cycle paths are not directly interpretable from measured flows. Instead, these flows need to be corrected for weather conditions. Weather is therefore an important factor when monitoring cycling demand over time and investigating developments in actual use of infrastructure. This paper aims to further explore the relationship between weather and bicycle flows, by deploying regression and residual analyses on data over a relatively long time-period (4–11 years). This study is also meant as a contribution to the development of a generic demand model that can account for a large part of the day-to-day bicycle flow variation. Such a model can ultimately be very useful to provide corrections for studies focusing on demand developments over a longer period of time, for example for evaluating policy measures to increase cycling demand. It may also be used as part of a benchmarking tool, when comparing cycling demand in different regions with different weather conditions. Corrected bicycle flows are also worthwhile when constructing a transport model calibration set. Another application is to clarify developments in traffic victims among cyclists, by relating (daily) weather conditions to differences in exposure (Bijleveld and Churchill 2009). This paper is structured as follows. In Data we describe the data that are used. Method describes the methodology. In Development of the regression function, the functional form of the non-linear regression is determined, and in The influence of weather on bicycle flow, the results of the regression analysis are analyzed. Analysis of the remaining variation describes the remaining variation with respect to the regression. In Evaluation of trends over the years as an application, we applied the regression model to evaluate long term time-series of bicycle flows. Conclusions and further research is the discussion section, ending with conclusions.",81

Due to the error an important part of sentence was incorrectly published. The sentence, part of the Introduction paragraph should have read the following; The interrelationship between virtual (online) activities and real-world activities is an area of growing interest in recent years. The net effect of internet use on mobility patterns is however ambiguous (Mokhtarian 1990); both negative (substitution) and positive linkages (complementarity) are plausible. Despite the ambiguity regarding the relative magnitude of these countervailing effects, it is frequently suggested that increased online-connectivity has led people to travel less, particularly by car, and perhaps even to feel less need to acquire a driving licence (Alcindor 2012; Buccholz and Buccholz 2012; Kay et al. 2014; Maynard 2014).

In the first category, respondents are asked to provide details of their trips based on memory. The second category is the most recent approach, where travel data is automatically recorded by devices either placed at fixed locations or carried by the respondents themselves (Hato 2010). In recent times, researchers have been focussing on the second approach to determine travel patterns, primarily due to its significant benefits compared to conventional travel diaries and questionnaires. Such traditional methods are usually expensive, time consuming and require considerable effort on the part of the respondents. Moreover, the start and end times of the trips reported are usually approximate, while small trips are often left unreported. An additional factor is that people’s perceptions of in-vehicle time vary according to different modes of travel. For example, a person travelling by car will underestimate the travel time, whereas the same person travelling via public transport will overestimate it (Ettema et al. 1996; Stopher 1992). This decreases the accuracy of the data collected and, in turn, affects subsequent transportation planning and design. For the purpose of automatic travel data collection, researchers now employ sensors such as global positioning systems (GPS) and accelerometers, among others. A GPS can locate the position of a device anywhere in the world with varying accuracy, depending on factors such as the number of satellites in view. An accelerometer, on the other hand, measures the acceleration of a device in three directions with respect to gravitational force. This means that when the device is placed on a flat surface, an acceleration of 1 g is detected in a downward direction, whereas zero acceleration is recorded in the other two directions. Modern smartphones are now equipped with both of the above sensors, so any methodology developed using either or both sensors can be very easily applied via smartphones. The rapid global increase in smartphone usage, especially in developed countries, offers a perfect opportunity to utilise them to collect travel data. A major concern for researchers is to accurately detect the mode of transportation used by a person carrying a device (either a smartphone or a purpose-built device with the necessary embedded sensors). Mode determination will not just prove beneficial for the transportation sector, but will also pave the way for a new and effective means of advertising. For example, if a user’s location and mode of transportation are known in real time, a message can be sent to his or her mobile phone advertising the nearest facilities available in connection with the mode detected. In addition, products relating to a particular mode used can be advertised directly to the user. In this way, the data accumulated can be used to implement a targeted customer-oriented advertising programme. For the purpose of mode detection, the analyst can currently avail of different types of classification algorithms. Some of these are listed in Table 1, along with their advantages and disadvantages and the methodologies associated with each. A number of researchers have compared the various algorithms in comparative studies, some of which are summarised in Table 2. The four classifiers used in this study, namely, AdaBoost, SVM, decision tree and random forests, were selected based on the results derived from existing comparative studies. Those algorithms have exhibited good performance in numerous studies, and their respective advantages and disadvantages can be seen in Table 1. The current study compares the algorithms with a view to ascertaining the one most appropriate for transportation mode detection.",79

Seminal studies in the transportation literature have documented theoretical frameworks and empirical evidence of how personal social networks influence travel choices (Carrasco and Miller 2006, Carrasco et al. 2008; van den Berg et al. (2009, 2010, 2013)  ; Axhausen 2008). These studies addressed social networks and travel choices at a given time or age of an individual. However, social networks evolve (Snijders et al. 2010; Sharmeen et al. 2010) over time and life stages. Although the research frontier in activity-based modelling is shifting from cross-sectional models to short and long term dynamic models, research on social networks and travel has predominantly been concerned with analyses of static ego-centric social networks. Whereas, evidently, social networks and activity-travel patterns co-evolve (Sharmeen et al. 2014a). Ignoring such interdependency may lead to biases in prediction and erroneous design and output of models for policy evaluation. Thus, a challenge in travel behaviour research is to model the dynamics of social networks. Attempts to formulate dynamic models of social networks can build on previous work on simulating social networks for population-wide predictions using the concept of tie formation (Arentze and Timmermans 2008; Arentze et al. 2012; Kowald et al. 2012; Arentze et al. 2013) and rational behavioural assumptions and network statistics (Hackney and Axhausen 2006; Hackney 2009; Hackney and Marchal 2011; Illenberger et al. 2009; Illenberger et al. 2012). Methods developed in these research can be used to predict tie formation. However, social ties may disappear over time, and the attributes of existing ties may also change over time. Hence, any model of the dynamics of social networks should take these different processes into account. This paper suggest such a dynamic model. The aim of this study, in an attempt to contribute to the analysis and modelling of travel behaviour from a long-term perspective, is to formulate a model of the dynamics of social ties (i.e. tie retention or dissolution), in which lifecycle events are considered as triggers of change. More specifically, the study is based on the utility-based tie formation model developed in Arentze et al. (2012, 2013). The model is extended to incorporate the influence of lifecycle events on social ties. The model draws from social network theories, the life course approach and takes geographical distance into account. The proposed model predicts the formation of and changes in social ties among individuals in the population. The empirical analysis demonstrates how the parameters can be estimated using a two-step likelihood estimation approach. We could not take the role of transitivity and reciprocity of decisions into account, owning to data limitation. However the model can be easily extended to incorporate those. In the following sections, we will discuss the relevant theory and literature, methodology and approach, data and descriptive statistics, and the results of model estimation. We conclude the study by summarizing the major conclusions and delineating avenues of future research.",16

However, in many remote farming villages in these countries, basic resource-conserving and economic practices, such as the application of organic fertilizers, are unknown, and locally common uninformed and wasteful agricultural practices are leading to insufficient productivity and local environment degradation (Yila and Thapa 2008; Pretty et al. 2010; Beddington et al. 2012; Matouš et al. 2013b; Kassam et al. 2009). The effectiveness of formal institutions in disseminating necessary agricultural information across vast underdeveloped rural regions has been questioned (Matouš et al. 2013b; Douthwaite et al. 2001; Leeuwis 2004; Warner 2007; Spielman et al. 2009; Gebremedhin and Swinton 2003), and informal social networks and social contact have been recognized as important channels for information-sharing about resource-conserving practices (Rogers 2003; Solano et al. 2003; Schneider et al. 2009; Ostrom 1990; Folke 2006; Janssen et al. 2006; Pretty and Smith 2004; Bodin and Crona 2009; Bodin and Prell 2011; Leeuwis 2004; Hoang et al. 2006; Isaac 2012; Isaac et al. 2007; Warner 2007; Spielman et al. 2011; Conley and Udry 2010; Bartholomay et al. 2011). However, communication connections among the inhabitants of areas with less developed infrastructures tend to be geographically constrained, and the potential for the diffusion of beneficial practices between communities is thus limited (Matous et al. 2013a; Apicella et al. 2012; Urry 2004b). The international development literature is highly optimistic about the role of information-communication technologies (ICTs), specifically mobile phones, in increasing farmers’ access to valuable information (Donner 2008; Juma 2010; Matous et al. 2014). Several evaluation studies have reported on the impacts of mobile phones on access to agricultural information (Arunachalam 2002; Bhavnani et al. 2008; Overå 2006). Mobile phones are expected to enable inhabitants of less-developed areas to expand their networks and to reach beyond the locus of their everyday face-to-face interactions to access information about production techniques and markets (Donner 2008; Ilahiane and Sherry 2012). In contrast, little research is available on the role of motorized transport in access to information. Although the importance of effective transport for the economic development of rural areas is widely accepted (Starkey et al. 2002; Cook 2005; Plessis-Fraissard 2007; Porter 2002), the negative environmental impacts of motorized travel are well documented (Santos et al. 2010; Adams 1999), and the relationship between transport and social interactions has recently started to gain attention (Dugundji et al. 2008, 2011; Farber and Paez 2011; Axhausen 2008), the role of motorized transport in access to information and the creation and maintenance of knowledge-sharing ties in less-developed regions is not yet understood. This paper uses originally collected quantitative and qualitative data from Indonesia to examine the roles of motorized transport and mobile ICTs in social contact and agricultural information diffusion within and between local communities in rural areas of developing countries. Specifically, the study uses quantitative survey data to examine the following relationships at the personal and interpersonal levels. At the personal level, we examine how mobile phone ownership and motorbike ownership are related to the spatial extent of individuals’ access to information through their networks. At the relationship level, we examine how the physical distance between the interlocutors and the characteristics of their relationships are related to their preferred main mode of contact and information exchange. Finally, combining these two perspectives, we examine how the overall personal inclination toward contact through motorized transport is related to access to information inside and outside one’s own community. After the quantitative assessment, we use qualitative data from semi-structured interviews with the local inhabitants regarding their perceived reasons for choosing a particular contact mode and devise feasible policy implications.",11

Change in employment status constitutes a good example of such lifecycle events. Being employed means that work commitments more or less fix the location, activity type, duration, and start and end times of a considerable part of the day, which in turn may strongly influence the use of mobility resources. A transition to unemployment status implies that the released work time can be allocated to other activities, while in addition the flexibility in scheduling other activities increases. Vice versa, the transition from being unemployed to being employed reduces the flexibility in organizing activities in space and time and likely increases time pressure. Insight into this dynamic relationship between change in employment status and changes in activity-travel patterns is of paramount importance to transportation planning. Shifts in the timing and amount of travel may substantially impact the use of transportation infrastructure and therefore congestion, emission and other related indicators of accessibility and quality of life. The relevance of the topic has been increased in recent years due to the economic crisis in many parts of the world. Using the Netherlands as an example, the discussion to further invest in highways and other transportation infrastructure or to invest in a better use of existing infrastructure has dominated transportation policy for many years. Since the recent economic crisis, however, there has been evidence of a reduction in traffic intensity on some main corridors. Moreover, it is well known that a small reduction in traffic volume tends to have magnified effects on congestion levels. Combined with the necessity of governments to reduce their spending, this recent trend has fuelled the discussion whether plans and programs to invest in new highways and upscaling of existing ones should at least be postponed. While this shift in discussion is not void of opportunism, it nevertheless highlights the underlying questions about the nature and strength of the relationship between changes in employment status and shifts in activity-travel behavior. Although the direct effects of change in employment status on travel behavior are immediately clear, secondary and higher order effect are not, and as we know, ultimately these higher order effects determine the consequences of changes in employment status on the urban and transportation system. Surprisingly, an examination of the transportation literature shows that little is known about shifts in activity-travel patterns that are triggered by changes in employment status. One reason may be the lack of panel data. Some studies have included employment status as an explanatory variable in cross-sectional analysis. For example, Lau (2006) found in a study in Hong Kong that non-employed respondents exhibited different behavior in coping with limited accessibility. In addition to the tendency of having fewer children and not living with their elderly parents, more frequent walking to non-work activities and living in urban areas were commonly used strategies. In a study on lifestyle classification, Lin et al. (2009) identified a segment, which they called home-centered persons. Respondents belonging to this segment have a lifestyle that involves relatively few activities and travel outside. As this segment has the second highest unemployment rate, it suggests that unemployed people are less mobile. Unfortunately, their study cannot rule out other explanations as they also found that this segment has the largest share of students. Moreover, they found the highest unemployment rate is strongly correlated with another lifestyle segment, characterized by active participation in many discretionary activities. Thus, limitations in their analysis, especially the lack of any interactions between socio-demographics variables, prevent drawing any strong conclusions regarding the relationship between employment status and activity-travel behavior. To examine this topic, we analyzed the Puget Sound Panel Survey. The use of a panel seems warranted because it allows an examination of aspects of activity-travel behavior before and after transitions in employed status. Although the findings pertain to this specific region in the USA, the findings may have wider validity beyond the Puget Sound area since they impinge on broader discussions of the effects of non-employment on travel behavior and the most appropriate policies to reduce congestion and improve accessibility. More specifically, we analyzed changes in time allocation for different transitions in employment status, controlling for a set of socio-economic variables, using econometric models. A random parameters panel effects regression model of changes in time allocation for different activities was estimated as a function of these variables. The paper reports the results for shopping duration. Before presenting the results of this analysis, we first discuss the conceptual considerations underlying the analysis. Next, we discuss the data that were used for the analysis, focusing on sample characteristics and some features of the data that led to specific operational decisions in model estimations. The paper is completed with a discussion of the implications of the estimation results.",7

Recent studies in this area have focused on understanding the dynamic nature of household car ownership and there is also interest in the relationship between major life events (like moving home or changing jobs) and travel behaviour changes of various types. The hypothesis is that people are more likely to reconsider their transport resources and travel routines at the time of major life events. This paper presents an empirical analysis of panel data from the new UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) which examines the role of life events and spatial context in changes to household car ownership. An earlier analysis of this data set confirmed that life events are associated with higher likelihoods of general increases and decreases in car ownership level (Clark et al. 2014), as reported elsewhere (e.g. Oakil et al. 2014). The contribution of this paper is to identify the determinants of different types of car ownership level change (zero to one car, one to two cars, two to one car and one to zero car). It is argued that a different combination of factors is likely to influence each of these level changes. The paper begins with a review of studies of the dynamics of household car ownership. A research framework is then justified in relation to the literature. The analytical approach to examining household car ownership level changes using data from the first two waves of the UKHLS is then introduced, followed by an interpretation of the results of logistic regression models estimated for each car ownership level change type. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the results for research and policy.",98

Considerable efforts in current spatial and transport planning are devoted to designing future cities that enable mobility while reducing car dependency and increasing the share of energy-efficient transport modes. Predicting the impacts of competing policies is not an easy task due to the overwhelming data dependency and multitude of concurrent changes (Wegener 2004). Spatial development determines the need for spatial interaction, and thus transport, which in turn has impacts on land use patterns. They together shape individuals’ activity-travel behavior. In that sense, the models used to support travel demand management need to integrate them to capture the underlying effects (Waddell 2011). This notion has been widely accepted in contemporary activity-based travel demand models. Activity-based models acknowledge the fact that the travel needs of a population are determined by their need to participate in activities spread out in time and space (Chapin 1971; Bhat and Koppelman 1999; McNally 2000). The explicit modeling of activities and the consequent trip chaining allows a thorough analysis of individuals’ response to land-use and transport policies. The responses can be viewed as a series of location and travel choices concerning how to implement activity programs. Thus, effects of the policies emerge from the activity-travel scheduling process, which should take into account travel and location preferences from the demand side and locations of facilities/services and transport from the supply side (Shiftan and Ben-Akiva 2011). A variety of policy-sensitive systems have been developed along this line of logic, which include platforms principally based on (1) computational process models, such as TASHA (Miller and Roorda 2003), ALBATROSS (Arentze and Timmermans, 2004a) and ADAPTS (Auld and Mohammadian, 2009); (2) utility-maximization, such as DAS (Bowman and Ben-Akiva 2001), CEMDAP (Bhat et al. 2004) and FAMOS (Pendyala et al. 2005); and (3) constraints-based approaches, such as CARLA(Jones et al. 1983) and several GIS-based systems (Miller 1999), etc. Although these activity-based models represent an important step forward compared to the classical aggregate trip-based approaches, few of these systems can capture multi-modal trip chaining in the context of full activity-travel patterns. The use of private vehicles (PV) such as car and bike is often separated from the use of public transport (PT) as parking choice is not explicitly modeled. This model limitation causes insensitivity to parking and transit-related policies, e.g. park and ride (P+R), as well as policies to synchronize transport networks. These policies are attracting increasing attention and are regarded as feasible instruments to improve the capacity of the existing transport system. In addition, most of them adopt a hierarchical structure, where decisions are made in sequence from activity pattern via tours to trips, to derive the activity-travel schedule of an individual. In hierarchical approaches, capturing the impact of lower-level choice facets (e.g., route choice) on the higher-level ones (e.g., activity location choice) generally requires a reduction of the level of detail in the lower-level choice facets. Consequently, reduction of information may be the result in predicting the effects of land use policies on combined activity location and travel choice. Overall, a mechanism that can simultaneously model the choice of mode, route, parking and activity location at a sufficient level of detail is lacking in these approaches. The multi-state supernetwork approach (Arentze and Timmermans 2004b) is a promising way to model the high dimensionality of choice behavior. This approach was extended and further developed by Liao et al. (2010, 2011, 2012, 2013a, b). Networks of passenger transport (both PV and PT) and locations of facilities/services together with activity programs of individuals are integrated into the structure of multi-state supernetworks. Different choice facets mentioned above are modeled as a unified “path choice” (Nagurney and Dong 2002) through the supernetworks, and the optimal (least generalized cost) path can be used to predict how individuals make choices to implement their activity programs. Thus, this approach can be applied to predict changes in travel choice made due to adaptations to the land-use and transport system. Since the choice facets in a supernetwork are fully represented, the approach is highly policy-sensitive. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how the multi-state supernetwork approach can be applied to analyse the likely effects of a set of integrated land-use transport scenarios on individuals’ travel patterns. The approach is applied for the city of Rotterdam (The Netherlands), where several policy scenarios are considered by the municipality concerning transit improvement (including P+R), parking price, and land-use redevelopment. To that end, a synthetic population of a broader area, i.e. Den Haag-Rotterdam–Dordrecht corridor, together with activity programs, are extracted from Dutch national travel-diary surveys. Individuals’ travel preferences regarding multi-modal trips and activity locations are based on estimation results from stated and revealed data. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In “Multi-state supernetwork” section, we discuss the basic concepts of the multi-state supernetwork approach and how it is tailored to analyse policy scenarios on individuals’ travel patterns and accessibility (welfare). Next, we describe the study area and scenarios. Then, the application results are discussed in “Application” section. Finally, the paper is completed with conclusions and future research.",25

For the Netherlands the share of the population aged 65 or above is expected to rise from 16 % in 2010 to between 23 and 29 % in 2040 (Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency 2013). Besides well-documented social and economic implications (e.g. Harper 2014), ageing also has significant consequences for the transport sector. Although elderly have still been found to travel less often and less far than younger age groups (e.g. Collia et al. 2003), they have become increasingly mobile over the last decades, because of increased income levels, better health, and more active lifestyles (e.g. Marrattoli et al. 2000)—a trend which is likely to proceed (e.g. Arentze et al. 2008). Moreover, the elderly rely, less than before, on public transport and more on the car (e.g. Noble 2000; Rosenbloom 2001; Alsnih and Hensher 2003; Donaghy et al. 2004). As a consequence, some scholars find that the elderly constitute the fastest growing segment of the driving population, both in terms of license rates and kilometres travelled (e.g. Okola and Walton 2003; Banister and Bowling 2004). While studies emphasise the importance of the elderly’s mobility for their social inclusion (e.g. Ravulaparthy et al. 2013) and quality of life (e.g. Delbosc and Currie 2011; Haustein and Siren 2014), concerns are being raised regarding the implications of this induced automobility to society, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, environmental pollution and congestion (e.g. Rosenbloom 2001; Banister and Bowling 2004). In the Netherlands, Jorritsma and Kalter (2008) have found that an increase in elderly out-of-home activities has led to a 3 % growth in overall distances travelled. In addition, increased car dependency amongst the elderly may have negative health impacts resulting from a lack of physical activeness (e.g. Oxley and Whelan 2008; Kemperman and Timmermans 2014), which, especially at older age, is vital to physical (e.g. Visser et al. 2002) and mental health (e.g. Binder et al. 2002; Strawbridge et al. 2002). This societal relevance of elderly mobility has led to a rapid recent expansion of scientific literature. Research conducted so far investigates the influence of socio-demographic factors(e.g. Kim and Ulfarsson 2004; Rosenbloom 2004; Li et al. 2012; Mercado and Páez 2009; Schmöcker et al. 2008; Hjorthol et al. 2010; Kim 2011, Yang et al. 2014a), spatial environments (e.g. Schwanen et al. 2001; Waldorf 2003; Banister and Bowling 2004; Michael et al. 2006; Hess 2009; Borst et al. 2009; Gómez et al. 2010; Hall and McAuley 2010; Kemperman and Timmermans 2014), and policies (e.g. Mercado et al. 2010) on elderly activity patterns, trip frequencies, transport mode choices, and physical activeness. Although all of these studies provide essential contributions to the field, several shortcomings can be identified. First, while most studies focus on just one type of elderly travel behaviour (e.g. only trip making or mode choice), only few look at the effects on multiple behavioural aspects simultaneously (e.g. Schwanen et al. 2001; Collia et al. 2003; Arentze et al. 2008). Second, while many existing studies look at elderly populations exclusively, fewer studies conduct comparisons to younger age cohorts (e.g. Schwanen et al. 2001; Rosenbloom 2004; Páez et al. 2007; Mercado and Páez 2009; Hjorthol et al. 2010). Third, with regard to the effects of spatial environments, previous research is often limited to the effects of address density or the availability of different infrastructures, whereas other components of the built and natural environment, such as land use patterns and building diversities, are often not considered (for an exception see Kemperman and Timmermans 2014). Moreover, in contrast to static spatial attributes, elderly mobility studies scarcely address dynamic natural environmental conditions including daylight, seasonality and weather (exceptions are Hjorthol 2013; Yang et al. 2014a). This is surprising given that elderly are considered as more sensitive or vulnerable to weather than younger age groups (e.g. Díaz et al. 2002; Tuomaala et al. 2013; Böcker et al. 2014). In order to address these shortcomings, this research aims to provide an integrated analysis of the effects of socio-demographics, health attributes, trip characteristics, spatial environments, and normal and extreme weather on elderly as compared to non-elderly trip making and transport mode choices. Daily trip frequencies and transport mode choices of the elderly are analysed in zero-inflated negative binomial and multinomial logistic regression models, and are contrasted with the non-elderly subpopulation to explore (dis)similarities. This study draws on Greater Rotterdam (The Netherlands) stated adaptation data and travel diary data linked to spatial and weather attributes. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. “Literature review” section reviews the literature concerning transport-related factors. Next, the research design is introduced in “Research design” section. “Results and discussion” section presents major results while “Conclusion” section highlights key conclusions and discusses possible implications.",112

Regret relates to an affective state of mind that individuals may experience or anticipate once they realize that one or more of the non-chosen choice alternatives outperform the chosen alternative on one or more attributes of interest. Regret-based models assume that individuals minimize regret rather than maximize utility when choosing among choice alternatives. The principle of regret minimization may signal bounded rationality in the sense that emotions are assumed to play a role in the decision-making process and that individuals tend to avoid extremes in their decision processes (Rasouli and Timmermans 2015b). Chorus et al. (2008a) introduced regret-based models into transportation research. They provided an econometric framework extending seminal work (Bell 1982; Loomes and Sugden 1982, 1983, 1987; Quiggin 1994), from binary to multinomial and from single to multi-attribute choices. Originally, they defined regret as a linear function of negative attribute differences between the considered alternative and the best non-chosen alternative. Later, Chorus (2010) suggested replacing this discontinuous function with a continuous logarithmic approximation, primarily for technical reasons. Very recently, Chorus (2014c) introduced the generalized regret model, but we do not include it in the present study because it deviates too much from the pure notion of regret. This fundamental work has led to an upsurge of applications of regret-based models, and extensions of the model under both certain conditions (Chorus et al. 2008a, b; Chorus and de Jong 2011; Chorus 2012b; Kaplan and Prato 2012; Beck et al. 2013; Chorus et al. 2013; Chorus 2014a; Hensher et al. 2013; Boeri and Masiero 2014, Prato 2014), and uncertain conditions (Chorus et al. 2008a; De Moraes Ramos et al. 2011; Chorus 2014b). Regret-based models seem to be more important when respondents are less familiar with the choice situation (probably because they have less defined preferences) (Boeri et al. 2014). Applications cannot ony be found in transportation research area but also in environmental studies (Thiene et al. 2012) and health economics (de Bekker-Grob and Chorus 2013). All these regret-based models have in common that regret is a function of attributes differences of the choice alternatives. That is, the physical measurements of attributes are used in the regret function to measure the amount of regret, assuming that regret is based on these differences. In reality, however, regret may be based on the perception of physical attribute differences. Psycho-physical research, although focusing on different kind of stimuli such as noise, has provided a substantial amount of evidence that the relationship between physical attribute values and perceived attribute values is non-linear. If these findings would equally apply to travel-related attributes, current regret-based models would wrongly represent the mental representation of physical attributes levels that are subsequently used to arrive at a choice. All current regret-based choice models implicitly or explicitly ignore the perception of attributes. Compared to utility-based models of transport-related decisions, ignoring perception may have more dramatic repercussions, because regret-based models are based on attribute differences. It is assumed that the same absolute attribute difference is perceived independently of the overall attribute range and the absolute value of attribute itself. Thus, incorporating an improved representation of the perception of attributes into regret-based models may enhance their predictive success. In this paper, we therefore propose and empirically test such an elaboration of the basic model specifications. In order to investigate this issue, the current paper sets out to formulate elaborations of the basic random regret minimization models and incorporates a non-linear representation of the perception of attributes. Inspired by research on psycho-physical measurement, it is assumed that the perception of stimuli (attributes) is proportional to their absolute values. To allow for slight deviations from this representation, a more general non-linear representation is also formulated and tested. Two data sets (one on stated choice, the other on revealed choices) are used to estimate and assess the proposed models. These newly formulated regret models will be compared against each other and against the original random regret minimization models. In addition to comparing their predictive performance, K-fold validation tests will be conducted. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We will first summarize current regret-based models as they have been formulated in transportation research. Next, we will outline the new regret models that incorporate the non-linear psycho-physical relationships. Then, we will discuss the estimation and validation results for two case studies, respectively pertaining to choice of shopping center and transportation mode choice. The paper is completed with a discussion of the results and avenues of future research.",20

The widespread application of CBA explains the voluminous literature examining the method. The literature scrutinizes substantive improvements of the CBA (e.g. Mackie and Preston 1998; Mouter et al. 2013a), amongst other things. Moreover, various studies showed that no correlation exists between political decisions and CBA results (e.g. Eliasson and Lundberg 2012; Eliasson et al. 2015). There is relatively little empirical research scrutinizing the way politicians—the end users of CBA—use the information provided by CBAs when evaluating the desirability of a transport project. Notable exceptions are Nyborg (1998) who analyzed how 16 Norwegian Members of Parliament (MPs) use CBA and Sager and Ravlum (2005) who interviewed Norwegian MPs in three consecutive parliamentary processes in 1995, 1997 and 2001. Nyborg (1998) concludes that most politicians found the CBA useful as a screening device to pick projects requiring closer political attention, but few seemed to actually use it to rank projects. Moreover, Nyborg establishes that politicians use CBA in an opportunistic way (only when the study supports their conclusions). Sager and Ravlum (2005) conclude that there are strong indications that Norwegian politicians make decisions first and only look at the CBA results afterwards. However, Sager and Ravlum (2005) argue that the institutionalization of CBA has symbolic value for politicians, since the search for and processing of information may itself send out signals that will enhance the status of the political body. Disclosing this information symbolizes the ability and legitimacy of decision makers and the political enterprise will gain more respect from the public when politicians pretend to make decisions in a proper way by exhibiting expertise and using generally accepted information. Since the data analyzed by Nyborg (1998) and Sager and Ravlum (2005) were gathered 15 to 20 years ago in one single country (Norway), it is worth examining how politicians use CBA in further research. This study analyzes how politicians use CBA in another context, this being the Netherlands, by interviewing 28 politicians and 10 top-level civil servants. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: “Literature on the use of research in policy making” section provides a brief discussion of literature about knowledge utilization; “Methodology” section outlines the methodology; “Position of cost-benefit analysis in the Dutch planning process” section provides a brief description of CBA’s position in the Dutch planning process for infrastructure projects; “Politicians’ use of CBA when forming their opinion” section presents how politicians use CBA when forming their opinion; “Barriers hampering politicians’ use of CBA when forming their judgments” section discusses barriers hampering the use of CBA by politicians when forming their judgment; “Use of CBA as political ammunition” outlines how politicians use CBA as political ammunition; “Symbolic use of CBA” section discusses the symbolic use of CBA by politicians. “Solutions for enhancing the use of CBA when forming an opinion” section presents and discusses the solutions suggested by politicians to enhance their use of CBA when forming their opinion; “Discussion” section provides a discussion.",30

Following Geurs and Van Wee (2004) and limiting ourselves to passenger transport, we define accessibility as ‘the extent to which land-use and transport systems enable individuals to reach activities or destinations by a (combination of) transport mode(s)’. We use the term ‘measures’ for the general expression of accessibility, and the term ‘indicator’ for a specific operationalization of a measure. Geurs and van Wee (2004) gave an overview of families of measures, one category being infrastructure-based measures described as ‘analyzing the (observed or simulated) performance or service level of transport infrastructure, such as level of congestion and average travel speed on the road network. This measure type is typically used in transport planning’. Recently, there has been rapidly growing awareness that the generalized travel costs (GTC) should not only include travel time, monetary costs, and trouble/comfort, but also the predictability/variability of travel times. Related terms include robustness, reliability, vulnerability, flexibility, and resilience, etc. We firstly provide a few definitions. Reggiani et al. (2015) stated that ‘resilience analysis refers to the speed at which—and the pathway along which—a network returns to its equilibrium after a shock, as well as to the perturbations/shocks that can be absorbed’, and that ‘vulnerability analysis refers to the susceptibility to extreme strains on a dynamic system’. Cats and Jenelius (2015) provided a definition of the robustness of a public transport system which can easily be generalized to the transport system: it is ‘the ability to withstand or quickly recover from disturbances such as infrastructural and vehicular malfunctions and planned maintenance closures without significant reduction in the performance of the system (in terms of travel times etc.)’. We next give a brief overview of the literature in this area. Bates et al. (2001) discussed the theoretical and empirical literature of the valuation of travel reliability. Lam and Small (2001) developed models based on empirical results concluding that the value of reliability is $15.12 per hour for men and $31.91 for women. Rietveld et al. (2001) concluded that users of public transport (PT) have a strong attitude of risk aversion towards travel time. Chen et al. (2002) proposed a method to assess the capacity reliability of road networks. Mazloumi et al. (2010) estimated day-to-day variability in bus travel times using GPS data. Börjesson and Elisasson (2011) studied how long-distance train passengers value unexpected delays, and concluded that the disutility increases more slowly than linearly in the delay risk. Koopmans et al. (2013) proposed an indicator that also includes the reliability of travel times. In the editorial of a special issue in Transportation Research part A on “resilience of networks”, Caschili et al. (2015) provided definitions and explain how some of these concepts are related. These concepts have also been included in some policy documents. For example, the Dutch government aims to increase the reliability of travel times on roads, waterways, and railways (Ministerie van Infrastructuur en Milieu 2012). The variability of travel times is linked to the more general concept of the robustness of the transport system, which is the opposite to the vulnerability of it. This study proposes an indicator of the robustness of the transport system associated with the number of options that a traveler has to travel either between given origins and destinations, or to carry out given activities. The motivation for this proposal is that the more options travelers have, the less vulnerable they are to disturbances in the transport system, such as delays due to road accidents, or substantial train delays. We find that this is not the only possible indicator for robustness, just as that any accessibility indicator proposed in the literature is not the only one in the same family of accessibility indicators. And we realize others might prefer another term than ‘robustness’—the debate on terminology is not closed yet. Note that travel options between activity locations so that people can fulfill activity programs are the core of time geography measures (e.g. Neutens et al. 2007), and that the identification of alternative routes is common in route choice and path choice modeling (e.g., Bekhor et al. 2006; Bovy and Fiorenzo-Catalano 2007)—these elements in themselves are thus not new. What is new in our proposal is to present travel options as a robustness indicator. Conceptually, the availability of more travel options matters for two major reasons. Firstly, individuals value the reduced travel time variability that results from having more options. If, for example, there is a road block somewhere in the road network and an alternative route is available with hardly a detour nor capacity limitations, the road block will not affect the travelers. The availability of multiple options and the impact of the road block on travel times/GTC might occur both preceding the trip (e.g. being aware of problems in part of the rail network whereas alternatives are available) and during the trip (e.g. dynamic satellite navigation can suggest an alternative route because of unexpected congestion on the standard route). Secondly, individuals in general value having multiple travel options, regardless of their actual use—they may value the potential of having these options, as recognized in the concept of the option value (Geurs et al. 2006; Laird et al. 2009). However, despite the increasing attention paid to topics like robustness, vulnerability, and travel time variability in the academic literature, to the best of our knowledge no dedicated family of accessibility measures for the robustness of the transport system exists, although there are some examples of indicators that include reliability (e.g., Koopmans et al. 2013). Koopmans’ indicator is a GTC indicator including reliability to some extent, but it is not an indicator explicitly addressing the concept of the availability of multiple travel options. The popular contour measure (number of destinations accessible within a threshold value, generally expressed in distance, time or GTC) or potential accessibility measures (number of destinations accessible, whereby the relevance decreases with the increase of distance, costs, or GTC) can be seen as measures for the provision of alternative destinations. One could argue that a higher level of the potential accessibility indicator expresses more options to travel for specific trips. This holds for trips that in a short term (e.g. daily or hourly basis) have flexibility regarding destination choice, such as daily shopping, but not for trips with fixed locations, such as most work-related trips. It might seem that the logsum accessibility measures (e.g. De Jong et al. 2007) value travel options, but it is important to realize that the inclusion of multiple options only results from uncertainty on the side of the modelers (Chorus and De Jong 2011), and is not meant to measure the options offered by the transport system. It is also important to realize that the logsum measures only express the value of the options and is therefore not necessarily an indicator which directly expresses accessibility. Similarly, D’Lima and Medda (2015: 35) proposed a new measure for resilience, following Pimm (1991) defined as “how fast a variable that has been displaced from equilibrium returns to it”. Janic (2015) proposes a methodology for the “ability of the network to neutralize the impacts of disruptive event(s)”. Although related to our work, their measures/approaches do not focus on the number of opportunities available for travelers. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose a family of measures for the robustness of the transport system. More specifically, the measures express the number of travel opportunities (either weighted by a cost function or not) available for the travelers. We mainly use examples in the area of passenger transport, but the measures could be used in a comparable way for freight transport. We limit ourselves to physical accessibility, largely ignoring Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)-based accessibility (Van Wee et al. 2013). The proposed accessibility measures not only fill a gap in the literature, but are also relevant for policy-making. Policymakers might be interested in the number of travel options people and companies have, because it tells them how vulnerable the transport system is for disruptions. In many countries, large disruptions receive a lot of negative media attention, which is an indication for the societal relevance of the topic. By making the transport system more robust (via increasing the number of travel options) policy makers can increase welfare because travel time losses due to disruptions are valued negatively (see above), even more than expected travel time losses due to recurrent congestion. Including the robustness in ex ante evaluations of infrastructure options and next decision-making could, for example, lead to deciding to prioritize parallel road infrastructure options over improving the capacity of one single motorway. So we argue policy makers can benefit from our indicators and the applications are manifold, including: Comparisons between geographical areas of the robustness of the transport system. Such comparisons can reveal in which regions the transport system is relatively vulnerable. Comparisons of the robustness of an area over time. Such comparisons can reveal trends, e.g. due to changes in congestion levels or land-use patterns. Impact of policy measures on robustness. Of particular interest are infrastructure policies, non-infrastructure related transport policies (e.g. related to time tables of PT, road pricing), effects of changing opening hours of location services, and synchronization policies, etc. Synchronization increasingly receives attentions in the academic literature. The general idea is that synchronization between land use and the transport system results in benefits in several areas, such as increased travel comfort, reduced travel times, increased accessibility, and maybe also increased travel options. Van Wee et al. (2014) refer to examples of synchronization in the areas of PT networks (Guihaire and Hao 2008; Guo and Wilson 2011), land use and transport planning (Levine 2005; Bertolini et al. 2012), teleworking and travel (Mokhtarian 2002) and multitasking while travelling (Lyons and Urry 2005). The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. “The proposed family of measures” section proposes the family of measures and discusses important features of the measures based on the conceptualizations needed to operationalize the measures. “Operationalization of the measures” section proposes a methodology to operationalize the measures. “Illustration: a case study” section illustrates the operationalization in a case study in a multi-modal transport system. “Conclusions and future work” section finally presents the main conclusions and discusses avenues for further development of the measures, valuation of outcomes, and their use for policy.",22

This has, in Britain at least, been termed ‘Cost Damping’, and has entered demand analysis and appraisal guidance issued by the Department for Transport (DfT 2014). If such relationships exist in disaggregate data and in car trip matrices, we would expect to find them in other forms of behavioural response. The paradigm of utility maximisation, for example, applies in principle to all choices and travel behaviour. One source of evidence on behavioural response is rail ticket sales data. In Great Britain there exists a large and accurate record of the number of rail trips made between many pairs of stations and this has been extensively exploited to support a wide range of modelling opportunities. As a result there is extensive evidence on how rail demand is influenced by fares, journey time and economic activity, and to a lesser extent the impact of competition from other modes and other service quality factors (ATOC 2013). In this paper we examine whether there is evidence to confirm such cost damping effects in rail ticket sales data covering a very wide range of flows and many years. The existing results indicate that there is limited variation with distance in the elasticity of demand with respect to fare (‘fare elasticity’). Simply, we would expect that fare elasticity should become stronger (more strongly negative) with distance, because longer trips have generally higher fares, so that (in a linear model) a proportional increase on all fares has more impact at longer distances. So a finding of limited variation with distance gives evidence in support of the hypothesis of cost damping. That is, the response mechanism in the model is not linear but shows a decreasing proportional sensitivity to fares as fares increase. In this paper we present further analyses of this issue and compare this with the disaggregate evidence. The importance of these findings would be to show the consistency of behaviour across different modes and data types, so that consistent utility functions can be used. Practically, the findings indicate how fare elasticity varies with trip length, suggesting ways in which fares could be set to optimise revenue. For modelling, the results indicate that cost damping should be included in models of travel demand. Additionally, we take the opportunity here to conduct analogous analysis of time elasticities. In addition, conducting these two forms of analysis also provides evidence on how the value of time (VOT) varies with journey distance. VOT is an important parameter in transport planning and one about which there is also much evidence from the disaggregate literature, but little evidence derived from aggregate data. The analysis here is based upon tens of thousands of observations. The basic approach is to estimate fixed-effect pooled cross-section time-series models but instead of the standard approach of estimating constant elasticities with respect to fare and time we allow the fare and time elasticities to vary with journey length in ways suggested by disaggregate and conventional transport planning analyses. This is done by specifying continuous functions which allow an increasing, diminishing or no effect from journey length, measured by distance, cost or journey time, on the elasticities, as empirically justified. The following section of the paper discusses the formulation of the models to be used for analysis and how a near-equivalence can be obtained between the models of conventional transport demand analysis and those previously used for rail ticket sales data. Section 3 describes the data that is used and presents the results of analyses of this data using the various model forms proposed. Section 4 presents the summary results and gives a discussion and conclusions.",3

Seminal regret theory postulates that an individuals’ regret derived from a binary decision is not only based on the anticipated payoff or utility of the considered choice alternative (across different states of the world), but also on anticipated payoff of the other alternative. More specifically, individuals are assumed to consider the possibility that the non-chosen alternative turns out to have a higher payoff than the chosen one after all. Regret occurs when an individual experiences or realizes that a higher payoff would have been achieved if the foregone alternative had been chosen. Thus, individuals are assumed not only to consider the attractiveness of the chosen alternative but also to anticipate the regret of not choosing the foregone alternative. Regret-based models have been introduced in the travel behaviour community as an alternative approach to modelling travel decisions under conditions of uncertainty (Chorus et al. 2008a, b). The equivalent of random utility theory for decisions under conditions of uncertainty is expected utility theory, which assumes that individuals choose the choice alternative that will generate the highest expected pay-off, which is equal to the payoff of each decision outcome, multiplied by the probability of its occurrence. The violation of this property in many experiments in a variety of decision sciences has led to the formulation of alternative theories of risky choice and decision-making. (Cumulative) prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky 1979; Tversky and Kahneman 1974, 1981, 1992) received most attention. It assumes that individuals frame possible outcomes in terms of gains and losses, relative to some neutral reference point, evaluate outcomes according to some value function and transform objective probabilities into subjective probabilities according to a non-linear probability weighting function. To account for violations of classic expected utility theory, the utility function is assumed concave over gains and convex over losses. A recent overview of these studies on prospect theory is given in Li and Hensher (2011), while Rasouli and Timmermans (2014) provide a more extensive overview that also includes competing theories and modelling approaches. The majority of these studies concerned departure time and route choice decisions. For example, respondents in a study on route choice were asked to choose between two routes from work to home, which differed in terms of uncertain travel times, and estimated corresponding choice probabilities using cumulative prospect theory. They found evidence of violations of expected utility theory. In particular, they found evidence of the certainty effects and the inflation of small probabilities effect. Gao et al. (2010), comparing different approaches to model route choice behaviour, found that cumulative prospect theory outperformed expected utility theory, while Michea and Polak (2006) reached a similar conclusion in the context of the choice between two train services. Senbil and Kitamura (2004) found evidence in support of prospect theory in the context of departure time choice. Li et al. (2012) developed a non-linear model accounting for both risk attitude and preference in the context of variable travel time. Their results suggest that the non-linear model better predicts earlier departure times compared to the linear model. Although most available research has focused on departure time and route choice, transport mode choice under risky situations has also been studied (Li and Hensher 2012; Li et al. 2013). Regret-minimization theory constitutes an alternative to both expected utility and prospect theory. In the context of choice under conditions of certainty, regret-based models can be viewed as an alternative to IIA (independence of irrelevant alternative) models, such as the multinomial logit model, in the sense that choices are assumed to depend on choice set composition. Regret-based models allow incorporating substitution effects in an easy and elegant way. Seminal work on regret theory for binary choices can be found in Bell (1982); Fishburn (1982); and Loomes and Sugden (1982). Chorus et al. (Chorus et al. 2006) and Chorus, Arentze and Timmermans (2008a, b), introducing regret-based choice models to the travel behaviour community, expanded this seminal work in two important ways. First, the model of binary choice was generalized to the choice among multiple (risky) choice alternatives. Second, the case of a single attribute was generalized to the case of multiple attributes. The extension to multiple choice alternatives was based on Quiggin’s (1994) principle of Irrelevance of Statewise Dominated Alternatives, which states that a choice from any given choice set is not affected by adding or removing an alternative that is inferior for every state of the world. It implies that regret only depends on the best available choice alternative. The extension to multiple attributes was based on the contention that choice is based on a valuation of choice alternatives on an attribute-by-attribute basis. Let \(n \in N\) represent the set of choice alternatives. Then, the linear regret function for attribute k for choice alternative n can be expressed as: Total regret when choosing alternative n is then equal to Evidently, the linear regret function is a straightforward formulation, but it may not sufficiently capture the magnitude of regret and its relationship with attribute differences. Therefore, Chorus, Arentze and Timmermans (2008b) added a parameter to capture any non-linearities in regret. If regret is defined in terms of not only the attribute difference between alternative n and the best-foregone alternative, but against all available alternatives, Eq. 1 is generalized to: Regret across all attributes can then be expressed as: Defining regret as the utility difference against the best foregone choice alternative or as the sum of utility differences against all available alternatives has strong ramifications in terms of choice probabilities and the effects of introducing new alternatives to the choice set. As the focus of the current paper is empirical in nature, we leave these theoretical discussions for future publications. Regret theory assumes that individuals minimize regret. Thus, alternative n will be chosen if \(R_{n} < R_{{n^{'} }} \forall n^{'} \ne n \in C\). Assuming that regret represents a random variable and that its error terms are independently Gumbel distributed, the probability of choosing alternative n then equals 
A technical problem of this specification (which we will refer to as the original regret model specification) is that the max operators imply a non-smooth likelihood function, which may create problems in deriving marginal effects and elasticities. Therefore, (Chorus 2010—see also Hensher et al. 2013; Chorus and Bierlaire 2013) suggested an alternative logarithmic specification, which we will refer to as the new regret model specification in the remaining of this paper. It can be expressed as The number of studies using this specification is rapidly emerging in different disciplines (e.g., Beck et al. 2013; de Bekker-Grob and Chorus 2013; Chorus et al. 2013). Note that the new regret model specification differs from the original specification in two respects. Firstly, the discontinuous regret function is replaced with a continuous logarithmic function of attribute differences. The constant “1” is added to avoid that the logarithmic function is undefined. In principle, the choice of “1” is arbitrary, and could be replaced with any (small) number or a parameter. However, as we will discuss later, this specification has some implications. Secondly, regret is not based on the difference against the best alternative only but against all choice alternatives. These two different specifications of regret raise the question which model should ideally be applied. The new logarithmic regret model specification avoids some practical issues and is easy to estimate. However, this comes at the cost of being theoretically inferior to the original model specification. That is, the specification is theoretically no longer consistent with the concept of regret as the value of the regret function is positive even if the chosen alternative turns out to be better than the foregone choice alternative. That is, Eq. (6) does not approximate zero if attribute differences are small and/or the number of choice alternatives is large. Moreover, the new specification estimates regret to be higher than regret based on the original specification, due to the constant 1 in the formulation. This difference has a disproportionally high effect when attribute differences and/or β are small, and a negligible effect if these differences are high. The two specifications are approximately identical under major attribute differences only. The comparison against all alternatives rather than against the best foregone alternative is also debatable. On the one hand, it is reasonable to assume that if an individual could have chosen multiple alternatives that perform better that the chosen one, regret will be higher. On the other hand, considering multiple better choice alternatives will further reduce the choice probabilities of the concerned alternative, which may be counter-intuitive. At least, there may be some diminishing effect. Behaviourally, particularly in the context of departure time and route choice decisions, assessing regret against all choice alternatives is cognitively very demanding as the number of alternatives is daunting. Moreover, it is not immediately clear in this decision context how to deal with autoregressive and spatial autocorrelation effects that are due to overlapping routes. Including all better foregone routes may thus involve routes that individual travellers will never consider or be unaware of. In this study, therefore, we argue that the decision to define regret against the best foregone choice alternative or against all foregone choice alternatives is an empirical matter that deserves further investigation. Thus, for real-world applications, the empirical question is whether these theoretical shortcomings of the new logarithmic regret model specification are negligible. If they are, then, the new regret model specification is a good, easy to apply proxy of the theoretically sounder original model specification. If these effects are non-negligible, however, the original model specification should preferably be used. Moreover, the assumption of regret valuation on the singly best alternative or on all (foregone) choice alternatives should be empirically examined. The aim of the present study is to address these issues. A stated choice experiment is designed to investigate the effects of the signalled theoretical shortcomings of the new regret model specification and provide evidence whether respondents compare their choice against the best alternative or against all alternatives. Because the results of stated choice experiments are highly dependent on the specification of the attribute range, first we conduct a formal theoretical analysis to identify the parameter space and attribute level differences where the two model specifications differ most. The stated choice experiment was constructed on the basis of the outcomes of this formal analysis to optimize the comparison of the regret model specifications. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. First, we describe the results of the formal theoretical analysis. Based on the results of this analysis, we describe the design of the stated choice experiment. After discussing sample characteristics, we present the results of the model estimations. We complete the paper by drawing conclusions and discussing implications of our findings for the application of regret-based models in travel behaviour analysis.",26

Big national studies are carried out at somewhat regular intervals to obtain an estimate of how the population would value changes in travel time. The objective is therefore a measure of the value of travel time changes (VTTC). Since valuation is likely to vary across the population and with the trip context, the interest is not placed on obtaining a single VTTC but an index according to some variables that could explain travellers’ VTTC. Among these variables are individual characteristics (e.g. income) and trip characteristics (e.g. journey length). The recommended set of VTTC for appraisal has significant economic implications, and it crucially affects which projects are carried out in a country. Small (2012) and Daly et al. (2014) concur that our understanding of the VTTC and its variation should increase in order to maintain the credibility of the VTTC concept. Hence, it is important to pursue both an unbiased estimate of the VTTC and unbiased estimates of VTTC elasticities with respect to the variables of interest. The theory of the VTTC has been well rehearsed over the last five decades, based mainly on the seminal work on time allocation by Becker (1965). DeSerpa (1971) developed a framework, building upon Becker’s work, from which a theoretical definition of the VTTC is obtained. In short, the VTTC is defined as the marginal rate of substitution between travel time and money (e.g. travel cost). It is then widely agreed that the VTTC can be found in individuals’ travel choices where they trade-off money and time. Simply imagine a classical convex indifference curve for the consumption of two goods, time and money, that can be changed by the allocation of time and money to travelling (as the Fig. 1 below depicts). Indifference curves for the money-time trade-off In this framework, utility increases as the individuals reduce their allocation of time and income to travelling and the slope of each indifference curve represents the VTTC. While some data of this nature exist from real travel markets (i.e. revealed preference data), it is often very limited: individuals’ travel choices are observable, but it is hard to observe the actual trade-off (if any) that the person faced at the moment of choice. For this reason, experiments that mimic those necessary trade-offs and choices are typically conducted to collect data. National VTTC studies typically rely on hypothetical stated choice (SC) experiments for data collection. Through these methods the researcher has more control over the variables of interest, time and cost, and can generate trade-offs. Discrete choice models grounded in traditional microeconomic theory are then employed to estimate the VTTC from the data. In this context, the artificial nature of the SC experiments has sometimes generated doubts on the validity of estimation results (e.g. Daly and Tsang 2009). For example, Ojeda-Cabral et al. (2015) found surprisingly similar patterns in the variation of the VTTC with income and journey length in two different countries (UK and Denmark) which had used the same SC design. While there is plenty of evidence on how modelling specification can also affect the estimation results (see also Fosgerau et al. 2007a, b; and Fosgerau and Bierlaire 2009), we are not aware of any work that shows how the preferences of individuals vary (reflected by model estimates) across a number of different SC design settings. Our global aim is to increase our understanding of the set of VTTC in a population. In this paper we do not question the validity of VTTC estimation results using SC experiments. However, we acknowledge that the variables used in the SC experiments (decided by the researcherFootnote 1) may influence the estimated set of VTTC, because preferences may be different under different SC settings. There is a subtle difference here from saying that the survey influences the behaviour; rather, different survey settings will potentially lead to different results given that preferences may vary across settings. In the simplest VTTC experiment, the design variables are travel time changes (∆t) and travel cost changes (∆c). The ratio ∆c/∆t forms a valuation threshold (Boundary VTTC, or BVTTC). It is essential to understand how SC design variables influence the VTTC and other estimates in order to improve the construction of SC experiments: if preferences do vary with the setting, researchers should decide for which particular setting/s they want to infer preferences. The objective of the paper is therefore to investigate how different (or not) the preferences of a sample of travellers may be under different SC design settings. Preferences are represented by the model estimates of the underlying set of VTTC, while the SC design settings are represented by the levels of the SC design variables. For this, a series of empirical exercises which we refer to as partial data analysis are conducted. Ideally, one would like to observe the same individuals completing different SC experiments. However, with the data currently available, an alternative approach is to use a large dataset of individuals’ responses, and split it according to different levels of the variable of interest. The data can then be analysed as if the design had a restricted range for the variable of interest (e.g. Fosgerau and Börjesson 2015), where it is still highly likely by design that a given respondent contributes to the results in different segments, given the variety in the settings they are faced with. To increase the policy relevance of this work, we use the data for the last published national VTTC study in the UK (Mackie et al. 2003) and state-of-the-art model specifications. The data will be split based on the levels of the three design variables: boundary VTTC, ∆t and ∆c. The estimation of the same advanced model on each sub-sample will show preferences for a particular setting (defined by the levels of the variable). This paper contributes to the literature on the estimation of the value of time by showing how preferences may (or not) be different under different SC designs, which is important both for researchers and policy-makers. The VTTC and how it varies across and within people remain not fully understood, and not enough attention has been paid to the SC designs that define the choice contexts (e.g. Fosgerau and Börjesson 2015). Our work will increase our understanding, will be useful to inform the construction of future SC experiments to estimate valuations of travel time and will have implications for appraisal. The paper is structured as follows. ”Evidence on variation in the VTTC”section presents some existing evidence on how the VTTC has been found to vary across and within individuals, which shapes the current perceptions about the set of VTTC in a population. “Methodology to estimate the VTTC” section reviews the standard methodology applied in most European studies to estimate the VTTC, explaining the essence of SC experiments and the most common discrete choice models in the field. “Dataset” section introduces the dataset and “Empirical work” section describes the empirical work, including all results. “Discussion and conclusions” section concludes.",10

Dharmowijoyo,Yusak O. Susilo,Anders Karlström,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"In engaging with their daily activity-travel, travellers’ needs and constraints are influenced by their personal and household socio-demographic characteristics and their socio-environmental conditions. Based on individual personal and social characteristics, Hägerstrand (1970) argued that an individual is subject to three types of constraints: capability constraints, coupling constraints, and authority constraints. These constraints interact with each other and define one’s daily time–space prism. The conditions and variability of other resources, such as availability and service level of the infrastructure and public transport network, the selection of possible activity locations within reachable distances, access to various travel modes, and amount of money to spend, would provide individuals with opportunities to engage in more/less activities with more/less dispersed location and time. Given that individuals’ needs, desires, and constraints differ from day to day, their time–space prisms and paths also differ from day to day (Schlich and Axhausen 2003; Miller 2005; Chikaraishi et al. 2011; Raux et al. 2012; Moiseeva et al. 2014; Susilo and Axhausen 2014). This complex mechanism means that each individual is unique and failing to accommodate these interactions biases analyses and predictions. The constraints are not solely physical and instrumental factors, such as travel mode availability, time and cost. Non-instrumental variables such as motivation, volition and habits also come into play. Currently there is a lack of knowledge of how these non-instrumental variables are interacting and influencing the constraints that shape the individuals’ travel behaviour (Lewin 1936; Weick 1976; McDonald 1994; Golledge and Stimson 1997; Dijst et al. 2008; Van Acker et al. 2011). Recent studies have hinted that different social and geographical conditions may present different sets of pressures and opportunities to the individual that correlate and differently interact with different individuals’ subjective characteristics (McDonald 1994; Gärling and Axhausen 2003; Dijst et al. 2008; Dharmowijoyo et al. 2015b). Previous studies revealed that individuals’ social and geographical conditions, including their activity locations and spatial movement patterns, are also influenced by non-instrumental factors, such as behavioural desire, volition, and past behaviour (Dijst et al. 2008; Dharmowijoyo et al. 2015b). Thus, individuals’ temporal-social situations and trip engagements are correlated with that individual’s non-instrumental factors. Given that each day is distinct, the influence of individual motivation, volitional state, and past behaviour on the variability of activity-travel behaviour may be different for different days. Furthermore, any health or emotional problems may also influence individuals’ activity-travel behaviour. How individuals’ health condition influences their activity and travel participation may be more straightforward compared with the other way around (Dharmowijoyo et al. 2015b, 2016a). This highlights the importance of understanding the complex interdependencies between ones’ health condition and ones’ time-use and activity participation. The interactions between needs and constraints highlight that some activities (such as work/school and drop-off/pick-up child/children) are temporally and spatially fixed, while other activities, such as maintenance and leisure, are flexible/discretionary. The former are defined as mandatory and difficult to be re-scheduled, thus, dictating the individuals’ ability to perform the latter. In this open information era, individuals’ desire to connect with other people may increase travel distance and space exploration by utilising the recent advancements in vehicle technologies and infrastructure expansion, but may reduce them in terms of spending more time on certain activity types with other people (Axhausen 2006; Carrasco and Miller 2006, 2009). It is notable that discretionary activity trips (consisting of grocery shopping and social-recreation trips) tend to dominate individuals’ trip making purposes (around 54–70 %, around half for social-recreation trips) rather than work/school trips (around 18–36 %) in developed countries (Stauffacher et al. 2005). Grocery shopping and out-of-home social-recreation activities are the most important out-of-home discretionary activities which tend to have different purposes in satisfying individuals’ needs (Akar et al. 2011), and temporal and spatial fixity degree (Schwanen et al. 2008). Grocery shopping aims to satisfy individuals’ biological needs and tend to have lower spatial and temporal fixity degree than out-of-home social-recreation in developed country case, whilst social-recreation trips fulfil cultural and physiological needs and tend to have more fixed spatial and temporal fixity degree. Understanding how different mechanisms underlie those different activities will help us to provide more opportunities for undertaking those activities and/or to manage trips related with those activities. Moreover, relating those activities with health parameters shows that undertaking social-recreational activities tends to positively correlate with better social health conditions (Suzukamo et al. 2011; Dharmowijoyo et al. 2015b; Susilo and Liu 2016). Meanwhile, simultaneously undertaking grocery shopping as a primary activity and socialising as a secondary purpose, encourages individuals to do more physical activities, subsequently improving their physical health condition (Dharmowijoyo et al. 2015b). While studies have investigated the complexity of discretionary activity participation (e.g. Yamamoto and Kitamura 1999; Joh et al. 2002; Pendyala and Yamamoto 2002; Meloni et al. 2004; Lee and Hickman 2007; Cirillo and Axhausen 2010), including how it was arranged between different household members and varied across different days (e.g. Kang et al. 2009; Kang and Scott 2010; Dharmowijoyo et al. 2016a), the interaction between individuals’ day-to-day time–space components, his/her subjective characteristics and health factors in discretionary activity participation are largely unknown. In this study, it is hypothesised that integration among time–space, psychological and health components can categorise the level of priority of certain activities. Cullen and Godson (1975), Cullen (1978), and Golledge and Stimson (1997) have argued that classification of certain activities as a planned or an impulsive behaviour can be caused by integration between time–space and psychological factors. Moreover, time–space components such as daily time allocation to activity participation, socio-demographic and built environment variables are assumed to affect individuals’ non-instrumental factors. Lastly, it is also hypothesised that incorporating health factors in the model will show how individuals’ health constraints influence individuals’ activity-travel behaviours. The interaction between health and time–space components may help us in coordinating health and time-use policies, All of the discussions above try to analyse individuals’ behaviours in relation with their personal factors and associations with other individuals, materials and authorities’ rules/norms in multi-hierarchies and multi-dimensional perspectives within time–space limitations. The investigation tries to capture the complexity of interactions at the smallest level (Golledge and Stimson 1997; Marion 1999; Urry 2005; Ramalingam et al. 2008). Individuals’ behaviours can be seen as individuals’ efforts to satisfy their needs and desires in considering the interactions of multi-dimensional systems embedded within themselves under given time and space limitations. Integrating multi-dimensional perspectives can provide insight into the reasons why an individual performs certain activities/trips which may not be obviously captured by a one discipline approach (Dijst et al. 2009). Using a 3-week household time-use and activity diary, this paper examined the relationship between individuals’ non-instrumental variables (such as motivation, volition, and past behaviour), time–space and health factors on individuals’ day-to-day grocery shopping and social-recreation activities. Time space components in this study were represented by day-to-day time duration of activity participation, socio-demographic and built environment variables. Those time–space components were available variables in this paper which explain time–space constraints. A hierarchical Structural Equation Model (SEM) was applied to take day-to-day variability effects into account, which examine the relationships between individuals’ discretionary activity time and non-instrumental factors, such as behavioural desire, volition, and past behaviour. In the next section, the datasets and variable specifications will be described. “Day-to-day variability in individuals’ grocery shopping and out-of-home leisure activities” section presents the descriptive analyses of individuals’ day-to-day variability in discretionary activity participation during the observed period. “Proposed model structure” and “Estimation results” sections describe the proposed model structure and model estimation results, respectively. Conclusions are presented in “Conclusions and discussion” section.",26

Chorus,Sander van Cranenburgh,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In a recent contribution to this journal, Rasouli and Timmermans compare two different specifications of RRM models. One specification was introduced in a paper co-authored by Timmermans (Chorus et al. 2008), the other was presented in a paper published two years later (Chorus 2010). In the remainder of this commentary, we will refer to the former as RRM2008, and the latter as RRM2010. In their paper (from here on denoted RT2016), they conclude that 2010RRM is theoretically problematic, and that it has a worse empirical performance on a particular data set. Unfortunately, the theoretical conclusion is based on a flawed representation and interpretation of RRM2010 (and of regret based discrete choice models in general). Furthermore, RT2016 overlooks highly relevant recent work on the topic which makes their comparison to a considerable extent irrelevant; and the paper contains insufficient empirical analyses. Importantly, this commentary will only focus on correcting flaws in reasoning and representation, and critical omissions of past work. Our aim is not to evaluate the outcome of the model comparison in itself (RT2016 prefer 2008RRM over 2010RRM). We are aware that, from their inception, RRM models have sparked considerable debate, (i) in terms of their potential and limitations as an alternative to linear in parameter RUM models and (ii) in terms of the ‘proper’ way to model regret minimizing behaviour. We have always kept an open mind regarding these debates, and will continue to do so; indeed, we believe academic debate is a potentially very effective route to scientific knowledge accumulation. However, in order to be effective, a debate about the relative quality of different models must be based on a correct description of these models, a proper discussion of relevant past work, adequate interpretation of the results of these models, and a sufficiently rich empirical context. Unfortunately, RT2016 falls short on all of these aspects. This is likely to lead to considerable confusion among readers, and may hamper scientific knowledge accumulation. Therefore, this commentary aims to resolve this confusion; it certainly does not aim to stifle academic debate. In the remainder of this commentary, we will address these issues in RT2016; we start with a rebuttal of erroneous theoretical claims in RT2016, and continue with a discussion of overlooked past work on the topic. We conclude by considering the empirical content of RT2016. We have chosen to avoid discussion of several minor mistakes and omissions, for reasons of conciseness. The Appendix provides notation for the models discussed in this commentary. Note that our notation follows that in our previous papers, and differs from that of RT2016. Finally, note that RT2016 compare two model specifications (RRM2008 and RRM2010) which differ in terms of both the shape of the so-called attribute regret function as well as in terms of the number of competitor alternativesFootnote 1 used for computing total regret. In this commentary (with the exception of the Section discussing empirical analyses), we focus only the former of these two dimensions, as it is this dimension which causes most issues in RT2016.Footnote 2 In other words, this commentary (and the next two sections in particular) focuses on refuting claims made in RT2016 concerning different specifications of the attribute regret function, which computes the level of regret which is associated with comparing a considered alternative with another alternative, in terms of a particular attribute.",4

A typical characteristic of this field is that it is rapidly evolving in response to technological development (Lyons 2014). Whereas about a decade ago, most advanced ICT applications were based on communication using land lines (e.g. teleworking or teleshopping from home), nowadays large segments of the population own smartphones, which allow them to be connected to the internet anywhere and anytime, and apply a wide variety of software (apps). It goes without saying that as a result, the variety of ICT tools available to travellers has increased exponentially (Schwanen 2015). The central tenet of this paper is that this dramatic development in the context of ICTs (and apps in particular) has profound bearing on the discussion about the impact of ICTs on travel, calling for complementary frameworks to the ones used to day. Whereas many studies to date tend to describe the effects of ICTs on travel in terms of the amount of increase/decrease of travel, the increasing diversity of ICT tools calls for more detailed analysis, which not only focuses on specific ICT tools rather than on broad types of ICTs, but also focuses in much more detail on the practices of using ICT tools and the contextual factors that influence their use and effect, as well as their further development. In the context of apps, Schwanen (2015) has argued that rather than focusing on the traveller as a decision maker, it is helpful to focus on the App as the object of investigation as it can be regarded as a more or less autonomous agent entangled in a web of relationships with humans and technological devices. In agreement with this reasoning, this paper proposes an alternative approach to analysing the effect of apps on travel. In particular, we propose activity theory (AT) (Engeström 2014) as a framework for analyzing the effects of apps on travel behaviour. This paper aims to explore how AT can be used to further our understanding of the impact of apps on travel, and complement the existing approaches focusing at travellers’ behaviour. To this end, we will use AT to systematically explore the mechanisms by which a number of different apps influence travel behaviour. We will assess the added value of AT as well as its limitations in the context of apps and travel. The paper is organized as follows. “Existing approach to studying ICT and travel” section discusses existing approaches used to date to study the relationship between ICTs and travel. “Apps, activities and travel: a taxonomy” section then proposes a taxonomy of apps, which serves as a starting point for more detailed analyses using AT. “Activity theory” section introduces the principles of AT. “The effect of apps on activities and travel according to activity theory” section describes the application of AT to two smartphone apps (WhatsApp) and Travel Feedback apps. “Conclusions and discussion” section, finally, draws conclusions regarding the applicability of AT to the study of apps and their impact on travel, the mechanisms by which the two apps influence travel behaviour, and discusses possible avenues for further research.",21

(2003, p. 29) proposed (in essenceFootnote 1) the following conditional indirect utility function (CIUF): whereFootnote 2 \(\tilde{v}_{{i,n}}\) is the conditional indirect utility for travel option i and traveller n, y

n
 is the income of traveller n, y
0 is the ‘reference’ income (i.e. across a sample of travellers), c

n
 is the ‘current’ travel cost for traveller n, c
0 is the ‘reference’ travel cost (i.e. across a sample of travel options), Δc

i,n
 is the change in travel cost following an intervention, defined: \(\Delta c_{i,n} = c_{i,n} - c_{n}\), ∆t

i,n
 is the change in travel time following an intervention, defined: \(\Delta t_{i,n} = t_{i,n} - t_{n}\), c

i,n
 is the ‘design’ travel cost for travel option i and traveller n, (i.e. as presented within a Stated Preference (SP) design), t

i,n
 is the ‘design’ travel time for travel option i and traveller n, t

n
 is the ‘current’ travel time for traveller n, and \(\alpha ,\beta ,\eta_{y} ,\eta_{c}\) are parameters to be estimated. Since 2003, the CIUF (1) has underpinned official UK guidance for appraising the time saving benefits of transport infrastructure schemes (Department for Transport (DfT), 2014), and similar identities have subsequently been adopted within the official methods of other countries, notably Switzerland (Axhausen et al. 2008) and The Netherlands (Kouwenhoven et al. 2014). A key feature of (1) is that travel time and cost are specified as changes from the current travel option rather than as absolutes. This specification reflects the format of the dataset analysed by Mackie et al. (2003), which was collected by AHCG (1999) some years earlier, and consisted of SP choices between pairs of time/money changes relative to the current travel option. In order to estimate (1), the convention has been to deploy models from the Random Utility Model (RUM) class (e.g. McFadden 1981). However, since a property of RUM is ‘translational invariance’—meaning that ‘only differences in utility matter’ (Train 2009, p. 19)—the empirical manifestation of (1) will be as follows: where Δc

i,n
 and Δt

i,n
 in (1) are, in effect, replaced with c

i,n
 and t

i,n
 respectively. When estimating (2) on SP data, it has commonly been found that \({{\partial \tilde{v}_{i,n} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{\partial \tilde{v}_{i,n} } {\partial c_{i,n} < 0}}} \right. \kern-0pt} {\partial c_{i,n} < \,0}}\) and \({{\partial \left( {{{\partial \tilde{v}_{i,n} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{\partial \tilde{v}_{i,n} } {\partial c_{i,n} }}} \right. \kern-0pt} {\partial c_{i,n} }}} \right)} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{\partial \left( {{{\partial \tilde{v}_{i,n} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{\partial \tilde{v}_{i,n} } {\partial c_{i,n} }}} \right. \kern-0pt} {\partial c_{i,n} }}} \right)} {\partial c_{n} > 0}}} \right. \kern-0pt} {\partial c_{n} > 0}}\), a result which has provoked debate concerning the phenomenon of ‘cost damping’. In general terms, cost damping refers to instances where the conditional marginal disutility of travel cost decreases—in absolute terms—as travel cost and/or distance increases (Daly 2010). Within this general definition, different researchers have interpreted the phenomenon slightly differently, depending on their respective definitions of travel time, cost and distance. In the particular terms of the CIUF (2), we refer to cost damping as the propensity for the conditional marginal disutility of ‘design’ travel cost to decrease—in absolute terms—as ‘current’ travel cost increases. Reconciling the empirical findings \({{\partial \tilde{v}_{i,n} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{\partial \tilde{v}_{i,n} } {\partial c_{i,n} < 0}}} \right. \kern-0pt} {\partial c_{i,n} < 0}}\) and \({{\partial \left( {{{\partial \tilde{v}_{i,n} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{\partial \tilde{v}_{i,n} } {\partial c_{i,n} }}} \right. \kern-0pt} {\partial c_{i,n} }}} \right)} \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{\partial \left( {{{\partial \tilde{v}_{i,n} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{\partial \tilde{v}_{i,n} } {\partial c_{i,n} }}} \right. \kern-0pt} {\partial c_{i,n} }}} \right)} {\partial c_{n} > 0}}} \right. \kern-0pt} {\partial c_{n} > 0}}\) with the theoretical properties of indifference maps, Mackie et al. (2003) concluded that ‘…the ‘relative’ effect whereby a given cost increase conveys less disutility when the base cost is large is not in line with general economic theory’ (p. 29). Subsequently, Daly 2010 examined the same theoretical properties, but considering a broader class of CIUFs than (2), and concluded differently: ‘…economic theory cannot give any indication for the sign of the second derivative of indirect utility with respect to price… Since it is exactly the curvature of the utility function that defines cost damping, we see that economic theory is not able to give any indication for the existence or validity of cost damping’ (p. 31). Whilst official guidance for appraising the time saving benefits of transport infrastructure schemes typically arises from a combination of theoretical and empirical insights, it would seem preferable if these two insights could be aligned—such that theory is supportive of empirical estimates of VoT, and vice versa. With this sentiment in mind, the present paper will reconsider the question of whether economic theory can shed light on the validity of cost damping, by examining the theoretical properties of demand functions as opposed to indifference maps. To this end, the specific objectives of the present paper are as follows: To consider the theoretical properties inherent within the CIUF (2), with particular reference to the cost damping phenomenon. To consider the theoretical properties of the conditional demand function associated with (2), and the extent to which these properties are affected by cost damping. To draw implications for the practical specification of travel choice models when estimating VoT. To illustrate these practical implications using an official national VoT dataset. The paper will begin by briefly rehearsing the theoretical basis of VoT (""Theoretical basis of VoT"" section), before analysing the first derivatives of (2), in particular deriving the VoT and the demand for travel conditional upon choice (""First derivatives from Mackie et al.’s CIUF"" section). This will be followed by analysis of the second derivatives of (2), which inform the theoretical properties of both the indifference map (""Second derivatives from Mackie et al.’s CIUF, and theoretical properties of the indifference map"" section) and the conditional demand (""Theoretical properties of Mackie et al.’s conditional demand"" section). The penultimate section of the paper (""Alternative specifications of the CIUF"" section) will test the properties of the conditional demand empirically using data from Mackie et al. (2003), whilst the final section will summarise and conclude (""Summary and conclusions"" section).",2

In addition to direct commute trips, extra stops added to the commute journey have recently received increased attention (Bhat 1999; Bhat and Sardesai 2006; Cao et al. 2008; Currie and Delbosc 2011; Ma et al. 2014; McGuckin et al. 2005; Portoghese et al. 2011; Susilo and Kitamura 2008; Van Acker and Witlox 2011). The increasing presence of dual-earner households and the growing acceptance of sharing household tasks between spouses (Levinson and Kumar 1995; Soo et al. 2008) increase time pressure for urban families and consequently encourage trip-chaining behavior. For example, a household travel survey in metropolitan Washington, DC showed that multi-purpose commute trips increased from 1.5 to 15% between 1968 and 1988 (Levinson and Kumar 1995). This trend was confirmed on a national scale for the USA from 1995 to 2001, with a 9% increase in commuters who chained trips as part of their commutes (McGuckin et al. 2005). For individuals, trip chaining behavior may provide greater efficiency and convenience in their daily lives (Hensher and Reyes 2000; Ye et al. 2007), and for households, frequent multi-purpose commute trips play a major organizational role in their overall travel patterns (Hanson 1980). However, for urban transportation systems, the substantial increase in non-work stops in commuting may result in severe problems; for example, pressure in peak hours can increase because of the extra travel time for the stops (Bhat 1997). Although previous studies have addressed many aspects of commute trip chains, such as occurrence (Cao et al. 2008; Nishii and Kondo 1992), stop frequency (Bhat 1997; Portoghese et al. 2011), stop duration (Bhat 1996a, b; Brunow and Gründer 2013), tour scheduling (Islam and Habib 2012; Ma et al. 2014) and location choice (Wang et al. 2013), the impacts of trip chaining on travel time have received little attention. Trip chaining in the context of commuting implies detours and extra travel time, the amount of which is likely to depend on the salience and duration of the secondary activity, geographical locations of the activity sites and increase in the efficiency of daily activity schedules. Soo et al. (2008) and Susilo and Dijst (2009, 2010) developed an analytical model to relate extra travel time (as compared with direct commute trips) to the duration of the secondary activity, expressed in the so-called travel time ratio (TTR). They found that the value of the TTR is affected by the journey types (to work or from work), trip purposes, socio-demographics of the travelers and built-environment opportunities. However, travel mode choices were assumed to be the same for direct trips and trip chains in their studies. In this paper, we argue that commute trip chains may in fact be the results of more complex behavioral adjustments, in which commuters may not only decide to include secondary destinations in their commute trips but also change the travel modes or timing of the commute trips. These strategies may have a considerable bearing on the extra travel time needed for trip chaining. Neglecting these strategies may lead to wrong conclusions regarding daily time use and travel times and consequently the sustainability and well-being implications. The aim of this paper is to investigate travel time attributed to non-work stops in commuting and examine the possible factors that affect the extra travel time and its trade-off with activity time in multi-purpose commute trips in Beijing, China. A series of socio-demographic and spatial attributes (at the residence and workplace) will be included. Specifically, one aspect of our research is to explore the influence of transport mode shift on extra travel time. The availability of multi-day travel and activity data in Beijing allows us to make these detailed comparisons between direct and multi-purpose commute trips at the individual level. The study area for this research is Beijing, China. Empirical studies on trip chaining behavior have largely focused on European or American cities. With rapid urbanization occurring in China, traffic congestion and accessibility deficiencies have become primary challenges (Chai 2013). As for transport mode choices in Chinese cities, public transit dominates, whereas urban residents have become increasingly dependent on automobiles. In Beijing, trips by public transit accounted for 44.0% of all the trips (trips on foot excluded) by the residents in 2012, whereas trips by private car accounted for 32.6%. Specifically, private car ownership increased sharply from 1.8 to 4.2 million between 2005 and 2012 (Beijing Transport Research Center 2013). A deeper understanding of trip chaining behavior with this state of transport mode choices will enrich the travel behavior research and may contribute to better policy making in the context of developing economies (Ma et al. 2014; Yang et al. 2007). The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The next section presents a brief review of previous studies on the trade-off between travel and activity time and the formulation for travel time attributed to non-work stops in this study. “Data” section introduces the data source, dataset preparation, and method for the analysis. The model estimation results are discussed in “Results” section. The conclusion and discussion are presented in the final section.",13

In general, for engineering systems, it has been defined as the sum of the passive survival rate (reliability) and the proactive survival rate (restoration) (Youn et al. 2011). Resilience has also been considered as an intrinsic ability of systems to adjust their functionality in the presence of disturbances and unpredicted changes (Hollnagel et al. 2006). Furthermore, it has been regarded as the ability of the systems to sustain the impacts of external and internal disruptions without discontinuity of performing their function; or if these functions are disconnected, to recover them rapidly and completely (ASME 2009). In particular, the resilience of transport systems as sub-components of engineering systems has been defined as their ability to predict, absorb, adapt, and/or quickly recover after the impact of disruptive events such as, for example, natural disasters (NIAC 2009). Since the transport sector and its infrastructure have been recognized as important contributors to the national economies and societies, most research in the given context has dealt with their resilience (Percoco 2004). The above-mentioned concepts and definitions of resilience can also be applied, after the necessary modifications, to rail passenger networks—both conventional and HSR (high speed rail)Footnote 1 as components of the transport network/system of many countries worldwide. Dealing with the resilience of these networks usually implies considering how their selected planned performances change if affected by the impact of various internal and external disruptive events. Most often, the consequences depending on the intensity and duration of these impacts include physical damage to infrastructure, failures of components of the supporting facilities and equipment and rolling stock, and consequently cancellations and/or relatively long delays of the affected transport services (Ip and Wang 2011). The main directly affected actors/stakeholders have always been on the supply side the rail transport service operator(s), i.e., providers of transport infrastructure and services, and on the demand side the system’s users/passengers. In some cases, the dependent businesses and governments at different institutional scales—local/regional/national—are also affected. In particular, the rail operator(s) and its users/passengers can generally be imposed the direct costs associated with the affected performances during and after the impact of disruptive events, i.e., during their deteriorating and recovering, respectively. This has raised the question of the resilience of the existing conventional and particularly HSR passenger networks affected by different disruptive events, particularly large-scale ones. Therefore, this paper aims to addressing precisely this question. In addition to this introductory section, the paper consists of four other sections. “Some characteristics of rail passenger networks and the concept of their resilience” Section describes the relevant characteristics of conventional and HSR network(s) and the concept of their resilience. “Modeling resilience of the affected rail passenger networks” Section presents the methodology consisting of the analytical models for estimating resilience of these networks and the models of indicators of selected performances as the figures-of-merit for assessing it. “An application of the methodology to the affected HSR (high speed rail) network” Section presents an application of the proposed methodology ex post, i.e., to a past case, namely to the Japanese Shinkansen HSR network, which was affected by a large-scale disruptive event, the Great East Japan Earthquake on 11 March 2011. The last section summarizes some conclusions.",31

For quite some time, there has been a growing interest in research into traveller behaviour, to explore the choice set formation and its representation. A proper modelling of user behaviour requires including the endogenous and exogenous factors that affect the decision-making process, as they induce constraints in the choice set formation. The endogenous factors are inherent to the user, limiting the universal choice set. The exogenous factors are instead originated by the decisions of other users and by the existing supply of goods or services. Constraints imposed by endogenous or exogenous factor are called soft if they reduce the probability to choose a given alternative but does not completely exclude it from the choice set. Hard constraints instead cannot be violated and impose the exclusion of the alternative. For example in the choice of residential location, a user can eliminate from the choice set alternatives whose price is above a threshold (hard constraint due to endogenous factors), or it can be that the utility of an alternative drops if an attribute takes a value above or below a given threshold, but the alternative is still available (soft constraint due to endogenous factors). Analogously the allocation of seats between railway services and the choices of other passengers (exogenous constraint) may define the latent choice set for a specific user (hard constraint). Note that exogenous factors may induce soft constraints, e.g., the vehicle capacity in transit services (subway or bus) does not impose an upper bound in the number of passengers but represents a factor of discomfort. As will be clarified in the next section, the literature review, most work concentrates on the use of soft constraints applied to model endogenous factors. Hard constraints have received less attention, despite their importance in modelling such endogenous factors as the interaction of supply and demand. If we are analysing a supply and demand equilibrium problem and we wish to estimate a demand model, the data available about demand is the result of choices made by that demand and the limitations imposed by the current supply. Most applications simply ignore these effects; thus, forecasts of demand for a different supply scenario from that used in the estimation are likely to violate constraints and miscalculate demand. A notable example of the interaction of supply and demand can be seen in the problem of rolling out a refuelling infrastructure for Alternative Fuel Vehicles (AFV). This effect is known as the Chicken-or-Egg dilemma. The refuelling infrastructure imposes hard constraints on the user choice set. Users with no effective access to a refuelling station will not contemplate buying an AFV. Most discrete choice models designed to analyse the introduction of AF vehicles up to now have considered infrastructure as just another attribute (soft constraint). Fúnez-Guerra et al. (2016) show the problem for the Spanish case, and underlines that a discrete choice model that does not consider the refuelling infrastructure as a hard constraint significantly overestimates sales of AF vehicles as against a model which does. The hard constraints separate the effects of supply from those associated with demand allow changes in supply to be properly accounted for when making estimations. The main aim of this study is to explore an approach that can handle hard constraints in the decision-making process to find a mathematical formulation for the specific case of (nested) logit models. A second problem addressed in this study is how to introduce general nonlinear utilities into this type of constrained model. This is especially important when considering dynamic phenomena. The machine learning community has made extensive and successful use of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces. This paper adapts these techniques to the second problem. The challenge lies in its estimation, since there may be a parameter for each observation, rather than one for each attribute considered. For this reason, and because constrained nested logit model do not allow a closed formula, we have created a novel estimation method for this problem.",7

The offered trip results solely from the individual need of the supplier to perform a particular movement. The supplier determines the main characteristics of the trip: origin, destination, departure time and choice of route. A ridesharing potential occurs, if the temporal and spatial trip characteristics of supplier and demander match. A ridesharing trip is generated if the demander accepts the offer of the supplier. While the supplier receives a certain cost compensation, the demander receives a convenient trip to the desired destination. Traditional ridesharing, also called carpooling, has the following characteristics: The suppliers conduct their trips independently of any additional demand for a ride. In the past, where only a small number of trips were on offer, ridesharing made sense only for long-distance trips (arranged by ridesharing agencies) or for regular trips (trip sharing with work mates). New online platforms ensure the matching of suppliers and potential demanders at short notice. This dynamic ridesharing has become an option in short-distance transport offering an alternative for trips with no or inadequate public transport. In such cases, ridesharing can reduce car trips and contribute to a more sustainable transport. As the example of transport network companies (TNC) like Uber and Lyft shows, ridesharing can also be provided as a professional service offering taxi-like rideselling services, which may increase the number of car trips. The expectation, that the importance of ridesharing will increase, be it in the form of carpooling or rideselling, requires transport planners to estimate the impacts of ridesharing. How big is the potential of ridesharing? What is the critical mass of suppliers necessary to ensure that demanders are offered a suitable trip with a high probability and short waiting times? What would happen, if fleets of self-driving cars offer ridesharing services? In order to find answers to these questions travel demand models may be helpful, if they are extended by an algorithm for the matching of offered and demanded trips. This paper presents an algorithm for the matching of trips. It can be integrated in existing macroscopic travel demand models, which differ from microscopic travel demand models in several aspects (Table 1). The algorithm is based on the following assumptions: Origin and destination of all trips of suppliers and demanders are located in traffic zones. Every trip originates in an origin zone, traverses a sequence of traffic zones along a shortest path until it terminates in the destination zone. Trips are only matched if their origin and destination lie within the sequence of the traversed zones. Suppliers will only make detours for picking up or dropping off passengers in the zones along the shortest path. A traffic zone does not represent an exact meeting point for suppliers and demanders but it defines an appropriate area for this meeting. It is assumed that suppliers and demanders can arrange an appropriate meeting point within a zone. The exact meeting point, however, is not modeled. Longer trip times resulting from detours for picking up or dropping off demanders can be included by extra times depending on the size of the corresponding traffic zone. The daily travel demand is available as a set of time-dependent demand matrices. The algorithm matches the trips for every matrix independently. The paper does not address methods for determining the modal share of ridesharing trips within a travel demand model. The share can be set as an assumption (“assume 10% of all car drivers offer rides and 20% of all public transport users would take suitable offers”) or determined as an independent mode in the mode choice step of the travel demand model. In addition to traditional ridesharing with suppliers and demanders, the paper also addresses a case where individual suppliers are replaced by fleets of taxis or taxi-robots. This case permits to calculate the vehicle occupancy rates of such taxi fleets.",18

C. MariAnne Karlsson,Jana Sochor,Female,Unknown,Female,Female,"The transition to sustainable urban mobility is generally acknowledged as one of the major challenges for the future (Audenhove et al. 2014). To meet sustainability targets, a mix of technological improvement and behavioral change is commonly argued to be necessary (May 2013; Marsden et al. 2014; Lyons 2011). Development is not limited to only more efficient technology (e.g. more efficient and less carbon intensive vehicles), but also includes new ways of producing, delivering and consuming transport through integrated mobility solutions, such as the emerging concept of Mobility as a Service (MaaS). MaaS is an organizational and technological approach to attract and enable people to give up their private car by providing a competitive service offer (Kamargianni et al. 2016). Although there is ongoing debate about what constitutes MaaS, central elements include: offering a service that focuses on the customer’s/user’s/traveler’s transport needs; offering mobility and access rather than transport; and offering integration of transport services, information, booking, payment, etc. (Sochor et al. 2017). Building upon different types of integration, Sochor and colleagues (2017) propose a MaaS typology as a tool for facilitating comparisons of MaaS as well as for understanding potential effects. The typology suggests five levels of MaaS integration (0–4) where level 0 is no integration (e.g. separate services), level 1 integration of information (e.g. travel planners), level 2 integration of payment (e.g. SMILE or moovel), level 3 integration of the customer relationship and experience (e.g. UbiGo or MaaS Global), and level 4 integration of policy (no examples). At higher integration levels, for example at level 3, which is the focus of this paper, MaaS can offer an integrated multimodal mobility package as a competitive alternative to car, instead of focusing on promoting a single, alternative mode. MaaS is predicted to contribute to sustainability by increased sharing of mobility resources, reducing the number of vehicles needed as well as simplifying multimodality through integration (Preston 2012; Karlsson et al. 2017). However, for MaaS to lead to a decrease in car ownership and use, travelers are still required to change behavior, which has been hard to bring about (Graham-Rowe et al. 2011). While previous behavior change interventions have mostly focused on informing and motivating individuals to change (Cairns et al. 2008; Brög 1998; Börjesson et al. 2012), MaaS takes a different approach. The expectation of MaaS is that by meeting the individual traveler’s mobility needs in an easy-to-access, tailor-made service package, the travelers’ ability to choose and combine the most appropriate transport options for their trips will improve, decreasing their need to own a car. In a recent stakeholder analysis, 80% of participants reported that they expected private car use to be significantly reduced due to MaaS (König et al. 2016). Based on such expectations, the European MaaS Alliance states that “MaaS has the potential to fundamentally change the behavior of people in and beyond cities, hence it is regarded as the biggest paradigm change in transport since affordable cars came into the market” (https://maas-alliance.eu/). However, empirical studies of the effects of MaaS on user behavior are scarce, as few implementations of MaaS have been made (as yet), let alone have been openly evaluated. Several pilots are underway, such as Whim in Helsinki and EU Horizon 2020 projects IMOVE and MaaS4EU which started mid-2017. UbiGo is still an exception, having been trialed and evaluated in a six-month Field Operational Test (FOT) in Gothenburg, Sweden. Based on the insights gathered in that FOT, this paper aims to present analyses and discussions regarding who the (potential) MaaS customer is, their expectations, and their behavior. In particular, the paper examines the following questions: (a) What users does such a service (and value offering) attract? (b) For what reasons do users join such a service, and what are the users’ expectations of the service and of themselves? and (c) How can such a service lead to (or hinder) behavioral change?",55

Public procurement practices and the privatization of municipal operators are general characteristics of these institutional changes. These developments in public transport are aligned with the general movement in the public service sectors. Subjecting public services to market principles is one major strand of opinion being advocated in the stream of research labeled ‘New Public Management’ (NPM), where the basic assumptions are that market orientation improves public service performance (Walker et al. 2011) and that citizens’ preferences should be used as the basis for formulating objectives (Vigoda 2002; Rourke 1992). In public transport research, market orientation has only recently been introduced and applied to a public transport context (Molander et al. 2012). The concept of market orientation operationalizes the notion that a market focus is essential, which is an underlying assumption in the development of NPM and the changes taking place in the public transport industry. The tangible and concrete conceptualization made by Kohli and Jaworski (1990) focuses on organizational activities and actions (Kohli and Jaworski 1990; Jaworski and Kohli 1993), defining market orientation as “the organizationwide generation of market intelligence pertaining to current and future customer needs, dissemination of the intelligence across departments and organizationwide responsiveness to it” (Kohli and Jaworski1990, 6). The general trend of increasingly subjecting public transport industry to market principles has been concretized via various regulations and policies. In a public enquiry preceding Sweden’s new public transport Act, which came into effect on 1 January 2012 (SFS 2010), it was concluded that a clear passenger perspective is needed, and that the new Act should foster a customer-centric public transport system in line with passenger needs (SOU 2009). Since customer orientation serves as a foundation for market-oriented activities, market orientation is a seemingly suitable theoretical foundation for examining how the customer-oriented approach being sought is manifested in the organizations responsible for delivering public transport. The new Act (SFS 2010) was also aimed at increasing role clarity for public transport actors. In this study, the market orientation of both public authorities and service providers is examined. In determining the organizational roles that exist in the market orientation of public transport, we also examine public authorities’ and service providers’ perceptions of the other actors’ involvement in market-oriented activities. Market orientation is a process of change and is thus likely to increase over time if the involved actors are committed to a pursuit like this. Other processes, e.g. new regulations and policies, also imply change, indicating that the desired effects might not be visible immediately after coming into effect. Therefore, in order to examine whether and how approaches to market-oriented activities have evolved in public transport, we have adopted a longitudinal approach. As Sweden’s new public transport Act came into effect on 1 January 2012, the first study was conducted in the spring of 2011 and the second in the spring of 2014. The new Act accentuates the prevailing trends in public transport, providing a research opportunity to examine the approach to market-oriented activities that has been taken by public authorities and service providers during this transformative phase of public transport. Examining the market orientation before and after this Act came into effect was a unique opportunity. However, the two market orientation studies should be seen in terms of being conducted on two occasions during a longer and ongoing process to achieve a market-oriented public transport system.",5

Developments in information and communication technology enable us to collect user travel behavior data in detail and design complex systems for transportation services. The empirical study of new pricing systems and mechanism design is needed to validate whether these systems perform efficiently. Analysis of travel behavior under a novel transportation system is also important because such behavior usually varies across users. To achieve policy goals, which means efficient use of transportation system, without monitoring the private value that users placed upon their time or upon transportation services, the tradable credit scheme model has been proposed (Verhoef et al. 1997; Viegas 2001; Yang and Wang 2011; Wu et al. 2012; Nie and Yin 2013). According to this scheme, credits were distributed by the government and users were then required to pay a certain number of credits to use transportation services and facilities. The credits could be traded among users and the price was determined by the market through free trading. By deciding the initial credit distribution, the government could achieve its policy goal. The major advantage of the tradable credit scheme was the achievement of efficient allocation by free trading without requiring information about user preferences. In this study, we implemented a tradable permit system for bicycle-sharing service to clarify the usefulness and practical issues of a tradable permit system empirically. In particular, permits for using the bicycle-sharing service were distributed to users, and we attempted to allocate them efficiently through free trading. Our objective is validating tradable credit/permit schemes, which had been validated only by theoretical approach, by a social pilot program empirically. If the social pilot program show some practical issues of these schemes, then we can improve the scheme practically. Our key contributions are as follows: We implemented a tradable permit system in Yokohama city as a social pilot program. It is a new attempt even from a global perspective. Although there are many existing studies of transportation service auction by theoretical approaches, there is no empirical study of transportation service auction. The empirical transaction behavior is valuable. We collected both transaction behavior in the transportation service auction and travel behavior by GPS every day in the social pilot program. These data can clarify the relationship between transaction of tradable permit and day-to-day travel behavior. We did not use real money but a “virtual money” in the social pilot program. However, we designed the incentive compatible social pilot program by the induced value theory of experimental economics. We discovered that a tradable permit system for a transportation service cannot necessarily achieve the efficient allocation that the theoretical analysis forecasts though the sample size of our pilot program is small. In particular, the transaction behavior of tradable permits is a type of reservation behavior under uncertainty and, in reality, users postponed their decision-making and changed their schedule without prior warning. We showed empirically that this behavior is one of the causes that the tradable permit system in our pilot program did not work. By using a dynamic discrete choice model, we modeled the decision-making of tradable permit transaction, and we empirically clarified the important elements about transaction and future decision-making. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. “Related work” section reviews the reservation system, the pricing system, and the tradable credit/permit scheme for transportation service. In addition, we review the dynamic discrete choice model for describing dynamic decision-making. “Pilot program and Data” section describes the pilot program in Yokohama city in detail and summarizes our data. “Basic analysis” section presents the basic analysis to clarify the relationship between transaction behavior and travel behavior. “Dynamic discrete choice modeling for choice dynamics” section formulates the dynamic discrete choice model for choice dynamics. In “The estimation result of the dynamic discrete choice model and
discussion” section, we estimate the parameters of the dynamic discrete choice model, and sensitivity analysis is described in “Sensitivity analysis” section. Finally, “Conclusions” section concludes the paper.",6

Whilst the full technical reports of the study (Arup, ITS Leeds and Accent 2015a, b) are already in the public domain, and the study team’s recommendations have largely been accepted and implemented by the Department (DfT 2015, 2016, 2017), the present paper seeks to present a digestible summary that is accessible to a broad academic readership. In the context of transport appraisal, one of the most important concepts is that conventionally referred to as the ‘value of time’. This does not refer to the value that might be placed on time spent in travel, but should be seen as shorthand for the ‘value of changes in travel time’, relative to a reference case when investment takes place. These changes may be positive or negative, but historically have been referred to as ‘savings’. Travel time savings are usually the largest single component of the monetised benefits of transport infrastructure projects and policies. Furthermore, time-related benefits such as reliability and relief of overcrowding on public transport (PT) are conventionally valued through multipliers on the ‘value of time’. In this paper we have chosen to refer to the ‘value of travel time’ (VTT) to convey this concept. There have been three waves of national studies of VTT in Britain. First, a series of research studies during the 1960s, the results of which were synthesised and adopted by the Department in appraisal guidance. Second, the MVA, ITS Leeds and TSU Oxford (1987) study, which led to updated guidance. Third, the 1994 study by Accent and Hague Consulting Group (published some years later as AHCG 1999), which was re-analysed by ITS Leeds (Mackie et al. 2003) before again being committed to guidance. Between 2003 and 2016, appraisal guidance was intermittently revised and updated by the Department, to reflect changes in incomes and travel patterns [e.g. as documented in WebTAGFootnote 1 Unit A1.3 (DfT 2014)]. The underpinning behavioural estimates of VTT were not however re-surveyed. In other words, between 2003 and 2016, appraisal guidance on VTT was based on survey data collected in 1994, and analysed using methods considered best-practice in 2003. Over the subsequent 20 years, incomes, prices, demography and the mix of travel by purpose and trip length have all changed. Possibly more significant is that the world has moved on in other ways—the internet revolution, the quality and comfort of vehicles, working practices and, perhaps most fundamentally, the ways in which people perceive time spent travelling. It does not seem credible to suggest that such phenomena can be accommodated simply through updating historical behavioural values for changes in incomes and travel patterns. Also, over the same period, there have been developments in methods for collecting survey data and estimating VTT measures. Contrasting 2016 best-practice against 2003, we are now better equipped to understand various empirical phenomena such as variability in VTT (e.g. ‘deterministic’ variation across different travel conditions, travellers and trip types, as well as inherently ‘random’ or ‘unobserved’ variation), discontinuities in VTT (e.g. ‘size’ and ‘sign’ effects (de Borger and Fosgerau 2008), as well as the phenomenon of ‘cost damping’ Daly 2010), and any residual ‘uncertainty’ in the resultant values (which would contribute to confidence intervals on the VTTs used in appraisal Daly et al. 2012a). In response to these challenges, the Department has, since 2009, taken steps to review the theoretical, methodological and evidential basis of its VTT guidance. Among the key actions have been the Department’s commissioning of scoping studies concerning the valuation of travel time, for both non-work and business. The ITS Leeds, John Bates and DTU (2010) study ‘Values of travel time savings: updating the values for non-work travel’ scoped out the research activities that would be required to update the values for non-work travel, and issued recommendations on which packages of activities should be commissioned. In a similar fashion, the ITS Leeds, John Bates and KTH (2013) study ‘Values of travel time savings for business travellers’ reviewed the feasibility and theoretical accuracy of different methods for estimating VTT for business travellers, as well as evidence from the UK and overseas on the values emanating from these different methods [see also the companion journal paper Wardman et al. (2015)]. Informed by these scoping studies, the Department commissioned new market research to deliver updated evidence on values of travel time and reliability (DfT 2013), and the resulting tender was awarded to the Arup/ITS Leeds/Accent consortium. The study was conducted in two phases, across a challenging timeframe of 11 months. Phase 1 of the study, which was undertaken from June to September 2014, involved the development and testing of methods for undertaking the requisite market research. Phase 2 involved a substantial field survey and detailed modelling to complete estimation of the values of travel time using the collected data. The Department specified the following aims for the research: To provide recommended, up-to-date national average values of in-vehicle travel time savings, covering business and non-work travel, and based on primary research using “modern, innovative methods”. To investigate the factors which cause variation in the values (e.g. by mode, purpose, income, trip distance or duration, productive use of travel time etc.) and use this to inform recommended segmentation of the values. To improve our understanding of the uncertainties around the values, including estimating confidence intervals around the recommended values. To consistently estimate values for other trip characteristics for which values are derived from the values of in-vehicle time savings. In pursuit of these aims, we employed an analysis framework based upon the primary dimensions of trip purpose and mode of travel (see Table 1). Within this framework, key features of the present paper include the following: We focus on the mechanised modes of car, bus, rail and ‘other PT’.Footnote 2 The walk and cycle research encountered significant methodological challenges, and was eventually reported to the Department separately from the mechanised modes, and with only tentative recommendations (Arup, ITS Leeds and Accent 2015b). Informed by the scoping studies, the Department directed us to value travel time savings using willingness-to-pay (WTP) methods—for both non-work and business. The latter directive in respect of business reflected the Department’s interest in replacing the long-standing Cost Saving Approach (CSA) (e.g. Harrison 1974) for valuing business travel time savings with WTP—if the evidence base was adequate to support such a change. Whilst the direction was to implement WTP methods primarily through Stated Preference (SP) data, the Department encouraged us to validate the SP with Revealed Preference (RP) data.Footnote 3 The Department directed us to examine business travel from two alternative perspectives, namely those of the employee and employer. With regards to the latter, the employee is effectively ‘spending’ the business’s time and money, and it is important therefore that the employee reports a WTP representative of his/her employer’s interests. Whilst directed to examine business using WTP, the Department specifically excluded the so-called ‘Hensher’ equation (Hensher 1977) from our scope.",35

Susilo,Chengxi Liu,Maria Börjesson,Unknown,Unknown,Female,Female,"In this study we use the national survey data to reveal the 30-year trend of activity-travel patterns changing over time for men and women in different life-cycle stages. Over these 30 years, there have been substantial changes in household structure, intra-household arrangements, and gender equality in Sweden. These changes are interrelated and have been potentially driven by some fundamental welfare policies. We do not attempt to explicitly investigate the possible causal effects of such policies on the travel behaviour. Instead we explore the trends over time and generations, and we qualitatively discuss possible causes of these trends (even if we cannot be conclusive on the causal effects). Using a pseudo panel approach with several large cross-sectional datasets of the Swedish national travel survey (NTS) conducted between 1978 and 2011, this study systematically explores and quantifies travel behaviour and activity participation trends. Trends in activity-travel patterns have not previously been analysed over such a long period as 30 years. There have, however, been studies examining the impact of life-course or lifestyle on travel choices. We add to this literature in three dimensions: First, earlier studies only focused on travel behaviour indicators descriptively (e.g. Hjorthol et al. 2010; Kuhnimhof et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2014, 2015), whereas we model the interaction between a number of them. Second, earlier studies used a complex behaviour model (e.g. Susilo and Kitamura 2008; Susilo and Waygood 2012) but we add a distinction between different cohorts/generations and life-cycle stages (distinguished by age and household structure: with/without children and single/partnered living). Third, earlier studies explored the changes in detail via mobility biography among a small sample of respondents, such that the findings are difficult to generalise into a full population (e.g. Lanzendorf 2010; Jones et al. 2015), whereas we use large and representative samples. Many of the earlier studies also point to the importance of accounting for the impact of life choices when exploring the travel behaviour (Zhang and van Acker 2017), while in this study the impacts of life choices such as marriage and having children are investigated. Moreover, studying trends in activity-travel patterns across gender and generation in Sweden is relevant for many other countries, since Sweden is among the most gender-equal nations in the world, and in the lead regarding many of the trends. The study has some caveats, namely that each group (life-cycle stage) is treated independently and that it does not consider the dynamic effect over life-cycle stages (e.g. the travel behaviour in an individual’s youth can influence the travel behaviour as they grow older). Moreover, the study does not explicitly model the effect of long-term choices such as residential relocation and owning the first car. The outline of the next sections of this article is as follows. “Life-oriented travel behaviour research” section provides a literature review on how policies and instruments can affect individuals’ travel and activity choices differently for individuals in different life-cycles and generations. “Data and classifications” section describes the national travel survey and the classification of life-cycles adopted in this study. In addition, we present a descriptive analysis of activity-travel patterns for men and women broken down to life-cycle stages and generations in Sweden. A path model structure is proposed in “Descriptive analysis: lifetime span distribution of travel indicators” section to systematically analyse, follow, and quantify the evolution of key factors driving those changes over time. “Controlling the differences over time: a model system to systematically examine the different paths of changes across different genders, life-cycle stages, and generations” section presents the model estimation and results. “Discussion and conclusions” section summarises the findings and also offers a brief reflection towards relevant policy implementation in Sweden in the last 30 years.",29

Many countries, (e.g. Finland, UK, Australia, Singapore, Canada etc.) have stated their intentions to introduce this new service model, which restructures the mobility distribution chain to include a MaaS operator who satisfies users’ every transportation need through a single digital platform (Kamargianni 2015; Datson 2016; MaaS Australia). One of the truly revolutionary elements of MaaS is that it aims to offer travellers the option to buy monthly mobility plans that include a certain amount of each transportation service such that are personalised to each user (Hietanen 2016). These MaaS mobility plans are analogous to “TV + phone + broadband” subscription plans in the telecommunication sector where customers can purchase services in a prepaid one-stop-shop manner. Depending on the local environment, the MaaS plans could not only include the various public transport options, which in many cities are already offered in monthly subscriptions, but also private transport options such as taxi, car sharing, bike sharing, car rental, long distance rail etc. Due to the novelty of the concept, there is still a vast gap in knowledge about the ideal design of the mobility plans. As travellers’ needs are immensely heterogeneous, the plans need to be able to cater for the differing preferences of all user groups. Through the few pilots, projects and thought pieces (Sochor et al. 2015; Hietanen 2016; Kamargianni et al. 2016a etc.) several potential designs have been presented, but there is no quantifiable evidence or consensus about which one would be the best approach. Further, with careful design, MaaS mobility plans can be used as a travel demand management tool to assist in the shift towards more sustainable travel (Matyas and Kamargianni, 2018). Finding subscription plan designs that will both cater to the preferences of users and at the same time support the shift away from private vehicle dominance is not a straightforward task. Before attempting large-scale MaaS applications, it is crucial that some key points are established about user preferences and behaviour. This a priori information can then be used to guide the developments and best practices of MaaS plans design. Against this background, it becomes clear that in depth analysis is needed about preferences and behaviour under various MaaS subscription plan designs. However, to do this, new, currently unavailable data is necessary. As such, the following paper presents a survey and a stated preference (SP) experiment that are designed to investigate the decision-making process of MaaS plan choices. The detailed SP experiments are based upon repeated discrete choices between mobility plans involving the respondents making tradeoffs between the various characteristics and elements of each plan. The case study city in this paper is London, however the presented survey could be used as a basis for MaaS surveys in other geographic areas. More importantly, the SP design of this survey can be applied to other MaaS market research, while the findings from the focus groups provide insights to the research community regarding interpretation of the information presented in the experiment. The findings presented in this paper have the potential to provide in depth insights into how MaaS plans should be designed and can be of high value to transport operators and the wider industry. The paper is structured as follows. “Stated preference for service packages” section provides a short review of service packages in other sectors and the stated preference methodologies that are used to study them. “Mobility tools and MaaS plans” section briefly presents the background on mobility tools and the current approaches to MaaS subscription plans, and sets the core objectives of the SP designs. “London mobility survey” section describes MaaS SP design, including the process at which the attributes and attribute levels were chosen and generated, the scenarios and final design. “Application and data collection” section presents initial insights into the application of the design, which includes the basic design as well as an extension which integrates the survey with a smartphone based prompted recall travel survey. “Conclusions” section concludes the paper and describes the next steps.",38

An exploratory analysis in decomposing the door-to-door experience for multimodal trips,October 2019,Roberto F. Abenoza,Oded Cats,Yusak O. Susilo,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Increasing the modal share of transit services is of large importance to cities worldwide where there are: growing mobility needs to reach workplaces, services and leisure activities, an aspiration for achieving a healthier lifestyle, and of attaining a socially equalitarian and environmentally sustainable society. Transit’s share can be increased by improving travelers’ perception of the quality of the services offered. Transit traveler’s satisfaction can be defined as the overall level of fulfillment with traveler’s expectations (Tyrinopoulos and Antoniou 2008). The existing link between transit traveler’s satisfaction, ridership and loyalty prove the relevance of improving overall trip satisfaction (e.g. Van Lierop and El-Geneidy 2016; Nathanail 2008; Fellesson et al. 2009). There is a large body of literature on the impact of main travel mode’s service attributes on overall satisfaction. However, a large number of transit trips consists of multiple legs; including access, main and egress trip legs. The composition of these door-to-door trips along with their added complexity, including different travel modes and duration has been largely overlooked despite their potential impact on the overall trip satisfaction. The increasing emphasis on integrated transport planning and the policy objective to create seamless door-to-door mobility for all (European Commission 2011) calls for the investigation and deeper understanding of the determinants of travelers’ multimodal travel satisfaction. In order to address the aforementioned limitations, this study aims to answer the question “how do travelers combine memories of a series of pleasant and unpleasant episodes of their multi-leg trips to construct the evaluation of their overall experience?”. Therefore the objective is to investigate the relative importance of satisfaction with access, main and egress legs for the whole travel experience of the combined trip. A trip can be defined as a continuous sequence of legs from an origin to a destination and with a single main purpose (Axhausen 2007). A trip leg is a continuous movement with one mode of transport which includes any waiting times (and transfer times, if applicable) immediately before or during that movement. Thus, multi-modal door-to-door trips have an origin and a destination, are composed of two or more modes, consist of two or more trip legs of which one is identified as the main trip leg, and at least one as an access or egress leg. We focus on exploring whether trip leg’s relative weight on the overall travel experience varies as a function of trip composition (trips with access, main and egress stages, and with main and either access or egress), trip complexity (two, three and four or more legs), the duration of the trip legs (both waiting and in-vehicle/walking times), in regard to different combinations of transit modes (metro, train and bus), for trips with and without transfers and for different trip purposes (commuting and non-commuting). Using a modest sample size, this study deepens and expands the very limited knowledge on door-to-door trips (Susilo and Cats 2014; Ettema et al. 2016) and on the aggregation of retrospective multi-episode experiences in the transport field. To the best of our knowledge, only Suzuki et al. (2014) explored this topic when they tested the goodness of fit of a number of rules for the last normal trip (i.e. without any disruption). Their analysis was limited to commuters and did not distinguish between in-vehicle and waiting times. Understanding how satisfaction with individual trip legs aggregates to the overall travel experience for different types of trips will enable stakeholders to identify which particular trip segment(s) need(s) to be improved. Therefore, it will allow practitioners to better evaluate the different parts of a trip and cater for travelers’ needs by supporting the allocation of resources and prioritization of measures. In addition, this research will allow making a more fair assessment of public transport operators’ roles in contributing to overall travel satisfaction when different stages of the trip are provided by different operators. In order to address the abovementioned issues, we first provide a review on how travel satisfaction is conceptualized, measured and previous findings on its underlying determinants in “Literature review”. “Satisfaction aggregation rules” details the satisfaction aggregation measures used in this study. This is followed by a description of survey design and independent variables in “Survey description”. Results of the analysis are then provided in “Analysis and results” including the estimation of: the overall aggregated experience, of multivariate travel satisfaction models, of correlation analyses between overall and leg specific satisfaction evaluations and of generalized aggregation models. In “Discussion” and “Conclusion”, discussion and conclusions are presented, respectively.",28

Shires,Manuel Ojeda-Cabral,Mark Wardman,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Train services are from time to time disrupted due to essential engineering work undertaken for the purposes of maintaining and upgrading the railway infrastructure. Whilst fairly uncommon on any specific route, they are routine across the rail network. This paper reports research which investigated the extent to which various features of such planned engineering-based disruptions impact on rail demand, both at the time of the disruption and in the longer term, providing some original insights in an important area where there are few previous studies.Footnote 1 When engineering blockades occur, railway operators generally still have a responsibility to convey passengers and they can meet this obligation in one of two ways: A bus replacement is offered. This might be for the entire journey, involving extended journey times, or for part of the journey. The latter would additionally involve one or two transfers between bus and train depending upon where in the journey the bus replacement occurs. Trains are diverted via another route, make additional stops or are retimed, all extending travel times, or frequencies are reduced by cancelling some departures. Bus replacement is usually an inferior option for both travellers and operators due to the higher incremental costs for each (e.g. interchange penalty for travellers and bus hire for operators). Unfortunately, bus replacement is inevitably the most common measure. Many engineering blockades occur overnight and the rail travelling public is not even aware of them. Others impact upon late night and early morning services when very few are travelling. The vast majority of major engineering works occur on a Sunday with some covering the entire weekend. Nonetheless, disruptions can have extended periods, such as those stemming from route electrification or major station and track improvements. There is though, a tendency to avoid engineering works in periods when the rail network is more heavily used, such as weekdays, and to concentrate efforts over public holidays when fewer routine journeys are being made. In contrast, unplanned disruptions associated with extreme weather, vandalism, accidental damage to lines and power supplies, security issues, some forms of industrial action and indeed overrunning engineering work tend to be less common but extend over a prolonged period. Whilst inherently unpredictable, an unplanned disruption that has an ongoing impact essentially has the same features as a planned disruption once travellers become aware of it.Footnote 2 There are a range of possible immediate behavioural responses to engineering-based disruptions. Those who are aware of the disruption in advance might continue with the planned rail journey, either using the modified service or else using other stations or routes that are not affected, make the journey on another day or travel to another destination. What does affect rail revenue is when rail travellers instead choose to travel by another mode or do not make the journey. Those who are unaware of the disruption can in principle exhibit each of the aforementioned immediate behavioural responses although they can be expected to be more constrained to the modified rail service and available alternative routes and stations. It is worth noting that the responses described above relate to options faced by travellers’ making non-rail journeys (Marsden et al. 2016b), for example when faced with a disruption to their travel or an activity a person must decide whether to: (1) continue with that journey/activity; (2) change their destination/activity; (3) continue with the same transport mode/route; (4) reschedule the journey activity; or (5) cancel the journey/activity. As such this paper positions itself within the general literature on disruption, not just rail. Returning to the impact of planned engineering disruption, it is conceivable that there are also longer term demand impacts, for a number of reasons: Those who sample other modes or undertake other activities as a result of a disruption might indeed decide to continue with them even in the absence of disruptions. Experience or awareness of weekend engineering disruptions might instil a wariness that dissuades some from planning future weekend rail journeys. A bad or worse than expected experience during a disruption might increase the propensity to switch from rail on future disrupted journeys. This might particularly apply to those who were unaware of the planned disruptions beforehand. Prolonged disruptions might lead to high levels of frustration and dissatisfaction that induce a transfer from rail more generally. A poor experience may also be relayed to family, friends and peers, with potentially adverse influences on their likelihood to travel by rail. Hence the longer term demand impacts might relate to specific ongoing journeys that were disrupted or to potential future rail travel more generally. Quantifying them is difficult and made more so by other background changes such as changing jobs, moving house etc. The scope of the research reported here was planned disruptions due to routineFootnote 3 engineering works. It does not cover regular commuters since routine engineering works occur mostly at the weekend, commuters are hardly likely to switch out of rail in the long run in the event of anything other than major ongoing disruptions beyond the scope of this study, and, at least in the British context, season ticket holders are reimbursed in the event of planned disruptions. The passenger demand forecasting handbook (PDFH) has, since its inception in 1986, contained an incremental forecasting framework and associated demand parameters that are recommended for use in the rail industry in Great Britain (ATOC 2013). It is a unique document amongst railway administrations worldwide. It is regularly updated with a synthesis of best available evidence and since version 4 in 2002 has contained guidance for forecasting the impact of engineering work, initially informed by research reported by Steer Davies Gleave (1995) and with Steer Davies Gleave (2006) providing the most recent insights. However, the PDFH evidence base is now a little dated and, as discussed in section “Background”, has a number of limitations which the research reported here aimed to address. Furthermore, there is very little published research on the impact of planned disruptions on rail demand.Footnote 4,Footnote 5 This investigation aimed to advance understanding in this area by exploring: the differential effects of bus replacements and rail diversions, and in the former case the impact of the amount of connection time and whether connections are guaranteed; the impact of awareness of planned disruptions, which will have increased over time; the effects of different lengths of disruption and of ongoing disruptions; whether the behavioural change estimates differ between reported responses to actual past disruptions and stated intentions regarding hypothetical future disruptions; how behavioural responses vary by flow type, distance and journey purpose; differences between the immediate impact and the longer term demand consequences of planned disruptions. The structure of the paper is as follows. Section “Background” discusses why the research reported here is important and warranted. The methodology is set out in section “Methodology”, distinguishing between immediate and long run impacts, whilst section “Data collection and key characteristics” discusses the surveys and the key features of the data collected. The analysis of the immediate behavioural responses is reported in section “Immediate impacts” followed by forecasting applications in section “Forecasting immediate run effects”. Section “Forecasting longer term demand impacts” deals with the longer term demand impacts with concluding remarks and recommendations provided in section “Conclusions”.",15

As millennials are approaching their prime spending years, their progressive attitudes towards ownership have supported the evolution of the sharing economy and the emergence of services such as Airbnb and Zipcar. Capitalizing on this and technological development, the ‘as-a-service’ era has started to render traditional business models obsolete. Keeping up with this trend, the transport sector is evolving towards the ‘Mobility as a Service’ (MaaS) concept. MaaS aims to restructure the mobility distribution chain, by creating mobility operators who integrate all the offerings of providers and supply them to users as a single service. A digital platform creates and manages trips which users can pay for via a single account. A core part of MaaS is giving users the option to purchase MaaS products, such as monthly subscription plans, which best fit their needs (Hietenan 2016). These subscriptions include a certain amount of each transportation service (e.g. public transport, bike sharing, car sharing, taxi) and are similar to other service bundles, such as mobile phone plans, where the user pays one price for the combination of a variety of service elements. Bundling products is not a new concept and is a frequently used method to increase consumer acceptance and aid diffusion of currently underutilized products and services. In a similar way, MaaS products could bundle less popular modes, such as bike sharing and car sharing together with public transport, with the hope that this will result in increased uptake of these modes. As such, MaaS can be viewed as a soft mobility management tool, which aims to ‘repackage’ the way travel services are presented to users and thus alter the way they are perceived by individuals (Headicar 2009). If MaaS could aid an increase in the uptake of shared modes, it could have a number of positive impacts. Many studies have shown evidence that both bike and car sharing significantly reduce private vehicle use and VMT (Vehicle Miles Travelled; Fishman et al. 2014; Martin et al. 2010). In many cases, when individuals who own a private vehicle start using shared services they end up selling their vehicles (Fishman et al. 2014; Shaheen et al. 2009). An even more important, long-term impact is that, if younger generations who do not currently own a vehicle are able to solve all their door to door journeys without one (for example, with a combination of public transport and car sharing), they may delay or abandon purchasing a vehicle in the long run. As a result, shared services lead to a significant reduction in GHG emissions (Martin et al. 2010; Chen and Kockelman 2016) and bike sharing in particular, to a number of health benefits (Woodcock et al. 2014). However, as the current MaaS implementations are limited, there is little evidence, that MaaS could actually be used as a mobility management tool to influence people’s uptake of shared modes. The most advanced applications to date, where MaaS ‘product bundles’ are used, are the Ubigo field trial, and Whim, the product of MaaS Global. The first MaaS pilot, the Ubigo project, carried out a MaaS field trial in Goethenburg, Sweden (Sochor et al. 2016). In this project, personalized combinations and amounts of public transport, car sharing, bike sharing and car rentals were offered in prepaid tailored monthly plans. During the trial, users showed an increase in both bike and car sharing and a decrease in private vehicle use (Sochor et al. 2016). The first commercial MaaS product is Whim, offered by MaaS Global. Whim is now fully operational in Helsinki, is expanding to the West Midlands (UK) and Amsterdam (Netherlands). They have proposed various approaches for bundling mobility services into a MaaS product. For example, some of their publications indicate that they are in favor of plans that are tailored to different socio-demographic groups (families, students etc.) (Hietenan 2016). However, there is no study about how these could impact potential uptake of new modes. This minimal evidence leaves space for further research into MaaS bundle’s role in aiding the uptake of shared services. Against this background, this paper aims to present initial research into the possible role MaaS could have as a mobility management tool to promote currently underutilized modes. The method used is based on stated preference survey data analysis, as such can be completed in areas where there are currently no MaaS applications. This allows researchers and the industry to gain insights into this up and coming phenomenon, prior to large-scale implementations. In order to do this, we use data from an original survey, specifically designed to study individual preferences of- and the effect that- MaaS bundles can have. First, using this information, a MaaS bundle choice model is developed to identify which modes the individuals in our sample would and would not prefer in their MaaS plans. This will help us understand preferences for the different shared modes. Next, a second bundle choice model is developed with only those individuals who indicated that they would be interested in actually purchasing their chosen MaaS plan (not just indicating their preference among the options). By comparing the results of the two models, we can investigate whether the preferences found in the initial model remain consistent for those who would actually purchase their bundle. Finally, we examine whether those individuals who would purchase their MaaS plan would start using shared modes as a result of their MaaS plans and how this would affect the overall use of shared modes. The paper is structured as follows. Section “Literature” provides a literature review of mobility management and bundling to set the context of the paper. Section Survey design and data describes the survey and data used for the paper, while section “Methodology for bundle choice models” gives a brief overview of the methods used for the bundle choice models. Section “Model estimation results and discussion” provides the analysis and section “Conclusions” concludes and outlines next steps and further research.",93

The fiercely competitive development of digital and autonomous technologies is enabling new travel modes that may fundamentally change the way people move around in cities. Autonomous Mobility on Demand (AMoD) services (Pavone 2015) are one such MaaS solution that could allow autonomous vehicles (AV) to service ride-requests from customers on demand. These types of services may significantly improve urban mobility by providing a more efficient and safer transport while reducing the number of privately-owned vehicles (Heilig et al. 2017). However, there are many potential challenges in the successful implementation of these services. Among the most significant is the likely increase in congestion and pollution due to the vehicles’ dead-running (or re-balancing), when an empty vehicle is directed towards an area of higher demand to enhance its chance of picking up a passenger. Another important potential issue is passenger safety. Rather than the technology risks (which many prospective customers perceive as solvable) ‘stranger danger’ is perceived as a greater risk (MERGE Greenwich Consortium 2018). This includes the infringement of social rules, the invasion of privacy, and the threat to personal security due to travelling with strangers in a confined space. The final pressing issue is range and charge-infrastructure: when and where should possibly electric AMoD services recharge, for acceptable service levels, and what are the implications for the power network? The provision of effective AMoD services requires reconciliation of multiple competing parameters involving multiple stakeholder groups representing both infrastructure and mobility service providers. Consequently, commercial operators and city authorities fundamentally need tools capable of demand estimation and fleet simulation to enable a transparent assessment of the benefits and challenges of AMoD services. Demand estimation is an active field of research and practice, with alternative models currently being available in commercial software tools (such as PTV Group 2017; Department for Transport, Diadem 2012; Citilabs 2013). However, some of the software vendors have yet to address the topic. In the absence of an established commercial AMoD demand estimation solution and to avoid the limitations of existing tools, we decided to use an open-source, agent-based tool (Horni et al. 2016) which has already been used in similar studies (Hörl 2017; Maciejewski and Bischoff 2015). This research presents a comprehensive simulation approach to study the deployment of a ride-share AMoD service. Our approach couples a demand simulation model (built in MATSim) with a fully featured fleet simulation engine: IMSim, the Intelligent Mobility Simulator. This combination uniquely enables the study of a broad variety of mobility services with very detailed specifications, taking a realistic multi-agent demand model into consideration. It allows both commercial operators and city authorities to evaluate the impact that AMoD will have on the mobility ecosystem (with or without ride-sharing). For example, city authorities can use this tool to study the interplay between demand mode shift and prospective AMoD scheme. In contrast, commercial operators can study how best to tailor their offering to the customer market, and better understand the potential business opportunities arising from variations in the service features. These include, but are not limited to, the following: a multi-tiered service implementing service variations including fuel type [e.g. Electric Vehicles (EV) vs. Internal Combustion Engine (ICE)], seating capacity, and vehicle specification (e.g. no frills minibuses to executive vehicles); and a heterogeneous customer base with different sensitivities to wait and detour times, and different loading and unloading times (e.g. the impatient business person versus the wheelchair customer).",24

This is because such composite terms have a number of attractions at both the estimation and application stages. These include overcoming estimation problems due to co-linearity between or lack of variation in the constituent variables,Footnote 1 introducing the potentially desirable feature that the elasticities to the constituent variables depend upon the proportion they form of the composite term, supporting a consistent approach to forecasting and economic appraisal, reducing concerns about the use of constituent elasticities for large proportionate changes, and avoiding the problems in consumer surplus measurement where a constituent variable, such as fare under a concessionary scheme, is zero. Searle (1978) justified its use on the grounds that “it results in better practice than its more simple alternatives” and that “we [should not] overlook the commonsense virtues of generalised cost”. Nonetheless, one possible reason why GC is used is because ‘it has always been used’, and we here contend that its potential limitations have been forgotten, overlooked or indeed not appreciated. This paper not only raises the question of whether the use of GC in demand models is justified but provides some empirically based answers. Bruzelius (1981) contends that the “articles (Grey 1978a, b; Goodwin 1978; Searle 1978) demonstrate that there is a considerable lack of understanding in the profession”. We contend that this is still the case with regard to GC. Although the GC formulation is widely adopted, it imposes properties without any explicit testing of whether they are empirically justified. This has long been recognised (Jones 1977; Grey 1978a). Indeed, Grey (1978a) stated that, “The principal restriction is that the ratio of the rates of change of demand Q with respect to any two independent variables Ci, Cj is not fixed directly by empirical evidence, but by the predetermined generalised cost specification”. The GC approach forces the implied constituent elasticities to exhibit large cross-sectional variations according to the make-up of GC on different journeys and an increase (reduction) in time (cost) related elasticities, all other things equal, as monetary values increase over time with income growth.Footnote 2 Moreover, it is implicitly assumed that the value of time used in appraisal can be taken to be appropriate for demand forecasting. A different approach, and one used by the rail industry in Great Britain, is to merge the time related aspects (journey time, frequency and interchange)Footnote 3 into a single variable, termed generalised journey time (GJT), but to maintain fare as a separate term. We term this the GJT-Fare approach. This approach also forces elasticity variation, given that the elasticities of the component variables of GJT will vary with the proportion that they form of GJT. Whilst this might not be justified, and indeed was addressed in Wardman (1994), the formulation of the GJT function is not the focus of this paper. Finally, what might be regarded as the conventional economics approach would be to enter into the demand model separately each of the key attributes regarded to influence demand. We term this the separate components (SC) approach. We note that it invariably characterises the very extensive discrete choice modelling literature. The SC approach is here covered to demonstrate the potential for further disaggregation of the components of GJT, and for reference and interest given that we can estimate it, but its most appropriate formulation is not the focus of this paper. The railway industry in Great Britain has available very large amounts of ticket sales data which provide a reasonably accurate account of rail travel between very many stations over numerous years. Whilst rail fares exhibit variation over time, just as the costs of other modes do, a key attraction is that rail routes can also exhibit variations in the timetable related service quality attributes of journey time, frequency and interchange. This then supports modelling opportunities not otherwise possible which we here exploit to test a number of important hypotheses. As Bruzelius (1981), summarising Searle (1978), concluded: “the use of generalised cost has to be based on [the claim that] travel demand functions in terms of generalised costs seem to be working better than other types of travel demand models”. Specifically, the aims of the research reported here are to test: whether the GC approach of standard transport planning provides a better explanation of rail travel demand than the standard rail industry GJT and fare approach or indeed an approach that specifies separate elasticities to each component of GC; whether the elasticities to GJT and fare implied by the GC approach can be empirically justified; whether variations over time and across routes in the GJT and fare elasticities implied by the GC formulation are empirically justified; the appropriate values of time to adopt conditional upon the use of the GC approach. In short, is generalised cost justified in travel demand analysis? The research findings here discussed are both original and significant because, as far as we aware, there has been no explicit and detailed testing of the ‘hypotheses’ set out in “The opportunity and aims” section along with GC being a dominant formulation worldwide where transport planning and appraisal is practised. It is important to know whether GC is empirically valid because of the fact that GC is consistent with conventional microeconomic demand theory if and only if the willingness to pay to save travel time is not a function of real income (Bruzelius 1981). In addition to insights of a methodological nature, we also provide a range of results that are of broader interest for the purposes of forecasting, benchmarking and interpretation in the passenger rail market. In terms of the scope of the research reported here, which is primarily concerned with the validity of the GC approach, we make a number of important points largely stemming from its originality. We aim to understand these fundamentals of GC as currently used in practice but with a view to developing this investigation to address more complex issues. Firstly, we have not considered ‘flexible’ functional forms where the GC, GJT and SC formulations might through appropriate parameterisation approximate each other. The analysis reported here is couched very much in the tradition of these approaches, that is, characterised by constant elasticities to GC, GJT and Fare, and the SC variables. The analysis of more flexible functions is a separate study in its own right. Secondly, the analysis could have been extended to the direct estimation of a wider range of weights used in the composite GJT terms. We are though of the view that this would not materially add to or alter the findings presented here. Again, this is a separate study beyond the scope of the significant issues this paper aims to address. Thirdly, and related to the previous point, our focus here is on comparing the GC and GJT-Fare approaches on the grounds that the latter is dominant in the rail industry in Britain and serves as a sound empirical basis to test the former whereas the robust estimation of each of the SC elements to provide a firm basis of comparison is a much more challenging task. Finally, we have not addressed dynamic behavioural responses. In part, this is because two of the three data sets available to us cover only a few years. But more importantly, the analysis of dynamic effects would cloud our investigations and add an element of complexity in terms of the relationships explored that would not contribute to answering the important hypotheses set out in “The opportunity and aims” section. The structure of the paper is as follows. “The candidate model formulations” section provides background discussion covering the competing demand model formulations. “What insights on expected elasticity variation are provided by existing evidence?” section considers the insights that are provided by review study evidence into the elasticity variation here being examined whilst the rail ticket sales data used in our analysis are described in “Data used in analysis” section. “Model specification” section sets out the candidate models to be evaluated and examines whether fixed or random effects models are more appropriate to our investigations. The main empirical findings and tests of hypotheses are contained in “Empirical findings” section and concluding remarks are provided in “Conclusions” section.",7

Parents face the challenge to meet the ever-increasing job performance criteria, nowadays with decreasing job security. They need to generate sufficient income to be able to pay for a house, buy a (second) car and support their children, knowing that the costs of daycare (in the study area: The Netherlands) are virtually equal to minimum income levels. They need to invest time in raising and parenting their children, spend time on running their household and find the time to escort their children to school, day care and various sports and leisure activities. They feel the pressure to spend quality time as a family. And, last but not least, they need to free the time to meet with their social network, both personally and as a family, and get engaged in personal recreational and leisure activities to have a moment for themselves to recuperate from all those activities, tasks and errands when often they do not have much choice as others dictate the timing and rhythm of their daily lives, certainly during weekdays. An abundant volume of literature in sociology, social psychology, education research, health studies, spatial sciences and travel behavior research has examined different facets of this problem, including subjective well-being, health, financial aspects, children education and their development path to independence. Travel behavior research and urban planning/geography have studied how the spatial distribution of activity locations, jointly with institutional regulations and the multimodal transportation system offer opportunities and at the same time enforce space–time constraints affecting how personal and household activities are manifested in time and space. The decision problem of households is how to realize their needs and desires, considering their job and other commitments, within the space–time action space that defines time-dependent choice options and the travel options they have available, which also discriminate options in time and space (Rasouli and Timmermans 2014a, b, c; Liao et al. 2014). Institutional constraints strongly limit the time windows to conduct particular activities and influence the start and end times of other discretionary activities. Some jobs involve fixed work schedules as they are organized in work shifts. Even if workers have flex hours, meetings that come with uncertain end times characterize their jobs, adding to the complexity of the household activity scheduling process. Workers may feel pressure, as they cannot afford canceling meeting requests or leaving early too often. At the same time, school start time hours are fixed and even though schools may have facilities and programs for extracurricular school care, parents have to pay for it and still need to pick up their kids at a certain time at the latest. Day care centers have similar arrangements. As a final example, children and/or parents may be engaged in voluntary or leisure activities in the evening that involve particular pre-arranged time slots and therefore influence the available time window to prepare and have dinner, getting ready for such activities and going to the activity location. If multiple individuals are involved with different time slots and different activity locations, travel arrangements may become problematic. If this is not complicated enough, in cities and regions with highly congested transportation systems, parents also need to cope with the uncertainty that comes with travel times. While there is always a remote chance of accidents, cancellation of public transport services or the car breaking down, it is unlikely that parents take this into consideration when arranging their daily schedule. On the other hand, structural variability in travel times is learned. Parents become aware of it and dependent on their risk attitudes make choices under uncertainty (Schwanen and Ettema 2009; Rasouli and Timmermans 2014d). They may have arranged fallback security protocols for such situations such as a parent or friend picking up the child, but not everyone has family living nearby while friends may be in the same predicament. Because one or both parents may need to travel substantial distance, especially for such dual-earner households, the potential negative aspects of their risky decisions may be substantial. Timmermans et al. (1992) found that dual-earner households tend to reach a balance where the job preferences of the male tend to dominate his job location choice whereas females tend to have more to say about the choice of residential location which tend to be closer to her job location. It is one means of limiting the probability of these extreme situations to happen. The literature on task allocation in (dual earner) households has devoted a lot of attention to task allocation and school travel. Although differences between results of these studies can be observed, they share some regularities. First, there is substantial evidence that parents’ travel patterns and children’s travel to school are synchronized (e.g., McDonald and Aalborg 2009; Deka 2013; Hsu and Saphores 2014; Colley and Buliung 2017). School start times and departure times of work commutes tend to be correlated (e.g., Fox et al. 2015; Deka 2017; Mehdizadeh et al. 2016); Ehteshamrad et al. 2017a, b) unless fixed work schedules preclude such synchronization. This correlation tends to be weaker when children become older and therefore more independent, and when the built environment, distance to school and general safety in the area are inducive to children traveling independently without any escort (e.g., Fyhri et al. 2011; Giles-Corti et al. 2011; Elias and Katoshevski-Cavari 2014; Mitra and Buliung 2014; Lin and Chang 2010; Pojani and Boussauw 2014; Lopes et al. 2014; Lam and Loo 2014; Kyttä et al. 2015). Meanwhile, the spatial synchronization, such as location of parents’ work place and school, also affect parent’s escorting activity (e.g., He 2013; He and Giuliano 2017; Ermagun and Levinson 2016). For instance, He (2013) showed that the probability of a child being escorted by parents will increase with decreasing distance from the mother’s workplace to school. Second, although variables such as parental employment status, work hours and flexibility of work hours (e.g., Vovsha and Petersen 2005; Yarlagadda and Srinivasan 2008; Gupta et al. 2014) and the age of the child and parent (e.g., Tetali et al. 2016; Scheiner 2016) significantly affect the propensity of escorting children to school or day care, gender seems the most dominant factor explaining escorting behavior. Ceteris paribus, children tend to be more escorted by their mothers than fathers (e.g. Fyhri and Hjorthol 2009; Barker 2011; Ekert-Jaffé 2011; Scheiner and Holz-Rau 2012, 2017; Hjorthol and Vagane 2014; Bernardo et al. 2015; Motte-Baumvol et al. 2017). This gender difference is not only clearly noticeable in the tendency to escort children and the time spent with children, but also in experienced stress and subjective well-being (e.g., Offer 2014; Feng and Boyle 2014). Although our knowledge of escorting behavior and task allocation decisions in (dual-earner) households has accumulated substantially, a limitation of these empirical studies and the associated mathematical models of group decision making (e.g., Zhang et al. 2002, 2005; Bradley and Vovsha 2005; Gliebe and Koppelman 2005; Srinivasan and Bhat 2006; Ermagun and Levinson 2016; see Ho and Mulley 2015 for a recent overview) is their exclusive focus on single escorting events. Turn taking behavior has not been considered explicitly with one exception (Ettema and Van der Lippe 2009). Turn taking behavior may manifest itself in multiple ways. One of the parents may drop off the child at school or daycare while the other parent is picking up the child. If not enforced by work schedules, this decision strategy freezes up some flexibility for one of the parents on that specific day. This routine may also be induced by parents’ opinions about parenting. An alternative turn taking strategy is to share the responsibility of escorting for different days of the week. In this case, if parents are not forced to enact this strategy, it creates more flexibility for one of the parents for a full day, and may also offer some mental relief in that a parent is released from the responsibility of being on time at school/day care. Finally, turn taking behavior may be reflected in a pattern that one of the parents takes the responsibility of escorting during weekdays (working days), while the other parent is responsible for escorting during the weekend (non-working days). If the non-working days coincide with the weekend, this pattern will likely involve different activities of the child such as escorting the child to training or sports matches or other out-of-home leisure activities. To enhance our knowledge of turn taking behavior, the current paper reports the results of a series of analyses about the prevalence and covariates of different turn taking strategies in the context of escorting children to school and other activities. The study is empirical in nature and attempt to identify tendencies in turn taking behavior. In particular, it reports the results of an analysis of turn taking behavior on the same day of the week, and the results of an analysis of taking turns for different working days. A multinomial logit model, which predicts the probability of a particular turn taking strategy, relative to other task allocation strategy is estimated. The other strategies differ between the two analyses because their prevalence depends partly on the turn taking strategy. We report estimated coefficients and their significance and for easier interpretation the associated probabilities of choosing a particular strategy. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. First, we document the data collection and discuss sample characteristics.

A travel behaviour market segmentation using Goal framing theory,February 2020,Gustav Bösehans,Ian Walker,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Attempts to steer travel mode choice towards more sustainable alternatives are often complicated by the fact that not all people necessarily share the same preferences, making intervention difficult (Anable 2005). People may hold contrary perceptions or attitudes (e.g. public transport as too crowded and unreliable versus public transport as opportunity for pleasant encounters or to relax; Beirão and Cabral 2007) and may place a different emphasis on travel aspects such as comfort, independence or practicality (Gardner and Abraham 2007; Rubens et al. 2011). Indeed, the idea that different travellers hold different attitudes and/or preferences is common. With the aim to more effectively influence peoples’ travel behaviour, policy makers and researchers alike have thus acknowledged the need to unveil the differing motivations underlying travellers’ modal practices and have done so by conducting various travel behaviour market segmentations (Jensen 1999; Kaufmann 2000). Travel behaviour market segmentations aim to classify the population into distinct groups of travellers based on the assumption that different ‘mobility styles’ (Barr and Prillwitz 2012) can be distinguished based on attitudinal, demographic and/or travel-related information (e.g. Diana and Mokhtarian 2009; Pronello and Camusso 2011). Often involving a combination of travellers’ motives (e.g. affective instrumental and symbolic motives; Cools et al. 2009), worldviews (e.g. eco-centric versus techno-centric values; Barr and Prillwitz 2012) or attitudes (e.g. towards the environment or particular modes of travel, such as the car or cycling; Anable 2005; Jensen 1999), various such segmentations have now been conducted with general population samples to find subtypes of people who either use a particular mode (e.g. car) or a combination of modes. The bulk of segmentation research to date has considered specific travel mode users, including cyclists (Bergstrom and Magnusson 2003; Dill and McNeil 2013; Zhibin et al. 2013), car drivers and public transport users (Anable 2005; Beirão and Cabral 2008; Cools et al. 2009; Jensen 1999; Krizek and El-Geneidy 2007; Pronello and Rappazzo 2010). Similar efforts have been undertaken with more specific target groups such as day-trip travellers (Anable 2005) or tourists (Dolnicar 2002), including comparisons between daily versus short-break or holiday travel (Barr and Prillwitz 2012). While this has shed light on the differing motivations of particular types of mode users and contextual factors, it has not addressed a primary deficiency of previous segmentation work, which is how traveller segments have been conceptualized on a theoretical basis. To a large extent, segmentation research to date has occurred independently, lacking both a unifying theory and a thorough integration of findings. Consequently, any further travel behaviour market segmentations may contribute only moderately to the existing body of literature. It follows that a theoretical integration of the findings from previous travel behaviour market segmentation research is long overdue. In prominent segmentation research to date, traveller types have been defined predominantly using a mixture of attitudinal variables that arguably lacks a coherent focus. Variables range from preferences towards particular modes of travel (e.g. “I like travelling in a car”; Anable 2005), to preferences regarding specific travel characteristics (e.g. the importance attributed to travel speed, cost and comfort; Pronello and Camusso 2011), perceived symbolic aspects (e.g. “The car is a symbol of independence”; Jensen 1999), normative beliefs (Krueger et al. 2016) or views of nature (e.g. “The Earth is like a spaceship, with limited room and resources”; Barr and Prillwitz 2012), to name a few. While this in itself may not be problematic, other than reducing the comparability between segment solutions, including people’s modal (behavioural) choices in the definition of segments may be (e.g. Anable 2005; Barr and Prillwitz 2012; Beirão and Cabral 2008; Cools et al. 2009; Jensen 1999; Krueger et al. 2016). Labels such as “Complacent Car Addicts” versus “Malcontented Motorists” (Anable 2005) and “Cyclists/Public Transport Users of Convenience” versus “Cyclists/Public Transport Users of Necessity” (Jensen 1999) are abundant in previous segmentation research, suggesting that different types of users can be distinguished within a single mode, such as the car or public transport. However, all of the aforementioned traveller type definitions included mode labels, whereas it may be more appropriate to conceptualize traveller types based on their goals or preferences independent of their current mode choice (see Pronello and Camusso 2011). Why this may be preferable might best be illustrated in an important observation made by Anable (2005) being that “the same behaviour can take place for different reasons and that the same attitudes can lead to different behaviours” (p. 65). Thus, in the context of travel mode choice, the critical assumption being made is that not only may individuals choose a particular travel mode based on different goals or attitudes (e.g. cycling because it is fun, cheap, good for the environment, provides exercise or any combination of those), but also that despite sharing an identical set of goals or attitudes—whether it be the cost, convenience, comfort, travel time or the ecological footprint of their travel—people may actually end up using entirely different modes of transportation. This, in turn, may be primarily due to contextual factors, first and foremost the built environment, such as available infrastructure or the location of home and workplace, which may facilitate—yet not necessarily determine—some modal choices while impeding others (Næss 2015). Crucially, this calls into question the inclusion of mode in the definition of traveller types, as the latter arguably is neither particularly revealing regarding people’s overarching goals nor necessarily with regard to their immediate local context. To date, however, little to no segmentation research has established traveller profiles independent of people’s mode choices, although there are exceptions, such as the work of Pronello and Camusso (2011) who strived “to define homogeneous travellers’ groups based only on attitudinal variables, regardless of the behaviour in terms of mode and trip purpose” (p. 1297) or the work of Jacques et al. (2013) who extended the captive versus choice user distinction (e.g. Beimborn et al. 2003) by adding trip practicality as an additional dimension to trip satisfaction. While this research has been insightful, there is a critical element that is still missing: a sound theoretical basis for distinguishing those supra-modal and context-independent traveller types. The potential for psychological theory and market segmentation to be combined has been illustrated by Anable (2005), who used theory of planned behaviour (TPB; Ajzen 1991) constructs in her work. However, the latter model’s focus on behaviour being seen as the outcome of behavioural intentions that are determined by attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control—may be strongly undermined by contextual factors and habit (Pronello and Camusso 2011). Indeed, there is now ample evidence to suggest that modal choice is largely not a rational process (Innocenti et al. 2013; Lois and López-Sáez 2009; Steg 2005; Thomas 2014). Ajzen (2015) himself noted that behavioural, normative and control beliefs may be based on invalid or selective information. Extensions of the TPB have taken factors such as habit and environmental concern into account (Donald et al. 2014), although some have argued that these kinds of extensions have obscured the theory beyond recognition (Sniehotta et al. 2014). For the purpose of the current study, we do not intend to question the utility of the TPB as a general framework to predict intentions and behaviour, but we do question its utility for the classification of traveller types. Specifically, we argue that traveller types should be defined not in terms of TPB constructs, but based on overarching goals. A different theoretical framework may thus be needed with, Goal framing theory (GFT; Lindenberg and Steg 2007, 2013; Steg et al. 2014a, 2016) being a promising contester. Rather than conceptualizing people’s behaviour as a result of the interplay between attitudes, norms and control beliefs, GFT (Lindenberg and Steg 2007, 2013) suggests that information processing and behaviour are guided by three overarching goals: hedonic goals which reflect the desire ‘to feel better right now’, gain goals which refer to the management of one’s resources, as well as normative goals which include information on how to ‘act appropriately’. At any given moment in time, a different goal or combination of goals may be activated or ‘focal’ building the ‘goal frame’. The activated goal frame subsequently determines which information is attended to, how behavioural options are perceived and finally which action will be taken. As there is currently no validated instrument available to measure people’s situationally dependent goal frames directly, they are approximated through measuring values. That is, it is argued that, in addition to situational factors, which goals become activated in the first place strongly depends on people’s values, which are thought to affect the chronic strength of goals (Steg et al. 2016). Values serve as guiding principles in people’s lives (Rokeach 1973) and “because values are fairly stable, they render some goals chronically stronger than others” (Steg et al. 2016, p. 185). Which goal frame tends to be dominant for any one given individual, across situations, may thus best be determined by measuring people’s values instead. Four types of values are distinguished (Steg et al. 2014b), each relating to one of the three (situationally dependent) goals. People who endorse altruistic and biospheric values share a strong concern for the welfare of other human beings (altruistic), on the one hand, and for the quality of nature and the environment (biospheric), on the other hand. Both are considered self-transcendence values, as they focus on the collective interest, and are thus related to the normative goal. In contrast, hedonic and egoistic values focus on the gratification of personal interests, such as pleasure and enjoying life (hedonic) or social power and wealth (egoistic). Consequently, they are considered self-enhancement values and are thought to affect the chronic strength of hedonic and gain goals, respectively. Frequently, especially with regard to pro-environmental behaviour, goals conflict, as people tend to be very sensitive to the hedonic consequences of their actions (Mann and Abraham 2006; Steg et al. 2014a, b). That is, they try to avoid situations which may involve extra effort and tend to choose the most convenient alternative of behaviour. This has an especially detrimental effect on pro-environmental behaviour which is often costly in terms of time or effort. For costly (pro-environmental) behaviours, such as transport mode choice (e.g. driving versus using public transport), utility aspects (gain goal: e.g. “I’ll be faster if I drive”) and anticipated affective consequences (hedonic goal: e.g. “Driving is more convenient than taking the bus”), frequently outweigh normative goals (e.g. “Taking the bus is less harmful to the environment”). However, goals can also reinforce each other. When gain and hedonic goals support the normative goal (e.g. “Taking the bus is faster and more convenient than driving”), the likelihood for sustainable behaviour to be performed may increase (De Groot and Steg 2009). At this point, the reader may wonder why choose GFT rather than any other theoretical framework for travel behaviour market segmentation? The answer is simple: GFT’s focus on the relative strength of (chronic) goals including hedonic goals (affect), gain goals (resource management) and normative goals (environment) suggests it bears high potential to feed into travel behaviour market segmentation analyses since ultimately, all travel is for something, if only the intrinsic satisfaction of movement. Unlike other (pro-environmental) behaviours such as recycling, which most people may do primarily because it is the right thing to do (normative goal) rather than for egoistic interests (gain goal) or because it is fun (hedonic goal), travel behaviour may involve any combination of the three overarching goals (see also Steg 2005). That is, apart from gain goals related to the management of one’s resources (e.g. instrumental aspects such as cost and travel time), travel behaviour is also strongly related to hedonic goals (e.g. comfort, convenience, joy and effort) and normative goals (e.g. environmental protection). Hedonic goals, for instance, may be reflected in the journey-based affect that people anticipate from their travel mode choice (Anable 2005; Mann and Abraham 2006), whereas goals that are related to the management or improvement of one’s resources may be reflected in the practicality (e.g. cost, time and effort) of people’s current travel behaviour (Jacques et al. 2013). Finally, attitudes towards the environment or the benefits of sustainable travel (Anable 2005; Barr and Prillwitz 2012) may be expected to translate into normative goals (i.e. doing the right thing). The huge potential of GFT can also be observed when applied retrospectively to existing segmentation research (see Table 9 in “Appendix” for an initial summary). Consider Anable’s (2005) ‘Die Hard Drivers’ or ‘Aspiring Environmentalists’. The former appear strongly guided by hedonic goals (i.e. great pleasure in driving paired with a high attachment to the car), whereas the latter may primarily adhere to normative goals (i.e. high environmental concern and relatively low attachment to the car). This illustrative example suggests that combining segments and theory in this way, a more adaptive and theory-based travel behaviour market segmentation scheme may be developed. We suggest the three goal frames may provide a parsimonious way to replace the various attitudinal variables that have been used in previous segmentation research. That is, GFT may add a theoretical element to travel behaviour market segmentation research which has largely been a-theoretical until the present day. Following in the footsteps of Pronello and Camusso (2011), the present study thus sought to derive goal-based preference profiles, while examining their transcendence across modes. That is, we tested whether segmenting travellers solely based on their individual preferences corresponding to the three overarching goals, irrespective of their current mode choice or travel behaviour per se, would converge with the findings of past research. Critically, however, the present study offers a theoretical integration of current and past segmentation research, using goal framing theory as a unifying theory. Needless to say, this may also have implications for the targeting and design of interventions, which will be elaborated further in the “Discussion” section. In addition to values and a standard measure of satisfaction, the factors chosen for segmentation represented commonly recognized travel aspects including the ‘three Cs’ (comfort, convenience and cost in terms of money and travel time; Chatterton et al. 2009), as well as effort (Stradling 2002), environment (Anable 2005) and independence (Jensen 1999). In line with Goal framing theory (Lindenberg and Steg 2007), the choice of travel related factors attempted to include gain goals referring to the management of one’s resources (i.e. cost, convenience and travel time), normative goals referring to the right course of action (environment), as well as hedonic goals referring to the desire to feel better right now (comfort and effort). A control aspect (independence) was added in line with previous research stressing the importance of autonomy (Jensen 1999; Mann and Abraham 2006; Thomas et al. 2014). The present study also included ratings of habit which has only rarely been measured in the context of travel behaviour market segmentation research (see Krizek and El-Geneidy 2007, for one exception). Considering that travel mode choice often involves a strong habitual component (Domarchi et al. 2008; Donald et al. 2014; Klöckner and Matthies 2004; Verplanken et al. 1997; Walker et al. 2014), including habit as an additional factor has the potential to improve taxonomies of different traveller types. In their recent work, Thomas and Walker (2015) illustrated that satisfaction and habit may vary significantly between mode users and thus may also be suitable to discriminate between traveller types. For the study, data from a large-scale quantitative survey was used to segment a sample of current staff and student commuters of the University of Bath (a middle-sized university in the UK) via cluster analysis.",10

Mass utility cycling would go some way to addressing the pressing issues facing modern urban societies such as an obesity epidemic, fatalities and serious injuries resulting from traffic crashes, local environmental degradation, social inequality and global climate change (Blue 2013; Macmillan et al. 2014; Pucher and Buehler 2016). Developing mobility alternatives that work in car-oriented urban areas is a particularly pertinent issue given the legacy of decentralisation and low density urban form (Mees 2010). 
This paper examines utility cycling in the dispersed city. ‘Utility cycling’ refers to trips made by bicycle for practical, transport purposes, for example to and from work, education, for shopping or to visit family and friends. This is as opposed to recreational cycling, which is undertaken purely for leisure or exercise. For the purposes of this study, the ‘dispersed city’ (Mees 2000) (also referred to as the ‘automobile city’ by Newman et al. 2016) describes urban centres of any size with car-oriented urban form and transport network design, together with high levels of car ownership and use. Due to common historical trends in transport development, specifically mass motorisation, the dispersed city refers principally to the North American, Australasian and European context, although it is also relevant to other parts of the world that have followed a similar urban planning trajectory. Countries with a majority of the population living in dispersed city urban fabric often have low levels of cycling, which is partly explained by the lack of cycling facilities and traffic-calmed streets and neighbourhoods (Mees 2010; Pucher and Buehler 2008). The focus of this paper is how utility cycling in the dispersed city can be increased from a low starting point through municipal cycling policy. It asks: What do cycling experts perceive to be the most effective measures that could be implemented at a municipal level to increase cycling mode share and improve real and perceived cycling safety in dispersed, low-cycling urban centres? A number of studies have been conducted into the effectiveness of municipal cycling policy, with a bias toward cycling conducive environments. Typically, there are two types of approach. The first type evaluates a single intervention or a more comprehensive analysis of municipal cycling policy in a particular setting, often in countries with existing high levels of cycling (such as Rietveld and Daniel 2004; Harms et al. 2014, 2016; Pucher and Buehler 2006, 2008). The second type focuses on a particular element of policy related to cycling, such as infrastructure, commuting, health or environmental conditions (including Jacobsen and Rutter 2012; Jones 2012; Macmillan et al. 2014; Nielsen et al. 2013; Schoner and Levinson 2014). Both of these approaches restrict the potential for generalisation due to the difficulty of applying the findings to different settings or to other areas of policy related to cycling. This study differs in that it allows potential for generalisation of the results in different dispersed city settings and across all parts of municipal cycling policy due to its theoretical standpoint and the Delphi methodology employed. Numerous studies have been carried out which set out the range of physical infrastructure interventions can be made to improve conditions for cycling (including Pucher and Buehler 2008; Pucher et al. 2010; Buehler and Dill 2015). This has been divided into those factors which increase the attractiveness of cycling (‘pull factors’) and those that decrease the attractiveness of alternatives to cycling (‘push factors’). In the context of this study, the latter refers principally to the reduction of travel by private automobile as opposed to public transport use, walking and other non-motorised modes. Measures designed to increase utility cycling mode share through programmes of non-infrastructural interventions are promoted by several authors as being important facets of a cycling policy package. This includes a wide variety of initiatives at the local level that generally focus on raising awareness of the benefits of cycling and also opportunities for cycling. Programmes intend to induce psychological changes in individuals and encourage positive social interaction and learning associated with the bicycle (Harms et al. 2016; Forsyth and Krizek 2010). Conclusions on the effectiveness of programmes vary, although it is generally recognised that the impacts of such measures are not often thoroughly and systematically evaluated (Pucher and Buehler 2012b; Pucher et al. 2010, 2011; Forsyth and Krizek 2010). Several studies postulate that the success of municipal cycling policy is influenced by the governmental setting in which policy is formulated, funded and delivered. This covers areas such as policy formulation, funding and implementation, citizen engagement and civic leadership (see Pucher et al. 2011; Pucher and Buehler 2008). Socio-spatial contextual factors or ‘exogenous factors’, are also thought to have an influence on cycling mode share. Exogenous factors can be divided into those that can be influenced by some level of policy (although are typically outside of the remit of municipal cycling policies)—policy amenable factors—and physical environment and climate variables that cannot reasonably be impacted by any policy—non-policy amenable factors. An overarching theme in the literature is that no single solution suffices to induce increased utility cycling mode share (Pucher and Buehler 2012b; Pucher et al. 2010; Forsyth and Krizek 2010). Successful programmes commonly employ a coordinated, integrated suite of cycling-specific, land use, urban form and transport planning interventions which influence the relative attractiveness of modes (Pucher and Buehler 2012b; Forsyth and Krizek 2010). Pucher et al. (2010) observed that isolating the impacts of individual policy interventions is almost impossible and recommended that pro-cycling policies should be designed to interact with one another and leverage synergies. There is a consensus in studies in mature cycling countries such as the Netherlands that a combination of pull and push conditions must be applied in order to increase cycling mode share and improve real and perceived safety of cycling (Harms et al. 2016; Pucher and Buehler 2008). Recommendations are commonly made to transpose this approach to low-cycling environments. This paper outlines a study that applied an innovative method to investigate what are perceived by professionals to be the most effective combination of measures that could be implemented in dispersed, low-cycling urban centres, to improve cycling safety and increase cycling mode share.",13

Thanks to the widespread use of smartphones, carsharing is becoming increasingly convenient since real time information regarding the availability and location of shared cars can be easily checked via mobile apps. In order to fulfill the diverse demand of consumers, various carsharing schemes are offered in the market, which differ in terms of pricing scheme and ways of organization (one-way vs. roundtrip carsharing). Since carsharing grants people access to cars without the responsibilities and hassles related to car ownership such as regular maintenance and high parking costs, it serves as a viable substitute for conducting car trips and even buying a car for some people. Several empirical studies found that carsharing users reduce their vehicle travel distance and even give up car ownership (Martin et al. 2010; Millard-Ball et al. 2005; Shaheen and Cohen 2013). The potential of carsharing in reducing car ownership gained considerable attention in automobile industry and policy making. Since each shared car usually can serve more than one person, a carsharing fleet is expected to replace more private cars than the number of shared cars, consequently reducing the total number of cars. Therefore, car manufacturers expect a “reasonable share” of their future profits will be coming from carsharing since car ownership is likely to drop,Footnote 1 and governments are focused on carsharing’s potential in relieving the negative externalities brought by both the production and usage of cars, such as pollution, CO2 emission, high parking pressure, etc. In order for (potential) car owners to switch to carsharing and reduce car ownership, the carsharing scheme has to be able to cover some trips which are currently (or expected) conducted by the private car. Duncan (2011) investigated what kind of car trip patterns can be cost-effectively accommodated by carsharing and derive the potential of joining carsharing by calculating the share of people with the compatible trip pattern. A similar study by Schuster et al. (2005) simulated people’s choices between owning private car and carsharing by comparing their costs based on the car condition and trip pattern. However, cost may not be the only consideration and people do not necessarily use carsharing to replace private car trips even if it is slightly cheaper. Furthermore, those who can accommodate more trips by carsharing are not necessarily more willing to reduce car ownership. In order to decide whether there shall be policy incentives for carsharing, the government needs information regarding the scale of impact of carsharing on car ownership. Moreover, in order to understand how this impact can vary for different carsharing systems and individuals, it is also necessary to know what factors affect people’s intentions of private car trip replacement and car ownership reduction. Among all potential influential factors, carsharing system service attributes are especially of interest since they are within the control of service providers. Of all service attributes, the impact of deploying electric shared vehicle is particularly worth investigating. Many governments have been promoting electric vehicles (EV) due to the sustainability target and EVs have also entered carsharing service. If electric vehicles are deployed in the carsharing fleet, the potential benefits of carsharing are further enhanced. For example, many carsharing users still keep their private car (Martin et al. 2010) and use carsharing services when their car is not available at the ideal time (e.g. because their partner is using the car), a parking place is too hard to find, etc. In that case, even if those people would not drive less due to carsharing, it can still reduce environmental impacts since most private cars are powered by fossil fuel. Moreover, deploying electric vehicles in shared car fleets provides easier access to electric vehicles (EVs) for many people who still have doubts towards adopting EV as a private vehicle (Zoepf and Keith 2016). People may have less battery-related concerns (replacement costs, life expectancy, possible decrease in range over time) for a shared car compared to a private car they have to purchase, especially if they use shared cars for short urban trips; therefore, a carsharing fleet of EVs may face less resistance from its potential users than the resistance EV has to confront from its potential buyers. From the fleet owners’ perspective, EVs may also be a better option because of their lower operational cost and positive environmental image compared to internal combustion engine vehicles. There seems to be a possible synergy of carsharing and electric mobility, therefore it is worthwhile to investigate how deploying electric vehicle would affect potential carsharing users’ decision. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effects of various carsharing system attributes (including car fuel type) on people’s choice and propensity of joining and using carsharing. We explore the potential of carsharing in both replacing car trips made by privately owned cars and reducing car ownership. Furthermore, we identify different consumer groups according to their heterogeneous preferences and describe each group based on individual-related variables. Finally, we explore the relationship between people’s intention of using carsharing to replace private car trips and the intention of reducing car ownership. For the above purposes, we conducted a stated choice experiment and applied latent class models to analyze preferences and categorize respondents. This paper contributes to the literature by (1) exploring the impact of carsharing system attributes on the intention of replacing private car trips and reducing car ownership under both roundtrip and one-way carsharing schemes, especially the option of deploying electric vehicles in shared car fleet, (2) identifying different customer groups based on their preferences for carsharing and (3) examining the relationship between car owners’ intention of private trip replacement and car ownership reduction. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: “Related work” section provides a brief review on relevant literature; “Methodology” section introduces the methodology including survey design, data collection and model estimation. “Results” section elaborates the results we obtained from multiple analyses. The final section provides a discussion regarding the policy implication of the results. Among others, we discuss the implications of our results for the area of shared autonomous vehicles.",55

K. Bhavathrathan,Moshe Ben-Akiva,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"Urban freight has become a globally important policy subject. Efficient operations of urban freight systems are critical in the metropolitan regions that become larger and denser. Furthermore, the evolution of logistics and supply chain practices has rapidly transformed the way freight operations take place. In this context, it is of utmost importance to develop a comprehensive and flexible urban freight simulator that can analyze the impacts of relevant policies such as land use changes, vehicle restrictions, the use of urban freight consolidation centers, the designation of loading/unloading spaces, crowdsourced deliveries, and other “smart” measures for freight operations. Several urban freight modeling systems have been proposed in the literature (e.g. Boerkamps et al. 2000; Fischer et al. 2005; Wisetjindawat et al. 2005, 2006; Hunt and Stefan 2007; Nuzzolo and Comi 2014; Moeckel and Donnelly 2016; Alho et al. 2017) and, overall, freight modeling has been advanced significantly during the last few decades. However, the models for the commodity flows within a metropolitan area are underdeveloped (Comi et al. 2012). This is attributable to the heterogeneity of urban freight agents and the commodities handled as well as the difficulty of obtaining data, particularly disaggregate data. For urban freight, it is especially important to consider the nuances of sourcing behaviors by receiver type, such as offices, stores, restaurants, logistics facilities, factories, cultural and educational facilities, and residential facilities, which are relevant to commodity flows. Due to the data limitations, it is quite common to use aggregate economic statistics such as input–output tables to estimate commodity flows in freight traffic simulations (Ben-Akiva and de Jong 2013). On the other hand, a lot of efforts and resources were spent on collecting disaggregate data until this day. Several metropolitan-scale establishment surveys, which are also called commodity flow surveys, were conducted in recent years or are currently ongoing for informing urban freight models (Hunt et al. 2006; Alho and e Silva 2015; Toilier et al. 2016; Cheah et al. 2017; Oka et al. 2018). Exploring urban freight modeling approaches that make full use of those survey data is one of the important research topics. One of the research gaps in urban commodity flow modeling is the consideration of distribution channels. Without the consideration of distribution channels, the model, for example, cannot differentiate direct and indirect shipments that go through logistics facilities, i.e. warehouses, distribution centers, truck terminals, and other intermediate facilities. While many freight models that deal with commodity flows were proposed in the past, the use of the facilities is considered mostly in the context of inter-city commodity flows (Huber et al. 2015); only a small number of the models explicitly consider the use of logistics facilities in the urban commodity flow estimation. Although an entire supply chain does not fit within a metropolitan region in many cases, the spatial distribution of urban logistics facilities is suspected to influence freight traffic flows (Dablanc and Rakotonarivo 2010; Sakai et al. 2015a). Furthermore, without considering the distribution channels, one cannot analyze the impact of the changes in urban structure. If some factories that have mainly been serving local markets move out, the local demands should be served by other suppliers, which could be other factories in the area or the logistics facilities that receive goods from outside. This paper aims to fill this research gap by proposing and testing a new approach that reproduces aggregated logistics chain structures within a metropolitan area through the estimation of the commodity flows. Here, we define a “logistics chain” as the connection between the locations of production and consumption, consisting of means of transportation, mainly goods vehicles in urban freight, and the intermediate locations that goods go through. Our approach is particularly appealing as it requires only typical establishment survey data, i.e. establishment and outbound shipment records. For the model specification, we assume that commodity flows are demand-driven; a receiver, directly or indirectly through the cost minimization principle, determines a distribution channel (defined by the supplier function type, i.e. factory, logistics facility, office/store), and a supplier which has a specific location. While this is a strong assumption, it makes a simple and robust model specification possible. We present a framework for the supplier choice model and develop an error components logit mixture model that considers the complex correlation structure among alternative suppliers. We use the data from the Tokyo Metropolitan Freight Survey (TMFS) conducted in 2013 to estimate the model. The focus of this paper is the modeling approach, but the estimated parameters in the models using Tokyo’s data also provide interesting insights on the supplier choice mechanism. The proposed framework is integrated into a comprehensive metropolitan-scale agent-based modeling system, named “SimMobility” (Adnan et al. 2016). The SimMobility accommodates various decisions and behavioral aspects related to urban freight traffic, ranging from those based on long-term “strategic” visions, e.g. business characteristics and overnight parking locations for goods vehicles, to those relevant to daily logistics operations, e.g. vehicle touring, route choice, and delivery/pick-up parking (Alho et al. 2017). The proposed approach is also applicable to the commodity flow estimation in other existing urban freight modeling systems. The rest of the paper consists of the following: in second section, the recent developments of freight models are reviewed, focusing on disaggregate commodity flow estimations and the consideration of distribution channels in the models; in third section, a proposed model structure and the calibration data are presented; in fourth section, the model specifications and the estimation process are detailed; in fifth section, the estimated models and the elasticity effects are discussed; in sixth section, tests for the model reproducibility are presented; and finally, in seventh section, the conclusions of this research are provided.",6

They foresee many benefits from high shares of active mode usage. Examples are increased health for individuals, but also reduced emissions and traffic jams if active mode usage replaces car usage. Consequently, many governments have set goals for increasing the active mode share over the next decades (Pan-European Programme 2014). Ideally, this increase in active mode use would be paired with a decrease in car use, so that more sustainable mobility patterns emerge. Kroesen (2014) found that single-mode (habitual) users were less likely to change their mobility pattern over time compared to multi-mode users. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the overall daily mobility pattern of individuals and identify traveller types, as this can provide input for whom to target with policies designed to attain the desired shift towards active modes. Attitudes are generally considered to play an important role in determining the mode choice and, more general, travel behaviour of individuals (Gärling et al. 1998). An attitude is broadly defined as an affective evaluation, regarding an object or behaviour, which can be positive or negative (Ajzen and Fishbein 1977). The relationship between attitude and behaviour has been translated to theoretical frameworks, the most prominent being the Theory of Planned Behaviour (Ajzen 1991), which has often been applied in the travel behaviour domain (e.g. Bamberg et al. 2003; Heinen et al. 2011; Muñoz et al. 2013). Furthermore, attitudes have been introduced into the discrete choice modelling theory, by developing models that can accommodate subjective latent constructs, like the hybrid choice model (Ben-Akiva, et al. 1999). This model has also been applied in the travel behaviour domain (e.g. Vij et al. 2013; Kamargianni and Polydoropoulou 2013; Habib et al. 2014; Krueger et al. 2018). Two main approaches of investigating the relationship between attitudes and travel behaviour have been identified. The first approach focusses on quantifying the relationship between attitude towards a mode and the mode choice at a trip-level, while using the abovementioned theoretical frameworks and applying discrete choice modelling theory. Several studies investigate this for a single mode, as a binary choice (e.g. to cycle or not to cycle), while other studies research a broader spectrum of modes. Due to the increased interest in active modes, research has often explored walking and cycling, albeit in a binary fashion. Several studies have investigated the impact of the attitude towards walking on the choice to walk (e.g. Lindelöw et al. 2014; Rodríguez and Vogt 2009). Similarly, past research quantified the impact of the attitude towards cycling on the choice to cycle (e.g. Heinen et al. 2011; Ma and Dill 2015; Fernández-Heredia et al. 2016). Another body of literature has investigated this relationship for multiple modes, i.e. they investigate the one-on-one relationship but accommodate multiple modes (e.g. Akar and Clifton 2009; Maldonado-Hinarejos et al. 2014; Kamargianni et al. 2015). Generally, findings suggest that if a person has a positive attitude towards a mode, the probability of using that mode increases. This approach investigates the mode choice at a trip-level, thus ignoring that individuals have a mobility portfolio and use multiple modes on a daily basis. Therefore, this approach does not show the relationship between mobility patterns and attitudes towards different modes. The second approach focusses on mobility patterns of individuals. This approach also often applies the aforementioned theoretical frameworks. A common way to deal with the many different mobility patterns that can be present in the population, is to reduce the complexity by identifying segments or classes of individuals. In this, often attitudes are used to help classify individuals into classes or segments. Many different studies set out to identify classes of individuals based on mobility patterns, attitudes, and other aspects, which is often referred to as modality styles or mobility styles (e.g. Krizek and Waddell 2002; Lanzendorf 2002; Diana and Mokhtarian 2009; Molin et al. 2016; Krueger et al. 2018). These studies integrate attitudes and observed behaviour into one model, consequently assuming a relationship between attitude and behaviour. An issue arises when deriving input for policies from these segments, as it is argued that attitudes are endogenous to travel choices and should not be used as targets for policy design (Chorus and Kroesen 2014). Consequently, it might be better to use only observable variables of the mobility pattern for the segmentation analysis, so that policy design can be tailored to population segments. To overcome the issues related to trip-level research and endogeneity of attitudes, this study investigates the relationship between daily mobility patterns of individuals and the attitudes towards modes by including only observable variables in the segmentation analysis and by explicitly investigating the relationship between attitudes and mobility patterns. This paper presents the findings of a latent class cluster analysis on individuals’ daily mobility patterns, after which the individuals in each class are compared on differences and similarities in their attitudes towards modes. Furthermore, within each class the attitudes towards modes are compared to the observed behaviour to identify whether individuals travel using their most preferred mode. We use census data from the Netherlands. The Netherlands is characterised by a high share of active mode use, consequently we expect a diverse range of mobility pattern clusters. The findings provide insights into how the overall mobility pattern of individuals relates to their attitude towards modes. The results of this study can be used to identify which groups of individuals to target in order to achieve a higher share of active mode usage by means of policy interventions.

47.0,6.0,Transportation,11 March 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11116-019-09983-9,How commuting affects subjective wellbeing,December 2020,Ben Clark,Kiron Chatterjee,Adrian Davis,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"There has been increasing attention internationally on how transport policies and practices can contribute to better health (for example, see UNECE (2015) for Europe and CIHT (2016) for UK). The focus has mostly been on reducing the impacts on physical health from traffic injuries and pollution and reversing the decline in physical activity. However, it is also acknowledged that transport systems and different forms of travel behaviour can have effects beyond physical health on people’s mental health and happiness. This has coincided with concern about the limits of GDP as a measure of economic performance and social progress and growing interest globally in measuring people’s wellbeingFootnote 1 (OECD 2011).
 Personal wellbeing can be measured using objective measures (e.g. income) and subjective measures (e.g. happiness)—measurement of the subjective measures are argued to be particularly important as only the person themselves knows how they are feeling (Layard 2005). Subjective wellbeing (SWB) is defined formally in the 2013 OECD Guidelines on Measuring SWB as “Good mental states, including all of the various evaluations, positive and negative, that people make of their lives, and the affective reactions of people to their experiences” (OECD 2013). As such, SWB is a broad concept encompassing (1) self-evaluations of satisfaction with different aspects (or domains) of one’s life (e.g. satisfaction with home, family, job, health) and with life overall-referred to as ‘evaluative wellbeing’; (2) the frequency with which one experiences different emotions,-referred to as ‘experiential wellbeing’, and (3) whether individuals feel they are fulfilling their potential-referred to as ‘eudaimonic wellbeing’. The first two of these SWB dimensions are sometimes jointly referred to as ‘hedonic wellbeing’, since they relate to pleasure and satisfaction (e.g. de Vos et al. 2013). Recent research has sought to identify whether the commute to work has an impact on the SWB of workers. The rationale for this research is that the journey to and from work is routinely repeated-for example, full-time workers in England commute to work on about 160 days of the year (DfT 2016). Any SWB benefits or dis-benefits of commuting will potentially affect a large proportion of the population. Indeed, there are multiple ways through which commuting could affect SWB. The journey to work may consume more time and money than individuals would prefer and may also be a stressful experience (Koslowsky et al. 1995). On the other hand, the commute may offer SWB benefits in providing time to relax (Redmond and Mokhtarian 2001) or to undertake physical activity. The impact on SWB of commuting is likely to depend upon its duration, the mode of transport used and the conditions experienced during the journey. This paper presents an analysis of the impact of commuting (time and mode) on multiple aspects of SWB, including: satisfaction with life overall and the SWB sub-domains of job satisfaction, satisfaction with leisure time availability and self-reported health. Measures of strain and mental health are also examined. Six waves of individual-level panel data from Understanding Society (2009/10 to 2014/15) (University of Essex 2016) are analysed, providing a sample of over 26,000 workers living in England. The paper expands on the summary of an examination of commuting and wellbeing reported in Chatterjee et al. (2017). Specifically, the paper provides a detailed explanation and justification of (1) the models used to identify robust associations between commuting and SWB, paying particular attention to those arising from individual changes in commuting circumstances over the six waves, (2) the results of these models and (3) their implications. In the next section we summarise the existing evidence on how commuting influences different aspects of SWB. Through this, we build the argument that it is valuable to take a multi-dimensional view of SWB within a single research framework. This is the contribution of our empirical analysis, which set out to identify and compare which specific aspects of SWB are affected by commute time and mode. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: The objectives and research framework are explained under “Study objectives and contribution”, in relation to evidence gaps identified through the literature review. The data set used in the empirical work is then described under “Data”, followed by an explanation of the approach to the analysis, under “Analytical approach”. The  “Results” are summarised next, with implications and opportunities for further research considered in the “Discussion”.",80

47.0,6.0,Transportation,14 March 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11116-019-09988-4,The evaluation of large cycling infrastructure investments in Glasgow using crowdsourced cycle data,December 2020,Jinhyun Hong,David Philip McArthur,Mark Livingston,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"The benefits of cycling have been well documented in several studies (Woodcock et al. 2009; Oja et al. 2011; Cavill et al. 2008). Among other things, it can improve public health and make cities more active and environmentally friendly. Even though cyclists are vulnerable to emissions and traffic accidents, several studies have found significant net health benefits of cycling and physical activities (Mueller et al. 2015; De Hartog et al. 2010; Celis-Morales et al. 2017). In many European cities, local governments have promoted cycling to make their cities more active and sustainable. For example, the cycling action plan for Scotland developed several strategies (e.g., leadership and partnership, infrastructure, integration and road safety, etc.) to achieve a vision of having 10% of everyday journeys made by bicycle by 2020, with cities being a key driver for achieving this (Transport Scotland 2017). Glasgow City Council has also committed to cycling by increasing funding and building new infrastructure (Glasgow City Council 2015). Specifically, the strategic plan for cycling 2010–2020 included diverse action plans to prepare for the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games (Glasgow City Council 2010), a major sporting event held in the city. The city council wanted to use the games as a catalyst to increase cycling and therefore also planned to install infrastructure after the games were over. As part of these efforts, several cycling infrastructure projects were undertaken between 2012 and 2015 to facilitate easier movement around the city (e.g., by providing easy and flexible access to many destinations for cyclists) and to encourage people to cycle more. This required substantial capital investment. However, the effectiveness of these big new infrastructure investments has not been well examined, partly due to data limitations. A lack of proper data also influences the quality of analysis. For example, most previous studies used a simple analytical model, focusing on specific routes. Some studies only compared two to three points in time rather than examining the effects using continuous data. This is especially important when strong seasonality effects are present, as with cycling. Therefore, the analysis should consider overall time trends and compare areas with new infrastructure and those without to evaluate the effects of new infrastructure investments properly. Strava, a mobile phone activity tracking app with a focus on cycling, has provided new opportunities for researchers and planners to analyse cycling patterns. The app allows users to log their cycling trips and track them using GPS. Strava Metro, a division of the company behind the app, processes the raw GPS data collected from users’ devices and aggregates it into a number of products, which it then provides to researchers and planners. One of these datasets is an origin and destination (O–D) matrix of the cycling trips with added information about the routes taken by different cyclists. Some people may argue that Strava users could be different from the general cycling population. However, several empirical studies have shown the potential value of Strava data to examine spatial variation in cycling volumes as shown in the “Literature review” section. In this paper, we utilised Strava data from 2013 to 2016 to examine whether the major, new cycling infrastructure installed around the time of the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games has increased the number of cycling trips made by Strava cyclists. The significant contributions of this paper are to utilise 48 months’ worth of crowdsourced cycling data which provides information on cycling at fine temporal and spatial scales, and to employ a conservative analytical method to evaluate new cycling infrastructure investments rigorously. The methodology developed can be applied in any city. Restricting ourselves to only Strava users results in measuring only the impact of the infrastructure on a subset of cyclists. However, we present evidence suggesting that the effects measured for Strava cyclists may be generalisable to the entire population of cyclists in Glasgow.",22

47.0,6.0,Transportation,10 April 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11116-019-09991-9,Validation of automatic passenger counting: introducing the t-test-induced equivalence test,December 2020,Michael Siebert,David Ellenberger,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Assessment of passenger counts is of paramount importance for public transport agencies in order to plan, manage and evaluate their transit service. Application covers many topics, for example short- and long-term forecasting, optimizing passenger behaviour and daily operations, or sharing of revenue among operators. Issues of passenger demand have a long-lasting history (see e.g. Kraft and Wohl 1968). In recent years, modelling of passenger counts has emerged rapidly due to the availability of large-scale automatic data collection. Data on (automatic) passenger counts has direct impact on both the revenue generated by ticket sales as well as state subsidies of public transport companies within one unified ticketing system. To illustrate, in Berlin, buses and underground trains are operated by the BVG, while a complementary rapid transit system is operated by S-Bahn Berlin GmbH. Public transport services in Berlin (and Brandenburg) are provided by around 40 companies organized in the Transport and Tariff Association of Berlin and Brandenburg (VBB), which provides operator-spanning tickets, e.g. single day or monthly passes. Excluding subsidies, the revenue from the ticket sales alone has been around 1.4 billion EUR in 2017Footnote 1. Revenue magnitudes in the billions are common in public transport (Armstrong and Meissner 2010) and regularly need to be shared among different operators on the basis of (automatic) passenger data. APC systems have evolved considerably within the past 40 years. Passenger flow data can be acquired with high accuracy outperforming manual ride checkers (Hodges 1985; Hwang et al. 2006). Devices that operate on 3D image streams are the industrial state-of-the-art technology. Latest generation devices offer an accuracy of around 99% (iris 2018; Hella Aglaia 2018) and technical progress is ongoing. As all measurement devices, APC systems are susceptible to error. For the comparison of counting precision between different sensors, objective statistical criteria are therefore required. These criteria are not only needed for comparisons between APC systems but also decision-making processes rely on high accuracy APC data (Furth et al. 2005). Upraising usage of APC systems led to the formulation of some precision criteria to ensure validity and reliability. The term APC validation for this type of quality control was used by Strathman (1989) and some wider usage of validation concepts awoke since the early 2000s (see e.g. Kimpel et al. 2003; Strathman et al. 2005; Boyle 2008; Chu 2010; Köhler et al. 2015). For real-world APC validations the most relevant criterion is to ensure unbiasedness, i.e. the need to rule out that the APC system makes a relevant a systematic error. Especially regarding revenue sharing, for which APC count data is commonly used (Detig et al. 2014; Hagemann 2017; Nahverkehrs-praxis 2014; Verkehr & Technik 2016; VVS 2016; VMT 2010), this is crucial, since small errors—of whatever origin—can already have a large impact: to illustrate, companies with a shared ticketing system like the above-mentioned BVG or the S-Bahn Berlin GmbH have revenues, consisting of ticket sales and subsidies, of roughly one billion EUR eachFootnote 2. If one of these companies somehow systematically counted 1% too few and the other one 1% too many passengers and passenger counts accounted to only 10%Footnote 3 of the shared revenue, yet two million EUR would be distributed inappropriately—every year, for these two companies operating in the Berlin area alone. In Germany, it is prevalent that the tickets are sold by the transport association and revenue, as well as subsidies, are distributed among the transport companies (Beck 2011), which accounted for 12.8 billion EUR in 2017 (VDV 2018). Furthermore, such a revenue sharing scheme itself is currently associated with high costs, which were roughly one million EUR for the VBB in the year 2014 (Baum and Gaebler 2015). One industrial recommendation regarding APC systems is central to tendering procedures in Germany and also advertised by manufacturers worldwide (Hella Aglaia 2018; iris 2018): the VDV 457 (Köhler et al. 2015), which regularly and in an unmodified form becomes part of transportation contracts, sometimes even in the latest, yet unreleased version that has “this is a pre-release” watermarked on every page. Due to the huge impact of the document, all change requests to the VDV 457 must be approved by a committee within the Association of German Transport Companies (Verband Deutscher Verkehrsunternehmen, VDV). Results presented in this manuscript are given as follows: In the second section we summarize and discuss the development in (automatic) passenger counting. The complete statistical model of APC measurements we introduce in the third section. In the fourth section we define and examine the revised t-test, which is an attempt to modify resp. extend the t-test to account for the type II error accordingly. There were two reasons for this approach: Firstly, the admission process based on the t-test was already established in the VDV 457 v2.0 and its predecessors, so we wanted to change as little as possible to make the impact of the changes foreseeable and manageable by decision makers. Secondly, being unopinionated was more likely to succeed than simply insisting to use a statistical test because it was popular in other fields like biostatistics. Subsequently, we illustrate that this newly introduced test generally suffers from numerical instability making the approach unsuitable for wide practical use. In the fifth section we introduce the equivalence test and in the sixth section we normalize the test criteria of both the revised t-test and the equivalence test to analytically see, that, after transposition of parameters, the tests are identical. This so-obtained t-test-induced equivalence test however is, due to only elementary calculations being made, generally not susceptible to numerical instability.

Recently, survey methods have shifted from interview-based methods to self-reported paper-based and web-based survey methods to reduce survey costs and the burden on investigators. Owing to this change, several biases have been introduced in survey data that must be carefully examined. While many types of biases exist (e.g., non-response bias and coverage bias), this study focuses on the proxy-response bias in household travel surveys. Proxy response in household travel surveys can be defined as the situation in which a household member responds (i.e., completer) to a travel survey on behalf of the other members in the household (i.e., proxy respondents). This is in contrast with self-response in which a household member responds to his/her own travel survey. For example, the mother in a household may report the estimated travel data of her entire household, which may include her father, husband, and children. However, her father may visit a hospital, walk to the park, or go to the community center, and the completer (mother) may not be aware of these trips. Therefore, such crucial records are inadvertently omitted, and thus, the reported number of trips for her father is underestimated. This is an example of proxy-response bias, which is obviously problematic. Several authors have investigated proxy-response bias using survey data with a special format to collect the completer information (Badoe and Steuart 2002; Richardson 2006; Wargelin and Kostyniuk 2006). They found trips were often underreported for individuals responding by proxy, which produced substantial bias in the travel survey data, so collecting information about the person responding by proxy is highly important. Stopher (2012) stated that the reporting proxy-response statistics provide an important measure of survey quality. Unfortunately, travel surveys do not always collect information on completers in practice, which causes problems in accurately understanding travel behavior and for comparing household travel survey data among several cities and time periods (e.g., intercity and temporal comparisons). Therefore, the development of a methodology that enables us to infer the proxy response and correct the proxy-response bias in the situations where completer information is unavailable is highly important. This is the target of the present study. Choosing the completer of the requested household travel survey can be regarded as task allocation of household activities among household members. Many studies have developed household task-allocation models considering group-based decision choice in the transportation research field. This study proposes a method that is similar to one of these task allocation models. This model can infer the probability of proxy response for each member in household, and infer the proxy-response bias. Such inference is possible without collecting information on the completers (i.e. with unknown completer). Therefore, the objectives of this study are: to develop a group-based response choice model for household travel surveys, to retrieve the probability of proxy response from the group-based choice model, and to infer the proxy-response probability and proxy-response bias from real household travel survey data with unknown completer using the developed model. Although technological innovation has provided new types of travel data (e.g., global positioning system (GPS) tracking data and smartcard data), these data often lack demographic information. Some of these data focus on single travel modes. Therefore, these new data can complement household travel surveys, but they are not sufficient to replace household travel surveys in the short term (Verreault and Morency 2018). In addition, collecting attitudinal answers for transport policies should be based on social surveys. Therefore, examining methods to improve classic household travel survey data are still important. Contributions of our study are summarized as follows. First, we proposed a novel method to infer the proxy-response probability of household travel surveys with unknown completer using a group-based discrete choice model. This innovation was made possible by incorporating group-decision modeling, which is popular in activity-based travel analysis, in the study of the travel survey method. Our proposed method was equivalent to a type of household-based model suggested by Zhang et al. (2009), but we provided another interpretation of their model. Our methodological innovation will be highly useful in fields other than transportation research. Second, using the proposed model, we can more clearly describe the response choice behavior of the household travel survey. This description will be useful for considering strategies to increase the response rates and to reduce survey bias, in general. Third, we inferred the proxy-response bias using the proposed method and found that the inferred bias was consistent with the proxy-response bias reported in the literature. This finding was surprising because our proposed method made the inference without completer data and showed similar trends to existing studies with real completer data, thus indicating the validity of our model. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. ""Second section""  reviews existing literature on proxy response and the group-based decision choice model. ""Third section"" describes the methodologies used in this study. ""Fourth section"" demonstrates the results and discussion. Finally, ""Fifth section"" concludes the study.",9

48.0,1.0,Transportation,09 October 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11116-019-10057-z,The use of recovery time in timetables: rail passengers’ preferences and valuation relative to travel time and delays,February 2021,Manuel Ojeda-Cabral,Jeremy Shires,Nigel Harris,Male,Male,Male,Male,"What is termed recovery time in the rail industry is the extra time or ‘buffer’ time that is included in train timetables over and above the minimum journey time necessary often with the explicit aim of improving punctuality. In addition to improved punctuality, it can manifest in a number of ways in cases where there is not much delay requiring the train to ‘call on’ the recovery time: Longer than necessary stops at intermediate stations; Slower than line-speed running between stations, which might involve trains being held prior to arriving in a station; Arriving earlier than scheduled. By way of example, recovery time in Great Britain can be significant on some routes, extending journey times for longer distance travellers by even around 10% as recovery time is incurred through the course of a journey, whilst the insertion of 5 to 10 min extra time on long distance trains prior to the final destination can lead to very large proportionate increases in travel time for those using the service for shorter journeys.Footnote 1 Nor is recovery time limited to longer distance operators; for example, in 2004 South West Trains, serving suburban as well as longer distance routes from London Waterloo, undertook a major re-cast of its timetables with a central feature being additional recovery time to achieve a more robust timetable delivery. It is important to note that recovery times are not immediately apparent to passengers who only see the public timetable that includes it, even when they are ‘following’ their train live on a travel app. Only the train planners have information on the amount of recovery time. Recovery time is not unique to railways and is also present in bus and airline schedules whilst motorists, cyclists and those walking can allow extra time to ensure a punctual arrival. In Great Britain, it has been included in railway timetables to improve punctuality, particularly as in recent years train operators and the infrastructure manager are liable to pay passengers and other parties monies to compensate for lost revenue due to delays. Reliability is also the most important driver of passenger satisfaction with the railways (Passenger Focus 2012). On the other hand, there is a push for timetables to deliver quicker journey times, and inserting recovery time would mean that the timetables are not optimal when there are no delays. There is a need to understand what the balance should be between the efficiency a quicker timetable delivers and the reliability a slower timetable that includes recovery time delivers. This is the subject of this paper. The impetus to this research was that several train operators in Great Britain felt that they might have inserted too much recovery time into timetables and were concerned that perceived recovery time, such as being held outside stations and prolonged stops at stations, might have some premium valuation due to the frustration caused. After all, waiting time might be spent in conditions that are the same as (or approximate to) in-vehicle time yet the convention in transport planning practice worldwide is to value wait time at twice in-vehicle time (OECD/ITF 2014). If perceived recovery time in train timetables does have a premium valuation then the benefits of improved reliability achieved by it will be reduced. The objective of this research was to understand rail passengers’ views on this matter and estimate their valuations of changes in recovery time relative to in-vehicle time and reliability in the form of late time. This paper summarises the findings of a large study and provides estimates of passengers’ valuations of recovery time, both relative to in-vehicle time and late time, that can be used for economic appraisal purposes. The fresh empirical evidence reported here provides an important contribution given that, as far as we were aware, there had been no prior research into passengers’ preferences on recovery time. Previous research concerning recovery time has largely focussed on the supply side (e.g. UIC 2000; Schittenhelm 2011). Given the complex issues involved and little prior research to guide us, the study was conducted in three phases: (1) an initial online survey of 1006 respondents, (2) two focus groups aimed at providing in-depth insights and informing the main survey, and (3) an on-train survey, providing information on the perceptions of and attitudes towards recovery time alongside the SP exercise used to examine preferences around recovery time. “Background” section provides additional background on recovery time and briefly reviews the available literature on it. “Initial insights on passengers’ perspectives on recovery time from surveys” section presents the key initial insights into passengers’ perspectives of recovery time from the surveys and focus groups conducted in the study. The main quantitative phase of the study was based upon a Stated Preference (SP) valuation exercise as part of the final survey: “The stated preference experiment” section sets out how this was designed and a description of the data. “Analysis of stated preference data” reports the findings of the analysis of the SP data followed by an illustration of the use of values in an appraisal in “Illustrative use of values in appraisal” section. Concluding remarks are contained in “Conclusions”.",1

H. Chan,Tim Schwanen,David Banister,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Physical inactivity is one of the major challenges to global public health (Sallis et al. 2016). Studies have shown that 18% of the population in developing countries are physically inactive (Dumith et al. 2011). For instance, the average level of physical activity for adults in China has dropped by nearly 50% from 1991 to 2011 (Zang and Ng 2016), and almost 80% of its adolescents were reported having inadequate exercise (Chen et al. 2014). In this context, walking has become a most sustainable form of physical activity in our daily lives, which enables people to interact with the environment in a more direct way due to its slow speed (Kamruzzaman et al. 2016; Larrañaga et al. 2016). Increasing evidence reveals that the improvements of the built environment can facilitate walking and other types of physical activity by providing more convenient transportation (Ball et al. 2001), accessible destinations (Owen et al. 2007), aesthetically pleasing features (Inoue et al. 2010), and well-maintained footpaths (McCormack et al. 2010), etc. However, several recent studies have drawn attention to the divergent effects of objective and subjective dimensions of the built environment in explaining variations in walking behaviour (Hanibuchi et al. 2015; Koohsari et al. 2015). It has been suggested that both dimensions of the built environment should be included, as different associations have been found between the objective and subjective dimensions of the environmental features with walking behaviour (Ma et al. 2015; Orstad et al. 2017). Nonetheless, the relationships between those dimensions of the built environment and walking behaviour may be more complex than hitherto suggested. There may be interactions in how objective neighbourhood characteristics and neighbourhood perceptions affect walking behaviour. Such interaction effects need to be examined further in a structured manner. Additionally, walking attitudes may moderate the environmental influences on physical activity (Yang and Diez-Roux 2017), although previous research has largely focused on measuring travel attitudes in general (Kitamura et al. 1997; Larrañaga et al. 2016). Recent studies suggest that compared to general attitudes, behaviour-specific attitudes have stronger correlations with the behaviour (Kroesen and Chorus 2018). How walking attitudes play a role in shaping the associations between the built environment and walking behaviour deserves further exploration (Ma and Cao 2017; Kamruzzaman et al. 2016). Hence, including behaviour-specific attitudes (walking attitudes in this study) may help to improve our understanding on the associations between the built environment and walking behaviour. In this study, rather than portraying walking as a generic form of movement, we pay special attention to the purpose of and activities generated by the walking trips. The influence of the built environment on walking behaviour may vary for trips with different purposes, such as household responsibilities, work/study, and leisure. Thus, it is opportune to examine the influence of the built environment on different purposes of walking behaviour. Moreover, our current knowledge of the associations between the built environment and walking is mostly based on findings from developed cities in North America, (Western) Europe, Australia and New Zealand (Feng 2016). Case studies in rapidly developing countries, in particular China, are still limited to date. Metropolitan cities in China, such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, have highly mixed land uses, extremely high population densities and are less car-dependent compared to Western cities (Kenworthy and Hu 2002). In view of such differences in social, cultural, and economic contexts, it is urgently needed to investigate the associations between the built environment and walking behaviour in the Chinese context. The results of such studies will inform urban planners and policymakers in designing more appropriate and contextualised strategies for intervention. To fill these gaps, this paper examines the association between objective neighbourhood characteristics, perceptions of the neighbourhood environment, walking attitudes, and walking behaviour for three specific types of neighbourhood walking trips. We include both objective and subjective dimensions of the neighbourhood environment, and explore their interaction effects in order to understand the impacts of the built environment to walking behaviour more comprehensively. Using Shenzhen as a case study allows us to enrich the literature of walking by incorporating a non-western perspective. This paper is organised as follows. First, drawing insights from current literature, we discuss the links between the built environment, walking attitudes, and walking behaviour. We then present the methodology of this research, followed by discussions of the empirical results. Lastly, the conclusion summarises the major findings and provides directions for future studies.",39
48.0,1.0,Transportation,26 October 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11116-019-10061-3,The bicycle-train travellers in the Netherlands: personal profiles and travel choices,February 2021,Olaf Jonkeren,Roland Kager,Marco te Brömmelstroet,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Cycling, especially in relation to urban mobility, has experienced a strong surge of academic interest in recent years (Fishman 2016). While most studies examine cycling environments in the North American context, increasingly academic and policy attention has turned to the Netherlands, which offers a context where cycling is a more mature, mainstream mode of transport (e.g. Harms et al. 2014, 2016; Rietveld and Daniel 2004; Nello-Deakin and Harms 2019). However, most of these studies have a critical blind spot: they largely study cycling as a stand-alone transport mode and/or on the level of cities or neighbourhoods. The limitations of solely examining this geographical scale is also an oft-cited research limitation of papers about cycling environments. This is seemingly a fundamental limitation, especially in the Netherlands. In the Dutch context, certain urban cores have local modal splits for cycling of above 50%, but high cycling levels are not only confined to cities, as evidenced by cycling’s 25% modal share on the national level (Harms et al. 2014). Hence, the Netherlands’ favourable conditions allow cycling to function on the scale of an entire country of 17 million people (PBL 2016). Arguably, the Dutch case can provide relevant lessons about the necessary conditions for mainstreaming cycling in sprawling urban regions around the world. On this geographical scale, the proliferation of bicycle use is aided by the Dutch national transit system. Although the train and cycling systems are originally not necessarily integrated by design, their combination has created a new type of traveller—the bicycle-train user. A bicycle-train traveller is defined as someone who combines the use of the bicycle and the train in a single trip. Most bicycle-train travelers use a private bike which is parked in a bicycle parking facility at the train station, a shared bike which is retrieved from and returned to a facility at the train station, or a folding bike which can easily be taken on board of the train. Very few people take their regular, non-foldable, bike on board the train.Footnote 1 Consequently, it has been argued that large parts of the cycling and railway system across the Netherlands should be regarded as one distinct transport mode: ‘Cycling and public transport can have a symbiotic relationship, forming a hybrid, distinct transport mode’ (Kager et al. 2016, p. 208). The relevance of combined bicycle-train transport can be illustrated by the fact 11% of all trips of more than 15 km are train trips in the Netherlands and that 83% of all train journeys are multimodal trips.Footnote 2 In addition, combined bicycle-train transport is experiencing strong growth in the Netherlands, with the number of train passenger kilometres increasing by 21% between 2005 and 2016. This increase is accompanied by the growth of cycling in the modal split at the home-end of the train trip, from 36% in 2005 to 43% in 2016. At the activity-end this share rose from 10 to 14% (Jonkeren et al. 2018). The system characteristics and ramifications of the bicycle-train system are increasingly being studied, both in academic research and in policymaking. See for example Jonkeren et al. (2018), Kager and Harms (2017), Geurs et al. (2016), and Lee et al. (2016). The focus of Jonkeren et al. (2018) is on bicycle parking at railway stations, Kager and Harms (2017) and Lee et al. (2016) discuss the benefits of improving the integration of cycling and transit, and Geurs et al. (2016) examine the impacts of bicycle-train integration policies on train ridership and job accessibility. Nevertheless, relatively little is reported about the people who use the combined bicycle-train mode. Many studies to date have targeted either cyclists (e.g. Menghini et al. 2010) or transit travellers (e.g. dell’Olio et al. 2011). This paper presents the analysis of a large-scale questionnaire that was specifically devised to bridge this gap and investigate who the bicycle-train travellers are and how they use the system. Studying this specific group will shed light on the key role that the train system plays in the success of cycling in the Netherlands, although a relatively small number of bicycle trips is directly linked to a train trip. The reasoning is that once a traveller can rely on the bicycle and train for longer distance trips, the bicycle arguably becomes a more suitable mode for local trips. Thus, the presence of a high quality train service can be seen as an important prerequisite for local cycling. The next section of this paper presents an overview of the academic literature on combined use of cycling and transit. We then outline the survey data and methodological choices, followed by a discussion of the results, presented in two separate parts. The first part explores the profile of the bicycle-train users and their key characteristics, comparing them to other train users. The second part examines their behaviour, zooming in on their choice of stations, trip chaining, modes for access and egress travel, and type of bicycles. By focusing on not one but several choices (most bicycle-train studies only examine access and egress mode choices), we are able to provide a more complete picture of the bicycle-train traveller. We close with a discussion of the implications of our findings for research and practice.",11

It is well documented in the literature that aging has significant consequences for the transport sector (e.g. Hjorthol et al. 2010; Mercado et al. 2007; Coughlin and D’Ambrosio 2012). Older adults constitute the fastest growing segment of the driving population, both in terms of license rates and kilometers travelled (Nakanishi and Black 2015; Böcker et al. 2017). This overreliance on automobile has negative impacts on the society not only in terms of the resulting environmental pollution and congestion (Banister and Bowling 2004), but also the effects on health and wellbeing of this vulnerable age group (e.g. Oxley and Whelan 2008; Kemperman and Timmermans 2014; Böcker et al. 2017). Substantial policy movements to make these societal challenges recognized in the national agenda have occurred in Europe and North America (Mercado et al. 2007). Consequently, research on travel behavior of the older population has grown to inform policy (Mercado et al. 2007; Böcker et al. 2017). Although progress has been made in understanding different sets of factors (e.g. travel factors, sociodemographic, built environmental, and latent psycho-social factors) affecting this age group’s travel behavior and more specifically their mode choice, a number of conceptual and methodological shortcomings still exist in the literature. First, while a plethora of studies have investigated the socio-demographic, built environmental, and travel factors influencing this age group’s travel behavior and transport mode choices (e.g. Schwanen et al. 2001; Banister and Bowling 2004; Kim and Ulfarsson 2004; Páez et al. 2007; Schmöker et al. 2008; Hjorthol et al. 2010; Pettersson and Schmöcker 2010; Kim 2011; Van den Berg et al. 2011; Boschmann and Brady 2013; Hahn et al. 2016; Böcker et al. 2017; Liu et al. 2017), the heterogeneous travel behavior of this age group and the latent psycho-social factors affecting their travel behavior have rarely been accounted for. The studied travel factors mainly include travel time and cost (e.g. Su et al. 2009), and purpose of the trip (e.g. Schwanen et al. 2001; Schmöker et al. 2008; Su et al. 2009; Hjorthol et al. 2010). Particularly, inclusion of purpose of the trip in models and separately modelling different travel purposes has been emphasized in the literature. It has been well established that shopping is the main daily trip purpose among this age group (e.g. Schmöker et al. 2008; Su et al. 2009; Hjorthol et al. 2010), and that the older adults are more likely to use car when going shopping. After shopping there is generally a load to carry, which increases the difficulties to use other modes of transportation (e.g. Su et al. 2009). However, shopping trip mode choices are diverse and while car driving is, in general, found to be the most frequently used mode (e.g. Gould et al. 1998), some shopping trips are made by foot, transit, or bicycle (e.g. Su et al. 2009). In addition, when studying travel behavior of this age group, it is important to distinguish the “younger old” (e.g. 55–75) from the “older old” (above 75) as declines in health often limit feasible activities (which can include the use of active travel modes) for the older olds (e.g. Alsnih and Hensher 2003). Moreover, individuals may have heterogeneous travel behavior and choose different modes of transportation for shopping purpose in different days and for reaching different shopping locations. It is, therefore, of utmost importance to account for the heterogeneous travel behavior of this age group when investigating the factors that affect their shopping trip mode choice. Besides travel factors, sociodemographic and built environmental factors affecting this age groups’ mode choice have been widely investigated. The studied sociodemographic factors in the literature mainly include gender, age, education, employment status, income, and household size (Shao et al. 2019). The effects of physical health, size of social networks (e.g. Haustein 2012), and car ownership (Chen et al. 2004; Hjorthol et al. 2010) have been also investigated in a number of studies. The studied built environmental factors mainly include population density, land use, recreation and green areas, and walking distance/time to the public transport stops (Shao et al. 2019). Neighborhood accessibility measures (e.g. Haustein 2012) and, more recently, environmental factors, such as weather conditions and seasonality (e.g. Böcker et al. 2017), have been investigated as well (e.g. Böcker et al. 2017). However, there has been some contrasting results in the literature regarding the influence of built environmental factors on mode choice of this age group (see Böcker et al. 2017 for a review). Controversies regarding the influence of built environmental factors on transportation mode choice, regardless of age or trip purpose, have been widely discussed in the literature (see Ewing and Cervero 2010 for a review). However, most of the studies have shown positive correlations between the choice of active and sustainable modes of transportation and intersection density, land use mix and residential and commercial density which has been incorporated into a walkability index developed by Frank et al. (2010). This measure is reported to have had consistent significant positive correlations with the use of active modes of transportation for different age groups (e.g. Clark and Scott 2014). However, the possible effect of walkability index on shopping trip mode choice of older adults has not been investigated. In addition, while there is a consensus regarding the positive correlation between the percentage of green space area within older adults’ neighborhood boundary and active travel or physical activity (e.g. Sallis et al. 2016; Lu 2018), the possible effect of this built environmental measure on shopping trip mode choice of this age group has been rarely studied. While built environmental, sociodemographic, and travel factors have been investigated in a plethora of studies, very few studies have accounted for or controlled the effect of latent psycho-social factors such as the diverse lifestyles and attitudes of the older adults (e.g. Haustein 2012), as well as their self-reported physical and functional abilities (e.g. Naumann et al. 2009). Put differently, integrated studies that account for the full set of travel factors, socio-demographics, psycho-social, and built environmental factors influencing transportation mode choice of older adults at the same time are limited in the literature. Furthermore, more recently, a number of studies (e.g. Temme et al. 2008; Kamargianni et al. 2015) have emphasized the importance of investigating the possible effects of basic underlying constructs, such as one’s personal goals, defined as states that people strive to achieve or avoid in the future (Freund and Riediger 2006; Saajanaho et al. 2016; Salmela-Aro 2009), rather than using relatively superficial constructs such as the willingness or propensities to use specific modes of transportation (e.g. Haustein 2012), in order to gain a better understanding of travel behavior. For example, Temme et al. (2008) found that some abstract motivations such as hedonism and power influence transportation mode choice. Saajanaho et al. (2015) found that the older adults’ spatial extent of mobility in daily life (defined as Life-space mobility) is influenced by personal goals. For example, older adults who had reported personal goals such as maintaining functioning, staying mentally alert, activeness in daily life, and meeting other people, had larger life-space mobility compared to those not reporting such goals. Moreover, older adults who did not report any personal goals moved around outside their home surroundings less than those who reported at least one personal goal in any of the goal categories of the study (for details see Saajanaho et al. 2015). Having personal goals related to maintenance of functioning as well as engaging in physical and social activities can influence not only the older adults’ spatial extent of mobility but also the mode of transportation that they use due to the need to move around outside their home surroundings. However, such understandings of the possible influence of latent personal goals on transportation mode choice of older adults in general, and their shopping trip mode choice in particular are missing in the existing literature. Second, the latent psycho-social variables, if included at all, have been always dealt with as other observable variables (i.e. the factor scores are first extracted using factor analysis of a set of Likert scale statements, and these factor scores are used subsequently as a continuous variable in models). This procedure might induce measurement error as the extracted values differ from the true values (see Bielaire 2010). Moreover, socio-demographic and built environmental factors may affect latent factors (Ramezani et al. 2015, 2018a, b) which in turn influence mode choice and such complexities cannot be accounted for and unraveled in commonly used modelling frameworks such as multinomial logit models. However, as Vij and Walker (2016, p. 205) put it, more recently, hybrid choice models (i.e. Integrated Choice and Latent Variable (ICLV) models) have been conceived to enrich “existing representations of decision-making through the inclusion of latent sociological and psychological constructs”. While discrete choice models usually use sociodemographic variables and random error components as proxies for such latent behavioral constructs, they are not able to provide any additional information to describe what these variables might be proxies for (Vij and Walker 2016). On the contrary, an ICLV model can give structure and meaning to underlying differences in behavior by helping identify additional parameters (e.g. observable variables such as sociodemographic and built environmental factors) associated with the latent explanatory variables, and test for the effect of these latent variables on observable choices (Vij and Walker 2016). To the authors’ knowledge, application of such a modelling framework in studying transportation mode choice of older adults is missing in the literature. Finally yet importantly, studies of the effects of the built environment on travel behavior of older adults (as well as other age groups) have often used predefined and static spatial units of analysis around an individual’s home location (e.g. 500–1000-m buffers, grids, census blocks) to measure the built environmental factors (e.g. Böcker et al. 2017). However, an individual’s travel can be influenced not only by the urban form characteristics of home location but also by the characteristics of the destination location (e.g. Ding et al. 2018) and the route from home to destination (e.g. Krizek 2003). Moreover, the spatial extent to which attributes are perceived by individuals can differ (Schirmer et al. 2014). As Mitra and Buliung (2012, p. 53) put it, previous research (Banerjee and Baer 1984; Horton and Reynolds 1971) has shown that “a household’s perceived neighborhood boundary can largely be defined based on the action space within which the household members perform their daily activities, and consume goods and services”. The validity of the use of commonly used buffers to account for the effect of built environment on individuals’ travel behavior has, therefore, become controversial (e.g. Perchoux et al. 2013; Holliday et al. 2017; Laatikainen et al. 2018). Such predefined spatial units of analysis have been criticized for not being able to define the spatiotemporal extents of individuals’ neighborhoods and spatial exposure (e.g. Mitra and Buliung 2012; Perchoux et al. 2013; Holliday et al. 2017; Laatikainen et al. 2018). As Hasanzadeh et al. (2017) put it, although the use of buffer has priority over the traditionally rigid neighborhood definitions (such as large traffic analysis zones or administrative boundaries), such definition of neighborhood is individual-centered, but not individual specific for the spatial extent of neighborhood is systematically defined in a uniform way for all individuals. Recent research has, therefore, taken steps forward by defining dynamic and person-based “activity space” as the spatial unit of analysis. These approaches are based on the understanding that the spatial units of analysis should not only be individual-based, but also individual specific (Hasanzadeh et al. 2017). Places and daily movements, or space in general, are heterogonous and complex in nature and this should be considered in the modeling of activity spaces (Wei et al. 2018). Therefore, few studies have proposed the use of advanced models of activity space which have been mostly used in health related studies (e.g. Wang et al. 2018; Wei et al. 2018) or for measuring hotspots of segregation and integration potentials in cities using patterns of daily travel behavior (e.g. Farber et al. 2015). For example, in an attempt to study the spatial inequalities of the food environment (“foodscape”) and measure their effects on personal health, Wei et al. (2018) used long-term GPS data to model individual activity spaces. The authors used a framework based on space–time proximity to investigate individual foodscape exposure. In a similar attempt, Wang et al. (2018) used a “crystal-growth” algorithm to develop an individual activity space model that not only considers people’s actual daily activity patterns based on GPS tracks but also takes into account the environmental contexts constraining or encouraging people’s daily activities. There is little doubt that such advanced methods provide a more accurate estimation of individual activity spaces compared to more simplistic approaches. However, a crucial fact that needs to be taken into consideration when developing activity space models is their application and ease of use. In response, Hasanzadeh et al. (2017, 2018) developed two individually and spatially sensitive models of activity spaces, which are also practical to use. The individual home range model (IHR) is an individual-specific boundary method, which applies a convex hull enclosing all daily destination points as well as the home point (Hasanzadeh et al. 2017). Individualized residential exposure model (IREM) is based on the understanding that the activity spaces are not only variable in their shape and extents, but also in their very fabric (Hasanzadeh et al. 2018). However, to the authors’ knowledge, application of such activity space models in studying the effect of built environment on transportation mode choice of older adults is missing in the literature. This study aims to contribute to the understanding of transportation mode choice of older adults (i.e. aged 55–75) by filling some of the abovementioned gaps. The contribution of this study is threefold. First, it uses an ICLV modelling framework to investigate the effects of different sets of variables including travel factors (e.g. travel time and cost), socio-demographics, psycho-social, and built environmental factors, influencing transportation mode choice of older adults for shopping trips as one of the main daily trip purposes among this age group (e.g. Schmöker et al. 2008; Su et al. 2009; Hjorthol et al. 2010). The aim is to investigate the observable socio-economic and built environmental factors influencing older adults’ transportation mode choice directly, and through their influence on latent psycho-social factors. Put differently, such a modelling framework is used to enhance understanding of the behavior of heterogeneous groups of older adults by unraveling the association between the observable (e.g. sociodemographic, built environmental) and the latent (i.e. psycho-social) factors affecting mode choice. Such an understanding can guide policy making by providing information about target groups for different policies that aim to increase the use of more sustainable and active transportation modes. Moreover, by using panel data (more than one shopping trip, to one or several shopping locations, reported by each respondent), this study accounts for the heterogeneous travel behavior of the respondents in contrast to most of the previous studies that consider only one trip and one shopping location reported per respondent. In this study we use the definition of shopping trips by Barber (1995) and used by Su et al. (2009) who define a shopping trip as a trip to any retail center, irrespective of the size and type of the store or shop and of whether or not a purchase is made. Second, rather than examining the effects of commonly studied latent factors, such as willingness to use specific modes of transportation, the concept of personal goals, defined as states that people strive to achieve or avoid in the future (Freund and Riediger 2006; Saajanaho et al. 2016; Salmela-Aro 2009), is used to study the intrapersonal and psychological dimensions (Laatikainen et al. 2019) that could affect the older adults’ transportation mode choice. Four personal goals, namely “being physically active and doing sports”, “caring for others”, “managing on one’s own”, and “engaging in cultural and social affairs” are examined. Last but not least, this study contributes to the literature by using dynamic person based spatial units of analysis (i.e. activity space models) in addition to the commonly used 500-m buffer in studying the effect of urban form factors on transportation mode choice. Two recently developed activity space modelling methods, individual home range (Hasanzadeh et al. 2017) and individualized residential exposure model (Hasanzadeh et al. 2018; Hasanzadeh 2018), are used to define person based spatial units of analysis based on respondents’ revealed daily activities (Laatikainen et al. 2018). To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study that uses these activity space models in studying the effect of urban form factors on transportation mode choice of older adults. In addition, the possible effects of the shape and dispersion of an individual’s activity space on their transportation mode choice is investigated. The aim is to examine whether the use of these different spatial units of analysis affects the results we obtain regarding how and to what degree the built environment affects transportation mode choice and whether the activity space models can provide us with better insights for policymaking. To cap it all, this study aims to answer the following research questions: Do personal goals of older adults affect their shopping trip mode choice? To what degree and how do sociodemographic and built environmental factors affect shopping trip mode choice of older adults? Does the use of different spatial units of analysis (activity space models versus the commonly used 500-m buffer) affect the results we obtain regarding the effects of built environment? Does the shape of activity space and activity dispersion of older adults affect their transportation mode choice? The paper is organized as follows. The next section (“Methodology” section) provides a detailed description of research methodology, including the data collection and data analysis procedure. “Results and discussion” section presents and discusses the results. Finally, the last section concludes the paper with a summary of key findings and future research directions.",15

This echoes what the National Infrastructure Commission sees as “the high levels of uncertainty which surround the decisions that need to be taken over the next thirty years” to address Britain’s infrastructure needs out to 2050 (NIC 2017: 34). This paper is motivated by a need to respond to what appears to be a new era for transport planning in which deep uncertainty must be accounted for when informing decision making and investment. As the French philosopher Voltaire remarked some three centuries ago, “uncertainty is an uncomfortable position but certainty is an absurd one”. There is a need to make sense of the uncertainty faced and consider how it can be accommodated in a way that is appropriate both in terms of analytical rigour and ease of communication, thereby supporting rather than paralysing decision making. Determinants of uncertainty for the transport sector are multifaceted and include the: changing demand for travel in society, its causes and likely continuation (Marsden et al. 2018; Maltha et al. 2017); impacts of climate change on infrastructure resilience and investment needs (Buurman and Babovic 2016; Dawson et al. 2016); speed and nature of any transition away from fossil fuel powered transport (Contestabile et al. 2017; Brand et al. 2019); future way in which road travel will be priced in a shift to electric vehicles (NIC 2017; Volterra Partners and Jacobs 2017); digital age maturing with a myriad of developments in information and communications technology (ICT) that in turn influence behaviours (Lyons et al. 2018a); advent, deployment and impacts of increasingly intelligent, automated and connected vehicle technology (Shaheen et al. 2018; Rohr et al. 2015); and the traditional factors of population growth, fuel price, disposable income and land-use distribution (NIC 2016; OBR 2018). Each of these determinants of uncertainty are subject to divergence of opinion (and underlying values) amongst experts and stakeholders. They face a lack of empirical evidence and insight. This can make way for speculation. They are each complex and yet also have complex interactions with each other. In short, it can be said that handling uncertainty constitutes a wicked problem (Head 2010; Rittel and Webber 1973) which may explain the accompanying discomfort. Uncertainty in strategic planning is not a new phenomenon. Marchau et al. find that the way “uncertainties are handled is strongly related to assumptions one has about the future” (Marchau et al. 2010: 940). Where uncertainty is seen to be limited, or the dimensions of uncertainty are perceived to be understood, then a trend-based, forecast-led approach can be deemed to be a reasonable way of representing uncertainty (Wilkinson 2009). However, it is argued that trend-based approaches cannot deal with “processes of social transformation” (Byrne 2003: 176) in which the functional relationships are subject to change and where it is no longer possible to assign probabilities to future outcomes (Walker et al. 2010). It is this paper’s premise that deep uncertainty is being faced. This brings with it a need to reflect upon and, we believe, revise how it is handled. We suggest that recent developments point towards a transition taking place in society away from the current regime of automobility (the motor age) towards a new regime as yet to be defined (but born of the motor age and digital age colliding and merging) (Geels et al. 2012; Lyons 2015). Such a transition could take decades to unfold but would undoubtedly impact on the case for many current investment plans which are evaluated on the trade-off of benefits and costs over periods of between 30 and 60 years into the future. Of the different approaches to dealing with uncertainty beyond forecasting (as depicted above), scenario planning is perhaps the best recognised. Its genesis dates back to the 1940s and it began being embraced to great effect by Shell in the 1960s and 1970s (Chermack et al. 2001). Van der Heijden (2000, p 32) describes scenario planning as starting “from the premise that if the future is uncertain there are, in fact, multiple equally plausible futures, which we call scenarios”. Whilst there have been several examples of scenario planning exercises in transport planning (e.g. OST 2006; Banister and Hickman 2013; Zmud et al. 2013; Lyons and Davidson 2016), the process typically remains curiously upstream of, and separate from, the process of strategy and scheme development and appraisal, wherein a reliance on forecasting continues to prevail. Meanwhile, it has been suggested that the orthodox approach to transport scheme assessment has become so highly codified in the forecasting tradition that it becomes institutionally very difficult to change (Hall 1993; Marsden and McDonald 2019). In summarising this paper’s introduction so far it can be said that we are in uncomfortable territory in which the transport sector is subject to winds of uncertain change. There is a need for appropriate means to be able to chart a robust course forwards which may run counter to the orthodox wisdom and practice. The paper explores the treatment of uncertainty through an examination of the changing approach to decision-making in England. Whilst the paper draws on literature from across the planning domain, it relates this throughout to: (1) the codified decision-making processes of the UK Government as manifested in the Treasury Green Book (HM Treasury 2003); and (2) Department for Transport forecasting and appraisal documents from the past three decades. The choice of case study results from the ability to examine how these issues have evolved over time and because of the clear documented guidance regarding how and where to treat uncertainty in decision-making. The approach adopted in the UK will be of wider interest as it is recognised as one which fits with the mainstream texts and guidance which circulate the world of practice internationally (Mackie et al. 2005; OECD 2011). There are three main sections to the paper. The first addresses how uncertainty has been recognised and treated in the initial stages of setting the context for scheme design and evaluation. This process or these processes form part of what we refer to as opening out the set of plausible futures. The second section examines how alternative futures are then interpreted in informing and taking decisions. As Rydin (2007) notes, as well as opening out what is in scope there always has to be some way of closing down towards what is meaningful, or relevant or even reasonable to consider given the scale or nature of the decision being taken. The final section discusses the need to move beyond existing highly developed decision-making approaches to overcome the tensions of opening out and closing down. To do so, we suggest requires a re-examination of what knowledge is valued and where it is valued and accounted for in the decision-support process. This calls for an opening up of the decision-making process to reflect the new environment in which decisions are being taken. The paper outlines a plausible new approach to opening out and closing down that is starting to be applied in practice. The paper is written both for those engaged in the detail of forecasting and assessment and those who use, or debate the implications of, such approaches. Whilst we use the detail of practice in England we try to limit the depth to that necessary to understand the important generalizable messages. We set out pointers to guidance for those wanting more detail.",16

V. Cooper,Ian Harvey,Alain J. F. Chiaradia,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Predicting how changes to the urban environment layout will affect the spatial distribution of pedestrian flows is important for numerous reasons. From a sustainable transport perspective, substitution of motorized trips with walking is not only beneficial for our ecological and carbon footprint (Cervero and Kockelman 1997; Frank and Pivo 1994), but also reduces congestion and air pollution, increases community cohesion (Cooper et al. 2014), and—in the face of an obesity crisis—improves public health (Handy 2005; Handy et al. 2002). Pedestrian footfall is also key to understanding town and city centre vitality and hence economic sustainability. UK policy (Department for Communities and Local Government 2009) stresses the importance of ‘linked trips’. The strengthening of retail planning policy and regulation in the decade that followed the National Planning Policy Framework (2012), resulted in retailer adaptation to ‘town centre first’ approaches. Since then academic research began to suggest a more positive impact for such developments than previously, and to show that such development can play an important positive role in anchoring small centres (Lambiri et al. 2017; Zacharias 1993) through enhancing vitality and viability. Viability relates to economic regeneration, the continuing ability of the town centre to attract new investment (Ravenscroft 2000) that demonstrates sustained profitability, and as such can be monitored via vacancy rate. Vitality on the other hand relates to the intensity of activities at various times of the day, and is usually measured by pedestrian flows (Department for Communities and Local Government 2014 paragraph 5). To this end, town centres have audited pedestrian volumes and their changes over time. Viability and vitality are interrelated and define a complex index of attractiveness of the city centre along other indicators such as land use diversity and demographic profile (Guimarães 2017). All of the above aims in public policy relate to complex phenomena in which spatial distribution of pedestrian flows constitutes only part of the picture, but an essential part nonetheless. The effect of street space layout changes, such as space re-allocation and pedestrianisation, on pedestrian flows over time has been well documented (Gehl 2004). However, major changes in street layout such as urban block size/shape change and re-alignment are a rare and very costly occurrence in existing urban fabric, and their effects less well understood. The ability to model such major changes and predict their consequences on pedestrian flow is of interest to the many town centre stakeholders involved, and helpful to assist in effective urban planning and design. Pedestrian flow in an urban centre can be visualized as a set of complex paths joining, separating, and intersecting over the available street layout. Individual street links can experience higher or lower flow levels, as well as sedentary activity (Zacharias 2000). Pedestrian paths arise from a set of individual mental maps that unfold in the street layout, the individual traces aggregating to an emerging flow level pattern at pedestrian link level. These emerging aggregated behaviour patterns have an iterative effect on street layout design in the long term, since variable flow levels will contribute to vitality, land use change and vice versa—although in the current study we model only the shorter term effect of layout on flow. The influence of generic street network layout properties such as number and type of intersections has received a renewed attention in the past two decades. Vehicular street networks have elicited various quantitative descriptions capturing generic and distinctive topologies and geometries (Boeing 2019; Cardillo et al. 2006; Newman 2006; Xie and Levinson 2007). Such network design characterisations have contributed to a quantitative understanding of urban network design and dependencies between topologies, intersections, urban densities and flow. For motorised vehicle travel time, speed and turn delays and resulting flow depend on network topology, intersection types and densities (Vitins and Axhausen 2016). Street network design analysis focusing on pedestrian flow (Ewing and Cervero 2010) has shown the importance of higher street and intersection density and 3-arm intersection shares (Vitins and Axhausen 2018). Strano et al. (2012) in a 200 year longitudinal study found that street layouts shift towards oblong and square parcel shapes in a dual process including network densification and four-arm intersection density which in turn would impact pedestrian flow level distribution. The first attempts at town centre pedestrian modelling were proposed by Benham and Patel (1977) and Crask (1979). Town centre pedestrian models have since been developed in a variety of directions such as assuming or not a list to be bought (Borgers and Timmermans 1986, 2012, 2015; Dijkstra et al. 2009; Haklay et al. 2001; Zachariadis 2007; Zhu and Timmermans 2009). There are difficulties in reviewing and categorising the works done on pedestrian modelling and forecasting due to the heterogeneity of the published works, the diversity of motivations and goals for the research and the scales of representation e.g. from regional planning scale to corridor and sub-area scale to facility and development scale. Martinez-Gil et al. (2017), Kuzmyak et al. (2014), Aoun (2015)and Turner (2017) offer summaries of pedestrian demand modelling research approaches which broadly include three general categories: trip generation and flow, network simulation, and direct demand. Direct demand models have the defining characteristic of substituting all four stages of a traditional transport model (trip generation, trip distribution, mode choice, route choice/assignment) with a single model attempting to explain flows as a function of sociodemographic and built environment variables. There is however, considerable variance within the literature on what this really means. Kuzmyak (2014) and Munira (2017), for example, review a number of models which predict flows on individual network links or intersections from these variables. Conversely, de Ortúzar and Willumsen (2011) applies a direct demand model to predict the inter-zonal flow matrix, including the inter-zonal cost and time matrices as independent variables as well as socio-demographics of each zone in each pair. The latter is therefore fundamentally different in that it includes a route assignment process in order to generate cost and time matrices; for the current paper we term this “direct demand (with) assignment”. Cooper (2017) makes the case that spatial network analysis based on betweenness (Freeman 1977) predicts flows which scale with urban density and can therefore be characterised as a direct demand model under Ortúzar’s definition, albeit extended to predict flows on links rather than inter-zonal matrices. The same can therefore be said of space syntax models based on choice (Hillier and Iida 2005; Raford and Ragland 2004). Direct demand models without assignment, on the other hand, are now popular (Griswold et al. 2019; Kuzmyak et al. 2014). Their rise parallels studies that have examined the determinants of walking behaviors, and the specific role of the built environment on pedestrian mobility and volume distribution. Principal determinants of walking include population and employment density, land use diversity, design, distance to destinations, and distance to public transits; design measures include average block size, proportion of four-way intersections and intersections density, sidewalk coverage, average building setbacks, average street widths, numbers of pedestrian crossings, street trees or other physical variables that differentiate pedestrian-oriented environments from car-oriented ones (Ewing et al. 2014). These determinants have been successively conceptualized as the 3Ds (Cervero and Kockelman 1997) and the 5Ds (Ewing et al. 2014; Ewing and Cervero 2001, 2010). A review of the dimensions used in pedestrian Direct Demand model studies (Munira and Sener 2017) shows that most of the significant variables used, when reported, fall within the 5Ds categories with additional categories such as shown in Table 1. Absent of an assignment process, direct demand models do not capture a fundamental property of all network transportation: namely, that trips must necessarily proceed from an origin to a destination via a continuous chain of network links. Assignment models enforce this property by definition. Assignment-free direct demand models, by contrast, use spatial buffers to aggregate built environment characteristics of an area, which may mask the real environment that a pedestrian experiences when making a trip (Shatu et al. 2019). Hence, network characteristics such as improved pavement width, and sociodemographic characteristics such as higher population in a spatial buffer, will always lead to higher flow predictions even on network links which do not form part of any useful route—a result which is intuitively incorrect. We therefore take a direct demand with assignment approach in which, in contrast to assignment-free direct demand models, the only independent variables used are themselves the output of an assignment process, while other built environment and demographic characteristics are incorporated as inputs to that assignment process. We achieve this using multiple variants of spatial network betweenness in a regression model, as per Cooper (2018) (discussed in detail in Methods, below). Yet, we still capture the strengths of assignment-free direct demand models as a range of the popular ‘5D’ variables, including distance, block size, intersection connectivity and density, sidewalk coverage and pedestrian crossings, are implicit in modelling density and assignment on the detailed pedestrian network used. Our purpose is to eschew use of abstracted design metrics such as urban block, face length and connectivity (Gärling and Gärling 1988), and replace them with reductionist consideration of individual routes through the detailed pedestrian network layout (as Sevtsuk et al. 2016 did with Euclidean accessibility), thus retaining the geometric constituents of pedestrian intelligible navigation in open large scale urban environments (Montello 1998, 2005). Our approach also addresses noted problems (Crane 2000; Frank and Engelke 2001) with the covariance of urban design variables, by using ridge regression. To capture the design component of the pedestrian network, this study also departs from previous direct demand assignment flow models based on the axial map (described as space syntax (Raford and Ragland 2006, 2004)—these studies also include variables outside of the assignment model, which we avoid as discussed above). Axial map approaches have been criticised for lack of transparency (Kuzmyak et al. 2014; Raford 2010; Ratti 2004; Turner 2017). Instead we use for the first time, to our knowledge, a standard detailed pedestrian path centre line (Chiaradia 2014; Sun et al. 2019, 2017; Zhang and Chiaradia 2019). Pedestrian network mapping principles are given in the “Methods” section. The principal ways in which our model diverges from existing literature, and hence its contribution, can therefore be viewed from multiple perspectives. From an assignment-free direct demand perspective, the contribution is to enhance such models (1) by forcing all variables to act via an assignment process on a detailed pedestrian network to more accurately capture the nature of transport, and spatial locations of relevant variables, with greater accuracy; (2) by dropping abstracted variables such as block size and instead capturing their effect via an assignment process on the detailed network. From a direct demand with assignment, or spatial network analysis perspective our contribution is to enhance existing pedestrian approaches by capturing a range of built environment variables more commonly associated with assignment-free direct demand modelling, but without violating the assignment paradigm, while also maintaining the computationally efficient calibration of an assignment-free direct demand model. We also use more sophisticated route assignment criteria than the pure angular or Euclidean metrics prevalent in that literature (Hillier and Iida 2005; Raford and Ragland 2004) and for the first time, an inelastic formulation of betweenness. Finally, from an urban planning and design perspective, combining built environment characteristics with route assignment creates a bridge between these disciplines and transport modelling (Ewing and Clemente 2013; Stangl 2019; Stangl and Guinn 2011). The other major contribution is a longitudinal evaluation of model accuracy. Few published pedestrian models include an empirical test against observed pedestrian flow data, and those which do, invariably test model fit at a single point in time as a cross-sectional study. Longitudinal studies, which track response to changes over time, are considered more reliable (Greenhalgh 1997). A search of literature revealed two cases of models which track response of pedestrian flows to layout change over time (Borgers and Timmermans 2015; Teklenburg et al. 1993) yet neither of these attempt to predict post-layout-change flows based on pre-layout-change data—i.e., what an urban planner modelling flows through a potential new development would in fact be trying to do (Borgers and Timmermans is commendable in use of a hold-out data set for cross validation, but calibration is based on data from all years). The recording of pedestrian flows before and after a major change to the urban environment brings the opportunity to raise the bar to a natural experiment. Natural experiments have various definitions, all based around the general concept of seeking out real-life situations that in some way emulate laboratory conditions (Leatherdale 2019). The pre-post approach involves comparison of outcomes pre- and post-exposure to the intervention: although making the assumption that outcomes change only as a result of exposure to the intervention, the result is that the population partially serve as their own controls (Craig et al. 2017). We therefore seek to answer the question, “given a model calibrated on data prior to the change, can the effects of the change be predicted correctly?”. The study was conducted in simulated ex-ante fashion, in which we calibrated the model with reference only to data collected before the change, to mimic the working environment of live planning/design projects. Ex-post tests were used only for validation, not to revise the model. To our knowledge this is the first time any such model has been tested in this way. As well as testing the ability to predict changes over time, we also, using generalized cross-validation, test ability to extrapolate across space. From a network analysis perspective, we can characterise our direct-demand-with-assignment model as Multiple Hybrid Spatial Design Network Analysis (MH-sDNA) based on use of betweenness (discussed further in the Methods section) as structural flow analyses. This could also be described as a point-of-interest type model with individual heterogeneity, as it computes paths for the trips of numerous individuals through the network with differing goals (trips to retail from various origins, and between retail) and various route preferences (accounted for by Monte Carlo randomization). A final alternative characterisation is that this is an agent model but without interaction between agents.",18

Haddad,Marcin Stępniak,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"During decades, big transport infrastructure investments have been used as one of the main tools of the European Union (EU) structural policies. The idea to support the development of the single market by providing funding for transport infrastructure projects resulted in the creation of the Trans-European Networks (TENs) in 1993Footnote 1 and the launch of the first Community Guidelines for the Development of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) in 1996. The European transport policy aims at developing a Europe-wide network of roads, railways and waterways. However, until now the road network has attracted most of investments of the EU transport infrastructure projects.Footnote 2 As a consequence the overall length of the motorway network in the EU28 countries have increased from almost 42,000 km in 1990 to more than 76,000 km in 2015. The development of the motorway network has been particularly impressive in the case of the less developed EU member states. For instance, between 1990 and 2015 the length of motorways increased by more than 10 times in Greece (from less than 200 km to more than 2000 km), more than 8 times in Portugal (from slightly above 300 km to over 3000 km), more than 6 times in Hungary (from less than 300 km to almost 2000 km) and more than 5 times in Poland (from 257 km to over 1600 km) and in Romania (from 113 to 747 km). In absolute terms the greatest improvement can be observed in Spain (over 10,000 km of new motorways) followed by the aforementioned countries.Footnote 3 There is an extensive literature dedicated to assess the impact of transport infrastructure investments on regional development in the European Union. Using different methodological approaches, researchers generally find some kind of positive relationship between the construction of new roads and growth of regional production or employment. However, studies focusing on the overall impact of transport infrastructure investments on different regions of particular country are less frequently found. Most of macroeconomic studies examine the relationship between accessibility improvement and economic development of all regions of a given country, sometimes grouping the regions into more and less developed. At the same time, other studies focus on particular regions within a country without taking into account the remaining areas of that country.Footnote 4 As a result it is not clear what regions and to what extent really benefit from big transport infrastructure investment in terms of short and long run economic development. The answer to this question seems to be particularly interesting in the case of EU member states that have significantly increase the length of their motorway network in the recent decades and present strong spatial heterogeneity. In the present paper we aim at filling the gap in the literature and focus on the impact of big transport infrastructure investments on regional development of different regions in Poland. We also expand the existing literature providing an ex-post analysis instead of an ex-ante one. Hence, we rely on real values related to the reduction of travel time. This is hardly observed in the existing studies. We apply a regional dynamic CGE model to assess the economic effects of major transport infrastructure investments, undertaken between 2005 and 2015 in Polish NUTS2 regions. We use the data on both investment spending and accessibility improvement (expressed as an estimated reduction in travel time) in order to distinguish potential short and long term impacts. In our counterfactual simulations we rely on the value of travel time savings (VTTS) in freight transport approach to model the shocks on transport margins in particular regions. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews prior literature on the relationship between transport infrastructure investment and regional economic development in particular regions. In Sect. 3 we discuss the research methodology and the data. Section 4 presents the results of our simulations. Finally, Sect. 5 offers some concluding remarks.",15

Applying the Blinder–Oaxaca decomposition method to examine generational differences in transportation-related attitudes,April 2021,Ali Etezady,F. Atiyya Shaw,Giovanni Circella,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"Although in modern times all generations have engendered a certain amount of media attention, the Millennials cohort has disproportionately enjoyed a spotlight so intense that, for many, the word “Millennials” now evokes something of an ad nauseum catchphrase. Examining the deluge of popular news, opinion, and academic pieces on Millennials makes it clear that this fascination can be traced to several attributes, the most notable of which is that Millennials will soon become the largest living adult cohort, a prediction with reverberating implications across all domains. Compounding this demographic dominance is the fact that members of this cohort have long been making choices that fly in the face of trends observed in prior generations, although several studies have suggested that some of these contrasting behaviors may be converging with those of prior generations as Millennials enter later life stages. Identified behavioral differences between Millennials (defined here as those born in the 1980s and 1990s; also known as Generation/Gen Y) and the preceding Generation X (born between 1965 and 1980; also referred to as Gen X) have been attributed to a range of personal (ex. attitudinal differences, technological exposure), environmental (ex. built environment policies intended to encourage denser living), and economic (ex. effects of recession) factors (Blumenberg et al. 2012; Delbosc et al. 2019; Kuhnimhof et al. 2012; Thigpen and Handy 2018). Within transportation, there is substantial evidence that attitudes play a role in influencing behavioral choices (Spears et al. 2013; Domarchi et al. 2008; Kitamura et al. 1997; Kuppam et al. 1999; Mokhtarian and Salomon 1997). However, due largely to a lack of attitudinal data, the majority of comparative studies on generational differences have relied primarily on behavioral indicators, although there are segments of the literature that have examined market-oriented attitudes such as brand loyalty, or work/life-oriented attitudes such as satisfaction. We assert that continued examination of attitudinal differences between Millennials and Gen Xers is critical to placing into context behavioral differences, with particular importance in the transport sector where infrastructure planning revolves around forecasting travel behaviors, for which attitudes play an important explanatory role. But it is one thing to ascertain that attitudinal differences exist; it is another thing to identify the sources of those differences. That is the aim of the present study. To our knowledge, this paper is the first, in the dense collection of Millennials literature, to apply a decomposition approach, specifically the Blinder–Oaxaca (BO) method, to extricate group (endowment) and effect (coefficient) differences influencing transport-related attitudinal gaps between Millennials and Gen Xers. As such, while this study contributes specifically to the Millennials literature, it may also inform future work on other generational and demographic divides of interest within transport contexts. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: We first provide an overview of the literature on attitudinal and behavioral differences between Millennials and prior generations, followed by an introduction of the dataset. Next, we detail the attitudinal statements and resultant constructs examined in this paper, after which we statistically evaluate the mean generational differences for the selected attitudinal constructs. We then introduce and apply the Blinder–Oaxaca method to decompose significant generational gaps in attitudinal constructs, and close with limitations and avenues of future exploration for this work. We consign to a supplemental online Appendix the multiple underlying regression models (on which the BO analysis is based), detailed discussion on the decomposition of three of our four attitudes, and alternative versions of the BO method, so that the main body of the paper can concentrate attention on the distinctive features and messages of this study.",20

A trip chain or tour describes a sequence of trips that starts and ends at the home location (Primerano et al. 2008). Since the decision of the first travel mode often determines the available travel modes at subsequent stages of a journey, mode choice decisions are likely to consider more than only the next trip. Most studies on travel behaviour indicate that trip chaining precedes mode choice (Krygsman et al. 2007; Li et al. 2013; Yang et al. 2016; Ye et al. 2007). This means that people first arrange their out-of-home activities in trip chains and then select one or more available travel modes that are convenient for the planned trip chain. The number of included activity locations, generally referred to as trip chain complexity (e.g. Currie and Delbosc 2011), seems to influence mode choice. Most studies suggest that the more trip chains are getting complex, the more the traveller is inclined to use the car and the less likely he or she is to choose public transport (Hensher and Reyes 2000; Krygsman et al. 2007; Primerano et al. 2008). While these findings revealed a mode choice propensity for independent trip chains, the implications for a person’s day-to-day mode choice behaviour remain unclear. However, it is precisely these implications that are of great interest when performing any kind of scenario analysis that affects trip chain complexities (e.g. changing levels of time scarcity). For this reason, we study the relationship between trip chain complexity and mode choice behaviour using the full activity-travel pattern of a person as a starting point. The planning process that underlies activity-travel patterns is named trip chain or tour formation (Lee and McNally 2006). In this process, a person schedules his or her out-of-home activities and, thereby, determines the proportion of simple compared to more complex trips chains in the activity-travel pattern. Former research identified features of the traveller such as age, gender or working hours which affect associated trip chain complexities (Chen and Akar 2017; Currie and Delbosc 2011; Frank et al. 2008; Frignani et al. 2011; Hensher and Reyes 2000; Islam and Habib 2012; Primerano et al. 2008; Ye et al. 2007). This means that all trip chains of this person have a similar complexity tendency and are therefore not independent. Besides these factors describing the traveller and his or her environment, dependencies between trip chains also arise from the person’s activity program. As the activity program (i.e. a list of recurring out-of-home activities that have to be performed) is input for the trip chain formation, the complexities of trip chains are often interdependent. For instance, people might not go to the gym every day, entailing that trip chain complexity potentially boosts on one day but not on another. Based on the literature that we have seen above, the dependencies between trip chains within an activity-travel pattern can have two different implications for a person’s day-to-day mode choice behaviour. First, the literature suggests that people with considerably different characteristics regarding trip chain complexity factors are supposed to have clearly distinguishable trip chain complexity profiles (i.e. the composition of simple chains compared to complex trip chains), which in return result in specific mode choice patterns. Assuming this causal relationship, one would expect to find people who mostly use the car to have a more complex trip chain complexity profile than people who regularly use public transport. Second, the dependencies induced by a person’s activity program might entail interactions between trip chains, which again affect mode choices. For instance, one might observe regular public transport users that outsource a part of the necessary trip chain complexity to implement their activity programs to moments in which a car is available. However, it would also not be surprising if people simply travel with their routine travel mode, regardless of the complexity of their trip chains. In order to reveal the interactions between trip chain complexity and mode choice within the activity-travel pattern of a person, all travel modes have to be considered. To date, however, research on trip chain complexity has mainly focused on the comparison between car and public transport (e.g. Hensher and Reyes 2000; Yang et al. 2016) or, similarly, non-car trip chains (Ye et al. 2007). Only within a full activity-travel pattern, we can understand how an activity program is implemented with regard to complexity across trip chains and how these complexities affect a person’s day-to-day mode choice behaviour. The given examples illustrate that current knowledge is not sufficient to understand this relationship. Therefore, one key question needs to be answered. That is, whether a person’s aggregated mode choices are reflected by the complexities of his or her trip chains. Or, differently formulated, if trip chain complexities vary between people that have distinct mode choice behaviour. This paper extends the literature by investigating exactly this latter question. We meet this research objective by first identifying classes of people with homogeneous mode choice behaviour (in the following referred to as mobility pattern classes) using a latent class cluster analysis on data from the Netherlands Mobility Panel. Subsequently, we derived individual trip chains from the same data set and assigned each trip chain to a travel mode and the mobility pattern class of the traveller. Trip chain complexity was then analysed and compared between travel modes and mobility pattern classes. This paper has two major contributions. The first contribution is the consideration of all relevant travel modes. The explicit inclusion of the active modes and the independent travel mode category “multimodal trip chains” extends current knowledge and gives more differentiated insights into the relationship between trip chain complexity and mode choice. The second contribution is the change of scope from independent trip chains to dependent trip chains within a person’s activity-travel pattern. This approach provides valuable information on how trip chain complexity relates to average mode choice behaviour rather than to detached components of it. In the remainder of this paper, we describe the data sample in Sect. “Data: the Netherlands mobility panel”. In Sect. “Research methodology”, we outline the research methodology, including performed mobility pattern derivation, trip chain identification and trip chain complexity analyses. Subsequently, the results of all analysis steps are presented and discussed in Sect. “Results and discussion”. Finally, we provide concluding comments and recommendations for future research in Sect. “Conclusions and future research”.",16

Calibration describes the process of modifying the model, refinement of specifications, correction of (previously undiscovered) erroneous input data or adjustment of (non-empirically verified) parameters. The validation on the other hand describes the process of testing if the model has reached a certain goodness-of-fit. This goodness-of-fit does not refer to a particular key performance indicator. Ideally, before the model building process starts, the tendering institution determines how accurately the model should reproduce e.g. number of trips, traffic volumes, mean trip distances and mean trip times for each mode and trip purpose, keeping in mind the availability of reference data and its quality. If the validation process concludes that the model quality is not sufficient, adjustments are made to the model in the step of calibration. Frequency distributions, which are another type of key performance indicators, describe travel behaviour using specific indicators in discrete classes. There are two common cases: frequency distributions of (1) the time travelled, which are also known as trip time distributions or trip time frequency distributions, and (2) the distance travelled commonly known as trip distance distributions or trip length frequency distributions. Among others, those distributions are an important tool to evaluate how well a model fits with observed sample data. Therefore, the comparison of distributions is an essential part in the model validation process. Despite its importance the common modelling guidelines from the UK (WebTAG (Department for Transport 2014)), the USA (Travel Model Validation and Reasonableness Checking Manual (Cambridge Systematics Inc. 2014)) or Austria (draft of Qualivermo (Sammer et al. 2012)) provide little information about the correct structure and handling of such distributions. Likewise, common statistical methods that check whether two samples derive from a common population are not practicable for application during the validation of transport models, as will be explained later. This lack of rules leads to individual solutions, which complicate the model validation process, the comparison of models and the definition of thresholds for quality indicators in guidelines. The following Fig. 1 is intended to illustrate this issue. The same data set (number of trips with their corresponding trip length from a household travel survey and from a travel demand model) is classified into discrete classes in three different ways: the left figure is classified into 20 equidistant classes (1.5 km each), the middle figure into 10 equidistant classes (3 km each) and the right figure into 5 equidistant classes (6 km each). The overlap of the observed and modelled distribution, which is measured by the Coincidence Ratio (CR, which will be explained in more detail later), shows that the lower the number of classes, the less overlap there is. In other words, in an extreme case with only one or two classes, there would be a very high overlap. In this example, it would mean that the classes would only have to be large enough to reach the threshold of CR ≥ 7 proposed in the Travel Model Validation and Reasonableness Checking Manual (Cambridge Systematics Inc. 2014). Having said this, the modelled distribution in the left figure would probably be rejected, while the others would be acceptable, although the underlying data set is the same in all three figures. Classifying the same data set with different classification rules leads to different valuation results In general, this means that the resulting distribution evaluation is meaningless if there are no rules for creating the distribution, because even a poor model can be twisted so that the results look fine. Thus the overall goodness–of–fit is at risk. Therefore, guidelines for model validation need to suggest an appropriate way of how to build the distributions. This is one of the reasons for many misunderstandings between the model users (tendering institutions) and the model developers (contractors) in the context of model development. When validating a model with distributions of time and distance the following questions inevitably appear and they should be answered beforehand by the tendering institutions: What indicator should be used for the classification? Which area is covered by the distribution? What is the reference for a comparison of distributions? How many classes should be distinguished? What is the appropriate size of each class? Should the class size increase with the distance travelled? How to proceed with empty classes? What quality indicator should be used when comparing two distributions? Should absolute or relative frequencies or both be evaluated? 
The questions above are also related to the issue that the classification often depends on the dimensions of the study area. This is another reason for individual and not comparable solutions. In order to provide general guidance on how to handle frequency distributions within the model validation process this paper proposes a standardized classification method that can be applied independent from the indicator used and from the dimensions of the study area. For the data set in the example in Fig. 1, this would lead to a single generic classification. It is therefore a necessary complement to the existing guidelines in order to make model validation results more evaluable and comparable.",

Disruptions can increase passengers’ nominal travel time, due to additional waiting time, in-vehicle time or transfers. Furthermore, passengers potentially experience higher crowding levels on alternative services, resulting in a more negatively perceived in-vehicle time (Hörcher et al. 2017; Tirachini et al. 2017; Yap et al. 2018a). Disruptions can also imply costs for the service provider, due to overtime payments to personnel, possible fare reimbursement for delayed passengers, and in the case of contractual agreements between service provider and authority resulting in fines. In the long term, disruptions can result in a loss of revenue if ridership levels decrease because of (perceived) unreliability of the PT system. It is thus in the interest of passengers and service provider to examine and assess the frequency, location and passenger delay impact of different disruption types occurring at each public transport station or link. An accurate prediction of the occurrence and impact of disruptions supports PT authorities and service providers in prioritising the locations and disruption types for which they should devise measures to reduce disruptions or their impacts. For the remainder of this paper, we first introduce several definitions used throughout this work. We apply a definition of vulnerability, which is obtained by combining definitions from Rodriguez-Nunez and Garcia-Palomares (2014) and Oliveira et al. (2016), with robustness being its antonym. Vulnerability is defined as the degree of susceptibility of a PT network to disruptions and the ability of the PT network to cope with these disruptions. This definition highlights the two components vulnerability consists of: exposure, the degree to which a PT system is exposed to disruptions, and the impact once a disruption occurs. Moving from a network level to individual elements, we define criticality as the degree to which an individual element of a PT system—such as a PT node or link—contributes to vulnerability. Criticality again refers to both disruption exposure and impact: it considers both weakness, the degree of disruption exposure for an individual stop or link, and importance, the impact of disruptions occurring at a stop or link (Cats et al. 2016). The most critical nodes or links thus contribute most to PT vulnerability in terms of the product of their weakness and importance. We consider both recurrent and non-recurrent PT disruptions in our study. Recurrent PT disruptions, such as a vehicle door malfunctioning or a delayed departure from the terminal, occur relatively frequently whilst the impact is generally limited. To the contrary, non-recurrent PT disruptions—such as a faulty train, signal failure or vehicle derailment—are relatively rare, but often have larger impacts once they occur. In this study, we focus on the impact of identifiable, distinctive disruptions. The impact of normal stochasticity of the PT system, for example caused by variability in train running times, is not considered. In addition, we do not consider extreme events as natural disasters or terror attacks in this research. These events differ substantially from typical PT disruptions in terms of frequency, location and impact, that a bespoke research approach is necessary. Furthermore, we focus on unplanned disruptions: planned disruptions, for example related to scheduled track maintenance works, fall outside the scope of this work. Empirical data can contain information about the frequency with which different disruptions occurred, or about the disruption impact on passenger delays. However, to be able to study disruption frequencies and impacts of different disruption types for individual elements of a PT network, only using empirical data is typically insufficient. For illustration purposes, let us consider a medium-sized PT network consisting of 100 stops, where our aim for each stop is to predict disruption frequencies and impacts for 20 different disruption types, for five different time periods of the day and week, separately for each season. This would require empirically deriving disruption frequencies and impacts for 100 × 20 × 5 × 4 = 40,000 instances. Consequentially, this would require sufficient empirical observations for each of these 40,000 instances to fit a probability density function for, to use empirical data reliably to predict future disruption frequencies or impacts. In practice, this means there will be insufficient empirical data available from past disruptions to use directly for future disruption occurrences and impacts for each of these instances. Therefore, some kind of prediction model becomes necessary to predict disruption frequency and impact for each individual PT network element. In the field of transport vulnerability analysis, different approaches are applied to predict disruption impacts: full scan computation methods and methods using pre-selection indicators (Knoop et al. 2012). Full scan methods predict the disruption impact of each disruption type, at each location of a PT network. In a wider context, approaches to predict disruption impacts are broadly classified as scenario-based, strategy-based, simulation-based or using mathematical modelling (Murray et al. 2008). For transportation networks, generally a static, dynamic or simulation-based transport assignment model is used for this purpose. For example, in the context of highway networks, Jenelius (2007) uses a traffic simulation model where each link of the network is blocked, whilst Knoop et al. (2008) also incorporate dynamic spillback effects of blocked links. Full scan methods result in impact predictions for each individual network component, hence allowing all stops or links being ranked according to their contribution to network vulnerability. However, these methods are computationally prohibitive for larger networks and are typically only feasible to apply for smaller or case study networks. Instead, pre-selection methods apply indicators which result in a short-list of locations where disruption impacts are expected to be most severe. Full disruption impacts are only modelled or simulated for this selection of locations. For example, Tampère et al. (2007) assess the expected criticality of road network links based on multiple indicators, such as the incident impact factor. Other road network vulnerability indicators used in literature are the Network Robustness Index (Scott et al. 2006) and the Modified Network Robustness Index (Sullivan et al. 2010), which approximate the impact of a full or partial link blockage on the network performance, respectively. Bell (2003) and Zhang et al. (2010) both adopt a game theoretical approach to quantify indicators for network vulnerability. To assess vulnerability of PT networks, Derrible and Kennedy (2010) propose a robustness indicator which calculates the number of available paths in the event of a disruption, based on a graph representation of 33 metro networks worldwide. Cats et al. (2016) compare a passenger betweenness centrality measure as proposed by Cats and Jenelius (2014) and a passenger-exposure measure as PT vulnerability indicator. Aforementioned studies adopt either a node-based or link-based vulnerability approach, whilst some studies consider the vulnerability impacts of joint node and link disruptions (see for example Dinh and Thai 2014). The disadvantage of pre-selection approaches however is that there is no guarantee the largest impacts occur at these selected locations. This means there is no certainty whether the most critical nodes or links of a network are correctly identified. Additionally, these approaches do not allow for a comparison of disruption impacts between all individual network elements, as disruption impacts are only quantified for selected elements. The abovementioned state-of-the-art illustrates that existing methods are insufficient to predict the passenger delay impacts from disruptions for each individual PT station or link for medium- or large-sized, real-world PT networks. Several studies focus on predicting disruption impacts, once a disruption occurs. For example, studies quantify PT disruption impacts (Cats and Jenelius 2015), the value of spare capacity in a PT network (Cats and Jenelius 2014), or the impact of partial rather than complete track closures (Cats and Jenelius 2018). Corman et al. (2014) evaluate the robustness of railway timetables once a disruption occurs. However, focusing solely on disruption impacts without considering disruption frequencies can incorrectly put the emphasis on locations where very severe yet very rare disruptions occur. Predicting how often different locations in a PT network are exposed to different disruptions is a relatively understudied topic. There has been a vast amount of work towards predicting incident frequencies for road networks in the field of traffic safety. Whereas initial road traffic research primarily used descriptive and aggregate models to predict accident probabilities (e.g. Stone and Broughton 2003; Lord et al. 2005), more recent research has moved towards using disaggregate, predictive models (e.g. Zou and Yue 2017). For PT networks, the use of disaggregate models remains limited. An important reason is often a lack of good quality disruption log data, as data over a longer period of time is required given the relatively infrequent occurrence of disruptions. In Cats et al. (2016) and Yap et al. (2018b), a database consisting of logged disruptions on a PT network for a period of 2.5 year was used to fit statistical models for disruption frequencies on a network level. In these studies, relatively simple predictors such as the number of trains or train-kilometres were used to translate the network-wide number of disruptions to expected disruption exposure per station or link. This implies that location-specific characteristics—such as the type of stock serving a station, the passenger load or the geographical area where a station is located—are not considered, while these are believed to be important when predicting disruption exposure. In Tonnelier et al. (2018) a data-driven method is developed to detect individual atypical events in PT networks using anomaly detection. However, this method does not explicitly provide what type of disruption at which location initiated this anomaly, making it difficult to formulate policy recommendations concerning how to tackle PT vulnerability. This means that currently no adequate disaggregate models have been developed to predict disruption frequencies for individual PT stops or links. Our study objective can be summarised as the development of a generic methodology to predict disruptions and their passenger delay impacts accurately for different disruption types, for individual stations of a real-world PT network, thereby incorporating the specific characteristics of the different stations. This implies we develop a disaggregate modelling approach to predict disruption frequencies and to predict the passenger delay impacts of each disruption. We propose a supervised learning approach to perform these predictions, as this allows for the prediction of disruptions at individual stations for each time period, without the requirement of having sufficient empirical disruption observations available for each location and time period. This approach also enables a fast prediction of disruption impacts for a large number of disruption instances, hence addressing the computational challenges that rise when typical PT assignment or simulation models would be used for real-world PT networks. To improve transferability of our study results, we cluster stations based on their contribution to PT vulnerability using unsupervised learning. Besides predicting disruptions and their impacts for a specific PT network, this provides PT authorities and service providers insight in the different station types that can be distinguished based on their contribution to network vulnerability. For example, for policy purposes train stations in the Netherlands are grouped into six categories based on function and passenger volumes (Geurs et al. 2016). Our research results in a natural clustering of stations in a similar way, specifically based on vulnerability. Hence, this supports PT agencies to apply the appropriate type of measure aimed to reduce disruptions or to mitigate disruption impacts for each station type. Our research contribution is therefore defined as follows. Development of a method to predict disruptions and their passenger delay impacts for individual public transport stations, incorporating the specific characteristics of each station; Development of prediction models which predict disruptions and their impacts based on a non-exhaustive empirical disruption dataset within acceptable computation times. To provide PT agencies with predicted disruption impacts for each individual station on their network, for each distinguished time period and disruption type, supporting them to prioritise locations where to put mitigation measures in place; Identification of different groups of public transport stations with different disruption exposure and impact characteristics, enabling PT agencies to devise appropriate measures to tackle vulnerability for different station types. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. The Methodology section explains the methodology, whilst the Case Study section introduces our case study network. We discuss results in the Results and Discussion section, followed by the Conclusions section.",15

The platform for this service is a digital application, commonly known as an app, that is installed on a smartphone or tablet and provides options for booking, electronic payment, and ratings of passengers and drivers (Shaheen et al. 2016). Ride-hailing platforms determine trip fares, which are known in advance and are accepted by passengers and drivers. Once a trip is completed and payment is processed, the ride-hailing platform retains a percentage of the total fare as its commission and the rest is transferred to the driver.Footnote 1 Ride-hailing is also known as ridesourcing in the academic literature, and service providers are usually called transportation network companies (TNCs). Ride-hailing has expanded quickly in many countries over the past decade and several TNCs have emerged, including Uber, Lyft, Didi Chuxing, Ola, and Cabify, to name a few. This new industry has posed several challenges to policymakers: on the one hand, riders have been using these new mobility services due to several advantages they offer for specific types of trips. The advantages of this form of door-to-door, car-based mobility, as reported by users, include short travel time and waiting time, ease of payment, fare transparency, no need of finding or paying for parking, no need to drive after drinking alcohol, and increased comfort (Rayle et al. 2016; Henao 2017; Tang et al. 2019; Tirachini and del Río 2019). On the other hand, even though ride-hailing has the potential to reduce car ownership, this does not straightforwardly translate into a reduction of traffic levels and traffic-related externalities. In fact, recent studies have estimated that motorised traffic has increased due to ride-hailing in several cities (Agarwal et al. 2019; Erhardt et al. 2019; Wenzel et al. 2019; Tirachini and Gomez-Lobo 2020). Moreover, whilst evidence concerning the effect of ride-hailing on car ownership remains limited, there are clear indications of drivers purchasing or leasing cars to become ride-hailing drivers (Agarwal et al. 2019; Tirachini 2019), oftentimes incentivised by companies like Uber, which arrange partnerships with local car dealers in countries such as Mexico and India.Footnote 2 Beyond the mobility effects of ride-hailing (Surveyed in Jin et al. 2018; Tirachini 2019), a crucial issue to analyse and understand is the impact of the ride-hailing industry on the labour market and associated labour regulations. Ride-hailing platforms constitute one of the most recognisable examples of the so-called sharing economy, given that a ride-hailing company does not hire workers, but each driver decides when and where to use his or her own vehicle to work. Companies such as Uber, which has an estimated 3.9 million drivers worldwide,Footnote 3 rest upon a novel approach to labour relationships that is at the core of the ride-hailing business model: drivers are not employees but partners. This assertion has also been a noticeable source of conflict between ride-hailing companies and regulators in several countries. While the number of drivers and cities in which ride-hailing companies operate continues to grow, regulators struggle to find appropriate ways to balance all of the interests involved when deciding to accept (or ban) ride-hailing companies (Flores and Rayle 2017). For instance, between December 2018 and September 2019: In the United Kingdom, Uber announced that it would fight a decision by the Court of Appeal that would force the company to acknowledge its drivers as regular workers.Footnote 4 In Argentina, workers from Uber, Glovo, and Rappi decided to form their own workers’ union.Footnote 5 In California, lawmakers were in talks about passing a new law that would require Uber and Lyft to treat contract workers as employees.Footnote 6 In India, Uber and Ola drivers, who had been staging large strikes since 2017, continued their protests. These drivers had bought new vehicles on loan thinking these companies would follow through on their promise of helping them generate high income as ride-hailing drivers. Instead, these drivers found themselves incapable of paying back these loans due to the reduction of fares and fees that these companies paid to drivers, which severely affected their income expectations (Agarwal et al. 2019). These legal struggles in the relationship between ride-hailing companies, drivers, and regulators are the centrepiece of the ride-hailing business. Having a large number of drivers available is key to the success of ride-hailing in a city, where the service works best if the necessary supply scale is reached, which happens when a car that a user requests is available within a few minutes (Castillo et al. 2018; Tirachini 2019). In this context, a deeper understanding of the ride-hailing driver’s work environment is relevant to the current debate on ride-hailing regulation. In this paper, we present and analyse the results of a survey administered to ride-hailing drivers in Chile in 2018. The survey was applied to both current and former ride-hailing drivers and included questions about sociodemographic characteristics, estimated earnings and costs, and job satisfaction, among other topics. In our study, we begin by analysing several issues not previously studied in the emerging literatureFootnote 7 on ride-hailing drivers, including an examination of risk situations faced by drivers, satisfaction levels with specific attributes of this job (e.g., earnings, transparency of information, flexibility), driving routines, reasons to quit, and opinions concerning the future deployment of automated (driverless) vehicles as a threat toward their jobs. We then provide an estimation of earnings and costs for ride-hailing drivers that is independent of the platforms themselves, and that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first of its kind in a country outside the United States. Even though the scientific literature on job satisfaction is rich (see, e.g., Freeman 1978; Clark 1997; Gazioglu and Tansel 2006; Origo and Pagani 2009), there are no econometric studies on job satisfaction for drivers who work under sharing economy platforms. In the paper, we estimate ordered probit models to uncover the variables that are statistically significant in determining the level of satisfaction with the ride-hailing driving job. Such enquiry is helpful to understand the effect of this new form of job on the labour market. The second section of this paper synthesizes past research on the sharing economy concept and the impact of ride-hailing platforms over transport systems and the labour market. The third section describes the survey and data collection process. In the fourth section, we show and discuss findings on the drivers’ earnings based on the survey data, earning-and-cost estimations, the drivers’ work routines, risks faced, job satisfaction (including the estimation of ordered probit models to explain it), and the drivers’ opinions concerning different aspects regarding the present and future of this job. Finally, in the closing section, we synthesize our findings and discuss directions for further research.",27

Choudhury,Md. Shahadat Iqbal,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Traditional approaches to developing travel behaviour models rely on household travel surveys to establish the mathematical relationship between the choices made by the travellers, the attributes of the network and socio-demographic characteristics of the travellers. However, household surveys are often affected by low response rates and reporting errors (e.g. Rolstad et al. 2011; Groves 2006). Further, the surveys are expensive to conduct which leads to small sample sizes and lower update frequencies. Consequently, transport models designed to fit household travel survey data alone can result in biased parameters capturing the noise in the data rather than the actual relationships in the population. On the other hand, there has been growing interest in the use of mobile phone data for mobility modelling over the last few decades. Among the various transport-related applications, such data has been widely used to estimate origin–destination matrices (e.g. Çolak et al. 2015; Iqbal et al. 2014; Pan et al. 2006; White and Wells 2002) and trip generation (e.g. Çolak et al. 2015). Since mobile phone data generally covers significant proportions of the population (GSM Association 2017), the data is able to reliably capture the aggregate travel patterns. However, due to its anonymous nature, mobile phone data is not traditionally used in developing mathematical models of travel behaviour that establish the relationship between observed travel behaviour and causal factors such as the attributes of the alternatives and the decision makers. The existing mobility models based on mobile phone data alone cannot be used to reliably test alternative or future travel demand scenarios, and yet this is one of the core roles of transport models. We are thus in a situation where traditional survey data is small in size, potentially unrepresentative and inaccurate, but contains information on key causal variables. On the other hand, mobile phone data is larger in size, more representative and accurate but missing information on key causal variables. This situation motivates the present research where we propose a framework that brings in a third type of data, namely census information, which is representative and contains detailed socio-demographic variables but does not have travel behaviour information. We thus combine household travel survey data, aggregate census data, and mobile phone data using a combination of population synthesis techniques (to generate realistic disaggregate artificial populations to assist with forecasting) and mathematical modelling to jointly optimise the aggregate and the disaggregate fit of travel behaviour models. In terms of the aggregate fit, we seek to minimise the error between the modelled and the zonal trip productions derived from call detail record (CDR) data, while in terms of the disaggregate fit, we seek to ensure that the model parameters represent the genuine sensitivities of individuals in the population. The framework is calibrated and tested in the context of trip generation models. In the context of trip generation, the traditional models based on household survey data establish the mathematical relationship between the number of trips made by an individual or household with the socio-demographics (see Bwambale et al. 2015 and the cited references). But the household survey data is prone to under-reporting of the number of trips (e.g. Zhao et al. 2015; Stopher et al. 2007; Itsubo and Hato 2006). Aggregating models based only on household survey data for estimating the zonal travel patterns can lead to errors, with serious consequences for the different steps of the four-stage model. This prompts us to investigate various ways of adjusting the parameter scales of the traditional trip generation model by using a joint optimisation process to combine it with the trip patterns derived from the mobile phone data. We adopt a joint optimisation approach because CDR data too is inherently noisy, and thus not error-free. Given the lack of knowledge about which datasource really represents the ground truth, it would also be unrealistic to benchmark one dataset over the other. In the proposed joint modelling framework, the base trip generation model is first estimated using household travel survey data alone to obtain the parameter priors (i.e. the sensitivities). The parameter scales are then adjusted in three different approached (without changing the prior parameter signs). The joint models hence explain the reported trips for each individual in the household survey data and ensure that the aggregated zonal trip productions are close to those derived from CDR data. This ensures that the joint models do not lose the travel behaviour sensitivities reflected in the household survey data and is computationally tractable.

Smart,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The notion of commuting for work often assumes a neat division between a distant single workplace and home. Yet not all jobs take place entirely in a single workplace location. Truck drivers, repairpersons, and traveling salespersons have long challenged this simple conception of work location, and conducting work remotely from one’s home has been a viable option for some workers for decades. Recent advances in information and communication technology (ICT) may further diversify work locations for those knowledge workers whose occupations are most capable of being done remotely. Principally, the adoption of mobile cloud computing infrastructure allows workers to be better connected to colleagues, clients and work information from home, but also from locations beyond the home such as cafés, and anywhere else by connection through Internet networks. This paper explores the relationship between work location and travel among United States knowledge workers using American Time Use Survey data from 2003 to 2017. In this study we seek to test recent findings using Canadian time use data (Lachapelle et al. 2017) in an American context, and build upon it using different analyses on knowledge workers and including trip purpose. These years encompass a large time period of knowledge work practice utilizing Internet software enabled by mobile cloud computing, such as the widespread use of web-accessible email. We define four categories of alternate work location: working from one’s own home, working from other people’s homes, working from cafés/libraries, and working from vehicles, and construct a nominal variable that captures both single location and multiple location workers. Using this variable, we first highlight time trends and spatial patterns in the practice of alternate work location in the United States. Secondly, we apply this variable in determining how alternate work location practices interact with daily travel patterns considering both work and non-work-related travel. We do this by modeling the relationship of work location with duration of daily travel and participation in morning and evening peak hour travel period, answering the following two research questions: Which daily work location arrangements are related to decreased or increased travel duration? Which daily work location arrangements are related to peak or off peak travel? We also describe a potential mechanism within this relationship through a survival analysis of daily departure times based on work locations. The conclusion considers how telework might play a larger role in travel demand management strategies in light of our findings.",21

Graham,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Short-run supply optimisation has a long-standing history at the boundary between transport planning and economics. The elementary principles of microeconomic theory suggest that, no matter which mode we consider, capacity variablesFootnote 1 such as road width or service frequency should be increased up until the point where the marginal operational cost of further expansion equals the marginal benefit delivered to users. The outcome of this capacity rule in combination with usage fees capturing the marginal social cost of travelling ensure that supply maximises the economic efficiency of service provision (Small and Verhoef 2007). In public transport, multiple variables can be considered as a representation of capacity, and the evolution of the underlying literature follows the discovery of the links between new capacity variables and the corresponding user costs. First, the tension between the cost of service frequency and average waiting time is investigated by Mohring (1972, (1976). In the second phase the literature recognises that not only waiting time, but also the in-vehicle travel time may depend on service frequency through the time required to board and alight at intermediate stops (Jansson 1980; Jara-Díaz and Gschwender 2003; Basso and Jara-Díaz 2012; Jara-Díaz and Tirachini 2013). Third, vehicle size is considered as another supply variable which determines a theoretical upper bound of vehicle loads (Jansson 1980; Basso and Silva 2014) as well as the magnitude of inconvenience of crowding (Jara-Díaz and Gschwender 2003; Tirachini et al. 2014). Further capacity variables may include the spatial density of lines (Kocur and Hendrickson 1982; Chang and Schonfeld 1991; Small 2004) and stops (Mohring 1972; Basso et al. 2011; Tirachini 2014), both affecting the time users require to access a boarding location or reach the trip destination after alighting. The majority of the literature cited above concentrates on the derivation of optimal supply as a function of aggregate demand conditions. The representative origin-destination pair is the most usual spatial setup of the models. Exceptions include Rietveld and van Woudenberg (2007) and Pels and Verhoef (2007), for example, who do allow for fluctuations in demand along a public transport line, but these variations are exogenously fixed throughout their investigation. In terms of temporal demand patterns, some authors, including Newell (1971), Oldfield and Bly (1988), Chang and Schonfeld (1991), Rietveld et al. (2002), Jara-Díaz et al. (2017), consider daily demand variations with a fixed fleet composition. The lesson that off-peak fleet underutilisation is inevitable will be important in this paper. Several network optimisation models are also relevant to this paper. They study demand patterns on a larger spatial scale, i.e. on the level of a simple network with one transfer hub (Gschwender et al. 2016), an urban grid (Daganzo 2010), a radial network (Badia et al. 2014), or a parametric city (Fielbaum et al. 2016), and derive the optimal operational response in terms of network configuration. However, demand imbalances within individual lines are suppressed in their models, and they rather focus on the tension between transfer costs and scale economies. This paper can be considered as a generalisation of spatial and temporal demand imbalances. Our model recognises that operators serve multiple spatio-temporally differentiated markets along a public transport line, with the same second-best capacity generating joint costs. We analyse whether the magnitude of imbalance in demand has a predictable impact on the optimal supply strategy. Hörcher and Graham (2018) show in the simplest back-haul settingFootnote 2 that the asymmetry in demand between jointly served markets may have crucial impact on (1) the optimal capacity, (2) the equilibrium occupancy rate of vehicles and thus the crowding experience of passengers, (3) optimal pricing decisions, and (4) the financial and economic performance of public transport provision. In this follow-up paper we expand the spatial scope of analysis from the back-haul problem to entire public transport lines. In this research the authors extend the analysis of the back-haul problem to a more realistic urban public transport setting: a transit line along which capacity is still indivisible due to operational constraints, but more than two origin-destination pairs have to be served. We investigate what may be a suitable measure of demand imbalances in this setting that could replace the share of main haul demand in total ridership in the back-haul problem (Hörcher and Graham 2018). We show that what matters in a network is not only the spread of demand between line sections, but also the spread of costs between them. For example, the cost of excess demand is higher on long line sections for the customers, as crowding inconvenience increases with the time spent inside the vehicle. Similarly, variable operational costs such as asset maintenance and driver costs are higher on long line sections. To characterise the joint distribution of demand and social costs, we propose the Gini coefficient of demand imbalances, a statistical index frequently used in macroeconomics as a measure of income inequality (Handcock and Morris 2006). Delivering the core contribution of the paper, in a series of randomised numerical simulations we show that the Gini index can be identified as an important predictor of the socially optimal service frequency and vehicle size. The results are partly driven by the fact that if demand concentrates in certain sections of the line, forming a bottleneck, then crowding costs become very important relative to other user costs, and welfare maximisation requires that the operator reacts with the assignment of larger vehicles to the entire line.Footnote 3 This finding remains robust in three simulation scenarios with inelastic as well as elastic demand systems. Beside their impact on optimal supply-side decision variables, demand imbalances imply that the average operational cost of transporting a passenger as well as the optimal flat (or distance-dependent) fare increase, and the operator requires more compensation from the public budget in the form of direct subsidies. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 sets the field with a descriptive analysis a demand patterns along real urban public transport lines. Section 3 explains the methodology of the analysis, including a detailed description of the three scenarios we investigate and the process of generating synthetic demand patterns in Sect. 3.3. Subsequently, Sect. 4 delivers the main results of the quantitative work, the three scenarios being split into separate subsections. Finally, Sect. 5 discusses our conclusions.",8

The VTT expresses travel time changes in monetary values (Small 2012). Due to its importance for transport policies and appraisal, the VTT is one of the most researched notions in transport economics (Abrantes and Wardman 2011). Most Western societies conduct studies to determine the VTT on a regular basis. The focus of such VTT studies is typically not to obtain a single (mean) VTT for all trips, but rather to obtain tables of VTTs which show how the VTT depends on trip characteristics, such as travel purpose and mode. Despite decades of experience with data collection and VTT inference, the best way to obtain the VTT is still under debate. Early studies predominantly used Revealed Preference (RP) data in combination with Multinomial Logit (MNL) models (Wardman et al. 2016). However, despite the well-known advantages of RP data over Stated Choice (SC) data (Train 2003), nowadays RP data are seldom used in VTT studies. The main reason is that while the travellers’ choices are observable, their actual trade-offs across alternatives are not—which hampers estimation of the VTT using RP data. More recent VTT studies therefore favour using SC data in combination with discrete choice models that account for (some of the) potential artefacts of the SC experiment (notably size and sign effects) (Fosgerau et al. 2007; Ramjerdi et al. 2010; Börjesson and Eliasson 2014; Kouwenhoven et al. 2014; Hess et al. 2017). In one of the most common kind of VTT SC experiment travellers are presented a binary within-mode choice task where the alternatives are made up out of travel cost and travel time only. Recent VTT studies report particularly good results with so-called Random Valuation models when analysing data from this type of SC experiments (Fosgerau and Bierlaire 2009; Börjesson and Eliasson 2014; Ojeda-Cabral et al. 2018). Besides discrete choice models, nowadays nonparametric methods are increasingly pioneered in VTT studies (Fosgerau 2006, 2007). These methods are methodologically appealing as they do not make assumptions regarding the shape of the VTT distribution and the structure of the error terms. However, despite their methodological elegance they are typically not used to derive VTTs for appraisal. Rather, they are used as a first, complementary, step to learn about the shape of the distribution of the VTT, after which parametric discrete choice models are estimated to derive VTTs for appraisal. Börjesson and Eliasson (2014) argue that nonparametric methods are not suitable to compute VTTs for appraisal for three reasons. First, they (often) cannot incorporate covariates. Second, they (often) cannot account for panel effects. Third, they (often) do not recover the VTT distribution over its entire domain. That is, the distribution right of the highest VTT bid is not recovered, which hinders computation of the mean VTT. Very recently, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are gaining ground in the travel behaviour research arena (e.g. Mohammadian and Miller 2002; Cantarella and de Luca 2005; Karlaftis and Vlahogianni 2011; Omrani et al. 2013; Pereira et al. 2015; Alwosheel et al. 2018; Wong et al. 2017; Golshani et al. 2018; Lee et al. 2018; Sifringer et al. 2020; Van Cranenburgh and Alwosheel 2019; Wang et al. 2020). ANNs are mathematical models which are loosely inspired by the structure and functional aspects of biological neural systems. A fundamental difference between discrete choice models and ANNs is the modelling paradigm to which they belong. Discrete choice models are theory-driven, while ANNs are data-driven. Theory-driven models work from the principle that the true Data Generating Process (DGP) is a (stochastic) function, which can be uncovered (Erdem et al. 2005). To do so, the analyst imposes structure on the model. In the context of discrete choice models this is done by prescribing the utility function, the decision rule, the error term structure, etc. Then, the analyst estimates the model’s parameters, usually compares competing models, and interprets the results in light of the theory. An advantage of such a theory-driven method is that its theoretical framework provides solid ground to interpret the model and its outcomes. A drawback is however that it heavily relies on potentially erroneous assumptions regarding choice behaviour, i.e. the assumptions may not accurately describe the true underlying DGP—leading to erroneous inferences. Data-driven methods work from the principle that the true underlying process is complex and inherently unknown. In a data-driven modelling paradigm the aim is not to uncover the DGP, but rather to learn a function that accurately approximates the underlying DGP. The typical outcome in a data-driven modelling paradigm is a network which has good prediction performance (Karlaftis and Vlahogianni 2011). A drawback of many data-driven methods is that—without further intervention—they provide limited (behavioural) insights on the underlying DGP, such as the relative importance of attributes, Willingness-to-Pay, or VTT. This holds especially true for ANNs, which are widely considered black boxes (Castelvecchi 2016), amongst other things, because it is impossible to interpret or diagnose ANNs by looking at the weights of the network. In fact, the weights will tell the analyst nothing about the importance of attributes, or whether the ANN has learned intuitively correct relationships, as opposed to spurious ones (see Alwosheel et al. 2019 for recent work in choice modelling to open-up ANN’s black boxes). Yet, these behavioural insights are typically most valuable to travel behaviour researchers and for transport policy-making. In the field of travel behaviour research there is a general sense that ANNs (and other data-driven models), could complement existing (predominantly) theory-driven research efforts (Chen et al. 2016). In light of that spirit, this paperFootnote 1 develops an ANN-based method to investigate the VTT distribution. This method blends theory-driven and data-driven modelling paradigms. Specifically, we develop a novel pattern recognition ANN which is able to estimate travellers’ individual underlying VTTs based on the behavioural notion of indifference. Our method capitalises on the strong prediction performance of ANNs (see Paliwal and Kumar 2009 for a comprehensive review of articles that involve a comparative study of ANNs and statistical techniques). The strength of this method is that it is possible to uncover the VTT distribution (and its moments) without making assumptions on the underlying behaviour. For instance, it does not prescribe the utility function, the shape of the VTT distribution, or the structure of the error terms. Moreover, the method can incorporate covariates, account for panel effects and does yield a distribution right of the maximum VTT bid. Thereby, it overcomes important limitations associated with some other nonparametric methods. Finally, the method does not require extensive software coding on the side of the analyst as the method is built on a standard MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) architecture. Hence, the method can be applied using off-the-shelf (open-source) software. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section ""Methodology"" develops the ANN-based method for uncovering the VTT distribution. Section ""Results"" conducts a series of Monte Carlo analyses to assess how well the method works. Section ""Application to real VTT data"" applies the method to an empirical VTT data set from a recent VTT study. Section ""Cross-validation"" cross-validates the method by comparing its results with those obtained using a series of state-of-the-art discrete choice models and nonparametric methods. Finally, Section ""Conclusions and discussion"" draws conclusions and provides a discussion.",6

Asborno,Sarah Hernandez,Manzi Yves,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"In the context of public and private transportation infrastructure investment, projects compete for limited funding and resources. Thus, evaluation and prioritization of competing projects is critical, and of the methods available, all rely in part on estimation of benefits relative to costs. Calculation of benefits necessitates detailed estimation of the types and magnitude of project impacts associated with the project’s area of influence (Hurtado et al. 2016; Weisbord and Reno 2009). Therefore, it is important to clearly and consistently define the extent, location, and characteristics of a project’s area of influence. The area of influence of a project affecting a multimodal freight facility can be defined as the region where the facility draws and delivers freight, or the connected origin–destination (OD) pairs served by the facility (Vadali et al. 2017). Despite general agreement on conceptual and qualitative identification of a project’s economic area of influence (National Academy of Sciences, Engineering,and Medicine 2014; Vadali et al. 2017), little published work is available to define such areas for freight projects using data-driven approaches. Instead, planning agencies within state Departments of Transportation (DOTs) and at Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) rely on professional judgement to define the extent, coverage, and location of a project’s area of influence (AASHTO 2015). As a result, there is a lack of a systematic method to determine areas of influence for competing projects. This leads to unfair competition among projects from different agencies and jurisdictions which may each use different and subjective means to define areas to measure project benefits. To ensure fair comparisons, the location, coverage and extent of the area of influence of different projects should be determined by following the same, systematic methodology. State-of-the practice methods to identify the area of influence of a project consist primarily of selecting an arbitrary radial perimeter around the facility (Institute of Transportation Engineers 2010; NADO Research Foundation 2011; Carroll et al. 2017). For freight related projects, however, this method ignores complex interactions among freight supply chain components (e.g. truck, rail, water) and longer travel distances. Instead, the area of influence of a project affecting a freight facility can be better defined as the coverage and extent of freight movements generated by the facility (where “generation” is considered as production and attraction of goods), or the OD pairs and paths served by the freight modes using the facility. This has been referred to in this paper as the “freight-shed” or “catchment” area, borrowing from transit studies (Andersen and Landex 2008). Freight OD pairs may be obtained from project-specific data like stakeholder surveys or traffic counts and/or statewide travel demand models (TDM). Project-specific data can be time consuming to collect, expensive, and subjective. In the case of annual traffic counts, they may not be available at or near the project and do not provide data on freight paths. If a statewide freight TDM exists, the OD pairs and paths served by a freight facility might be estimated by performing a ‘select link analysis’ (Alliance Transportation Group and Cambridge Systematics 2015). However, although TDMs contain representative models of the roadway network, they often do not provide robust depictions of water and rail networks and are thus unsuitable for multimodal freight catchment analyses (Alliance Transportation Group and Cambridge Systematics 2015; Donnelly et al. 2018). For example, the statewide TDM in Arkansas (ARSTDM) contains a multimodal mode choice model, but only performs trip assignment for highway flows and not vessel flows because waterways are not part of the model network (Alliance Transportation Group and Cambridge Systematics 2015). This is a notable limitation considering the key benefits of the Arkansas River to the state economy (Nachtmann 2015). In addition, network representation in TDMs often lacks the level of detail necessary to represent actual roadway geometry, i.e. port access roads may not be represented. Moreover, TDMs are predictive/forecasting tools, and do not constitute direct observation of existing flows. In contrast, the systematic method developed in this paper mines direct observations of truck and vessel tracking data to provide multimodal movements and patterns to and from freight facilities. The lack of guidance regarding multimodal catchment area definitions can be attributed in part to the heterogeneity of the data used for this purpose. In a freight supply chain, the catchment area contains several modes, freight facilities, and industries, which would be better represented (and linked together) by spatially and temporally continuous data, such as historical truck and vessel paths. To overcome the limitations in defining catchment areas for freight facilities, this paper leverages two sources of “big data” to identify multimodal freight paths: truck Global Position System (GPS) and marine Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The main contribution of this paper is a novel, automated geospatial data fusion method to identify the multimodal freight-shed of a project using ubiquitous vehicle tracking data. Conceptually, multimodal freight tracking data is used to characterize spatial patterns of freight intensity. In particular, GPS tracking data from trucks and marine vessels accessing freight facilities are mined to identify stops and to find complete paths which are then mapped to a high resolution, multimodal transportation network. The geographical coverage of the truck and vessel trips define the “multimodal catchment” area of the project. In this way, all competing projects are subject to identical criteria for catchment area definition, providing a common basis for funding prioritization. For new projects, where TDMs are relied upon for project evaluation, the methods in this paper provide a means to calibrate and validate TDMs so that they produce more accurate forecasts of multimodal catchment areas. The methodology is applied to freight ports located on inland navigable waterways, although it can be applied to other infrastructure including bridges, railyards, and warehouses. Beyond benefit-costs analyses, quantitative definitions of multimodal catchment areas further support efforts to: (1) quantify multimodal performance measures, (2) visualize the extent of transportation impacts of extreme weather events (such as flooding), (3) estimate population exposures to pollutants or congestion effects induced by freight facilities by analyzing vehicle-miles and vehicle-hours travelled per mode, (4) identify areas of potential modal competition, and (5) support travel demand models which rely heavily on directly observed data for calibration.",5

Triggers and trajectories of bike–train uptake in the Randstad area,December 2021,Samuel Nello-Deakin,Marco te Brömmelstroet,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Cycling is typically considered to be an attractive transport option for distances up to 5 km for utilitarian trips, making it primarily suitable for intra-city trips (Chillón et al. 2016; Kager et al. 2016; McNeil 2011). For this reason, urban cycling environments tend to be conceptualized and studied at a neighbourhood- or city-wide scale (Muhs and Clifton 2016; Nielsen and Skov-Petersen 2018). Medium-sized cities are often seen as the most conducive to cycling; in larger conurbations, longer trip distances mean that motorised or public transport are likely to become a more attractive transport option (Rietveld and Daniel 2004). Train travel, meanwhile, operates at a much larger spatial range, but the accessibility it provides is largely restricted to the vicinity of train stations, typically leading to a node-based form of urban development (Newman et al. 2016). Recent research, however, suggests that the combined use of bicycle and train as part of a trip chain dramatically expands both the spatial reach of cycling and the door-to-door accessibility of the train (Kager et al. 2016). While the use of cycling as a feeder mode for last mile trips to and from train stations has attracted a moderate amount of research (e.g. Givoni and Rietveld 2007; Martens 2004; Rietveld 2000), it is only recently that it has been suggested that the bicycle-train combination should be understood as a distinct mode of transport in its own right. According to Kager et al. (2016), the synergy between bicycle and train leads to a hybrid form of transport which combines the spatial flexibility of cycling with the speed of train travel. Likewise, Lee, Choi and Leem (2016) argue that the combination of bicycle and train provides a way to overcome the limited spatial reach of transit-oriented development, in what they refer to as “bicycle-based transit-oriented development”. In doing so, the bike–train system potentially offers both a means of “scaling up” cycling-based mobility beyond the local scale, and “optimising” regional train travel. This combination of speed and flexibility makes the bike–train combination a promising alternative to potentially replace many car trips (Kager et al. 2016; Jonkeren et al. 2018). Given its potential to act as a potential alternative to car travel, academic research on the bicycle-train combination (and bicycle-transit more generally) has grown significantly in recent years. In a recently published article, van Mil et al. (2020) provide a valuable review of the main factors which influence bike–train use, classifying them into transit-related factors, first/last-mile factors and context. As their article documents, high quality public transport, good cycling facilities (e.g. bike lanes, bike parking at stations), and a well-developed local cycling culture are some of the key factors which are associated with high levels of bike–train use. The character and focus of existing research on the bike–train combination, however, vary substantially between geographic settings, responding to the disparate realities of bike–train use in different contexts. In North American cities, the bicycle is primarily seen as a potential solution to first/last mile access trips to rail stations in suburban settings, which are difficult to serve by alternative means of transport (Mitra and Schofield 2019). As various studies have suggested (Boarnet et al. 2017; Zuo et al. 2020), cycling to transit can markedly improve public transport accessibility in North American cities, especially for low income and minority groups, and therefore potentially offers an effective means of increasing transit equity. Low levels of cycling and public transport use mean that the overall volume of bike–train trips in North America nonetheless remains small, even though an increasing number of American cities have implemented infrastructural and policy measures to improve bike-transit integration (Pucher and Buehler 2009). As documented by Ravensberger et al. (2018), safety concerns, lack of adequate bicycle parking, lack of comfort and personal appearance concerns remain strong barriers to increased bike–train use in a North American context. Another setting in which the bike–train combination has attracted noticeable attention is China. Building on the country’s rich cycling history, the bike–train combination is seen as a way of solving the accessibility problems associated to rapid urbanisation and providing access to growing urban rail networks (Pan et al. 2010). Among others, Zhao and Li (2017) have explored determinants of bike use to access metro stations; in addition, the rise and prominence of bikesharing in many Chinese cities have made the combination of transit and bikesharing a topic of especial interest for researchers (e.g. Ji et al. 2017). However, the bicycle-rail combination is by far the most developed in the Netherlands, which has the highest cycling rates in the world (Harms et al. 2014) and also possesses a highly developed rail network. For this same reason, the Netherlands has attracted the lion’s share of existing research on bike–train travel. In recent years, a growing number of studies focusing on the Netherlands have provided an incipient understanding of bike–train trip patterns and user characteristics within the Dutch context (Shelat et al. 2018; Jonkeren et al. 2019). Albeit not to the same extent as in the Netherlands, the bicycle-train combination is also popular in other mature cycling countries such as Denmark: as documented in a study by Olafsson et al. (2016) in a representative sample of the Danish population, about 12% of the Danish population use cycling as a means of reaching public transport. Despite the increasing number of available studies on bike–train use, to the best of our knowledge no study has explicitly focused on identifying the triggers which lead people to start travelling by bike–train. Through a retrospective longitudinal survey with people who have begun commuting by bike–train, the present paper aims to identify the main triggers and trajectoriesFootnote 1 of bike–train uptake in the Netherlands. This is highly relevant in an international context where many countries and cities are seeking alternatives to car-based travel, and look to the bike–train combination as a potential candidate (Krizek and Stonebraker 2011): identifying triggers of bike–train uptake can yield valuable policy recommendations as to how effectively promote bike–train use. Our research seeks to address the following three sub-questions: What travel behaviours are being replaced by bike–train trips?Footnote 2 What are the main triggers of bike–train uptake? What is the relationship between bike–train uptake and existing travel behaviour? By answering these questions, the present paper increases our understanding of the processes and drivers which sustain and reinforce the bike–train system. In doing so, it provides further insight into the potential of the bike–train system to provide an alternative to car-oriented patterns of regional mobility and development, both in the Netherlands and internationally. Admittedly, our results are specific to the Dutch context; given the unique characteristics of the bike–train system in the Netherlands, our findings are unlikely to be directly representative or extrapolatable to other contexts in various respect. However, their value lies precisely in the fact that they provide an insight into the characteristics and dynamics of what a mature bike–train system looks like. This can help other countries obtain a better understanding of the necessary physical and social environment conditions required in order to achieve widespread levels of bike–train uptake. In the next section, we provide a short overview of the bike–train system in the Netherlands. We then present the conceptual framework used to guide our research, which draws on the “mobility biographies” approach (Müggenburg et al. 2015); this is followed by a description of our methodology. In the findings section, we present some details on bike–train trip and respondent characteristics, and then proceed to address our sub-questions, each in a separate sub-section. We close the paper with a final discussion and conclusion, in which we elaborate on our findings and their implications.",4

Empirical evidence from San Francisco,April 2022,Gregory D. Erhardt,Richard Alexander Mucci,Joe Castiglione,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Uber launched in San Francisco in 2010, and Lyft followed in 2012, providing on-demand car rides booked through a smartphone app. These ride-hailing services, or transportation network companies (TNCs) resemble a taxi service, but are typically provided by “gig workers” driving their personal vehicles. TNCs have since expanded rapidly, serving more than 250 metro areas in the US and 700 globally. Most trips in the US are in nine large metro areas (Schaller 2018), and are further concentrated in the downtown cores of those metro areas (Schaller 2018; Feigon and Murphy 2018; Fehr and Peers 2019). These are the same areas where public transit ridership is highest, raising the question of how these two transportation services interact. Specifically, do TNCs increase or decrease public transit ridership? TNCs could complement public transit and increase ridership in several ways. First, TNCs could serve as first and last mile feeders to transit and increase transit ridership by increasing the number of people who can access it. Second, TNCs could complement transit by providing service to locations and at times-of-day not well served by transit, making journeys without a private car more feasible (Feigon and Murphy 2016). Third, TNCs have the potential to reduce car ownership, with lower car ownership leading to with higher transit use. Conversely, TNCs may reduce public transit use by competing for the same riders. TNCs offer door-to-door service in private vehicles at a cost lower than traditional taxis primarily in areas already well-served by transit. In this research, we use the best available data to measure the overall net effect of TNCs on transit ridership in San Francisco, considering the timing and location of TNC trips and comparing to what would happen without TNCs. Past studies of the effect of TNCs on transit ridership produced variable results. Several studies suggest TNCs either increase transit ridership or complement public transit (Hall et al. 2018; Feigon and Murphy 2016, 2018; Rayle et al. 2016; Alemi and Rodier 2017). Other studies found an insignificant effect on transit ridership or one that varies for different years of analysis (Boisjoly et al. 2018; Malalgoda and Lim 2019; Nelson and Sadowsky 2019). Among those studies with significant results, most found that TNCs reduce bus ridership (Babar and Burtch 2020; Clewlow and Mishra 2017; Doppelt 2018; Li 2019; Henao 2017; Gehrke et al. 2018; Graehler et al. 2019) and increase commuter rail ridership (Babar and Burtch 2020; Clewlow and Mishra 2017; Doppelt 2018). The effect on light rail and subway ridership depends on the study. Few cities have data on TNC use, which limits research and may contribute to these mixed results. Instead, several previous studies used proxies such as the start date of TNC operations to identify the correlation with transit ridership trends at the scale of metropolitan areas (Hall et al. 2018; Boisjoly et al. 2018; Malalgoda and Lim 2019; Babar and Burtch 2020; Nelson and Sadowsky 2019; Doppelt 2018; Graehler et al. 2019). Others used travel surveys to observe individual travel patterns, including who uses TNCs and what other modes they use (Rayle et al. 2016; Feigon and Murphy 2016; Henao 2017; Clewlow and Mishra 2017; Gehrke et al. 2018; Circella et al. 2019; Young and Farber 2019; Grahn et al. 2019; Dong 2020). A third set of studies takes a more theoretical approach, running models or scenarios to test possible effects rather than estimating the effects directly from the data (Kessler 2017; Alemi and Rodier 2017; Martinez and Viegas 2017). Our research takes a different approach: we used a unique data set scraped from the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) of two TNCs to infer where within a city TNC trips occur and at which times-of-day (Cooper et al. 2018). These detailed data are important, because the location and timing of TNC trips directly affects the modes with which they compete (Roy et al. 2020). Previous work in Toronto and at San Francisco airport leveraged detailed TNC data (Li 2019; Sturgeon 2019; Young et al. 2020), while other work that used spatially detailed transit ridership data but did not consider TNC data (Mucci and Erhardt 2018; Berrebi and Watkins 2020). TNC trips concentrate in city centers where transit ridership is highest (Schaller 2018; Feigon and Murphy 2018; Fehr and Peers 2019), and in the biggest cities during peak travel times (Gehrke et al. 2018; San Francisco County Transportation Authority 2017). The same travelers often make trips by both transit and TNC (Feigon and Murphy 2016; Zhang and Zhang 2018). These relationships do not establish either complementarity or competition. In fact, cross-sectional revealed preference data are inherently limited in their ability to distinguish between complementary and competitive trips because both would occur in similar places and times and among the same travelers. Instead, we must also consider what would have happened without TNCs. TNC rider surveys asking this question directly provide insight, suggesting between 15 and 42% of TNC trips otherwise would have been via transit (Gehrke et al. 2018; Henao 2017). However, they do not capture potential indirect effects, such as lifestyle and car-ownership changes, and we do not know the quality transit trips they replace. We address this issue using a before-and-after approach. Specifically, we compared San Francisco bus and light rail ridership in 2010 before the introduction of TNCs to ridership in 2015 when TNCs were widespread. We estimated panel data regression models of transit ridership as a function of TNCs, controlling for household and employment growth, transit service changes and other relevant factors. These models represent average weekday conditions for 981 Traffic Analysis Zones (TAZs) and 4 times-of-day. To validate the panel model findings, we also estimated time-series models of bus ridership over the same period. Together, these models let us infer the net transit ridership change attributable to TNCs and to each of our control factors.",26

Erhardt,Reginald R. Souleyrette,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In his review of the 50-year history of travel forecasting, Hartgen (2013) said, “The greatest knowledge gap in US travel demand modeling is the unknown accuracy of US urban road traffic forecasts.” Researchers have improved travel demand forecasting methods in recent decades but invested relatively little in understanding their accuracy. This underinvestment is unfortunate because accurate forecasts improve decisions about the evaluation, selection and design of transportation projects. The absence of data has been the major barrier to the study of travel forecast accuracy (Nicolaisen and Driscoll 2014). This deficiency arose because accumulating the data needed for retrospective analysis requires proactive planning. The responsible agencies do not commonly preserve and archive forecasts, and so often lose these data. Long project development cycles and staff attrition make recovering this information cumbersome. In National Cooperative Highway Research Program Project 08-110, we assembled those data, compiling a database of forecast traffic and post-opening traffic counts for 1291 road projects in six states in the United States (US) and four European countries. This resulted in the largest known database of forecast accuracy. We used those data to assess the accuracy of the forecasts, and identify the factors related to better or worse accuracy. The data points span from 1960 to 2017 and do not consider the effects of reduced travel due to COVID-19. The final report from that project, NCHRP Report 934 (Erhardt et al. 2020), contains detailed descriptions of the data cleaning and exploration, several case studies identifying the causes of inaccuracy, and recommendations for improving practice. This paper represents a distinct and independent extension of the NCHRP study. In addition to summarizing key findings for the readers of Transportation, we extend the analysis here to consider how and why forecast accuracy changes over time, to examine the effect of the Great Recession on forecast accuracy, and to place our work more clearly in the context of the academic literature.",5

These pilot studies target investigations of user acceptance and vehicle operation of AB in transport systems. Most pilot studies either offer last-mile connections from a transportation hub or close a transportation gap between two stations. When operating AB as a transport mode on fixed routes the operating costs are expected to reduce by ca. 50% compared to conventional bus operations (Lidestam et al. 2018). Walters (1982) showed that an operating cost reduction facilitates a shift in resource allocation towards higher service frequencies and lower vehicle capacities. With higher frequencies and smaller vehicles changes in the route network layout are possible. Eluru and Choudhury (2019) present eight different studies discussing potential impacts of autonomous vehicles on trip generation, vehicle-miles traveled and other transport related metrics. All these studies assume demand-responsive autonomous vehicles no line-based operations. In contrast to these studies, we elaborate more holistically on the impacts of autonomous vehicles on the combined operator, infrastructure and user costs on fixed-line services, which deepens the understanding of system level impacts due to AB deployment. Additionally we can get insights in how the reduction of operator costs in case of AB deployment effects the level of service for public transport users. The transit network design and frequency setting problem (TNDFSP) is characterized as creating an optimal set of public transport bus routes including the service frequency for each bus route operating in the network. The problem has been subject to extensive research in the last decades. However, even though vehicle automation has the potential to greatly impact service design properties, it has not yet been systematically investigated. In this work, we formulate a variant of the TNDFSP that caters for the characteristics of AB and hence allows examining the potential impacts of its deployment on service design. With the deployment of AB additional constraints regarding the connectivity of the bus lines are required. More specifically every bus stop should be connected in the network with every other bus, so that all bus stops can be reached by any bus. This property has not been considered in past TNDFSP formulations. The line-based network characteristics and the connectivity constraint are motivated twofold. First, the use of a line-based public transport system is known to most people and has been accepted for a long time and has important merits in serving the bulk of the travel demand. Second, the legal operation of autonomous buses in most urban environments is currently bound to certain areas and or specific roads. The legislative framework does not allow for the deployment of large fleet sizes in flexible operational environments; hence the line-based mode of operation is seen as the first practical use case. By adding line-based and connectivity characteristics to the problem formulation the study investigates near future and transition scenarios from traditional to autonomous public transport operations. Additionally, the deployment of AB affects the operational cost structure by reducing the crew cost as well as the infrastructure cost by increased costs for AB specific road or bus stop enhancements. The impact of both cost terms on the TNDFSP has not been studied previously. Further, the majority of past research on TNDFSP requires PT networks to serve every bus stop. In this AB specific TNDFSP the bus stop position is an output value. Thus, not every potential bus stop in the area of interest has to be served. This allows for a network design which is simultaneously benefiting operator focused designs and serving the demand with a user perspective in mind. In this study, we investigate how the network design (number of routes and route alignment), the infrastructure (number of bus stops and network length), operating and traveler costs are affected by changed supply characteristics (service frequency and vehicle capacity) induced by AB. Additionally, the study investigates the impact of changes in supply provision on user costs and consequently its potential impacts on ridership. Furthermore, structural differences in user-focused network design and operator-focused network design are investigated. We solve the TNDFSP using a simulation-based multi-objective optimization framework. The created solutions are constrained by the maximum number of routes, the maximum service frequency and number of bus stops per route. The use of a agent-based simulation module allows the simulation of walking as a transportation mode. By this passengers have the option to board a bus or walk at every bus stop and at every point in time. This is achieved by additional walking links added to the network design problem. The remaining of the paper is structured as follows. First, the relevant literature is reviewed in the  ""Literature review"" section. Then the methodology of this study is described in ""Methodology"". In the ""Case study"" section the case study is detailed. The following ""Results"" section discusses the impact of AB on the network design, differences between user-focused and operator-focused PT networks and benchmark results. The remaining of the paper ""Discussion and conclusion"" critically assesses the results and concludes about the applicability of the framework. This section closes with an outlook, sketching directions for potential future studies.",7

By July 1, 2020, more than 10 million cases were reported worldwide resulting in more than 513,000 casualties.Footnote 1 Due to the rapid spread of this virus, on February 28, 2020, the Indonesian government declared it a pandemic disaster (Indonesia National Disaster Management Agency 2020). On March 2, 2020, approximately 11 days after the first 2 confirmed cases, the national government established a task force for rapid response to COVID-19 patients, as directly ordered by the President (Ministry of State Secretariat 2020). However, in the beginning of pandemic, the national government preferred mobility and activity restriction rather than a partial- or full-fledge lockdown (AHK Indonesien 2020). Since April 18, 2020, the national government approved enforcement of partial-fledge lockdown (or large-scale social restriction policy) in 18 regions in Indonesia. This policy is stated in the Minister of Health Regulation No. 9, the Year 2020 consisting of workplace and school closure, restriction of social, cultural, and religious activities, and the operation and occupation limitation of public transport and private vehicle. People also must have a permission letter before entering into or exiting from partial-fledge lockdown zones (Ministry of Health Republic of Indonesia 2020). There have been benefited and disadvantaged sectors due to the COVID-19 outbreak. According to Dcode Economic and Financial Consulting (2020), e-commerce, information and communication technology (ICT), and the food processing and retail sectors potentially benefited from the outbreak. Many studies have considered the effects of e-commerce and ICT on behavioral changes in activity and associated travel (or activity-travel behavior changes), particularly the potential for replacing out-of-home activities with virtual-based tasks, such as e-learning, telework, and online shopping (Cao 2009; Chakrabarti 2018; Sener and Reeder 2012). The use of ICT in the transportation sector, such as ride-hailing, has successfully changed travel behaviors and sustainability (Irawan et al. 2020a; Tarabay and Abou-Zeid 2020; Tirachini 2020). Although many studies related to the rapid response to COVID-19 have been carried out (de Bruin et al. 2020; Djalante et al. 2020; Ha 2020; Karnon 2020; Makurumidze 2020; Wilder-Smith et al. 2020; Xiao and Torok 2020), understanding how ICT has impacted out-of-home activities and associated travel during the pandemic has been little discussed. To fill this gap, this study aims to investigate the activity-travel behavior changes during the beginning of COVID-19 outbreak as an effect of attitudes, descriptive norms, protective behaviors toward COVID-19, travel frequency before the pandemic, and spatial and socio-demography in accordance with the use of ICT. Specifically, the objectives of this study are threefold. First, to analyze factors influencing activity-travel behavior change and to explore the interrelationship between the influence factors. Second, to investigate the ability for ICT to facilitate activity-travel behavior change and to understand how ICT facilitated activities correlate to each other. Third, to explore the impact of individual and spatial characteristics on activity-travel behavior change in accordance with ICT use. Some policies are then recommended to optimize the implementation of mobility and activity restriction policies in Indonesia. Note that even though we mentioned ride-hailing usage when discussing travel behavior change, the modes that were used before the pandemic and will be used during the pandemic are not necessarily ride-hailing. That means if a person before the pandemic uses a car or public transport, he/she might use the same mode or different mode during the pandemic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the utilization of many features of ICT as an instantaneous and massive tool to limit pandemic spread through activity-travel behavior restrictions. Understanding the COVID-19 spread in Indonesia is also crucial because Indonesia is the fourth most populous country in the world and potentially suffers greatly and over a long period of pandemic. Indonesia is predicted to become the world’s next COVID-19 hotspot. Data were collected from an online survey from March 2020 to April 2020. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to deal with the complexity of relationships among the variables. With this background, this study contributes to understanding the travel behavior in the era of pandemic and how to manage mobility without exposing travelers to greater risk. In other words, we are not focusing to investigate the detail of impacted activities/travels and its magnitude, but we are focusing on how individuals fulfill their daily needs for mobility and activity. It is hypothesized that individuals will utilize ICT and change their travel behavior to fulfill their mobility and activities needs. The remaining section of the paper is organized as follows: a literature review, followed by a part (Research design section) that briefly introduces the conceptual model, and explains the questionnaire design and data collection method. The results are presented in Results section, while the final section summarizes the essential findings and discusses policy implications.",45

In the specific context of travel time variability, most empirical evidence relates to travellers’ valuations of late time and hence the reviews have almost invariably focussed on this. However, the effects on travel behaviour are very important, and Wardman and Batley (2014) discuss its recent significance in the context of the railway industry in Great Britain which has pioneered the investigation of how changes in train punctuality impact upon demand. This has been facilitated by the existence of enormous amounts of recorded station-to-station ticket sales over numerous years, which has long supported econometric analysis of a wide range of impacts on rail demand that in the 2000s was extended to late time as a result of the emergence of temporal data regarding train running performance. Wardman and Batley (2014) conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of late time elasticities for rail travel estimated in Great Britain that existed up to 2011. There is now a much more significant body of evidence and this, in part, motivates the present paper. We also report fresh econometric insights based on the analysis of large datasets available to us. The motivation here is that despite a number of significant recent studies, there is scope to add to the understanding of how late time impacts on rail demand. An underlying theme of both strands of research is addressing widespread concerns that the parameters used to forecast late time variations in the rail industry in Great Britain will exaggerate demand sensitivity. The aims of this paper are to: update and extend Wardman and Batley (2014) which, at the time of publication, formed the most comprehensive review and meta-analysis of late time elasticities; summarise recent research and practical recommendations regarding late time elasticities; report new econometric analysis that addresses gaps in existing evidence; provide recommendations for further research in the area. The structure of the paper follows these aims. “Background” section provides relevant background in terms of the method and parameters used in Great Britain to forecast the demand impacts of changes in late time along with a summary of recent studies and relevant policy issues. “Meta-analysis” section reports the updated meta-analysis and its implied late time elasticities whilst new econometric insights based upon the analysis of large data sets of rail demand are provided in “New econometric insights” section.

One school of thought focuses on changing economic circumstances and external constraints on young people’s mobility. This incorporates candidate explanators such as GDP per capita (Bastian et al. 2016), declining workforce participation and income levels (Bayart et al. 2020; Blumenberg et al. 2016; Delbosc and Currie 2014a), increasing costs of owning and operating a car (Bastian et al. 2016; Chatterjee et al. 2018; Klein and Smart 2017), and the advent of mechanisms that have made acquiring a driving license more onerous, time-consuming, and/or expensive (Thigpen and Handy 2018). Such exogenous explanators by themselves have not been convincing to the research community as fully and completely accounting for young adults’ declining automobility indicators. Other factors such as possible shifts in cultural mores, values and sentiment among young adults towards the automobile have also been raised. McDonald, for instance, writes that “…there is not agreement among researchers…the second set of work [i.e. theory] acknowledges the importance of economic factors but argues that they do not fully explain observed declines…Identifying factors contributing to declines has been difficult, but [includes]…changing attitudes to travel generally and cars in particular. Some posit that the car is no longer a status symbol having been replaced by smartphones. Evaluating this is difficult” (McDonald 2017, pp. 3–5). The difficulty in discriminating between these two competing schools of thought is at core due to data limitations: the data resources traditionally employed to both observe and model mobility trends (national and regional-scale household travel surveys) provide little or no information regarding respondents’ attitudes towards the car, and thus whether or not such attitudes may have shifted over time. Such datasets are relatively strong in demonstrating that young adults’ mobility indicators have shifted in unexpected ways since the 1990s/2000s [e.g. in the UK driving-license holding by people under age 30 peaked in the early 1990s, see Le Vine and Polak (2014)], however relatively weak in providing uncontested explanations for such trends. Although researchers have employed survey methods to probe attitude towards cars (Brown and Handy 2015; Thigpen and Handy 2018), the surveys are cross-sectional with limitations in capturing changing attitudes over time. The motivation for the present research is thus to advance the state-of-knowledge regarding the hypothesis that attitudes towards the car have changed over time. Due to the data limitations noted in the previous paragraph, we devised a novel data-compilation strategy using lyrics from popular music covering a 60-year period from the 1950s through the 2010s. While such data cannot yield unambiguous conclusions about the possibility of social attitudes having shifted away from the car, this research strategy employs the corpus of popular music lyrics as an attempt to proxy for young adults’ social attitudes towards cars during this time period; we note that popular music is consumed most heavily by younger adults (Kalia 2015). Using the song lyrics, we then compiled a structured database of bars within the lyrics that reference automobility, and analyzed this database of ‘tokens’ using both sentiment analysis (a.k.a. “Natural Language Processing”) techniques and manual classification by the research team to quantitatively evaluate the research question.The datasets created for this paper have been archived at https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/UM5XB, and are available open access for future research use. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: “Literature review” section reviews the relevant literature, and Sect. “Data” section describes our data-compilation protocol. “Results” section then presents the results, and “Conclusions” section summarizes and concludes the paper.",1

Graham,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"The global pandemic Covid-19 imposes an unprecedented challenge on public transport operators. Most of these challenges are stemming from low demand levels and disturbances in the financial stability of operations. Demand for public transport services has dropped substantially because  travel demand in general fell sharply due to lockdown measures and restrictions on a range of communal activities, including working at regular work places; official restrictions on public transport use, specifically, might have been in place, due to the threat of violating social distancing rules on board or in stations; and even if such official restrictions are lifted, travellers might be reluctant to use public transport services, due to the degree of perceived risk of infections in shared vehicles or during other stages of a journey in public areas. An immediate consequence of the drop in demand is financial instability. Public transport operators rely on demand dependent cash inflows to a varying extent. Most of the densely used urban rail systems cover more than half of their operating costs by fare revenues, while other services rely almost exclusively on public subsidies (see Monchambert et al., forthcoming). On the other hand, the operating costs of public transport operators are mostly not demand dependent, which means that a quick adjustment of supply levels and production costs is impossible in response to the external shock. Even if capacity supply (e.g. the number of timetabled commercial runs) can be reduced compared to pre-pandemic levels, the capital cost of infrastructure and vehicle ownership remains fixed in the short run. Under regular conditions, it is a popular view among managers of transport providers that the higher the self-financing ratio of an operator, the more stable its financial status will become in the long run. In the present situation we observe that self-financing has become a disadvantage; those service providers that are more reliant on public subsides and alternative forms of funding are less affected by the pandemic, at least in the short run. In the medium to long run, the latter financing model cannot provide guarantees either, as the pandemic is also likely to take its toll on local and central government budgets, which may in turn result in a financial famine, especially if subsidies are determined in the political process on the basis of present and prognosed ridership. These immediate economic consequences are coupled with general uncertainty regarding the speed and shape of recovery after the pandemic. Little is known about ‘life after Covid-19’. Some commentators envision that ‘life will never come back to normal’, hinting that working from home will remain persistent after the crisis, and the traditional offices and work places in high-density urban areas will not be utilised the same way as before. In practice, this implies a permanent reduction in travel demand, and fewer commuting trips in particular to traditional employment centres where public transport was the backbone of everyday mobility. Note that this scenario would lead to a fundamental rearrangement of urban land use and the spatial structure of economic activity, beside the obvious transformations in the transport market.Footnote 1 Others argue that severe health crises happened regularly over past centuries, including a number of infectious diseases with much higher human tolls than the present one. However, the urban culture has not disappeared, and cities always returned to the exploitation of the benefits of physical proximity that the urban economics literature attributes to sharing, matching and learning benefits (Duranton and Puga 2004, Graham et al., forthcoming). The future development path of public transport remains uncertain within these two extrema. Public transport demand is more likely to be impacted by Covid-19 than other transport modes, including walking, cycling and private motorised mobility, the core reason being that physical proximity is harder to avoid in public transport. Under regular operating conditions, physical proximity is the main source of density and scale economies in public transport, which are the engines of its efficiency gains compared to other modes when large travel volumes enable vehicle sharing. Even though clear empirical evidence on the exact infection rate in pubic transport is currently unavailable, and this number is expected to be extremely context dependent, it is likely that the risk of infections increases with the occupancy rate of shared vehicles. That is, the industry faces a delicate trade-off: too high demand leads to the violation of social distancing rules and increased infection risk (combined with the degradation of the public image of the service), while too low demand endangers the financial sustainability of operations. This delicate trade-off generates a need for sophisticated demand management tools under Covid-19. Gkiotsalitis and Cats (2020b) review potential service planning strategies under the Covid-19 crisis, while the present paper contributes with an elaboration of demand management measures and their feasibility. The working hypothesis of this paper is that public transport operators will have to maintain certain levels of social distancing in otherwise densely used stations and vehicles in the aftermath of the pandemic. In practice, this is equivalent to managing demand such that the occupancy rate of vehicles and other facilities never exceeds a predefined threshold. This is a novel task in public transport, because under regular operating conditions, urban buses and trains can be used up to their physical capacity, i.e. the operator does not need to prevent passengers to board a vehicle when capacities are not fully utilised. The paper approaches this practical but highly policy relevant problem with in-depth reviews of available knowledge in the literature. The review is split into three parts. First, in Section 2 we explore recent epidemiological findings on the transmission paths of Covid-19 and the likelihood of infections in public transport. The related discussion is supported by early empirical evidence and policy interventions in response to the crisis. Second, Section 3 introduces the key challenges of social distancing in public transport networks from a theoretical point of view. Third, Section 4 elaborates on the prospects of five travel demand management methods in achieving social distancing. These are (i) inflow control with queueing, (ii) time and space dependent pricing, (iii) capacity reservation with advance booking, (iv) slot auctioning, and (v) tradeable travel permit schemes. The conclusions of our review are summarised in Section 5.",29

Active transportation is key to this endeavor. Enhancing “walkable” and “bikeable” cities has been proved as beneficial to physical and mental health, to the reduction of pollution, mitigation of global warming, in terms of resources, safety, and many other personal and societal dimensions (Garrard et al. 2008; Maizlish et al. 2017; Pucher and Buehler 2017; World Health Organization 2002; Xia et al. 2017). As such, disciplines related to transportation engineering, urban design, street design, environmental engineering, and public health have joined in the common goal to provide a comprehensive understanding of the drivers behind encouraging more people to change modes of transportation to active modes. Many tools for measuring the service or the performance of spaces at local scale for pedestrians and bicyclists have been developed during the past decades. These include the Level of Service—LOS (for pedestrians and bicyclists) (Roess et al. 2010), the WalkScore (for pedestrians) (Duncan et al. 2011), the Level of Traffic Stress (for bicyclists) (Furth et al. 2016; Mekuria et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2016), and the Environmental Quality Index (for pedestrians and bicyclists) (Health and Team 2010), among others. These pedestrian and bicycle Service or Performance Indicators (hereafter referred to as SPI) relate objective and measurable right-of-way characteristics, conditions, and attributes with a perceived proxy of the performance or service, such as comfort, satisfaction, and quality of service. The explanatory variables for the SPIs are, in the vast majority of cases, supply oriented. For pedestrian and bicyclist Level of Service (hereafter referred to as LOS), Roess et al. (2010) summarize the attempts made via the Highway Capacity Manual to incorporate active modes in the methodology by classifying the explanatory variables in two big groups: geometry variables (G-variables), such as infrastructure width; and operational variables (O-variables), such as the traffic volumes or traffic composition. Table 1 summarizes a list of explanatory variables found in the literature, including other methods and studies besides the LOS. Recent literature suggests that beyond these groups of variables, there are other built environment characteristics to be considered (Nag et al. 2019). For example, the surface condition has been found to be a relevant aspect for both pedestrians and bicyclists (Asadi-Shekari et al. 2013; Gallin 2001; Samarasekara et al. 2011). Other relevant variables that are not necessarily geometric or operational and have been identified as significant are on-street signage, land uses, weather, and type of buffer (Asadi-Shekari et al. 2013; Foster et al. 2016; Gallin 2001; Jensen et al. 2007; Kadali and Vedagiri 2015; Landis et al. 1997; Pikora et al. 2003). However, the literature on the assessment of the performance and service of pedestrian and bicyclist infrastructure has not often considered user input to explain SPI levels and its implications in driving changes in choice behavior. Pedestrians and bicyclists, unlike motorists, consciously and unconsciously interact with their surroundings, while moving in the street (Barrero and Rodriguez-Valencia 2021; Ma and Cao 2019). Perception is the mean that makes it possible to connect the stimuli from the built environment to individuals’ emotional responses (Ali et al. 2020; Ma and Cao 2019; Mehrabian and Russell 1974; Ortiz-Ramirez et al. 2021; Yani-de-Soriano and Foxall 2006). According to Ewing et al. (2006), pedestrian perceptions of the street environment may have complex relationships with physical features, and these physical features may not reveal much about user opinions of a specific location. In the case of transportation, perceptions of both intangible features (e.g., safety perception), and physical attributes (e.g., pavement perception) can explain the pedestrian quality of service (Vallejo-Borda et al. 2020a, b) or cyclits service assessment (Barrero and Rodriguez-Valencia 2021; Vallejo-Borda et al. 2019, 2020c). Satisfied and content users generate attachment to the service, recommendations to other potential users, and repetition (Tyler et al. 1999). The purpose of this paper is to propose a framework explaining the pedestrian and bicyclist quality of service (QoS) at roadway segments that enhances associations with the activities and behaviors pertaining to these modes. Specifically, the aim here is to understand the underlying process that leads pedestrians and bicyclists to evaluate the quality of service for urban street segments, differentiating it from traditional LOS methodologies for motorized traffic. We also explore the statistically significant perceptual variables that explain the perceived QoS of the infrastructure of active mobility users.",7
49.0,3.0,Transportation,10 May 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11116-021-10195-3,E-bike user groups and substitution effects: evidence from longitudinal travel data in the Netherlands,June 2022,Mathijs de Haas,Maarten Kroesen,Serge Hoogendoorn,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The e-bike is gaining popularity in many Asian and European countries in recent years. While total bicycle sales in the EU grew with only 0.4% between 2010 and 2016, e-bike sales saw a growth of 284% in the same period and now accounts for 8.1% of total bicycle sales (CONEBI 2017). Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium, France and Italy account for almost 80% of e-bike sales in the EU in 2016. Relatively speaking, the share of e-bike sales is the highest in The Netherlands. In 2018, with 40% of new bicycles sold being an e-bike, more e-bikes were sold than conventional city bikes in the Netherlands (Stichting BOVAG-RAI Mobiliteit 2019). When the e-bike was introduced in the Netherlands, the main adopters turned out to be older people, who primarily used the e-bike for leisure trips (Hendriksen et al. 2008). However, in recent years a shift can be observed based on data from the Dutch national travel survey (Statistics Netherlands 2013–2017). While in 2013 54% of e-bike kilometres were travelled by people of 65 years and older, in 2017 this share decreased to 46%. This indicates that also younger age groups are adopting the e-bike. It may be expected that these groups will use the e-bike differently. Indeed, this is reflected in a shift in trip purposes. In 2013 18% of e-bike kilometres were work related, whereas in 2017 this share increased to 23%. In 2017, 13% of all bicycle trips and 18% of the bicycle distance were travelled with an e-bike. In the Netherlands, 50% of all car trips are under 7.5 km and 67% are under 15 km (Statistics Netherlands 2013–2017). As the e-bike allows travelling at greater speeds with less effort compared to a conventional bicycle, it has the potential to replace a substantial part of these car trips. As an e-bike emits 40 times less carbon dioxide (Shao et al. 2012) compared to a car, a substitution of car trips with e-bike would benefit the environment, as well as helping reduce road congestion. However, whether the e-bike brings environmental and other benefits depends on the mode it is replacing (Cherry and Cervero 2007). If the e-bike is mainly substituting non-motorized modes such as the conventional bicycle and walking, benefits could even be negative. Several studies have already focused on the effect that the advent of the e-bike has on travel behaviour. These studies generally report that the e-bike substitutes not only the conventional bicycle, but also, to a certain degree, the car and public transport, depending on local context. For instance, two studies with a geographic focus on China show that in areas with a high quality public transport network, the e-bike is seen as an affordable alternative to public transport (Cherry and Cervero 2007), whereas in areas without sufficient public transport facilities the e-bike mainly substitutes the conventional bicycle (Weinert et al. 2007b). A limitation of previous studies is, however, that they are either based on a cross-sectional survey or in-depth interviews which only allow for comparisons between individuals (differences in travel mode choices) and do not allow an evaluation of within-person effects (changes in travel mode choices) over time. As such, the current state of the art of the literature into e-bike substitution effects provides an incomplete picture, hampering the derivation of sound policies in this regard. The contribution of this study to the literature is twofold. The first aim is to assess whether substitution effects of the e-bike can be observed at an individual level; that is, we study whether the advent of the e-bike has led to actual changes in travel mode choices. To do so, longitudinal data from the Netherlands Mobility Panel (MPN) is used, which—in contrast to cross-sectional data—allows for such analyses. Note that the Netherlands Mobility Panel is representative for the Dutch population and includes both e-bike owners and non-e-bike owners. The second goal of this study is to assess trends in the population of e-bike users, with a particular focus on heterogeneity in user-groups and their e-bike behaviours. Although a shift in the use of e-bike can be observed in terms of age and trip purpose, little is known about the heterogeneity among e-bike users in terms of their usage patterns. It is likely that different groups exist that use the e-bike for different reasons and in different ways. By considering different types of e-bike users in terms of their socio-demographic characteristics as well as their usage patterns, it can be assessed whether it is likely that any substitution effects might change in the future. We use 5 years of data (2013–2017) of the Dutch national travel survey (Statistics Netherlands 2013–2017) to reveal different e-bike user groups and assess how these groups developed over the years. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. First, a brief overview of relevant studies regarding the effects of the e-bike on travel behaviour is provided. The next section shows how e-bike trips substitute trips with other modes. In the following section, we discuss the different e-bike user groups and their development over the years. The final section presents conclusions and recommendations for future research.",17

Traffic forecasting is another area in which VFTTS is used as an input (De Jong, 2008). Analysis of the VFTTS was introduced in the mid-1980s when an increase in the value of products and the quality of services was noted in commodity market (Zamparini and Reggiani 2007a). In both freight and passenger transport, the value of travel time savings (VTTS) is associated with maximising utility for firms and for passengers/workers, respectively. This maximisation problem is based on microeconomic theory, and is typically implemented using willingness-to-pay surveys and behavioural models to measure the VTTS for people and/or commodities (Zamparini and Reggiani 2016). VFTTS is a key benefit of the majority of transport improvement in both freight and passenger transport. In cost–benefit analyses, the time savings account for about 80% of the monetary benefit of projects in total in the United Kingdom (Mackie 2001). The freight transport, time savings in European countries represent a vital part of this percentage which is approximately a third of the time benefits (Massiani 2003). Therefore, a precise estimate of the VFTTS is essential for transport policy and planning. In the paper we would use the terminology VFTTS; however, we acknowledge that there is a debate about using VFTT or VFTTS (Daly and Hess 2019). We mean that the VFTTS is a value of unit whether is a gain or loss. The VFTTS is usually reported in monetary terms per hour, which reflects the larger time and distances associated with the freight sector, unlike the monetary unit per minute sometimes used in passenger transport. One major issue in studies on the VFTTS is the heterogeneity between these values due to the influence of the shipment size, the decision makers, the transport mode and the type of goods being shipped. A further difference is the choice of analysis method. Therefore, it is important to consider the heterogeneity between VFTTS estimated in different ways (De Jong 2008). This paper aims to address how study-specific characteristics and within-study differences can explain the observed variations in VFTTS reported in the literature. We draw on studies published in the academic literature as well as unpublished studies, such as government reports, PhD theses, conference papers and working papers. We substantially expand on the studies used in past meta-analyses of VFTTS. To achieve this aim, a meta-analysis framework is used to explain variations across studies. Meta-analysis has been applied in a range of domains that have combined the results of various studies that address the same research question (Wampold et al. 2000). The technique can be defined as a statistical analysis of the results that have been analysed in previous empirical studies. The use of the meta-analysis technique in the social and behavioural sciences emerged in the 1970s. Glass (1976) was the first to use the term ‘meta-analysis’ for what has become a powerful tool in the social sciences (Bangert-Drowns 1986). Since that time, researchers from different fields have shown an increased interest in using the meta-analysis method. The main objective of meta-analysis studies is to evaluate and analyse the quantitative results of multiple individual studies (Cleophas and Zwinderman 2007). The now well-established meta-analysis method provides valuable statistical results that are more efficient than the results of primary studies, due to the aggregation of existing information and data that supports decision making. Moreover, this type of analysis increases the precision and limits bias to improve the reliability of the findings (Chalmers and Altman 1997). This paper contributes to the existing literature by performing an updated review of the VFTTS, which has only been reviewed in a few studies so far (Zamparini and Reggiani 2007a, De Jong 2008, Feo-Valero 2011), of which only the first contains a meta-regression. The present meta-analysis includes studies from around the world and applies statistical analysis to pool the values, unlike the meta-analysis conducted by Zamparini and Reggiani (2007a), which only used VFTTS studies from the United States and developed countries in Europe, and only considered the road and rail transport modes. Furthermore, the present study examines a substantial number of explanatory variables, such as gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, transport mode, type of survey respondent, and survey method, among others. An additional difference between this analysis and the previous analysis is that the present paper considers the panel nature of the data that contain several studies from different countries by estimating fixed and random-effects models in addition to ordinary least squares (OLS). Besides, the weighted least-squares (WLS) model is used for weighting each study by the number of observations or the sample size as a proxy of precision of the VFTTS. Therefore, different meta-models will be used to consider the heterogeneous dataset and to obtain more precise estimates. In addition, meta-model outcomes will be used to generate VFTTS for different countries to be compared with past results and predict other situations. The remaining sections of the paper are as follows: Sect. 2 briefly discusses the concept of VFTTS, how it is calculated in the literature, its features and the data methods used to estimate it. Section 3 provides a brief review of the meta-analysis method in freight transport. Section 4 describes the data and search strategy. Section 5 presents the meta-model. In Sect. 6, the estimation results are reported and interpreted. Section 7 contains a conclusion and recommendations for future work.",2

Owen D. Waygood,Mengqiu Cao,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Many studies have explored the determinants of travel behaviour and mode choice in particular. Studies—mainly from the 1990s and early 2000s—found that the residential location has an important effect on travel mode choice. People living in low-density suburbs tend to use the car for most trips, while those living in compact, mixed-use neighbourhoods regularly walk, cycle or use public transport (e.g., Cervero and Kockelman 1997; De Vos 2015; Frank and Pivo 1994; Ewing and Cervero 2001, 2010; Waygood et al. 2015). In the last two decades, evidence has accumulated that besides the built environment, attitudes can also impact the way people travel, and that a positive stance towards a certain travel mode can stimulate the use of that mode (e.g., Bagley and Mokhtarian 2002; Beirão and Cabral 2007; Heinen et al. 2011; Kitamura et al. 1997). These travel attitudes may also have an indirect impact on travel behaviour through residential location choice, since people may want to live in a neighbourhood enabling them to travel in a preferred way (known as transport-related residential self-selection) (Cao et al. 2009; Handy et al. 2005). Some studies have also indicated that the choice of travel mode is strongly affected by past (mode choice) behaviour, partly due to the formation of habits (Bamberg et al. 2003a; Gardner 2009). People may not always consciously choose a travel mode based on existing attitudes, but rather choose a mode that satisfied their needs in previous trips. During the past decade, numerous studies have started exploring how people experience their travel and how satisfied they are with it. These studies have mainly focused on the determinants of travel satisfaction, such as travel mode choice and travel duration (e.g., De Vos et al. 2016; Morris & Guerra 2015). Although some of them have suggested that satisfaction with a trip using a certain mode can positively impact the likelihood of a person using that mode again in the future, this effect remains underexplored (De Vos 2019). It is reasonable to assume that it is not only the satisfaction with a particular mode that influences its future use, but also the frequency of (dis)satisfying trips. In this study, we will therefore explore the effects of the frequency of public transport (PT) use, satisfaction with PT, and the frequency of (dis)satisfying PT trips on the intention to use PT in later life stages using data from students at Laval University in Canada. This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of studies that have analysed the effect of past behaviour and travel satisfaction on travel behaviour. In Sect. 3, the used data and key variables are described. Section 4 presents the found results, while a discussion and conclusion are provided in Sect. 5.",9

As a result, recent evidence suggests that poor transportation provision may cause barriers to travel and limit participation in essential daily activities such as employment, medical appointments, and leisure (Farber et al. 2018). This is especially likely among those disadvantaged groups who suffer from socioeconomic and transportation deprivation conditions. Such individuals are understood to be suffering from transport poverty, and are at risk of being excluded from participating in the normal activities of everyday life (Lucas 2012; Martens 2016). Research contends that improvements in transit accessibility can encourage trip generation and activity participation in these groups and therefore alleviate social exclusion (Allen and Farber 2020; Roorda et al. 2010). Demand-responsive technologies, such as on-demand transit (ODT), offer public transit agencies new opportunities to deliver mobility services at reduced cost and improved customer experience. Despite this great potential, these services have seldom been investigated from the perspective of disadvantaged communities, nor have past studies looked at their ability to alleviate transport-related social exclusion.
 Several studies have shown that ODT can significantly stimulate ridership (Chebbi and Chaouachi 2015; Zhao et al. 2018). For instance, an initial analysis of the Belleville ODT pilot project, which we will be examining in more detail in this paper, claimed that nighttime bus ridership had increased 300%, albeit starting with a small base ridership (Mellor 2019). However, a recent study by Coutinho et al. (2020) found significant ridership drop after launching a 12-month demand-responsive transportation pilot in low-density areas of Amsterdam, Netherland. Since most existing studies of the ODT services have focussed on the operational and service-level characteristics of these systems, we know very little about the factors that may influence ridership, such as user experience and satisfaction, and whether or not ODT services are successful in eliminating mobility barriers to improve activity participation. This study intends to bridge this gap in research by investigating whether and how the launch of on-demand transit services has changed the nighttime activity participation patterns in Belleville, Ontario. In September 2018, the transit agency of Belleville started offering an ODT service for its residents. The underlying technology for this service is developed by Pantonium Inc., a Toronto-based mobility technology company. It enables passengers to hail and schedule transit trips on the city’s nighttime bus using a mobile application. Passengers lacking access to a smartphone can also book the service by phone, email, or directly through the website. Busses would also pick up any passengers they saw waiting at bus stops as they drove by, but this behaviour was discouraged since passengers were subjected to very unpredictable wait-times unless others had specifically booked trips from the same stop at the same time. According to the transit agency, the number of registered users and ridership of this service have grown significantly since the launch of the ODT (City of Belleville 2019). Ridership increases are one indicator of success, but to understand what this represents in terms of societal benefit, it is imperative to understand where this ridership increase comes from. Is it due to mode-shifting, time-of-day shifting, or increases in overall activity participation? Of the three potential sources, we posit that increased overall activity participation rates are the most relevant and meaningful indicator of social benefit, as they most likely represent the elimination of transport barriers, according to the transport related social exclusion theoretical framework (Currie et al. 2010; Kenyon et al. 2002; Lucas 2012). To further understand the potential of ODT in providing sustainable service in low density areas or periods of the day, it is important to know the satisfaction of users and the factors that are most related to the changes in activity participation. This study examines how the satisfaction of ODT users relates to changes in their activity participation. The data comes from a survey of ODT users that includes basic socio-economic status, user experience, perceived changes in activity participation, and a detailed assessment of satisfaction. From the survey, we found that most of the respondents reported an increase in activity participation after the launch of ODT. To understand what specific factors influence activity participation, we used factor analysis and structural equation models to explore the relationship between satisfaction and activity participation. The results show that feeling satisfied with the reliability and service equality is associated with increased rates of activity participation. So, not only do governments need to offer new services, but the social outcomes they hope to achieve are clearly linked to the quality of the services they provide. Our findings reveal how ODT influences activity participation, and in so doing, provide a better understanding of the impacts of demand-responsive technologies on residents’ daily life. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section contains a review of the literature on the transportation and social exclusion framework, and the contribution of on-demand mobility to the framework. The third section introduce the study context of this paper, providing details of the development of on-demand transit in Belleville. The fourth section covers research design and data collection, and the fifth section provides the model analysis and results. We provide a discussion with the implications of subsequent policies in the sixth section, and present conclusions in the seventh section.",7

Axhausen,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Tourism industry accounts for a substantial share of the direct Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the Alpine areas of Austria, Switzerland, Italy or France. In the Austrian province of Tyrol, for example, it is responsible for 17.5% of the GDP (Werbung 2019). However, over the past two decades, vacation trends, characteristics and demands of customers who bring in these revenues have changed significantly. While the average length of stay of tourists in Tyrol decreased from 5.1 nights in 2000 to 4.0 nights in 2019, the number of arrivals increased by almost 60% from around 8 million to more than 12 million (Statistics Austria 2020). This demonstrates the rising demand for tourist stays in the province of Tyrol (despite no expansion on the supply side, as the number of beds dropped by 7% between 2000 and 2019), which inevitably leads to an increase in tourism-related travel. In Austria, nearly 75% of inbound holiday trips are made by private car (Austrian National Tourist Office 2014). These trips have a substantial influence on traffic congestion on alpine roads and generate pollution in environmentally fragile areas. Car travel, due to its dominant role in Austrian tourism, heavily contributes to the sector’s greenhouse gas emissions, both at the level of a single destination (Unger et al. 2016), as well as for the entire country (Gühnemann et al. 2021). Tourists appear to be well aware of their travel carbon footprint, yet are not willing to change their behavior substantially (Mailer et al. 2019). Furthermore, traffic generated by tourists can even disrupt daily activities and travel patterns of local inhabitants, who experience severe difficulties in traveling due to lack of alternative roads in densely built-up and narrow mountain valleys. The problem is recognized and present also in other non-urban destinations, but has so far attracted only limited attention of researchers, who addressed it in qualitative studies (Dickinson and Robbins 2007, 2008). Local authorities still do not have any quantitative evidence at their disposal. In effect, transport policy measures in tourist regions are often shots in the dark, which, despite considerable expenses (e.g. free public transportation for tourists), lack proper evaluation and appraisal. Compared to what we know about everyday travel behavior from representative household surveys, census studies and extensive scientific literature, our knowledge of transportation behavior during vacations is very limited. While these studies provide information on specific vacation decisions (destination preferences, spending, etc.), they look at the issue from the perspective of the country of origin, for which respondents' behavior during a stay abroad is not relevant. Similarly, data collected by national tourism agencies and international organizations on tourism markets and aggregate statistics on travelers moving between and within countries are not helpful here either. It is, however, rational and legitimate to assume that travel behavior of tourists at the destination is not only different from their everyday behavior at home (Schlemmer et al. 2019), but it is also dissimilar to travel behavior of local residents. Yet, current research in this field is limited and concentrates merely on international tourism demand and the long-distance component of vacation travel (Christensen and Nielsen 2018; Gerike and Schulz 2018; Janzen et al. 2018). There are virtually no quantitative data documenting tourists’ travel decisions while at the destination, leaving their travel behavior still largely unexplored. The fundamental goal of current work is to help fill this research gap by developing a scientifically-grounded approach to collecting data on tourist travel behavior at the destination and by providing tourism practitioners, transport planners and policy-makers with a first-of-its-kind dataset from a survey conducted in the Austrian Alps. The paper is comprised of four sections with Sect. Introduction and motivation introducing the topic, describing the motivation and setting the objectives for the research. Section State of research on travel behavior of tourists reviews the literature on data collection methods and travel decisions, with a particular focus on tourists in vacation setting. Section Survey design covers the survey work. First, the conceptual framework of tourist travel at the destination is presented. Next, a detailed description of survey methodology and design is given, followed by response behavior statistics from a survey conducted in the field. Section Descriptive analysis provides a descriptive analysis of the collected data. Section Conclusion synthesizes and discusses the findings, and points out the limitations. We also provide an outlook on future research and suggest prospective study topics that could either extend the approach or resolve some of its limitations.",5

Daziano,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"Since the early 2010s, on-demand, door-to-door ride-hailing services provided by transportation network companies (TNC) like Uber and Lyft have become a popular travel mode especially in large cities. In New York City, for example, TNC services completed 219 and 248 million revenue trips in 2018 and 2019, compared to 103 and 85 million trips completed by traditional Yellow taxis in the respective years (NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission n.d. n.d.). Coinciding with the growth of TNC has been declines in transit ridership (American Public Transportation Association 2020). Before the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted travel, Philadelphia's bus ridership had decreased since 2014 and dropped to the lowest level since the Great Recession in 2019 (National Transit Database 2019). Several studies have also attributed worsening traffic conditions in downtown areas and increased vehicle miles traveled (VMT) at least in part to the increase in TNC use (Center City District 2018; Fehr and Peers 2019; Schaller 2018). TNC’s increasing presence has prompted scholars to investigate the service’s impact on individual travel behavior and mode choice. However, findings are still inconclusive in several areas. For example, it is unclear how TNC in cities with a wide range of travel options affects vehicle ownership decisions for individuals with different vehicle ownership statuses. While recent evidence has pointed to TNC’s substitution effect on transit, few studies have examined how individuals weigh travel options when choosing between transit and TNC services, and whether their choices are affected by different socio-economic characteristics, built environment, and transit service factors. For instance, individuals might consider walking to and from transit stations a lesser burden in more pedestrian friendly settings, and therefore might be more willing to choose transit over TNC services. Meanwhile, the time spent traveling in a TNC or a transit vehicle might be considered more “valuable” for residents in wealthier cities than those in less wealthy cities. In this paper, we compare responses from an online survey among 421 and 294 TNC customers in Boston, Massachusetts, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to investigate TNC’s impact on individuals' vehicle ownership, trip making, and mode choice. Boston and Philadelphia are both older, large multimodal cities with relatively high transit share and dense urban environment. Meanwhile, there are notable differences between the cities in walking environment, transit service, and residents’ socio-economic characteristics. These differences could contribute to different responses in travel behavior after adopting TNC services. They may also help explain the variations in TNC customers’ preferences when choosing between transit and TNC. Understanding how individuals respond to TNC services in different urban settings helps bridge the gap in the TNC literature and informs decision making in land use and transit service adjustments in response to growth in TNC use. Our study consists of a qualitative comparative analysis of the changes in surveyed TNC customers’ travel behavior after adopting TNC and a random parameter logit regression analysis of their preferences between transit and TNC service. We find that by providing a convenient on-demand transport service, TNC allows customers to either delay purchasing a car or forgo a car altogether. The service also enables customers across all income levels to take trips, especially errand trips and trips for recreational and social purposes, that they otherwise would not have taken without the service. Meanwhile, by allowing more trips and by replacing trips that were previously taken by transit, walking, and biking, TNC likely increases vehicle miles traveled. Our random parameter logit regression analysis on the responses to a series of stated preference choice experiments shows that when choosing between TNC service and transit, individuals in both cities consider the overall travel time for transit to be more burdensome than that for TNC. Differences in built environment characteristics, mode share within transit systems, and income levels likely contribute to the different values of time for respondents between the two cities. Increasing TNC fares substantially or improving transit service could prompt TNC customers to switch to transit. Our paper makes three primary contributions to the TNC literature. First, it provides further evidence on changes in individual travel behavior and vehicle ownership after adopting TNC services in two large, multimodal cities. Second, not only does the paper highlight TNC’s substitution effect on transit and other transport modes, but it also examines the characteristics of the trips replaced. It thus sheds additional lights on TNC’s impact on traditional travel modes. Last, to the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first to compare the trade-off between transit and TNC for individuals when making mode choice decisions in two cities with different urban settings and transit services. It provides further evidence on the importance of transit service improvements in retaining transit passengers or attracting TNC customers to transit. The findings have practical implications on transit service planning, station area improvements, parking regulations, and traffic management. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We first examine previous studies on TNC’s relationship with vehicle ownership, travel behavior, mode choice, and transit ridership, as well as policy responses to TNC’s externalities. We then explain the study area, survey design, and survey distribution, followed by a discussion of key findings from the qualitative comparative analysis and the random parameter logit regression analysis. In the last section, we discuss our findings’ implications on transit service planning, planning policies, and traffic management.",2

Rau,Jan Christian Schlüter,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Collective demand responsive transportation (DRT) systems represent intermediate forms of public transportation, which identify and combine similar travel routes of customers (Brake et al. 2004; Durand et al. 2018). The pooling of passengers increases the number of travelers per vehicle, which reduces fossil fuels and emissions (see also Jokinen 2016; Santi et al. 2014; Nyga et al. 2020). Therefore, DRT systems have the potential to increase the sustainable development in the transport sector. Moreover, they are also an interesting complement to conventional public transport, which may be of importance in rural areas where these services are lacking (Alonso-González et al. (2017)). In this case, DRT systems can be more cost effective and flexible than standard public transportation. Nevertheless, many DRTs have failed because the operations used were not realistically calculated (Davison et al. 2012) and had problems in the marketing (Enoch et al. 2006). Moreover, behavioral factors may play an important role for people’s hesitance to use public transportation in the form of DRTs. Fuji et al. (2001) highlight that frequent car users often develop a habit or routine of using their cars, which complicates the switch to other public transport modes. The findings may explain why the number of car commuters is especially high in rural areas. The high number of commuters may be a reason why the demand for DRTs is low in rural areas. In this paper, we analyze in a natural field experiment practices to promote the demand for DRT in a rural area. In our study, we offer vouchers for local leisure activities when customers use the DRT service. These small gifts aim at familiarizing customers with the transport mode and increasing the demand for it. We test the effectiveness of the gifts by comparing it to another treatment without equivalent. Here, the bus users receive environmental certificates that document the saved carbon dioxide because of the bus ride. Rewarding people for desirable behavior is motivated by findings of experimental economics, which reports positive effects when people receive incentives. For instance, people increase their gym attendances when paid to do so (Charness and Gneezy 2009). Moreover, evidence shows that people reduce smoking when financially rewarded (e.g., Gneezy et al. 2011). In the transport sector, Fuji and Kitamura (2003) also report positive effects of financial incentives, i.e., gifting free bus tickets convinced many customers to switch to buses. In a similar vein, small gifts were already successfully used to promote sustainable behavior in an urban context different from DRT. In the project “Bella Mossa” the city of Bologna (Italy) rewarded its citizens with small gifts, such as free beer, ice cream, or cinema tickets, if they refrained from using their cars. In this respect, an app was used, which awarded points to citizens when they used public transport, or when they walked or cycled. Bowden and Hellen (2019) report positive effects of the “Bella Mossa” project, i.e., about half of everyday car users showed some form of sustained commitment and behavioral change. Although, the net effect of the project seems to be positive, it is unclear to what extent the increase in sustainable behavior can be attributed to the gifts or to the pure motivational effects. Further evidence shows that offering incentives via an app may increase the use of bicycle (de Kruijf et al. 2018; Huang et al. 2021; Máca et al. 2020), public transport and walking (Tsirimpa et al. 2019). We refer the reader to Hulkkonen et al. (2020) for an overview on initiatives potentially influencing individual travel behavior. The current study presents the findings of a field experiment on the effectiveness of gift vouchers, which reward the use of a DRT system. We conducted the natural field experiment in connection with the “EcoBus” project between August 13, 2018, and February 24, 2019. The EcoBus is a door-to-door DRT system that was installed for a trial period of six months in a rural area in northern Germany called Harz. The system was fully integrated in the public transport. The main aim of the DRT system was to reduce environmental and personal costs in comparison to motorized private transport. Therefore, ride-pooling was applied. The project was initiated by the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization in Göttingen (Germany) and regional transportation authorities. In the experiment, we test the effectiveness of two incentive mechanisms (gift vouchers vs. certificates) to increase the demand for DRT. More precisely, customers are rewarded by stamps when driving with the EcoBus. The stamps can be converted to vouchers when reaching a certain threshold level. Customers can reach different threshold levels, i.e., the “silver bonus” (low level, which is achieved by 10 stamps) and the “gold bonus” (high level, which is achieved by 20 stamps). The gold bonus guarantees vouchers of a higher value. To analyze the importance of gift vouchers, we introduce a “certificates” treatment, which also rewards bus rides with stamps, but the customers do not receive gifts. In this condition customers can convert their stamps to environmental certificates, which report the saved amount of carbon dioxide. In the certificates treatment we apply the same thresholds (“silver bonus” and “gold bonus”) as in the gift vouchers treatment. The silver (gold) bonus can be converted to a silver (gold) environmental certificate. Depending on the threshold level the certificates report lower/higher levels of saved carbon dioxide. Our study contributes to the literature in several ways. We focus on a DRT system and try to demonstrate effective ways to increase the acceptance of this certain mode of transport. We focus on a rural setting, characterized by a very low degree of customers who are familiarized with public transportation. Other differences relate to the design of the treatment conditions, i.e, in Bowden and Hellen (2019) customers compete against each other and receive gifts if they substitute daily car usage with various services (e.g., walking, cycling, bus). In contrast to Bowden and Hellen (2019), we have two clear-cut treatments which differ in the incentives (vouchers vs. environmental certificates without equivalent) and reward customers if they achieve the same performance in each testing condition. We apply a quasi-experimental evaluation in comparison to self-disclosures (e.g., Bowden and Hellen 2019; de Kruijf et al. 2018) or experimental evaluations without pre-treatment data (e.g., Máca et al. 2020; Huang et al. 2021). The framework for testing the effectiveness of gifts is particularly suitable here, as our experiment is conducted in the pilot phase of the bus, where customers could not form good or bad long-term experiences with the service. Another strength of our field experiment is that we focus on a large data set with 1425 observations, which encompasses significantly more participants than in many previous studies of behavioral interventions in the transportation sector (Graham-Rowe et al. 2011; Arnott et al. 2014). We test our main question by applying a difference-in-differences (DiD) approach. After a trial phase, we implemented either the gift vouchers or the environmental certificates. In the DiD approach we compare the difference in the change of the EcoBus rides between these two treatments. It turns out that the usage of EcoBus rides went up by more in the vouchers treatment (83%) compared to the certificates treatment (65%). We find evidence that the observed effect is mainly taking place at the end of the treatment phase showing more durable effects of vouchers compared to environmental certificates. We speculate that this may indicate potential frustration, as customers in the environmentally-framed certificates treatment may have grown disappointed when realizing that the pilot would soon stop. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Sect. Study data, the DRT setting and the data is introduced to get an overview of the data collection and the travel mechanisms concerning the EcoBus pilot phase. Section Experimental design deals with the experimental design. In Sect. Related literature and research hypothesis, we derive our hypothesis based on the related literature. Section Results presents our results and Sect. Conclusion concludes.",1

Taylor,Andrew Schouten,Male,Male,Male,Male,"This paper analyzes the steep decline in US transit ridership that began in the years before the coronavirus emergency. Both absolute and per capita transit patronage fell during the Great Recession. Ridership began growing as the economy recovered, but soon started to fall (American Public Transportation Association 2021a). In 2012, Atlanta and Detroit became the first large urbanized areas (UZAs) to report post-recession year-over-year absolute ridership declines. They were followed by Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Washington, DC in 2014; Miami, Dallas, and Phoenix in 2015; and Boston in 2016. Transit ridership in many smaller regions began falling thereafter. In 2017, ridership rose in three UZAs, and fell in 436. Transit ridership losses continued in 2018 (U.S. Federal Transit Administration 2020). Nationwide, per capita transit patronage fell by 12% between 2008 and 2018; from 2014 to 2018, absolute ridership fell by 700 million (American Public Transportation Association 2021a; Schouten et al 2021). These declines generated substantial concern while they were happening (e.g., Badger and Bui 2020), but they were soon eclipsed by the even graver problems that befell transit as a result of COVID-19 (Frost 2020; American Public Transportation Association 2021b). While the pandemic decimated transit use, the source of that decimation is no mystery. The economy contracted, and transit travel did too. The source of the pre-COVID decline, in contrast, is less clear, and is worth investigating because the conditions that created it may well remain, and confront transit agencies as they emerge from the pandemic. Given the nature of American transit, the pre-COVID ridership decline likely had multiple causes. Transit in the United States serves different purposes, and takes different forms, in different places. Conditions that likely affected ridership in New York, Boston, and Washington, DC, such as service disruptions on aging rail systems, were less relevant or nonexistent elsewhere. This article focuses on an explanation with relevance to many places: increased access to private automobiles. In most of the US, public transportation is used disproportionately by people who have limited access to cars, but who live and work in built environments designed for car travel. Transit, for this group, is a mobility safety net: a public option for moving through landscapes planned around private vehicles. Precisely because transit in these areas is often mismatched to its built environment, the service it offers is generally inferior to driving. This makes transit ridership precarious. The relatively small share of people with little or no vehicle access accounts for a large share of transit trips, but those same people without vehicles have a strong incentive to acquire them, because vehicles greatly improve their ability to get around. In these circumstances, even modest increases in vehicle access could account for large losses in transit ridership. We hypothesize that in many US areas, this is in fact what occurred. We document the association between rising auto access and falling transit use by examining Southern California, and particularly the Los Angeles urbanized area (UZA) that lies at its heart. We emphasize Southern California because it offers an unusual window into America’s transit landscape: a large transit market with many attributes of a small one. American transit use follows a power law distribution: a small number of big places, most of them quite different from the nation at large, account for most transit trips. Over 40% of the nation’s pre-pandemic transit rides, for example, occurred in New York, a place that in many ways bears little resemblance to other US urban areas (e.g. Voulgaris et al. 2017). As a result, no single place offers an ideal case study of “American” transit. Nevertheless, Southern California makes a useful case study, for three reasons. The first is data limitations. Fully controlling for endogeneity in a national analysis of vehicle ownership and transit use is difficult, because data on a number of potentially confounding factors are either unavailable, or available only in data sets that are hard to match with one another. Using a single large case, as offered by Southern California, helps overcome this problem: we can scrutinize potential sources of endogeneity separately from our statistical analysis, in ways that would be difficult if we analyzed numerous areas. Second, using Southern California rules out an important potential reason for falling ridership, which is falling investment. Southern California exemplifies, and indeed lies at the extreme end of, a national trend where transit investment has risen but ridership has lagged. From 2000 to 2015, transit investment in the United States, measured as an inflation-adjusted ten-year rolling average of capital costs plus annual operating costs, rose almost 50% (US Federal Transit Administration various), while per capita ridership fell 1% (American Public Transportation Association 2021a). In Southern California, this divergence between investment and patronage is even starker. Since 1990, Southern California has added over 100 miles of light and heavy rail, over 530 miles of commuter rail, and increased bus service as well. Transit ridership over this period, however, has been mostly flat or falling; both absolute and per capita ridership had their postwar peak in 1985. The most recent per capita decline began in 2007, and ridership started falling absolutely in 2014. The decline was more pronounced on bus than rail, but both modes lost patronage. In 2016 per capita ridership was 40% below its 1985 high-water mark.Footnote 1 Finally, we examine Southern California because the region is, again, a large transit market with many attributes of a small one. Today Los Angeles ranks third behind New York and Chicago in the number of annual transit trips; as recently as 2016, LA was second to only New York (Freemark 2021). But the region differs dramatically from America’s other big transit markets. These other regions—the “legacy” urbanized areas concentrated in the Northeast (but including Chicago and San Francisco)—have central areas with dense prewar built environments, and these environments, by making driving and parking difficult, encourage broad swathes of the population to take transit (Chatman 2003; Taylor et al. 2009). Los Angeles, in contrast, more closely resembles the typical US urban area: much of its built environment is auto-oriented, and transit use is confined largely to the poor. Analyzing LA might therefore offer a better glimpse into why ridership fell in most places, even if it is less applicable to those places where frequent transit use is most common. We proceed as follows. The next section discusses falling transit ridership, situates Los Angeles in America’s transit landscape, and summarizes previous research on the relationship between vehicle access and transit use. The “Descriptive evidence on transit use and private vehicle access in Southern California” section presents descriptive evidence about rising auto access and falling transit ridership in Southern California. The “Statistical analysis of vehicle access and falling ridership” section presents a series of negative binomial regressions measuring the relationship between private vehicle access and transit use. The results confirm a strong negative association: a decline in zero-vehicle households is strongly associated with substantially fewer transit trips, even controlling for income, age, race, nativity, and other factors. We stop short of defining this association causally, however. Rising auto access could cause falling ridership, but could also be a consequence of other underlying reasons to prefer driving over transit. Because we cannot quantitatively control for this potential endogeneity, the “Endogeneity: changes in vehicle access vs changes that prompt vehicle access” section reviews other potential sources of transit’s decline, and weighs them relative to rising vehicle access. We conclude that increased vehicle access has likely played a central role in transit’s pre-COVID decline. The article’s final section considers the implications of this finding. Our results suggest a tension between the collective benefits that transit offers low-income people as a group, and the private benefits that automobiles offer to individual members of that same group. In many US urban areas, transit primarily relies for riders on people who lack cars (Pucher and Renne 2003). When vehicles become more widely available, that group shrinks. So too does transit’s base of frequent users, and thus its ridership. A logical policy response, from the perspective of transit operators, is to lure these riders back. From a broader perspective, however, the appropriate response is less obvious. Because transit’s collective benefits for low-income people rest on transit being viable, when riders of any income acquire vehicles and leave, an important service for low-income people suffers. At the same time, however, when low-income people living in auto-oriented places acquire automobiles, they likely become individually better off, because they can now travel by car in regions designed for doing so. The socially optimal response to falling ridership, therefore, likely involves more than just “winning back” riders who have left. Instead it would involve addressing the policies that create structural advantages for automobility. Before proceeding, a note about geography; throughout the article we alternatively discuss “Los Angeles” by which we mean the Los Angeles Urbanized Area (UZA) or—sometimes—Los Angeles County, and “Southern California” which is a larger area including not just Los Angeles but five outlying counties that are represented by the metropolitan planning organization. Most ridership occurs in Los Angeles, as we discuss, but Southern California is the geographic scale at which regional transportation planning occurs.",5

In the U.S., between 2018 and 2019 the number of online transactions has increased by $76.46 billion, from $523.64 to $600.10 billion. In 2020, U.S. consumers were projected to spend $794.5 billion online, for which part of the growth is due to COVID-19 (Intelligence 2020). The rapid growth of online shopping has profound impacts on transportation. First, online shopping may substitute, complement, or modify personal travel to stores (Mokhtarian 2002; Cao 2009; Shi et al. 2019) and thus have implications for changing personal vehicle miles traveled (VMT). For example, one stream of research argues that reduction in personal VMT as a result of online shopping can be important in low-density areas where travel for shopping takes long distance (e.g., Farag et al. 2003; Goodchild and Wygonik 2015). An earlier study in the UK estimates that a direct substitution of car trips by delivery van trips could reduce vehicle-km by 70% or more (Cairns 2005). Yet another stream of research supports a complementary effect, i.e., people frequently buying or searching online tend to make more shopping trips (e.g., Cao 2012; Zhou and Wang 2014; Lee et al. 2017). On the other hand, the increase in truck/van traffic for goods deliveries as a result of online shopping growth has raised many concerns, causing greater traffic congestion, shortage in freight parking space, and aggravated road wear-and-tear, particularly in dense urban areas where online shopping demand is high (Crainic et al 2004; Bates et al. 2018; Jaller and Pahwa 2020). Delivery of online shopped goods also presents significant contributions to CO2 emissions and climate change. In the European Union, for example, urban freight delivery accounts for 25% in the total transportation-related CO2 emissions (Nocera and Cavallaro 2017). Yet, on the other hand, online shopping is perceived to be environmentally friendlier than traditional means of customers traveling to and shopping in stores. Brown and Guiffrida (2014) show that CO2 emissions of last-mile delivery derived from online shopping is lower than CO2 emissions of personal shopping trips to stores, if an area has sufficient customers. Rosqvist and Hiselius (2016) find that in Sweden, the anticipated increase in online shopping activities could result in 22% reduction in CO2 emissions in 2030 compared to 2012, even after taking into account population growth. To meet the increasing delivery requirements from online shopping—in both volume and delivery speed, logistics service providers have been rethinking and renovating logistics strategies, such as relocating warehouses and expanding the network of distribution centers (Houde et al. 2017; Rodrigue 2020), employing crowdshipping (Kafle et al. 2017; Hong et al. 2019; Ahamed et al., 2021), and testing drones for contactless delivery (Chiang et al. 2019; Kim et al. 2020). Freight demand derived from online shopping is exerting increasing influences on the planning and operation of freight transportation systems. As such, the ability to predict online shopping demand is important to designing ways to maintain and enhance the performance of freight and overall transportation systems. Moreover, understanding the importance of the input variables used for prediction, and the nature of the dependence of online shopping demand on values of input variables is critical in informing transportation planning and policy-making. While a body of research has appeared toward understanding online shopping behavior (see “Literature review” section for a review of the literature), some important gaps remain. First, most of the existing studies focus on the interactive relationship between online and in-store shopping with ample but diverse empirical evidences (Shi et al. 2019). However, the ability to predict the volume of online shopping with reasonable accuracy has not attracted much attention despite its practical importance for transportation planning. Almost all existing research resorts to econometric or statistical models. Based on the reported goodness-of-fit, many of those models would not be adequate for online shopping demand prediction purposes (although prediction is not the main intent of those models). Second, the vast majority of the existing work relies on relatively small and local data samples, lacking a broader understanding of demand pattern from a national perspective. On the other hand, thanks to the recent release of online shopping information in national-level databases, we can build models to learn, on a national scale, how online shopping demand and its influencing factors have evolved over time and vary in different locations. In addition, as most data in the existing work come from surveys of individuals, research related to modeling online shopping demand from the household perspective is insufficient, which should be emphasized as it may be more appropriate than at the individual level because online purchases are often made for the needs of the household. Online shopping involves both items consumed by the individual who made the purchase and items consumed collectively by the household and by other members of the household. Items consumed collectively by a household can include grocery, furniture, home appliance, and electronics products (e.g., a TV). For example, in 2017 furniture and homeware sales accounted for 14.64% in total e-retail sales in the US (Statista 2021). For items purchased by an individual for another household member, it can be that parents shop for children (e.g., school supplies) and elderly parents helped by their adult sons and daughters (Selwyn et al. 2016). Given these considerations, modeling online shopping at the household level seems more appropriate. This research attempts to fill the above gaps. The contributions of this work are two-folds: empirical and methodological. On the empirical side, this paper leverages two most recent releases of the U.S. National Household Travel Survey (NHTS)—for 2009 and 2017—to develop machine learning (ML) models for predicting household-level online shopping purchases with input variables encompassing socioeconomic, trip, and land use characteristics and Internet use of household members. We are particularly interested in one type of ML models, gradient boosting machine (GBM), which has several strengths (Friedman 2001; Elith et al. 2008; Ding et al. 2018; Barua and Zou 2021) and shows superior prediction performance in comparison with several alternative prediction techniques for the purpose of the study. After the GBM models are trained, validated, and tested, we further investigate the modeling results by (1) quantifying the importance (i.e., contribution) of each input variable in the models in predicting online shopping demand; and (2) characterizing the relationships between predicted online shopping demand and the input variables. Unlike the existing econometric/statistical approaches which rely on pre-defined model specifications (e.g., linear), our characterization is purely data-driven thus allowing the relationships to vary with input variable values. Results from the investigation are compared between 2009 and 2017, a period in which online shopping has experienced an unprecedent growth, to shed lights on the changes and trends of the factors influencing household online shopping demand. The contributions also come from the methodological perspective. First, given a large pool of candidate input variables, a systematic procedure for input variable selection based on Recursive Feature Elimination algorithm is employed to reduce the risk of model overfitting and increase model explainability. Second, in quantifying the importance of each input variables, a recently developed method termed Shapley value-based feature importance (Lundberg and Lee 2017) is adopted to address possible quantification bias in importance among input variables of different types. Third, instead of using partial dependence plots, a prevalent method for characterizing the relationships between response and input variables which can be problematic when input variables are correlated, we employ a new approach called Accumulated Local Effects plots developed by Apley and Zhu (2020) that explicitly accounts for the presence of correlation of input variables and is also computationally less expensive. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. “Literature review” section reviews the relevant literature of online shopping. GBM model development is presented in “Model development” section, followed by a description of the data used in the study in “Data” section. “Model implementation and results” section describes model implementation. “Post-modeling analysis” section  performs post-modeling analysis, including quantifying the importance of the input variables and the relationships between the input and response variables. Finally, “Conclusions” section concludes and suggests directions for future research.",1

Atiyya Shaw,Kari E. Watkins,Unknown,Unknown,Female,Female,"In 2011, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution recognizing happiness and well-being as a fundamental human goal, and followed this in 2013 by establishing an official International Day of Happiness. These actions attracted much attention from the international community, and especially from those within academia, generating a surge of popular news and academic pieces on well-being and its variants. However, psychologists and social scientists have been studying happiness and subjective well-being (SWB) for decades, based on large-scale longitudinal surveys. For example, Harvard Medical School’s Study of Adult Development is the longest-running study of adult life (ongoing since 1939), and focuses on well-being during adulthood (McLaughlin et al. 2010; Waldinger et al. 2007). The World Values Survey (WVS) is another well-known longitudinal study, originating in 1981, spanning almost 100 countries, and spawning numerous contributions to the SWB literature due to its open availability (Kim 2018; Sarracino 2010). Other established sources of longitudinal well-being data include the British Social Attitudes Survey (BSA; Dean and Phillips 2015), the European Social Survey (ESS; Welsch and Kuehling 2017), the U.S. General Social Survey (GSS; Ifcher and Zarghamee 2014), and the International Social Survey Program (ISSP; Levin 2014). These large-scale longitudinal studies have allowed researchers to model the effects of general variables such as demographic characteristics, as well as selected values and behaviors, on SWB. However, because these longitudinal surveys are broad in nature, they do not facilitate the examination of SWB within specific contexts or with the help of more diverse explanatory variables. As a result, researchers within assorted fields have taken to studying SWB using cross-sectional surveys, which are more commonly available and facilitate investigation from specific perspectives (e.g., effects of health, occupation, transportation, etc. on well-being). In this study, we combine the longitudinal and cross-sectional approaches to studying well-being, creating a fused dataset that includes common variables from five travel-behavior-oriented cross-sectional surveys conducted across a 27-year period. Each survey includes an identical SWB question, as well as numerous other common variables across the individual datasets. Since these surveys were originally designed to serve travel behavior modeling purposes, the development of this fused dataset allows a unique examination of SWB within a transport context. Combining multiple travel survey datasets also enables the analysis of contextual variables that will differ across time and space, leading to more generalizable conclusions about the impact of the transportation-related attributes and attitudes on life satisfaction. Despite the continuity of some design factors across the five cross-sectional surveys, there are inevitable inconsistencies stemming from question wording differences and evolving survey design techniques over the years. In this study, we demonstrate an approach for addressing and ameliorating such inconsistencies using a combination of survey fusion and model development techniques. As such, one contribution of this work is to provide a rigorous example of using multi-year cross-sectional survey datasets to study the longitudinal evolution of variables, in this case, SWB, over time. Accordingly, this study both: (1) provides a detailed examination of SWB from a general as well as a transportation-oriented perspective; and (2) provides an example of combining cross-sectional survey datasets for longitudinal studies. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: the “Literature review” section provides an overview of the SWB literature from both conceptual and empirical perspectives. The “Overview of data” section provides a short introduction to the five transportation-oriented surveys, describes the survey fusion framework, and summarizes key statistics across the fused dataset. In the “Model estimation and analysis” section, we briefly provide background on the generalized ordered logit (GOL) model, followed by the results of the GOL models. In the “Discussion” section, we discuss model findings and limitations. We conclude with a brief overview of major findings, and provide recommendations for future research.",2

People who engage in active travel tend to be more physically active (Roth et al. 2012; Sahlqvist et al. 2012). Physical activity reduces all-cause mortality and multiple chronic disease outcomes such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancers (Bull et al. 2020; Pedersen and Saltin 2015; Warburton and Bredin 2017). Thus, widespread use of active travel across the population is beneficial for public health. Walking and cycling can be for the whole journey or to access public transport. Studies have reported that use of public transportation is a significant contributor to physical activity (Rissel et al. 2012). A significant proportion of public transportation users chieve 30-min-a-day of physical activity (Besser and Dannenberg 2005; Patterson et al. 2019). They are also many times more likely to achieve 10,000 steps in a day compared to users of private motorised modes (Villanueva et al. 2008; Wener and Evans 2007). The level of activity may also vary by the type of public transportation. For example, train use leads to a much higher level of activity than the bus (Morency et al. 2011). Daily mobility in a population is highly gendered (Alessandretti et al. 2020; Law 2002; Peters 2011). Average travel behaviour of women differs on from men in locations visited, trip purpose, trip distance, and mode of transport (Alessandretti et al. 2020; Gauvin et al. 2020; Goel et al. 2021; Law 2002; Ravensbergen et al. 2019). These differences result from space–time constraints, such as childcare and household tasks that fall disproportionately on women, that are also related to differences in employment levels (Kwan 2000; Peters 2011). Women are also more sensitive to traffic risk resulting in gender differences in the use of active travel (Aldred et al. 2017; Garrard et al. 2008a). Further, there are gender norms, cultural barriers, and fear of sexual harassment and assault by men that deter women from using certain modes of transport or travel at certain times of day (Iqbal et al. 2020; Phadke 2013). It is often while walking or cycling, or using public transport, when women feel most vulnerable during travel (Gekoski et al. 2017), thus making active travel for women a potential source of anxiety. Given that gender inequalities vary across countries, it is likely that the gender gap, in both mobility generally and active travel specifically, varies greatly across the world. Althoff et al. (2020) used smartphone accelerometery data for ~ 100 countries and found large variation in gender inequality in walking (measured as daily number of steps). The highest gender inequality was reported for Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Malaysia and the lowest in Sweden, Ukraine, and Russia. The study also concluded that population-wide activity inequality could be greatly reduced through increases in female activity alone. The study by Althoff and other such large-scale global studies, though useful to highlight gender gaps and its variation across the globe, often lack details such as the modes of transport that individuals use to attain their activity levels. There are very few studies that compared travel activity levels across a large range of countries especially a mix of low-and-middle and high-income countries. In this study we aim to address this gap in literature. Using travel surveys, we present active travel patterns for 19 cities across 13 countries located across 6 continents. We aim to answer the following research questions: What are the gender differences across the cities in terms of use of active modes of transport for all trips and for trips to work? What are the gender differences in active travel time and relative contributions of modes of transport to active travel time? What are the gender differences in the proportion of the population achieving 30 min of physical activity from active travel? The following includes the section on method that provide details of the datasets used, as well as the analysis conducted. This is followed by a section on results. Next, we present discussion and conclusions of the paper.",16

Lopez (2017) writes, “Ungodly commutes, as we know, are not new to Southern California, which practically invented sprawl. People have long moved out of the city by choice, but with housing costs at historic highs, some now move by necessity.” California is one of the few states where more than 10 percent of households make hour-long or even longer daily commutes (Schuetz 2019). Workers in California coastal communities—where housing prices are highest—spend 10 percent more time commuting than the national average (Taylor 2015). With the growing suburbanization of both jobs and households, the number of jobs within close proximity of residents has declined in most metropolitan areas (Kneebone and Holmes 2016) and commute distance has grown (Crane 2007; McGuckin and Fucci 2018). In the Los Angeles metropolitan area, from 2000 to 2012 the number of jobs near the average resident decreased by 7.4 percent, with even higher increases in commute distance in high-poverty and majority-minority neighborhoods (Kneebone and Holmes 2016). At the same time, housing prices—both home and rental—have continued to climb, even in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic (Joint Center for Housing Studies 2020a). High housing costs may limit the ability of lower-income households to act on their preferences for living in close proximity to their jobs (Levine 1998). Despite suggestive evidence of the relationship between housing costs and commute distance, there are relatively few studies that document this association and its magnitude. This study aims to fill this gap in the literature by examining housing availability and commute distance of workers by wages in the Los Angeles metropolitan area (Los Angeles and Orange Counties), with a focus on the commute distance of and housing available for lower-wage workers. For this analysis, we draw on data from the 2015 Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) Origin–Destination Employment Statistics (LODES) supplemented with neighborhood-level data from the 2013–2017 5-year American Community Survey (ACS). We find substantial variation in the jobs-housing fit, the availability of affordable housing in close proximity to low- and medium-wage jobs. The imbalance is greatest in higher-income neighborhoods located along the coast and in Orange County, the county just south of Los Angeles. Moreover, controlling for other determinants of commute distance, a higher ratio of jobs to affordable housing is associated with longer distance commutes. While the availability of housing in close proximity to jobs matters for higher-wage workers, the effect is significantly muted. Longer distance commutes can be detrimental to families as well as to the environment—adversely affecting economic mobility, activity participation, health, and air quality. The results of this study underscore the importance of available and affordable housing in enabling workers to live close to their jobs, if they so choose. However, Southern California is facing an acute shortage of affordable housing. To address increasing commute distances, policymakers must greatly expand and protect the supply of long-term rental housing particularly in job-rich neighborhoods.",1

Research suggests travelers have a propensity to form trip chains to reduce travel costs and/or save time (Liu 2012; Strathman et al. 1994; Wang 2015), such as when travelers stop at non-work activity locations when traveling to or from work. In chaining trips, travelers are potentially decreasing overall vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and positively impacting the transportation system of a region (Carlson and Howard 2010; Duncan 2016). The private automobile (i.e. auto) offers many advantages to travelers who chain their trips on a regular basis, including flexibility in scheduling and selection of routes, as well as overall travel comfort and the ability to store items between trips (Xianyu 2013). However, researchers also find that in areas with high transit demand, travelers complete complex trip chains using rail-based transit services in order to avoid roadway congestion and parking costs (Currie and Delbosc 2011). The recent emergence and proliferation of ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft offers travelers another modal option to complete trip chains or portions of trip chains. In general, ride-hailing services provide many of the benefits of a private auto without the high upfront purchasing costs nor parking costs. In contrast to transit, ride-hailing services obviate the first/last mile problem by providing transportation directly from one activity location to the next. Ride-hailing trips are also a lot more flexible than transit trips in terms of scheduling and routing. Hence, ride-hailing includes most of the benefits and avoids most of the pitfalls of both personal vehicles and transit for trip chaining purposes. However, a notable downside of ride-hailing (and transit and walking) relative to a personal vehicle is the inability to store items inside a vehicle between trips. Another downside of ride-hailing is the relatively high cost per trip. Given the potential of ride-hailing to be an attractive mode for trip chaining, the goal of this study is to explore the role ride-hailing currently plays within trip chains. The study focuses on understanding the attributes of the travelers who use ride-hailing within trip chains, the activities and trips within trip chains with ride-hailing, the complexity and structure of trip chains made with ride-hailing, and the land-use characteristics of the areas where ride-hailing trip chains typically occur. To meet the study’s overarching goal and answer specific research questions, this paper includes (i) a descriptive analysis of the characteristics of travelers across modes and across trip purposes or activities who trip chain, (ii) a binary logit model to understand the modal, individual, land-use, activity, and trip chain attributes correlated with the usage of ride-hailing within a trip chain, and (iii) a nested logit model to capture the modal, individual, land-use, activity, and trip chain attributes correlated with the choice of a primary trip chain mode. The analysis employs data from the largest, by population, 50 core-based statistical areas (CBSAs), obtained from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) dataset. While several existing studies attempt to reveal trip making patterns of ride-hailing users, as far as the authors are aware, this is the first study to explore ride-hailing within the context of trip chains. Since trip chaining is a relatively complex form of travel behavior with specific travel requirements, understanding the role ride-hailing plays within trip chains should help transportation planners, policymakers, and system managers formulate policies to enable better integration of ride-hailing into people’s daily travel routines, to ultimately improve mobility and accessibility. The literature also points to the significant opportunity for ride-hailing to support multi-modal travel (Shaheen and Chan 2016), which is related to trip chaining. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The next section reviews travel behavior-related ride-hailing and trip chaining research. The third section presents the theoretical framework and modeling approach to meet the study’s objectives. The fourth section provides an overview of the data used to answer the study’s research questions. The fifth section presents the model results, while the sixth section discusses the model results and their broader implications. The final section concludes the paper with a summary of the study, key findings, study limitations, and future research directions.",3
50.0,3.0,Transportation,04 March 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11116-022-10270-3,Mitigating bus bunching with real-time crowding information,June 2023,Arkadiusz Drabicki,Rafał Kucharski,Oded Cats,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Reliability of public transport (PT) operations is an important aspect for the perceived PT quality of service, which is profoundly influenced by variations in travel times and on-board travel conditions. In this context, variability of passenger flows is one of the key determinants of PT service reliability (Sorratini et al. 2008), especially in urban, congested transport networks. Excessive, unstable demand flows can ignite supply performance perturbations that can quickly spiral from an isolated event into a network-wide disruption (Cats et al. 2011b), and exacerbate service disruptions even without exogenous disturbances, posing major risks in low and high demand conditions (Fonzone et al. 2015). A clear illustration of this inherent PT system instability is the so-called bus bunching effect (Newell and Potts 1964; Cats et al. 2011b). Bunching is the consequence of a negative feedback loop between service headways, number of arriving passengers and dwell times. The bus bunching pattern is likely to become self-amplified along the service line, as the first bus becomes increasingly overcrowded and delayed at downstream stops, while the second bus is underutilized and ‘catches up’ with the predecessor, leading to their ‘platooning’ in extreme cases (Yu et al. 2016). This phenomenon results in unreliable services, with a series of negative implications for passengers and operators—longer journey times, service delays, higher travel discomfort, risk of overcrowding and denied boarding, uneven headway and load distribution and an inefficient capacity utilization (Cats et al. 2016). A major contributor to the bunching problem is passengers’ inherent preference towards boarding the first available departure, which exacerbates further the crowding—bunching feedback effect. Therefore, strategies aimed at stimulating co-operative boarding behaviour amongst passengers—presumably through the provision of real-time crowding information—shall be explored as a potential measure to counteract the bus bunching (Delgado et al. 2012; Wu et al. 2017). To counteract the undesirable bunching effect, various tactical operational strategies have been conceived. On the supply side, these involve holding control strategies [commonly evaluated as an optimized weighted function of passenger travel (dis)utility and/or the closed-form function of bus arrival times, e.g.: Adamski and Turnau 1998; Cats et al. 2011b; Bartholdi and Eisenstein 2012; Delgado et al. 2012; Berrebi et al. 2015; Berrebi et al. 2018; Laskaris et al. 2019; Gkiotsalitis and Cats 2019; Gkiotsalitis and van Berkum 2020; Wang and Sun 2020]; allowing for buses to overtake each other (Sun and Schmöcker 2018; Schmöcker et al. 2016; Wu et al. 2017); stop-skipping (expressing) (Fu et al. 2003; Sun and Hickman 2005; Larrain and Muñoz 2020); short-turning (Zhang et al. 2017; Leffler et al.  2017, Gkiotsalitis et al. 2019); rescheduling (Gkiotsalitis 2019); speed adjustment (Daganzo and Pilachowski 2011); and robust slack-time planning (Zhao et al. 2016). Another, relatively less-explored stream of research is devoted to impacts of demand-side phenomena in managing the bus bunching problem, albeit with limited empirical underpinning (Wu et al. 2017; Sun and Schmöcker 2018; Wu et al. 2019). A series of works have dealt with the notion of applying boarding limits to counteract the bunching effect. Imposing boarding limits or a no-boarding policy implies that when specific (in)stability criteria are met, the PT operator constrains the number of passengers allowed to board a PT vehicle, forcing the remaining ones to wait at the stop for a later departure. In the context of reversing the bus bunching mechanism, while holding strategies aim at ‘slowing down’ the second bus that moves ahead of schedule, the objective of no-boarding strategies is to ‘speed up’ the first bus that is otherwise increasingly delayed (Saw et al. 2019). Delgado et al. (2012) estimate that boarding limits can foster the benefits of holding strategies when applied simultaneously, particularly in the case of high-frequency and high-demand services, requiring fewer and shorter holding times to restore service regularity and travel comfort. Boarding limits implemented as a sole (isolated) measure were also found to be effective in reducing headway variability and improving travel times (Zhao et al. 2016; Enayatollahi et al. 2019). Saw et al. (2019) conclude that no-boarding policies perform favorably in mitigating the bus bunching when compared against holding strategies in busy periods, but contrarily—backfire during low-demand periods (by imposing excessive waiting times) when holding is a more advantageous solution. Aside from the notion of fixed boarding limits, a number of papers analyse whether shifts in passengers’ boarding behaviour can also help mitigate bus bunching. Wu et al. (2017) introduce a dynamic queue swapping behaviour model, where boarding probability is proportional to the available (residual) capacity of next bus arrivals—i.e. passengers at a stop form self-equilibrating boarding queues for the first and second incoming departures. They found that in conjunction with enabling overtaking between buses, this brings substantial performance and travel experience benefits, regardless of network demand levels and without employing any holding controls. Sun and Schmöcker (2018) demonstrate that in the event of bus bunching, a hypothetically high preference towards waiting deliberately for a second bus is in general advantageous for restoring the service regularity and improving travel experience, even without additional control measures. Studies acknowledge that favourable shifts in passengers’ boarding behaviour may be encouraged by providing information on the in-vehicle crowding levels (Delgado et al. 2012; Palma et al. 2015; Schmöcker et al. 2016; Wu et al. 2017). This is an increasingly feasible solution as data on past and current passenger flows in PT networks is gathered via a variety of sources—including Automated Passenger Counts (APC) and Automated Fare Collection (AFC) systems, video recording data, remote sensing, mobile and wireless networks, and most importantly—smart card ticketing systems. These data can be processed and conveyed to passengers in the form of real-time crowding information (RTCI) (Jenelius 2020). Current state-of-the-practice of RTCI systems involves usually pilot and limited-scale projects, ranging from localised crowding information on individual train carriages’ loads (e.g. London (Schmitt 2017), Sydney (Susan 2017), Tokyo (EJRC 2019), information on bus occupancy loads (e.g. Seoul (SMC 2017) and train crowding [e.g. Stockholm Metro (Zhang et al. 2017), Dutch Railways (NS 2021)], to network-wide information on expected crowding levels of PT routes, available via travel apps [e.g. Google Maps (Google LLC 2021), Moovit (Moovit Inc 2021), JakDojade.pl (City-Nav LLC 2021)]. Recently, RTCI provision has been gaining momentum as operators aim to tackle the ramifications of the (on-going) covid-19 pandemic crisis for perceived travel safety. This has been witnessed in several systems in the US, e.g. in Boston (MBTA 2021), San Jose (VTA 2021) and Washington D. C. (WMATA 2020), where crowding information is disclosed in real-time to reassure travellers about on-board crowding conditions and the possibility to maintain social distancing. Access to crowding information concerning the next PT trips (departures) at a stop can induce a specific decision pattern among passengers, namely the willingness to wait (WTW) to reduce (or avoid) on-board overcrowding experience—i.e., by skipping the first (overcrowded) trip and waiting at the stop to board a second, less-crowded trip later. This phenomenon has been estimated in a number of stated preference (SP) studies by means of survey questions (Kim et al. 2009; Kroes et al. 2014) or choice experiments (Preston et al. 2017; Kattan and Bai 2018; Drabicki et al. 2022). These studies found that the extent to which passengers are willing to wait is mainly driven by high overcrowding levels in the first departure, where the WTW tends to rise non-linearly above a perceived discomfort threshold, and on the waiting time for the second departure from the same PT stop. Average acceptable waiting times were found to oscillate between: ca. 3–12 [mins]—for urban PT (bus and tram) systems (Drabicki et al. 2022), and ca. 8–25 [mins]—for regional rail trips (Preston et al. 2017). In the case of urban PT trips, a 5-min wait is deemed acceptable for 40% of respondents—if the first bus/tram is moderately crowded (i.e. has ‘comfortable’ standing space available), and even for up to 80% of them—if it is severely overcrowded (i.e. possible denied-boarding risk). Survey findings from a Paris metro system report analogous figures, ranging from 12% (first train—minor crowding) to 75% (first train—severe overcrowding) (Kroes et al. 2014). The potential network-wide impact of RTCI upon passengers’ travel behaviour has been assessed by several studies using PT simulation models. These studies focus on specific RTCI consequences and spatial (i.e., route choice) or temporal (i.e., departure choice) impact dimensions. Bouman et al. (2016) develop a game-theory based model and analyse crowding information provision in context of the so-called El Farol Bar problem. Toy network simulations underline its potential to enhance capacity utilization, but also the risk of lower payoffs with rising network coverage and responsiveness to crowding information. Nuzzolo et al. (2016) proposed a mesoscopic PT assignment model that simulates the impact of predictive RTCI on long-term (day-to-day) travel decisions. Predictive RTCI and network assignment are achieved as an iterative outcome of in-vehicle passenger loads merging towards choice probabilities. Case study results show that long-term adaptation to such crowding prediction induces substantial departure time shifts in everyday journeys (e.g., AM peak widening), and a certain decrease in waiting times and denied-boarding risk. Noursalehi et al. (2019) introduce a dynamic, mesoscopic PT assignment model for analysing the impacts of localized (station-level) predictive RTCI on instantaneous departure choices of next train departures. Crowding prediction refers here to the probability of being able to board an arriving PT vehicle (i.e., guaranteed/likely/unlikely). Likewise, it is estimated in a rolling horizon approach in 15- to 30-min intervals as an iterative outcome of convergence between passengers’ anticipations, disseminated RTCI content and actual travel condition. Application findings reveal that passengers’ acceptance of boarding deference (i.e. WTW rate induced by predictive RTCI) eventually leads to much lower overcrowding experience and improved on-board comfort. Drabicki et al. (2021b) develop a modelling framework of instantaneous RTCI effects upon route (path) choices. The model, embedded within BusMezzo, a dynamic transit assignment simulation model, assumes that RTCI is generated based on latest reported crowding levels of downstream line segments, and then utilized by passengers to evaluate route choice probabilities. Model demonstration reveals that such crowding information can improve travel experience—in particular, by reducing the incidence of worst overcrowding experience—but it is also marked by substantial inaccuracy risks, especially on the crowding underestimation side. Finally, a recent study of Wang et al. (2021) presents the toy-network simulation of impacts of passenger boarding shifts in response to RTCI on bus crowding loads. Demonstration of their algorithm suggest improvements of ca. 20% in terms of bus headways and bus run times and its potential to coordinate with holding control strategies. The policy performance is seemingly robust even with low WTW rates among the passengers. In summary, although state-of-the-art studies have explored the prospects of demand-side interventions in managing the bus bunching, they predominantly involved centralized, top-down assumptions on operators’ boarding policies (fixed boarding limits) or passengers’ boarding choices (fixed splitting rates or self-equilibrating queuing behaviour). In contrast, the potential ramifications of decentralized, individual boarding decision patterns that might be stimulated by provisioning RTCI are not yet fully understood. Arguably, there is still a lack of comprehensive and evidence-based knowledge on collective dynamics, which might emerge from more informed individual decision-making in the context of bus bunching. The objective of this study is to assess the effects of real-time crowding information (RTCI) on travel experience and service reliability in the context of bus bunching problem. To this end, we model the passengers’ instantaneous boarding choices with access to RTCI on crowding levels of next two PT departures from the current stop. The choice model is developed based on own stated-preference empirical findings of the willingness to wait (WTW) behaviour with RTCI (Drabicki et al. 2022). It is then implemented within a dynamic, agent-based PT assignment model, reproducing its wider impacts upon PT system performance and journey experience. The potential of RTCI in mitigating the bunching is demonstrated through an application to a case study of a busy bus corridor in Warsaw (Poland). As shown by our results, the WTW with RTCI can greatly mitigate the evolution of bus bunching, prompting up to 30–70% of passengers to wait voluntarily for a less-crowded departure. Overall, this results in major improvements in terms of service performance, journey experience and eliminated risk of ‘full bunching’ phenomenon. The supply side witnesses lower headway variations and more uniform vehicle loads’ distribution. Benefits for passengers are evident across the majority of bus stops, especially at central and downstream parts of the service, where further evolution of bus bunching is effectively eliminated. Interestingly, WTW does not necessarily result in longer total waiting time. Consequently, RTCI provision leads to global decline in both nominal journey times (2%) and generalized travel disutility (5%), and substantially reduced risks of in-vehicle overcrowding and denial-of-boarding (40%). Travel experience benefits are attainable already with limited responsiveness to RTCI, while higher RTCI utilization among passengers can also foster the service regularity. This work aims to contribute to the (insofar limited) state-of-the-art stream of research on the prospective role of RTCI in mitigating bus bunching. Initial literature findings (Wang et al. 2021) have illustrated the value of RTCI in regulating bus services for numerical, toy-network simulations. We extend these considerations in our study and develop the PT operations and assignment model, underpinned by empirical WTW sensitivity analysis. Case study application reveals plausible RTCI effects on a real-world bus corridor model, whose overall benefits are captured via multiple metrics. We also investigate the impact of various level of responsiveness to the information provisioned. We conclude this study with discussion on our findings and the prospects of RTCI in real-time service and demand management strategies. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section “Method” presents the methodology of the proposed WTW choice model with RTCI and its embedment within a dynamic PT simulation model. Section “Application and Results” follows with application results of the proposed simulation model to a bus corridor case study network. We conclude this study with Sect. “Discussion”, containing a summary of findings and practical implications.",5

Robson,Taha H. Rashidi,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"Since the advent of the four-step transport planning framework in the 1950s, there has been a drive to incorporate linkages between transport networks and the broader economy. The simplest four-step models assume that origin–destination (OD) demands for trip assignment remain static as transport networks change. For small changes, this assumption is most likely realistic, but larger ones can lead to fundamental shifts in economies and travel demand. For example, improvements in travel time savings may lead to migration, changes in employment patterns, increased attractiveness of shopping regions and so forth. One method of incorporating OD demand elasticity is to update the generation, distribution and mode split steps using travel times from the assignment step. Land-use transport interaction (LUTI) models (Wegener 2004) achieve this by simulating changes in land-use patterns resulting from changes in travel times or accessibility indicators, and then recalculating travel demand from the new land-use patterns. While this can allow for the partial equilibration of land markets, there is still a reliance on fixed economic parameters for markets other than transport and land as well as of prices for all markets. Unabated population growth, urbanisation, and increase in consumption leads to higher pressure on transport services. In addition, changes in the production structure and economic patterns also can influence transport demand over time. As a result, a new body of research focuses on transport modelling, defined by the creation of transport input–output (IO) models at the urban and regional scale, where authors used IO, gravity, and SCGE approaches to model inter-regional freight demand (Ivanova 2014). Furthermore, there is increasing interest in understanding the welfare gains and losses that occur due to market imperfections and technological externalities, known as wider economic impacts (WEIs). These are not captured in the conventional consumer surplus metric used in cost benefit analyses, whether driven by classic four-step modelling structures or contemporary activity-based models. Computable general equilibrium (CGE) models have been adapted in recent years to analyse the economic effects of transport and to quantify WEIs (Wangsness et al. 2016). A CGE model comprises a set of equilibrium equations representing supply and demand in every market in a given economy. These equations are built from fundamental microeconomic models of household (consumer) and firm (producer) behaviour, and thus a CGE model can provide a wide array of welfare, price and GDP outputs. They can also be used to identify the eventual distribution of impacts both spatially and through markets from the equilibration of the entire economy. CGE models for transport are typically applied to estimate productivity gains from transport improvements, where transport costs determine regional demand and freight costs (Robson et al. 2018). Some formulations represent household travel demand as well, in which case transport costs influence household decisions on where to live, work and shop. In most models, transport costs are static parameters calculated by a transport model. There are a limited number of models with feedback between CGE and transport submodels such that the CGE model generates demand for the transport model, and the transport model generates transport costs for the CGE model (Shahraki and Bachmann 2018). This type of CGE model with endogenous travel costs provides a basis to develop an extended four-step planning model that accounts for a fuller range of economic responses. Since CGE models are simulators of economies, it is possible to generate trips at a very fundamental level—as a derived demand from the activities of households and firms, whose behaviour is determined from utility and profit maximisation models. A key advantage of linking these two models is that the one model could then be used to estimate both the magnitude and distribution of economic impacts, rather than relying on exogenous transport and economic models, generating a faster and richer set of outputs for strategic planning. The two-fold benefit towards both CGE and transport modelling practice would be that the transport model provides a complete endogenous response of transport costs for the CGE model, and the CGE model provides an endogenous economic response for the transport model. However, very few, if any, existing CGE models with endogenous transport costs represent transport networks in such detail (Robson et al. 2018). For example (Broecker et al. 2004) modelled Socio-Economic and Spatial Impacts of EU Transport Policy using regional transport model linking to the CGE for the entire European Union. Transport models in the four-step framework are required to handle detailed networks, incorporate different time periods and generate a complete set of travel demands (including household and freight) to model transport costs accurately and at a resolution that permits the analysis of physical changes in infrastructure. Instead, existing CGE models with endogenous transport costs mostly represent sketch networks at the geographical scale of the CGE model, which are generally much coarser than the scale of travel zones in a four-step model, making the analysis of physical changes more difficult. Furthermore, existing models tend to only generate trips that are relevant to their model behaviour, e.g. commuting and shopping trips for an urban CGE model, or freight trips for a regional CGE model. Without representing the full set of travel demands, transport costs do not reflect those observed in the actual network. This paper presents an integrated CGE and transport model that generates household and freight trips and simulates a detailed road network for different time periods. It is conceptually distinct from the model in Robson and Dixit (2017a) in that the transport submodel can be calibrated and run as a conventional transport model. Compared to that model, the transport submodel is new in that it is formulated separately, generates freight trips and allows for different geographies and time periods between the submodels. The CGE submodel in this paper is an extended version of the submodel in Robson and Dixit (2017a) by adding foreign market and government agents. Above all of these modifications, the Robson and Dixit work was based on a mixed complementarity formulation which was restricting the usage of the model for large scale problems. This is now relaxed in the proposed formulation of this paper. This structure provides a universal platform for modelling the economy and transport networks together, which can be extended for land-use. The model is calibrated for the Sydney transport network and economy, and is tested by simulating the WestConnex motorway project currently under construction. At this stage, the model does not simulate mode choice, but can be implemented in future models. The proposed model paves the path of development of transport-based CGE models. This suggests a paradigm shift from CGE-based transport models, which are typically limited in terms of the level of complication that can be borrowed from a transport model such as number of zones/links of a realistic transport network or properties of the travel demand model. In introducing a transport-based CGE model, the transport aspects of the proposed formulation can be seen as an object-oriented structure which can be easily plugged in if needed without requiring many changes in the CGE model. As such, the proposed transport-based CGE model can better accommodate transport related policies to assess their effectiveness and robustness. Compared to the existing literature, Fig. 1 shows where the current paper stands in literature and the gap it fills with proposing transport-based CGE model. A comparison between the existing literature and the current paper (Anas and Hiramatsu 2012; Tikoudis 2020; Tscharaktschiew and Hirte 2012; Dröes and Rietveld 2015) In this paper, “Literature review” section reviews existing CGE models for transport. “Methodology” section develops the integrated model and discusses its assumptions. “Calibration” section describes data for the model calibration and details the calibration process. “Application” section describes the model application. “Results and discussion” section presents and discusses the results of the model application. “Conclusion” section concludes the paper.",

One of its exemplars, present around the world, is the ridesourcing company Uber (also known as a Transportation Network Company or TNC), which began operations in 2009. Since then, a myriad of TNCs have appeared around the world (Lyft, DiDi, Grab etc.) Recent findings suggest that ridesourcing companies may be a contributing factor to worsening traffic conditions in cities, particularly in downtown areas (Balding et al. 2019; Erhardt et al. 2019; Rodier 2018). One reason for this is a relatively large proportion (30–60%) of empty vehicle miles travelled (VMT) while roaming and waiting for travellers (Henao and Marshall 2018). The other reason lies in ridesourcing substituting other existing modes. While the majority seem to replace car and taxi trips (40–70%), up to 30% of TNC users would have used public transport otherwise while 8–22% would not have travelled at all (Rodier 2018). Henao and Marshall (2018) looked at the impact of mode substitution and found that almost 37% of ridesourcing VMT is generated by users who would have otherwise gone by public transport, active modes (walking and cycling) or not have travelled at all. They conclude that, were it not for TNCs, these travellers would have generated almost 50-times fewer VMT. While the increasing adoption of ridesourcing services seems to exacerbate congestion in cities, the technology and service they introduce provide opportunities for improving accessibility and equity in urban mobility. One of the possibilities are pooled on-demand trips—as opposed to private trips—where passengers with a similar trajectory and departure time are combined and travel with the same vehicle, increasing vehicle occupancy and reducing VMT (Henao and Marshall 2018). Developing the necessary sharing algorithms and showcasing the benefits is a central topic of many papers in the field (Alonso-Mora et al. 2017; Bischoff et al. 2018; Inturri et al. 2019; Kucharski and Cats 2020; Lokhandwala and Cai 2018; OECD 2015; Ota et al. 2015; Sayarshad and Oliver Gao 2018). For ridesourcing services to offer an attractive pooling alternative it is essential to get a better understanding of travellers’ preferences. Firstly, we need to have good insight into the attitudes towards on-demand mobility on one hand and alternative modes in the urban environment on the other hand. This will allow assessing how the use of certain modes will be affected with the introduction of on-demand mobility services. Secondly, to get as many people as possible to use pooled ridesourcing, we also need to identify travellers’ willingness to share rides and how this relates to other travel preferences. In this paper we use the terms ‘ride-hailing’ and ‘ridesourcing’ when referring to services and companies such as Uber, Lyft, DiDi etc. These however are not the only types of on-demand transport services. Some incumbent public transport companies offer demand responsive transit (DRT) or microtransit in low demand areas, offering a flexible alternative to the fixed bus lines, such as Mokumflex (Coutinho et al. 2020) and Breng flex (Alonso-González et al. 2018). From a traveller’s perspective, microtransit and (pooled) ride-hailing are largely similar, as in both cases travellers order a ride using a smartphone app, website or by calling, for a trip from A to B without transferring, that the vehicle would not have made otherwise. A notable difference between the two services is that microtransit may not be able to offer a door-to-door service and thus a certain access time is necessary. As we account for access walking time in the study, these transport services are from here on referred to as on-demand services or Flex services. They can be ordered either as private (the rider requests a direct trip, without other passengers) or pooled (the vehicle may take small detours to pick up and drop off other passengers along the route) and are referred to as such. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The current literature covering on-demand services, their role in the current mobility environment and analyses related to adoption and use of on-demand services are presented in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 describes the methodology used to address the identified gaps in literature. The first subchapter elaborates on the survey design method and the data gathering, and the second subchapter presents the modelling framework used to analyse the gathered data and the third then describes the obtained sample. Chapter 4 then showcases the results of the model estimation, the identified user groups and the potential of the different classes to use Flex services. Finally, the results and policy implications of the emergence of on-demand services are discussed in Chapters 5 and 6.",4

Its most notable usage is the morning commute, in which heavy passenger demand is concentrated in a short time period. It is known that such transit systems often suffer from delays caused by congestion, even if no serious incidents or accidents occur (Kato et al. 2012; Tirachini et al. 2013; Kariyazaki et al. 2015). Therefore, appropriate management of transit systems is required; especially, travel demand management for mass transit systems has been gaining attention recently (Halvorsen et al. 2019; Huan et al. 2021). One of the approaches to find management strategies of transit systems is theoretical analysis with simplifications, such as use of certain static models with constant travel time (de Cea and Fernández 1993; Tabuchi 1993; Kraus and Yoshida 2002; Tian et al. 2007; Gonzales and Daganzo 2012; Trozzi et al. 2013; de Palma et al. 2015a, b). In this approach, general policy implications can be obtained thanks to the simplicity and tractability of the analysis. However, they may not be sufficient to investigate dynamic (i.e., time-varying) operation and demand management strategies. In congested transit systems, dynamical interaction among trains and passengers plays essential roles to determine the system’s operational behavior, and the travel time can be dynamically and significantly changed due to this interaction. For instances, there are two types of congestion in transit systems: train-congestion: congestion involving consecutive trains using the same tracks, passenger-congestion: congestion of passengers who are boarding to a train, namely, bottleneck congestion at the doors of a train while it is stopped at a station (Lam et al. 1998; Wada et al. 2012; Kariyazaki et al. 2015),Footnote 1 and these two types of congestion interact with each other and cause delay (Newell and Potts 1964; Kusakabe et al. 2010; Wada et al. 2012; Kato et al. 2012; Tirachini et al. 2013; Kariyazaki et al. 2015; Cuniasse et al. 2015). The “knock-on delay” is a well-known phenomenon describing “a train’s delay which is caused by other trains in front of it” (Carey and Kwieciński 1994). Some of the knock-on delays can be considered as caused by the dynamic train–passenger interaction (Kariyazaki et al. 2015). Specifically, trains are delayed due to the large number of boarding and alighting passengers at stations, and such delay propagates to the subsequent trains—this can be a train equivalent of the “bus bunching” (Newell and Potts 1964; Daganzo 2009). For example, assume that passenger-congestion happened temporally due to high demand. It would extend the dwelling time of a train at a station. Then, this extended dwell time would interrupt the operation of subsequent trains, and cause train-congestion on the track. It would deteriorate the passenger throughput, and thus the passenger-congestion at stations would intensify. This kind of dynamical phenomena cannot be captured by static models. A consequence of such dynamical passenger–train interaction can be found in macroscopic states of transit systems. Figure 1 shows observed 3-dimensional relations among states of transit systems, that is, train-flow (train/h), train-density (train/km), and passenger-flow (passenger/h). The visualization is based on the concepts of the fundamental diagram (Greenshields 1935) of urban traffic. Although Fig. 1a and 1b show data from completely different transit systems with completely different scales (e.g., the number of cars per one train was 10 for Tokyo and 1–6 for Boston), they have similar patterns. First, as the passenger-flow increases, the train-density increases; this could be a result of transit operators responding to increased passenger-demand. Second, as the passenger-flow increases, the average service speed of trains and train-flow decreases; this could be a result of the aforementioned congestion due to the interaction among trains and passengers. It would be preferable if we have a theoretical model of this phenomena, because it would be useful to obtain general principles on transit operations; however, to our knowledge, such a model does not exist in the literature.Footnote 2 Observed 3-dimensional relations among train-flow, train-density, and passenger-flow. The x-coordinates represent the train-flow (i.e., the number of trains per a kilometer), the y-coordinates represent the train-flow (i.e., the number of passing trains per an hour), the slope from the origin to an arbitrary point indicates the train-speed (i.e., the average speed of trains) of that point, and the color of each point represents the passenger-flow (i.e., average demand of passengers per an hour) of that point. “pax” in the figure is an abbreviation for “passenger”. Data sources: Fukuda et al. (2019), Zhang and Wada (2019), Tokyu Railways, and Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority This study derives a theoretical relation among the state variables of transit systems similar to Fig. 1 based on the microscopic operation principles. It is modeled as a fundamental diagram (FD), which is a well-known concept in the vehicular traffic flow theory. The original FD describes relation between vehicular flow and density, and it can be used to describe dynamic evolution of traffic by combining with other principles in a tractable manner (Lighthill and Whitham 1955; Richards 1956; Mahmassani et al. 1984; Geroliminis and Daganzo 2007). In fact, several recent studies have employed FDs of transit systems to describe train-congestion by modeling the relation between train-flow and train-density (Cuniasse et al. 2015; Corman et al. 2019; de Rivera and Dick 2021). The novel feature of this study is the incorporation of passengers in an analytical way. Furthermore, this study develops a dynamic transit assignment method based on the proposed FD. This study proposes tractable models of the dynamics of urban rail transit considering the physical interaction between train-congestion and passenger-congestion. In “Microscopic Model of Rail Transit System” section, a microscopic model of a rail transit system is introduced based on a passenger boarding model and a train cruising model. In “Fundamental Diagram of Rail Transit System” section, the operation performance of the microscopic model is analyzed. Specifically, a mathematically tractable relation among train-flow, train-density, and passenger-flow is derived—namely, a fundamental diagram (FD). The model can be also viewed as a variation of 3-dimensional macroscopic fundamental diagram (Mahmassani et al. 1984; Geroliminis and Daganzo 2007) with an analytical derivation. This is the key contribution of this study. In “Dynamic Model Based on Fundamental Diagram” section, a macroscopic loading model of a transit system is developed based on the proposed FD. The model describes the aggregated behavior of trains and passengers in a urban-scale spatial domain based on the FD. In Section “Validation of the Macroscopic Model”, the approximation accuracy and other properties of the proposed macroscopic model are investigated through a comparison with microscopic simulation. Section “Conclusion” concludes this article. Note that empirical validation of the proposed model based on actual data is out of scope of this study. Such validation is now being conducted by some of the authors and preliminary results that support the model have been obtained (Fukuda et al. 2019; Zhang and Wada 2019).",1
