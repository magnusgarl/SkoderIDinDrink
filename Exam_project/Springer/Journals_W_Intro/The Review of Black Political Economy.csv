Price,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"As I negotiate the second half of my life and career as an economist, and black man—the order may matter—I find myself in many instances afflicted with metaphysical anxieties. Chief among these is the extent to which my research interests and achievements mean anything. Have my intellectual inquiries made a difference? Have I moved the science of economics forward? Of course, such concerns could be mere vanity. Maybe I am just a mediocre half-baked black economist who has overestimated his ability, and both the community of scientists to which I think I belong, and the world at-large has the good sense to simply ignore whatever I offer up as a scientific contribution. Nietzsche once opined that “some men are born posthumously”. Perhaps this is my fate—or is this mere posthumous vanity? Quite frankly, I would prefer making a difference today, during this lifetime, as my time preferences like most people are probably hyperbolic. I suspect this may be true of most men who are not ascetic monks—Christian or otherwise—that are indeed interested in their existential significance in the empirical world they currently live in and occupy. If we are willing to assume that reality exists, and that one’s significance has a measure space that corresponds to their worth, then my metaphysical anxieties about whether I have made a difference as a black economist is potentially a trivial empirical exercise. What about others like me? I do not exist in a social vacuum afterall. In fact my social universe is quite complicated. You see, I am also a black man. I do not lament or apologize for being a black man, but it does seem to change things fundamentally. For example, being a black economist seems to lower one’s value in at least one stark way—it diminishes the prospect of having a career as an academic research scientist at a Ph.D. granting economics department ranked by the National Research Council in 1995 has never hired a black economist.Footnote 1 I also find myself contemplating the minds of other black economists, on their significance, and the extent to which they value me and others like them. Why? Being metaphysically anxious, and existentially challenged of late, I engage in some empiricism, take to the data on occasion, and consider the extent to which other economists cite my research. Not including self-citations, as of December 2007 SCOPUS, indicates that approximately 44% of citations to my research were by other economists and/or social scientists.Footnote 2 Apparently I am vain, as I seem to love myself at a higher rate than others. As for the others that do cite my research, approximately 43% are black economists/social scientists. With respect to my published research that engages the economics of race, approximately 37% of the citations are attributed to black economists/social scientists. Given these facts, I wonder why, given that I am cited at all by economists, why don’t I have more citations by black economists?",7

Poyer,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Every 2 years the Black Enterprise Magazine (BE) publishes its rankings of the top 50 colleges for African Americans. This past year’s rankings were quite different than the 2004 published rankings. As a result, both the type and the relative rank of institutions that compose it have changed. In constructing its rankings this year, BE employed a new methodology. According to BE (Sykes 2006, pp. 74–80): [We have] updated and improved the selection process for the list.... ...First, we expanded our pool of survey reviewers, which now includes more than 500 higher education professionals. ... The new approach—combined with giving more weight to graduation rates and other [italics are ours] necessary adjustments to the criteria—bumped some outstanding schools off the list. Nevertheless, all of the top 10 schools returned. ... ...Morehouse, which had been the top school on the listings, slipped 44 spots, from No. 1 to No. 45, primarily because its graduation rate fell from 56% to 49% over the last two years. (p. 76) A question raised by this and other attempts at academic ranking is their usefulness and legitimacy. To the extent that these exercises provide guidance and information based on institutional outcomes (productivity) and value added is a good thing. But for them to fulfill these requirements they should be subject to scholarly review and critique. They should avoid being arbitrary and inconsistent in their application of evaluation/assessment criteria. Moreover, the theoretical and methodological underpinnings of such exercises should be transparent and rigorously presented. The BE report fails on these grounds. The critique of the BE report presented in this short note attempts to address the following two questions. Does the BE report provide an unbiased and consistent assessment of the educational value associated with the institutions included in their listing? Aside from the general conceptual and methodological questions, is the ranking method internally consistent? In the BE report, there is neither articulation of the theoretical framework/context with in which its ranking is determined nor citation of established/peer-reviewed assessment practices. Exercises of the sort undertaken by BE are not trivial neither for those who consume the information contained in the report nor for the institutions which are the subjects of it. Any serious endeavor to assess institutional effectiveness of educational institutions should be subject to scientific scrutiny and have some policy implication. The BE academic ranking is based on a set of quantitative variables listed in Table 1. In its report, BE gives the impression that its ranking method is based on a set of fixed weights, where “[the] variables given the heaviest weighting were Black graduation rate, followed by the average academic and social environment scores (Sykes 2006, p. 76).” In this analysis, the quantitative benchmark will be based on the consistency and importance of these variables over the entire distribution of institutions included in the 2006 BE listing.
 Although not stated in the BE report, it is assumed that the relative importance of the variables used by BE to construct the list is the same across the entire distribution of institutions that are included in it. If this is the case then the structure of the model, used to construct the ranking list should be the same for all subsets of institutions contained in the BE list. If the published ranking is consistent with this weighting scheme, it should hold regardless of the subset.",1
35.0,1.0,The Review of Black Political Economy,17 April 2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12114-008-9019-x,"Increasing Finance, Improving Schools",March 2008,Linda Loubert,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"In 1993, the 73rd Texas Legislature approved school finance reforms by passing Senate Bill 7 (SB 7), which is commonly known as the “Robin Hood Bill”. In order to increase the per pupil funding in districts that did not have enough tax base to improve funding for their students, SB 7, using a method of fiscal neutralityFootnote 1, required wealthy school districts to share their wealth with poor districts. By assuming a fixed effects model we can examine the changes in academic achievement when state law forces a change in the funding amounts, and address the important policy issue. Do efforts of the legislature to bring about equity in funding to students actually make a difference in improving school quality as measured by academic achievement outcomes? Examination of the elementary schools within 14 school districts of Dallas County, allows us to see that when resources do increase, achievement improves. This study first investigates the inequities in Texas schools that led to school finance reform as legislated by SB 7. It describes and summarizes the data at both the district and the elementary school zone level. It presents the linkage between school quality, home values and the tax base they generate, and funding for students. It reports the findings of the changes in school quality after finance reform by school neighborhoods. It then draws conclusions and policy implications for states considering a fiscally neutral method of funding. Whenever the issue of school finance is placed on the policy-making agenda, and allocation of limited resources is at stake, the question always arises, “Does money really matter?” Taken from the viewpoint that money is an input of the education production function (Hanushek 1986, 1996; Murnane and Levy 1996; Hedges and Greenwald 1996; Iatarola et al. 2002), it is understandable that society would debate the issue. Greater outputs of educational attainment are expected from greater inputs of resources. Student achievement and school finance has been a controversial topic for over 30 years with no concrete answers being discovered. Elizabeth Harter (1999) argued that the relationship between school expenditures and student achievement depends on how money is spent. She tested the relationship of money and achievement by using data from elementary schools in Texas and by holding constant student academic potential, student socioeconomic background, and school characteristics. Her results indicated that only certain types of expenditure play an important part in explaining student achievement. Even though Hanushek’s early work found no positive relationship between money and achievement, he did conclude (1996) that it mattered how the districts spent their funds. More recently, Lopez (2007) suggests that the traditional educational production function used in these empirical studies is not an appropriate design to understand the relationship between resources and achievement. Hence, the literature does not provide a definitive answer as to whether money matters. This paper uses the result of a state funding equalization plan in Dallas County, Texas to show that academic outputs did improve after implementing school finance reforms. Elementary school pass rates on the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS) improved as per pupil funding increased.",

Wilson,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Black economists around the country were contacted; the intent to raise issues of concerns with the AEA Executive Committee was explained and the economists were invited to attend the meeting of the Executive Committee in December, 1969. Those contacted spread the word to others. All told more than 20 black economists attended the meeting, which became a celebration of sorts, because so many friendships were renewed. Many black economists had “dropped out” because of the limited opportunities provided by the profession. One of these was Dunbar McLaurin, the first black to receive a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Illinois, in 1943. During the World War II years McLaurin was a successful businessman and was eager to move into black economic development. McLaurin gave visible meaning and seriousness to our gathering by leaving another formal dinner meeting, he arrived in style—formal evening dress. It was at this meeting that we came to know Bob Browne. He projected leadership abilities and a keen sense of organization and implementation; the group chose him to act as secretary of the Steering Committee and later Secretary and Chairman of the Caucus’ Policy Committee. As the paper in this volume by John Handy points out, an immediate consequence of the meeting was Bob Browne’s decision to begin a new journal, The Review of Black Political Economy. The Review was an unanticipated asset, a critical outlet for the work of economists—black and white—whose work was related to the condition of blacks in the United State and the Diaspora. The Review has been, for a quarter of a century, the official journal of the successor of the Caucus of Black Economists, the National Economic Association. The presence of W. Arthur Lewis at the meeting of the AEA Executive Committee, sitting with the black economists, contributed greatly to our credibility. Lewis had left a sick bed and came up from Princeton to be there.Footnote 4 The meeting was a contentious one; several members of the Executive Committee, a group of distinguished economists known for their “progressive” views were not prepared for the charges of exclusion they heard, it is no exaggeration to say they were in a state of shock. At one point Kenneth Boulding, a towering figure in progressive circles and former faculty member at Fisk University, stood up and declared “if you continue to push on an open door it will shut on you”. Boulding’s remark did not deter the black economists who had come well prepared to state their case. By the end of the meeting several key members of the Executive Committee stood in support of the black economists. Among them were James Tobin of Yale and Kenneth Arrow of Stanford, both of whom would later become AEA presidents and Noble Laureates; they urged the AEA to work with the black economists to ameliorate the concerns raised at the meeting. One of the first positive steps taken by the AEA was the creation of a committee on the Supply of Black Economists, to deal with the “pipeline” problem. Andrew Brimmer was the first chair of the committee. It conceived the idea of a program to prepare and encourage blacks to enter the economics profession. When Alexis succeeded Brimmer as chair in 1971 he initiated, with the support of the Ford Foundation and an appropriation by the AEA, The Summer Program in Economics for Minorities, a program which continues to operate and which scores of young black and Latino economists have attended.Footnote 5
 The Caucus realized that for participation at the annual meeting to be sustainable not only the supply side had to be tended to but the research output of black economists had to be augmented. Many of the black economists taught at historically black colleges and universities where heavy teaching loads made research difficult, if not impossible. It was also recognized that the research skills of black economists needed augmentation. To accomplish this, the Caucus leveraged its in-kind overhead and administrative ties with UCLA and secured funding from the Ford Foundation for the Black Economic Development Project.Footnote 6 The purpose of the Project was to support summer research, workshops and travel that contributed the development of blacks in the economics profession. C.Z. Wilson directed the project from 1970–1972. Thaddeus Spratlen succeeded him, directing the project from 1972 until its end in 1974. The first workshop of the Project was at the ASSA meetings in Detroit in December, 1970. The workshop was a showcase for the discussion of topics for which black economists had been longing. Bob Browne chaired a Symposium on Economic Institutions and the Black Community: Richard America, James Hefner, Karl Gregory and Sid Evans were panelists. The international dimension was covered in a paper by Rawle Farley, “Poverty and Enterprise in America and Overseas”. In sessions chaired by Alexis and Wilson papers on, “The Political Economy of American Racism: Nonblack Decision Making and Black Economic Status;” “Problems of Economic Growth in the Black Community: Some Alternative Hypotheses;” “Ghetto Economic Development—Content and Character of the Literature;” and “Bonus Schemes and Racism,” were presented, these were published as Papers of the Caucus of Black Economists in the Summer, 1971 issue of The Review of Black Political Economy
Footnote 7 Undergraduate student papers were presented in a student symposium, Economics With or Without Color, chaired by Thad Spratlen. Undergraduate participation was a major focus of the Caucus from its inception; they were the future supply of black economists. In addition to the Summer Program and the Black Economic Development Project, Wilson, as a member of President Richard Nixon’s Advisory Council for Minority Business persuaded John Jenkins, Director of the Office of Minority Business Enterprises (OMBE), to contract with the Caucus to support research clusters at three black institutions: Virginia State University, Southern University, Atlanta University and at UCLA and the University of Washington. The Caucus used members from university and research organizations to evaluate and develop research directions for community development corporations. These efforts were consistent with Caucus goals of expanding opportunities for black economists at every level. The Caucus was an integral part of a larger movement involving civil rights, and university outreach to ameliorate inner city problems and create visible positions within the economics profession for blacks at all levels. An opportunity to have an influence at the graduate level developed when the Caucus was approached by Howard University in 1972 to consult on its pending Ph.D. in Economics. Howard economics had been the home department of two of the most prominent black economists of the twentieth century—Abram Lincoln Harris and Eric Williams. A group from the Caucus which included Bob Browne, Karl Gregory, Donald Harris, Duran Bell, Marcus Alexis, C.Z. Wilson and Thaddeus Spratlen served as the Caucus-Howard Advisory Council. The purpose of the Council was to assist Howard in the development of a Ph.D. program in economics and to assist in recruiting faculty to implement the Ph.D. curriculum. The invitation to the Caucus had come from Andrew Billingsley, Howard’s Vice President for Academic Affairs. But internal politics at Howard and the slow pace of progress ended the formal cooperation in 1973, individual Caucus members continued to work with Howard University. In 1974 The Ford Foundation asked Marcus Alexis and C.Z. Wilson to evaluate Bob Browne’s institution, the Black Economic Research Center (BERC) and The Review of Black Political Economy and to recommend a future for both. Both were reviewed positively in terms of their impact, but it was obvious that they could not survive on their own. In the late 1970s the idea was floated to permanently locate the Black Economic Research Center (BERC) at Howard. A satisfactory arrangement could not be made and BERC ultimately remained a stand-alone center in New York. In the end The Review of Black Political Economy became the official organ of the Caucus of Black Economists, a lasting tribute to the legacy of Bob Browne as a pioneering black economist, a visionary and intellectual entrepreneur.",5

Field order 15 set aside thousands of acres of land for ex-slaves divided into 40 acre plots, along with an army mule. Field order 15 was in response to the ex-slaves desire to achieve true freedom and economic sustainability and their insistence that land was a key to accomplishing these goals. Unfortunately, that covenant was broken by the government that refused to recognize Blacks as citizens and valued them only as laborers and consumers; yet neither the broken covenant, a hostile government, nor the KKK could sway freed slaves from their quest to own land. That land base not only provided its owners and their families with some degree of economic independence, it also had a social and political impact that extended throughout the civil rights movement and beyond. Black Landowners were the ones most likely to vote, run for office, become community organizers and leaders of the movement in the black belt rural South. Landownership by Blacks has historically served as a psychological and transformative mechanism, conveying pride and power, a role it continues to play today. For blacks, as for others, land ownership has been a cultural glue providing a sense of place, self, family and community. The significance of land and its role in the evolution of black America cannot be over emphasized. Robert Browne recognized the significance of black land ownership; if he were alive today he would be leading the charge to preserve black ownership.",1

Handy,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The nascent period of the Black Economic Research Center (BERC) and its principle publishing organ, The Review of Black Political Economy can be clearly demarcated as the years 1969–1972. This period came on the heels of the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Robert Kennedy, and El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz. Among many of the black intelligentsia, this period continued the long standing controversy between integrationist, civil rights strategies and programs promoting Black Nationalism. Also during the late 1960s and 1970s, there was tension stemming from the collapse of meaningful school integration and busing across every urban area in the country. In Brooklyn and in Harlem, where BERC was located, there had been a nationally publicized series of intense confrontations between black community activists and the American Federation of Teachers over community control of schools. Institutions and conventional practices were being challenged by black and white social activists and self-styled revolutionaries almost on a daily basis. Challenges to traditional forms of music, art, literature and literary criticism seemed to be the norm and not the exception. And if such a thing were possible, these issues began to recede as the forefront issues of the time with the all-pervading impact of the war in Vietnam. This was the era in which the Black Economic Research Center and The Review of Black Political Economy were conceived and launched.Footnote 1
 Robert Browne served for 6 years in Southeast Asia, but it was most notably during 1958–1961 while serving as trade advisor and Foreign Service officer in Cambodia and Vietnam that, I believe, Robert Browne’s public foray into black activism and radical economic thought began to crystallize (see Browne 1996, pp. 52–53) While he knew and worked with many of the leading white leftist intellectuals and progressive religious groups of the time, his overall deep distrust of war-time government policy and white America’s inability to fairly treat and work in the interests of people of color, both in Asia and America, led him to advocate reparations and, for a short time, some of the programs associated with the black separatist movement. Bob would frequently make the connection: Whether entitled reparations or disguised by another name, resources on a scale paralleling those dispersed in Viet Nam will have to be transferred to the black community if we expect to correct existing inequities. A significant sum will be required merely to counter the enormous raids on the public treasury being perpetrated by white America’s establishment in its own behalf. I refer here to oil depletion allowances, agriculture subsidies, public utility privileges, cost overruns and other financial shenanigans conspired in by big government and its favored defense contractors, political supporters, etc.—to say nothing of rectifying our exclusion from the 19th century welfare programs like the Homestead Act and the celebrated give aways to the railroads and other establishment institutions of white America. (Browne 1970a) His disturbing firsthand observations of the persecution of Buddhists monks and the heavy-handed, misguided policy that the USA was pursuing in that region riveted his deep concerns on the need to both help establish an anti-war movement and address the social and economic inequities facing black Americans. On returning to the USA in 1961, he emerged as one of the first major intellectuals to meet and warn various American groups about the dangerous path the USA was taking toward war in Vietnam. In 1967, during a fact-finding tour in Vietnam, the Buddhist community appealed to Bob Browne to enlist the support of Martin Luther King to take a stand against the Vietnam War. In that same year, Dr. King expressed his opposition to the war and delivered a powerful analysis of the link between the civil rights movement and the peace movement. A reading of Robert Browne’s personal correspondence with leading religious and peace groups during this period confirms the prominence that Robert Browne held in the establishment of the peace movement in the USA.Footnote 2
 Most disturbing to Bob was the disproportionate deployment of African Americans drafted to fight other people of color in Southeast Asia. His continued interest in Vietnam was underscored by the fact that he was one of the first Americans asked to visit Ho Chi Minh City in 1978, just 3 years after the US withdrawal in 1975. To a large measure, this issue helped shape much of his later positions and writings. Though Bob would often refer to the emergence of the new black activism and the black student movement as a motivating force, I feel, nonetheless, that it was primarily from the perspective of the peace movement, and his troubling Asian experience, that Robert Browne began earnestly advocating black economic development through compensatory justice and wealth generation via sustained black institution building: The two decades of the 1960s and 1970s constituted a period of domestically-based activity for me, but my work during that period was greatly enriched by the years I had spent abroad. There can be no doubt that the particular focus which I brought to the issue of black economic development was strongly influenced by my experience in working closely with the government of Cambodia....Footnote 3
 While working with Bob Browne during the first days of Black Economic Research Center, it was clear to me that the primary, original impetus to establish BERC came out of these complex events and controversial dynamics.",3

Anderson,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Full employment policy was a major interest of Congressman Augustus Hawkins, Democrat, 13th Congressional District of California. In the early 1970s Mr Hawkins was a senior member of the House Education and Labor Committee (HELC). He began his political career in Los Angeles during the 1930s and served in the California General Assembly for a quarter century before being elected to the US Congress. Mr. Hawkins’ views on economic affairs were greatly influenced by the economic policies adopted by the Roosevelt New Deal administration. The guiding principle of that era was that the federal government had an obligation to intervene in the market to promote and protect the public interest when the private sector demonstrated the inability or unwillingness to do so. In response to the high unemployment generated by the Great Depression, the federal government introduced a series of job creation initiatives, including the Works Progress Administration(WPA), Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), and the National Youth Administration(NYA) in which the government acted as the employer of last resort. The principle that government had an obligation to intervene in the labor market to influence favorable economic outcomes also was reflected in the National Labor Relations Act, which protected the right of workers to organize and join unions of their choosing, and to participate in collective bargaining to set the terms of wages and working conditions. Federal government intervention in the market also was demonstrated in New Deal policies on agriculture, trade, banking, and labor standards. Congressman Hawkins was dissatisfied with the failure of the economy to achieve full employment during the 1950s and 1960s, a period when unemployment hovered above 6.0%. He concluded that the Employment Act of 1946, was inadequate to address the problem. The Employment Act of 1946 declared that the federal government had the responsibility to “use all practicable means—to create and maintain conditions under which there will be useful employment for those able, willing, and seeking work, and to promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power” (House, Senate Conference Report 1945) To Mr. Hawkins, the term “maximum employment” was not the same as full employment. In his view, the failure to clearly state the policy goal as “full employment” allowed the government to tolerate unemployment rates well above any reasonable measure of full employment for extended periods of time. He believed a policy that would commit the nation to achieve full employment was necessary to drive down unemployment and keep it at a low level.",4

Development from an African Perspective: Early Success and Challenges at the Africa Development Bank,September 2008,Robert S. Browne,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The ADB is one of several regional development banks, patterned loosely after the global model of the World Bank. The ADB was the third such regional institution to appear, following the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the Asian Development Bank. To understand the history of the ADB it is useful to take a moment to describe the model towards which it aspired. The World Bank is an international financial institution whose membership includes most of the countries of the world. In the highly simplified description which follows, we can view the Bank’s membership as falling into two categories: borrowing countries and non-borrowers, sometimes referred to as donors. The Bank raises its capital from the sale of its shares to its members, not on an on-going basis but at periodic ‘capital replenishments’ agreed to by the member governments of the donor countries. These shares are purchased almost entirely by the developed countries, and are in fact more accurately described as being ‘subscribed’ than being purchased. That is because the subscribing countries actually pay in cash for only a token portion of their subscription (say 10%), providing a sovereign IOU for the balance. These IOUs then serve as collateral to enable the Bank to go into the capital market and borrow the money it needs. Obviously, with such strong collateral, the Bank can borrow at very attractive rates of interest. Another pertinent feature of the Bank is that it is split into two entities, the Bank, properly speaking, which makes market rate loans to borrowing countries, and its sister institution, the International Development Association (IDA), which extends loans at a near-zero interest rate to the poorer borrowers as well as makes loans for the more socially oriented type projects such as in education and health, where returns are not directly quantifiable. IDA’s capital fund is independent of the Bank’s capital and consists of a pool of money replenished through periodic fund raising campaigns among the non-borrowing countries. The bulk of the African countries acquired their independence at the beginning of the sixties, and in 1964 they agreed to organize a development bank for the Continent. Unlike the IADB, which had been created at the instigation of the United States of America (USA), and the Asian Development Bank, which was more or less sponsored by Japan, the ADB had no wealthy sponsor. In fact, given the still lingering bitter colonial taste in African mouths following independence, there appears to have been little disposition among the Africans even to consider accepting extra-African assistance in the creation of this institution. Early on, however, it became evident that the ADB, as then structured, would be highly limited in what it could hope to achieve, because it was essentially a vehicle which shifted scarce resources from poor countries to even poorer ones—a case of the poor lending to the even poorer. A few of the member countries were apparently untiring in pointing this out to their colleagues and eventually a compromise was reached whereby non-regional countries were invited to join with the ADB to create a sister institution, a soft-loan window, to be called the African Development Fund (ADF), modeled after IDA. Like IDA, the ADF would not have any staff of its own but would simply piggy-back on the Bank’s staff and facilities, for a mutually negotiated fee. The ADF would have its own board, consisting of 12 members, half chosen from the new non-regional members and the other half from among the board members of the Bank. The ADF was inaugurated in 1974, during the Nixon administration. For whatever reason, the USA did not join the ADF at its inception, but five years later President Carter sought and received Congressional approval for the USA to join and shortly thereafter I was recruited to go to Abidjan, in 1980, as the first US Executive Director. The term Executive Director really means ‘member of the board of directors’. It is a working board which serves on site and is on constant call. By the time I joined the ADF board there were already rumblings of dissatisfaction with the outcome of the compromise which had been made over non-regional membership. Not surprisingly, the ADF’s resources had very quickly outstripped those of the ADB, and while the ADF was clearly the subordinate institution, having absolutely no voice in the administration or the policies of the Bank, with its role limited solely to participation in the decisions regarding the loans being sought from ADF funds, the growing disproportion between the amount of capital flowing into the two institutions was becoming a source of ever greater sensitivity. The ADF was extending far more loans than the ADB could hope to do and the tail was clearly wagging the dog, to the latter’s embarrassment. The principal opposition to the proposals to open the Bank to non-regional members came from three influential countries—Libya, Algeria, and Nigeria—not so coincidently, countries whose economies were notably stronger than most of their neighbors owing to their position as oil exporters. Finally, in 1982, Nigeria was prevailed upon to change its position and the ADB promptly opened its membership to all interested donor countries, although under certain restrictions designed to “preserve the African character of the Bank”. This last phrase had become the leit motif of this debate, for clearly the Africans feared, perhaps with reason, that allowing the rich countries to put their noses under the tent might well lead to their loss of effective control of their institution. I left the ADF shortly before the non-regional countries actually began to take up their newly expanded participation in the Abidjan-based institution, so I have no experience to recount of life as an actual director of the Bank itself. I will be eager to hear what Willene’s experience has been, although I am acutely aware that the position she holds severely restricts her freedom to discuss what her private observations and experiences at the Bank may be. In terms of preserving the African character of the Bank, I recall that, when the terms of the non-regional membership were being discussed back in 1982, a formula was devised to insure that the non-regional member’s vote could never overpower that of the regional members. I do not know if this objective has proved in practice to be a workable one, given the vast disparity in resources at the disposal of the two groups. I have had Africans to express to me some resentment at the excessive influence which the non-regional countries now play in the Bank’s policies and operations, but I have no particular information on this subject. I would, however, expect to find a wide dispersion of opinion on such an issue, because the Africans are themselves quite divided as to where they direct their criticism regarding virtually all of Africa’s encounters with the external world. Some will hold Africans as principally responsible for the Continent’s dreary global predicament, whereas others are more inclined to place the blame on the tragic colonial legacy and on the post colonial intrigues and cold war manipulations saddled on Africa by the major powers. Because the USA was so eager to see the Bank opened to non-regional membership, my principal instructions upon being despatched to Abidjan had been to refrain from being obnoxious, which was a superfluous instruction in my case, as will, of course, be attested by all who know me. As the non-regional members had no role to play in overseeing the Bank’s budget, its administration or even its policies except as related to the ADF loans, it was quite easy for me to remain aloof from matters which might be tinged with controversy. My first line of contact was with the ADF’s African Executive Directors, for I had to interact with them in regards to the loans being sought from the Fund. These individuals were persons who seemed to have been awarded this rather plum posting as a reward for some past political service in their home country. They displayed no special training for, nor great intellectual interest in the details of their work. I then gradually found myself interacting more frequently with the technicians who were involved with preparing the loan requests and who were generally either country specialists or sector specialists. They were all Africans because, at that time, the Bank did not recruit non-African staff. Most of them were young and seemed adequately qualified for their work in the technical sense, although few of them could yet boast the years of experience carried by many World Bank, AID and other non-African development workers. On the other hand, there is some merit in the ADB’s argument that African communities are more accessible by African staff than by expatriates and inasmuch as the design of successful projects often depends as much on an understanding of local community particularities, rivalries, and other intangibles, as on technical considerations, the ADB was better positioned than the World Bank to address issues of African development. The terms of the opening of the Bank to non-African membership obliged the Bank to begin hiring non-African staff. During my tenure there had been perhaps a dozen non-Africans working on contract for the Bank, out of a staff of perhaps some 600 persons. Officially, the Bank operated on a bilingual basis although French may have had a slight edge, or at least so it seemed to me. This would not be surprising inasmuch as the Bank is located in a French speaking country. Administrative staff was more likely to be bilingual than was technical staff, but a substantial number of the technicians, if not fully bilingual, could generally understand the other language even if they were not comfortable speaking it. In summary, when I finished my tour I felt the Bank to be in competent hands, although I was not really privy to its inner workings. Its funding was adequate at the time, although the ADF, which required more frequent replenishment, was subjected to serious squeezing by the Reagan administration, which displayed little interest in Africa. The ADB was having no difficulty borrowing money in the private capital markets at moderate rates of interest, although this is less an indicator of the skill of the Bank’s internal management and solvency than it is of the market’s perception of the soundness of the donor country IOUs which collateralize the Bank’s borrowings. The only ominous, unarticulated, potential problem which may have clouded the Bank’s excellent profile was how it would handle a member who might, for one reason or another, become seriously delinquent in servicing its loans. There were no delinquent borrowers during my period, nor had there been. That is no longer the case, but of course the other international financial institutions, such as the World Bank and the IMF as well as bilateral lenders, are acquiring plenty of in-depth experience with the thorny issue of international debt so it is not a problem particularly targeted toward the African institution.",

This push to increase minority participation in the economics profession is in part a response to the relatively small percentage of minorities receiving their advanced degrees in this discipline compared to social science as a whole.Footnote 1 Analysis presented by the previous NEA president, however, shows an even smaller share of minorities who are employed in economics departments at academic institutions compared to the share of minority students receiving their Ph.D. in economics.Footnote 2 This current presentation continues the examination of the employment of ethnic minorities in the economics profession by examining the demand side of this issue.

Weller,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Household debt can be, if used correctly, the grease for economic mobility. By borrowing, many more families can afford to buy a home, car, or a college education than would otherwise be the case. And debt allows families to smooth out income fluctuations due to short-term spells of unemployment, a medical emergency, among others. Traditionally, not all families had the same access to credit. The chance of getting a loan and the costs of debt often varied by demographic characteristics. Minorities and low-income families in particular had fewer chances of getting a loan and paid higher costs for debt than their counterparts. These differences have often been the result of credit market discrimination. Specifically, lenders may have denied loans to some borrowers solely on the base of race, ethnicity and other personal traits, or they may have steered these borrowers towards higher-cost loan products than were available for other borrowers. Differences in credit access and costs of credit were expected to decline over time as US financial markets became more deregulated, starting in the late 1970s, but taking shape especially in the 1990s. In particular, market deregulation was meant to result in more competition and ultimately less financial market discrimination. Prior research has shown some decline in the financial market discrimination. From the late 1980s to the early 1990s, differences in the chance of getting a loan approved seemed to decrease. More recent research, though, found that differences in loan denial rates and the costs of credit persisted over time, although it is unclear if this persistence was due to taste-based financial market discrimination. Moreover, much of the research ignored the possibility of structural discrimination in financial market decisions. This paper considers recent household level data on consumer debt to determine if credit market discrimination has declined, disappeared or persisted as financial markets have become more deregulated in the U.S. In particular, this paper analyzes the evidence on the chance of financial constraints as well as on the cost of credit for the period from 1989 to 2004. Consequently, this paper builds on the previous research in a number of important aspects. First, the empirical analysis extends beyond the late 1990s to test the impact of the latest round of financial deregulation on discrimination. Second, the research considers the evidence pertaining to taste-based and structural discrimination in credit markets. Third, this research includes the costs of credit and not just loan denials. In the analysis of potential cost differences, the research pays particular attention to the role sources and types of loans can play for the cost of credit. Fourth, the data analysis compares the experience of Latinos and African–Americans with each other to see if their gaps with whites and with each other have changed in any meaningful way over time.",14

Ward,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"Since the 1960s, African Americans have made substantial progress in their overall participation in the politics of the United States. The percent of African Americans who registered to vote and who have voted in national, state, and local elections, increased steadily and significantly. Since the 1960s, African Americans have also increased their total numbers and proportions of those who run for political office, from local school boards to the United States Congress and the Presidency, with the most significant gain in recent history being the election of an African-American Barack Obama as the 44th president of the United States. In addition, African Americans have increased their participation in political organizations and have found ways to influence the U.S. and international media so that issues important to the Black community are highlighted. Existing scholarship has documented that during the past three decades, the general public in the United States has also shown a continuous acceptance of the increased role of African Americans in the country’s politics, and many non-Black Americans go on to vote for, or financially support, African American candidates (Swain 1995; Clemons and Jones 1997; Clayton 1998; Bositis 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2009; Franklin 2000; Katz 2000; Mastin 2000; Gay 2001; Davis and Brown 2002; Kim 2003; Amer 2004; Green 2004; Orey et al. 2007). African American leaders are also using their rising influence in American politics to advocate on important issues on behalf of Blacks in the U.S., as well as people of African descent across the world (Robinson 1999; Adekeye 2004; Kaba 2004; Tillery 2006). Data on the increasing efficacy of African Americans in the American political system reveal significant gender patterns that are emerging, and there has been very little scholarship that has examined the political success of African American women relative to their male counterparts. Statistics on African Americans’ participation in U.S. politics show that Black women tend to be increasingly more active participants than their male counterparts. In fact, some scholars have examined what is claimed to be the overrepresentation of Black female legislators in Congress. (Bedolla et al. 2005) The most telling statistic is that, while there has been no substantial increase in overall African-American political participation since the late 1960s, the percentage of female African American participation has increased. This trend is occurring across various aspects of political participation. African American women are registering and voting more than their male counterparts in local, Congressional, and presidential elections, and in recent years, they have been more successful than their male counterparts in their quest for elected office. According to Bedolla, Tate, and Wong, “despite the dismal prospects for women and Black candidates, and given the large advantage accorded to incumbents and the negative effect of racially biased voting patterns, minority women candidates may still have special advantages over their white female and minority male counterparts” (Bedolla et al. 2005, 167). The difference in the political participation rates between Black women and Black men has led to the two central questions of this paper: First, what are explanations for the increasing difference in political participation between Black men and Black women? Second, are African American women becoming positioned to take over significant political leadership in the United States? This paper will examine some of the factors that have contributed to the widening gap in political participation between Black women and Black men, and will consider this trend relative to larger trends in gender and voting. The paper will focus on the gradual shift in political and leadership representation from Black men to Black women by taking a closer look at the rates of participation of African Americans in U.S. politics within the past four decades.

36.0,1.0,The Review of Black Political Economy,05 March 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12114-009-9037-3,Be All That You Can Be?: Racial Identity Production in the U.S. Military,March 2009,James B. Stewart,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This analysis applies concepts from Stratification Economics to examine racial identity production in the U.S. military. Stratification Economics is an emergent economics subfield that uses the concept of social stratification as a point of departure for examining structural and intentional processes that concurrently generate hierarchy and economic inequality among ascriptively distinguished groups (Darity 2005, Stewart 2008). Stratification economists argue, for example, that inter-group conflict in both economic and non-economic settings is an endogenous characteristic of the social space rather than an exogenous contaminant of market allocation processes and individual decision-making. This investigation employs the model of racial identity production developed by Stewart (1976, 1997). Racial identity is treated as a Becker-type commodity produced by combining market goods and services, and time, using a technology based on pre-existing cultural knowledge. Racial identity is generated jointly with other commodities and has the potential to impose negative externalities on other groups. One implication of this model is that individuals with similar identity production functions have an incentive to engage in collective behavior to reduce negative externalities generated by others’ identity production on own production. Efforts by members of one group to offset the effects of others’ negative identity production externalities create potential for intergroup conflict. The magnitude of such negative externalities is hypothesized to vary across a vector of factors including: the degree of overlap in groups’ composite racial, sexual, religious, and class profiles; the relative weights assigned to racial identity in individuals’ utility functions; the degree of physical proximity and frequency and duration of contacts between members of groups with different identity production functions; and differences in stocks of political and economic resources available to affect identity production possibilities. Relationships between racial identity production and wealth accumulation outcomes have been explored by Darity et al. (2006). These authors conclude that (a) reductions in inter-group income and wealth differentials will not automatically lead to the erosion of traditional patterns of collective identification, and (b) incentives for engaging in cooperative inter-group behavior can reduce the potentially negative dimensions of inter-racial contact and create alternatives to traditional racial identification. The focus of the present investigation on racial identity production dynamics in the U.S. military is potentially instructive for several reasons. First, standardized pay scales, evaluation, and promotion criteria reduce the effects of some traditional pecuniary sources of racial identity production animus operative in the civilian sector. As a consequence, comparison of perceptions of the intensity of racial identity production in the military and in the civilian sector can provide useful insights regarding the relative role of income and wealth differentials compared to other dimensions of racial identity production interactions in generating inter-racial conflict. Second, the U.S. military aggressively attempts to reduce potential negative effects of racial identity production on its mission by fostering an alternative focus of identification. The former Army slogan, “Be All That You Can Be,” and the current one, “An Army of One,” signal this strategy. Both slogans emphasize individual opportunity, but are closely linked to a socialization strategy that emphasizes preparedness, team cohesion, and responsiveness. The effectiveness of a demographically diverse military force depends critically upon the ability of members to trust one another and respect the chain of command. The successful integration of the military, Moskos (1971, pp. 284–5) contends, “was facilitated by the pervasiveness in the military of a bureaucratic ethos, with its concomitant formality and high social distance, that mitigated tensions arising from individual or personal feelings.” The military’s current policy vis a vis equal opportunity is codified in the Department of Defense (DoD) Human Goals, which state, in part, that the DoD aspires, “To make military and civilian service in the Department of Defense a model of equal opportunity for all . . .” and “To create an environment that values diversity and fosters mutual respect and cooperation among all persons . . .” (Department of Defense 1998). Dansby and Landis (1996) have identified five key elements in the military’s approach to the management of equal opportunity (EO) and diversity issues:
 a focus on behavioral change and compliance with stated policy; an emphasis on EO and intercultural understanding as military readiness issues; an understanding that equal opportunity is a commander's responsibility and that the trained equal opportunity advisors can advise and assist the commander in carrying out this responsibility; a belief that education and training can bring about the desired behavioral changes; and reliance on affirmative action plans as a method for ensuring equity and diversity. (pp. 206–207) A third reason for examining racial identity production in the military is the possibility that some findings may yield useful insights for understanding some aspects of civilian workplace dynamics. Moskos (1988; p. 15) argues that “the armed forces of the United States has moved away from an organizational format that is predominantly institutional to one that is more occupational.” As a result of this transformation “in recent decades, the members of the armed forces have felt increasing conflict between internal pressures toward institutional integration and societal trends that push toward identification with like occupational groups in the larger society” (Moskos and Wood 1988; p. 4). In this regard it is useful to note that all military departments (branches) use a system of classifying jobs and categorizing career fields. The Army and Marines assign a Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) code to each member, the Air Force uses Air Force Specialty Codes, and the Navy employs a naval ratings system and Navy Enlisted Classifications. In all services demographic distributions across occupational classifications are monitored to identify systemic patterns of racial and gender over- and under-representation. Despite intensive efforts to manage racial (and gender) diversity, the military continues to face a variety of diversity management challenges. As an example, increasing numbers of gang members are entering the military, many with previous involvement in inter-gang racial conflict. Efforts by gang members to continue these confrontations while in the military require focused interventions (Robson 2006). Confronted by a significant decline in the enlistment of Blacks, one of the Army’s responses has been expanded efforts to attract Latino recruits (Alvarez 2006). The second section reviews selected theoretical and empirical psychological research that informs the present investigation and summarizes historical and contemporary efforts to manage race relations in the military. The models and data are described in the third section.

Butts,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This paper is an enquiry about the relative role of economic growth in the size of short-term external debt (STED)—debt with less than one year maturity. Economic growth is seen as the outcrop of monetary and fiscal policies, stronger institutions, and financial development aimed at facilitating stable economic growth that is aligned to continuous increase in absorptive capacity. Against this backdrop, I am interested in whether or not economic growth performance can help to explain growth in STED. To know this is important since the less developed countries (LDCs) have been and are exposed to terms of international trade financing of which STED formed an increasingly greater proportion of the debt portfolio over the recent decades (Dadush et al. 2000). I interpreted the increase as responses to policy issues that are related to the complex nature of absorptive capacity in LDCs. For my initial consideration, capacity absorption is the ability of an economy 
to generate the resources essential to meet increase (decrease) demand for consumption goods which occurs autonomously with increase (decrease) in economic growth. In short: does growth in STED reflect the nature of economic growth in the economies of LDCs? The importance of STED to LDCs is measured by its intertwining into their budgetary considerations. The inclusion helps policy makers to balance the budget and while government uses it as device to balance budget risk neutral agents benefit (Jeanne 2000, 2004). Interestingly, STED provides incentives to borrowers (governments) because of the moral hazard presented by the international financial institutions in their role as lenders of last resort (Jeanne 2004). The Bank for International Settlement (BIS 2000 Report) considers STED as “perhaps the most important and sometimes more volatile component of developing countries’ external obligations”. For example STED—bank loans, short-term securities, and trade creditFootnote 1—represented 60% of outstanding international bank claims as well as 50% of all new loans in the 1990s (Dadush et al. 2000). In fact international trade policies were shaped by the short-term lending to finance projects that were to come on stream beyond the maturity date of the loans (Chang and Velasco 1999) and to determine priority of access to foreign exchange in time of crises for less credit worthy borrowers (INTGDF 2002). Failure to account for the presence of STED omits the role of short-term forces (consumer, producer, financial institutions, government, and international institutions) in empirical modeling of international trade and development. It is well documented that economic growth performance is seen as a road map used to determine the direction and composition of international trade financingFootnote 2 (Todaro 1996). Several authors observed a negative correlation between economic growth and increasing foreign debt including Cunningham (1993), Easterly (2001), Oks and Van Wijnbergen (1995) and Sachs (1989). On the contrary, Dadush et al. (2000) observed that increased economic growth preceded growth of STED in emerging markets—Brazil, Mexico, Thailand, and Russia. INTGDF (2000) reported that cyclical rapid growth in the 1990s contributed to rapid growth in short-term financing. Gooptu et al. (1992) found that countries with greater growth prospects attracted more short-term credit. On the other hand, slow growth dampened 
inflows of private investment and increased short-term debt (UNCTAD 2002) because debt payment suppressed the demand for goods which in turn suppressed the demand for LDCs goods and hence dampened its growth (Cohen 1993). Do these mean that economic growth (size)—a contemporaneous presence, and shocks (deviations from long-run equilibrium growth path) cause STED to grow? Do changes in GDP cause changes in the accumulation of STED or are both determined endogenously? Though the STED phenomenon has been identified as very important, it has been neglected largely in the literature of the debt-growth nexus. The STED-GDP causality study is motivated by the fact that STED has been a prominent element of the portfolio of LDCs (Dadush et al. 2000) as well as featured as the cause of financial failure in large emerging markets (Rodrik and Velasco 1999
). The literature is lacking in empirical work on possible causality between the STED and GDP. Except for Amoateng and Amoako-Adu (1996) who found bidirectional causality between economic growth, export, and debt servicing, I am not aware of any theory about the interaction of STED and economic growth. Similarly, I am unacquainted with any major empirical studies establishing a relationship between economic growth and STED, except Butts (2006), Eichengreen and Mody (1999), and Rodrik and Velasco (1999). Butts (2006) found a positive relationship between STED and economic growth in the case of Guyana. Eichengreen and Mody (1999) argued that economic growth and high STED can co-exist once the perception of creditors about sustainability does not 
shift. Rodrik and Velasco (1999) pointed out that STED could increase investment and growth indirectly, and increase with openness of the economy; while Gooptu et al. (1992) suggested that the volume of short-term lending is affected by specific country factors. Against this backdrop, the purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between economic growth and STED in 27 selected Latin American and Caribbean countries over the period 1970–2003. With increasing economic growth in 2003 Latin America, in especially Argentina which had experienced negative growth of nearly 18.6% since 1998 (UNCTAD 2004) and the Caribbean, I postulate that economic growth Granger-caused growth in STED in several countries in Latin America and Caribbean. The empirical investigation to test the propositions of Granger-causality was done using both the Granger (1969), and Engle-Granger (1987) single equation VAR and the Johansen and Juselius (1990) maximum likelihood estimation approaches. This simple study of GDP and STED is used for comparison across countries where differences in size and 
composition of macroeconomic policy, make impact on environmental shocks which are singular to each country selected from Latin America and the Caribbean. The rest of the paper is as follows. In section two model specification, data, and methodology are considered. Section three gives estimation and results. Section four gives the conclusions.",5

Stockly,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"In the first model, the dependent variable GDGRADE (good grade) is constructed by assigning each observation a one for a grade of B or better and zero otherwise. For GENDER, female is set equal to one and male equal to zero. At first, dummy variables were created for the racial groups ASIAN, FOREIGN, BLACK, and LATINO, designating Asian American, African American, Hispanic, and International students respectively. Hypotheses were tested for BLACK equal to LATINO and ASIAN equal to FOREIGN. There was no significant difference between African American and Hispanic students, and these groups were combined to form the MINORITY variable. A corresponding variable for non-minority students could not be used because there were significant differences between observations in ASIAN and FOREIGN categories. White students are the base in each set of regressions. The complete set of variables used in the model is listed in Table 3. Although cumulative GPA in the semester prior to taking the courses would be the recommended proxy for academic maturity (Grove et al. 2006), it was not possible to obtain these data. High school rank and SAT scores were available and are also commonly used to indicate academic aptitude. In addition, the variable UTSTART indicates the number of semesters each student had completed at UT prior to the semester studied. It would be expected that the more experienced students would also tend to be more successful and have higher grades on average.
 Some observations had missing values for SAT scores, high school rank, and high school size. Transfer students to UT are not required to submit SAT results, though many do. Some transfer students, as well as those who completed their secondary education outside of the United States, do not have high school rank or size in their records. It was not possible to determine from the data set whether students had missing background information because they were transfer students or because they had completed high school abroad. One important variable serves as a measure of relative high school quality. Public schools in Texas at the time were evaluated by the Texas Education Agency (TEA), which required administration of the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS) to all sophomores in high school. The percentage of students in each high school, not in special education, who passed this exam was published by the TEA and used to evaluate high schools. These percentage passing rates were matched to the high school attended by each student to generate the TAAS variable. Again, some observations had missing values since TAAS scores are available only for students who attended public high schools in Texas. A modified zero-order regression method is used in order to utilize the remaining information available from those observations with missing values (Maddala 1977, pp. 201–203). An imputed value of zero was given to each missing value and dummy variables created where a one was assigned whenever the values in SATV, SATQ, HSSIZE, HSRANK or TAAS were equal to zero, and zero otherwise. Two variables for prior coursework are included in the data set, ECO and CALC. MACRO and MICRO did not have prerequisites at UT, at the time, and there was no recommended sequence. Most students, though, took MACRO before MICRO. The ECO variable is a dummy for successful completion of a previous course in economics, set equal to one if the student earned a grade of at least C in the course, taken prior to the targeted semester, and zero otherwise. Students who successfully completed of a previous introductory course would be expected to do well in the subsequent course both because they would have gained experience with the analytical skills required in economics and because they would more likely be good students. The dummy variable (CALC) indicates successful completion of a first-semester calculus course and was set equal to one if students earned a grade of C or better, zero otherwise. Calculus was required of business majors, but not a prerequisite for either MACRO or MICRO. It was assumed that students who successfully completed at least one course in calculus prior to taking the introductory economics course would have an advantage in understanding the quantitative and graphical components in this material. In this first model, it is hypothesized that the inclusion of a broad set of explanatory variables would eliminate race as a statistically significant factor in student performance. The expectation is that race per se does not determine a student’s success, but rather is a proxy for student characteristics that will either be controlled more explicitly in the model or are unobservable. Thus, variables for race and gender (ASIAN, FOREIGN, MINORITY and GENDER) should not yield statistically significant coefficients and grade differentials should be eliminated. The variable HSSIZE is the number graduating in the same high school class as the student; there is no prior expectation for the coefficient sign. It could be that students from smaller high schools may receive more individual attention and be more prepared academically. On the other hand, students matriculating from larger high schools may have access to more resources, such as honors programs with classes in calculus and other advanced topics. The variable CLSIZE is the class size for each unique section and, as in prior studies by Kennedy and Siegfried (1997), is not expected to be a statistically significant determinant of performance. An indicator variable, FALL, controls for the semester in which the student took the course, fall or spring as enrollment patterns may have varied between the two semesters. Enrollment time frames were longer in the fall and also included the surge of entering freshmen. Students enrolled in spring semesters might be more experienced in both the registration process and in deciding which classes to take. Grades might be slightly biased upwards during spring semesters. The average grade for each unique course section (MGRADE) was calculated and used to control for instructor and other effects particular to that section. This technique is used by Raimondo et al. (1990), and by Brasfield et al. (1992). The average grade is unique to each section and would be the equivalent of using indicator variables for each instructor and each section. Minority students and their non-minority counterparts come to the university with differing levels of academic maturity, measured or proxied by test scores and high school rank at graduation. Mean scores for these variables, as well as the mean course grades and the percent of female students in each category, are given in Table 4. The levels of statistical significance indicated were determined by difference of means tests comparing minority to non-minority scores. Average grades earned in both MACRO and MICRO as well as quantitative and verbal SAT scores are significantly lower for minority students then for non-minority students. Performance on the TAAS is significantly lower for MICRO only.
 Probit analysis results are list in Table 5. With few exceptions, the coefficient estimates for MACRO and MICRO are similar. In this model, gender is not a statistically significant factor in earning good grades in these classes. The sizes of the student’s high school graduating class (HSSIZE), as well as the number of prior semesters at Texas (UTSTART) are also not statistically significant.
 Success in both MACRO and MICRO is directly and significantly related to the students AGE, SAT scores, the student’s percentile rank at high school graduation rank (HSRANK) and relative high school quality, as measured by the TAAS variable. Probit estimates on UT and course-specific characteristics show mixed results. In both MACRO and MICRO the control for instructor effects (MGRADE) was statistically significant, but the unique section class size (CLSIZE) is only statistically significant for MICRO. Students do better in the larger the section of MICRO, even holding instructor effects constant. Taking MACRO in the fall versus the spring semester (FALL) gives a higher probability of success, but does not seem to affect performance in MICRO. Successful completion of at least one semester of calculus (CALC) is positive and statistically significant in both MACRO and MICRO. Course sequencing (ECO) is only statistically significant for MICRO. That is, grades improve when students take MACRO before MICRO, but not when MICRO is first. Of main interest are the coefficient estimates for race. In spite of the numerous explanatory variables, race is a statistically significant factor in determining student performance in MACRO and MICRO. Asian American students have higher probabilities of earning good grades than do White students in MACRO, but their performance in MICRO is not significantly different. Stronger results are found for International students, as the coefficient estimates are relatively larger and statistically significant for both MACRO and MICRO. These estimates most likely highlight substantial selection effects for International students, who may come from countries where acquisition of quantitative skills in secondary education is more rigorous than in this country, or may be members of elite groups in their countries: those with the highest motivation to excel academically as well as those with relatively advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. Minority students, on the other hand, have significantly lower probabilities of earning good grades in MACRO and MICRO than do any of the other students. Results were similar when interaction effects between the race variables and high school rank, TAAS, and SAT scores were tested. In summary, probit analysis indicates that minority students on average have a significantly lower probability of earning good grades in economics than non-minority students. The performance differential is due in part to the fact that minority students in the data set, on average, have a different set of academic background characteristics, such as lower SAT and TAAS scores. Some portion of the difference in grades earned however is not explained by the independent variables in the data.",3

The West Side Federation argued that CHA’s pattern of building most of their new public housing in the Black ghetto was systematic and illegal segregation and that HUD financed and endorsed CHA’s discriminatory behavior (Polikoff 2006; Rubinowitz and Rosenbaum 2000). Dorothy Gautreaux, a Black community activist, agreed to be the named plaintiff on the lawsuit which represented more than 40,000 Black families living in Chicago public housing or on the waiting list. Ten years later, the United States Supreme Court agreed that CHA and HUD discriminated against Blacks and ordered one of the largest desegregation programs in U.S. history, The Gautreaux Assisted Housing Program. The Gautreaux program represents an example of the U.S. government responding to African American citizens’ demands for public policy that would create dramatic shifts in their political and economic landscape and have the long-term goal of eradicating inequality. I argue that the 1966 Civil Rights Movement context of the Gautreaux lawsuit represents one of several major shifts in the U.S. political economy that dramatically altered the opportunity structure and life chances of African Americans: emancipation, Great Migrations, Civil Rights and Black Power Movements, and post-industrial job displacements. However, this interaction between social structures and individuals’ lives raises several important questions: How do racialized groups, African Americans in particular, perceive structures in the U.S. political economy that shape life course outcomes within and across generations? What are major events that appear in African American families narratives? How does their understanding of these events influence their decisions and outcomes associated with residential location and human capital (education and employment)? These questions are important because the ability of Gautreaux families to “rent out” their human capital in the market place continues to be affected by market failures in the broader political economy. In a report titled Residential Segregation and Housing Discrimination in the Untied States Michael de Leeuw et al. (2007:2) outline how the U.S. “has not satisfactorily complied with its obligations under CERD [Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination].” The authors discuss the historical role of government policies and practices in promoting racial discrimination and segregated housing and they identify current programs, practices, and policies that they feel continue to violate CERD equality obligations. For instance, public housing continues to be racially segregated and primarily located in areas of concentrated poverty, which affects women more than men. Unpacking the interaction between the political and economic structures in the lives of African American families and their responses to these structures is important for scholars interested in understanding the dialectics of constraints and opportunity and the role of policy in eradicating inequality. The goal of this study is to fill some of the knowledge gap by analyzing rich detailed narratives from a random subsample of Gautreaux participants (N = 25). This study examines how the Gautreaux participants perceive the economic and political structures in their lives and the lives of their parents (N = 50) and children (N = 72) and how these perceptions and experiences shape human capital outcomes (education and employment). An important feature of this study is that the parents of the Gautreaux participants have never been discussed in the literature on the Gautreaux program. The three generations of Gautreaux families have direct experiences with three out of the four major events that I argue dramatically shaped the lives of African Americans, which makes them uniquely interesting in an analysis of perceptions of, responses to, and outcomes associated with different periods of the U.S. political economy. In addition, the exogenous shock of the Gautreaux program and its associated moves to predominantly White or more integrated and affluent neighborhoods provides unusual insights into what happens when the government deploys resources to foster equal access (to housing in this case) for African American families. My findings show that the Gautreaux participants’ identified three major changes in political and economic structures as influencing the life course development of their families: the Great Migration(s), the Civil Rights Movement, and post-Civil Rights era (the 1976 Gautreaux program, affirmative action laws, the 1973 Comprehensive Employment and Training Act programs, etc.). Participants stated that while social structures may be racially discriminatory, they have a dialectical nature which appears as increased opportunities in the midst of persistent structural constraints. These dialectical perceptions determined their acts of resistance or agency (migration, Gautreaux move, school protests in suburbs, etc.). I argue that these acts of resistance were bundled across generations and influenced social mobility/quality of life in the form of educational and occupational accomplishments.",2

The episode paralleled the 1965 Watts riots. It seemed momentarily that if that one long historical cycle—urban violence, policy intervention, benign neglect, festering social inequalities—had been completed, another had begun. But history never performs the same drama twice. The 1965 riots were centered in Watts and bounded by a police/military blockade around a predominantly African American area known thenceforth as South Central Los Angeles.Footnote 1 The 1992 events also began in South Central, but soon stretched to Koreatown, Culver City, even trendy Melrose Avenue. And in 1992, many Latinos, having recently moved in large numbers to South Central, were involved. The targets of violence were often stores owned by Koreans, who had become the principal “middleman minority” operating stores in inner-core Los Angeles. It was widely noted that the 1992 uprising constituted the first multi-cultural riot in contemporary U.S. history.Footnote 2
 The 1992 civil unrest in Los Angeles helped launch a new round of federal policies, aimed at spurring asset-building and business activity in lower-income and non-white communities. This marked the first sustained federal urban-policy effort since the 1960s. Here too, differences between 1965 and 1992 policy responses are striking. This paper analyzes these post-1992 federal policies, notably the Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) program and the New Markets initiative, which aim at building assets and strengthening businesses in lower-income and non-white communities. This analysis first considers the role of finance in community development in general terms; then, it contrasts 1990s development-financing policies with those undertaken decades earlier in the context of the federal “War on Poverty.” We proceed as follows. “Conceptualizing banking/financial and asset-building practices: a framework” investigates the basic elements of asset-building processes in urban areas, especially in lower-income urban areas. This discussion points out that financing structures are at the heart of asset-building processes; and these structures pose challenges for any development effort, whether in upper-income suburban or lower-income inner-core areas. “A short history of urban asset-building initiatives before 1990” then summarizes federal urban programs aimed at asset-building and business development, from the 1960s through the Nixon era. “The transformation of banking and financial practices” then examines another crucial context of the newer federal urban initiatives—the transformation of banking and financial-industry practices. Then “Contemporary asset-building in urban areas: from CDFIs to New Market tax credits” returns us to Los Angeles in 1992. It describes the federal urban asset-building policies of the Clinton and Bush Administrations.Footnote 3 “Evaluating the post-1990 federal financing policies” then analyzes these newer federal asset-building urban policies—CDFI and New Markets—in light of past federal policies and of the changing structure of urban financial markets. “The new urban policy and evolving financial markets: some conclusions” draws out some policy implications.",1

An Afro-Brazilian may self-classify in various color or racial categories depending on their social situation. In addition, an Afro-Brazilian may self-identify in one color category but be identified as another color by someone else. I argue that despite strong anti-black sentiment in Latin America generally (Pena et al. 2004) and Brazil more specifically, Afro-Brazilians gain utility from choosing a black identity and the effects of black consciousness are expressed in candidate preference and support for racial policies. While I believe there are emotional attachments to identity, I stress that Brazilians can change their color choices and preferences according to social situations. Bailey and Telles (2006) find that poorer Afro-Brazilians tend to choose the brown category more than Afro-Brazilians with higher education. Thus both poor and high income Afro-Brazilians can whiten their color identification but this is more popular among poorer and older Afro-Brazilians. Racial classification is influenced by region, education, and age. Using 1996 national survey data, Telles finds that low educated blacks are more likely to be consistently classified than highly educated people who classify as black. The strongest effect is gender. Highly educated women who self- identify as black are less likely to be identified as black. He finds that self-identified black women in São Paulo are only similarly classified by interviewers twenty-eight percent of the time and in Bahia only twenty-two percent of the time (2004:99). It is considered demeaning to call a highly educated black woman preta so interviewers tend to classify them in other color categories. For this reason, even the black color category (preto), is not a clear-cut category with no room for manipulating ones color or having ones color manipulated. I argue that choosing moreno, an ambiguous color category is a form of whitening and Telles finds that low-educated Brazilians are two and a half times more likely than those with a high level of education to choose moreno. He finds that respondents with high levels of education are nearly three times as likely than those with low levels of education to choose the negro category (2004, 98–99). As Telles notes, in this case money darkens rather than whitens. The impact of education on self-classification as black is extremely important, given the fact that blackness continues to be stigmatized in Brazilian society. Highly educated Afro-Brazilians and younger Afro-Brazilians now embrace this identity and much of this can be attributed to the efforts of the black movement. In an informal conversation with me, a middle-class Afro-Brazilian man said he made a conscious effort to practice enegreçiamento so that he would challenge stereotypes of black people by showing white Brazilians that Afro-Brazilian families can be made up of a professional couple who are both black and embrace Afro-Brazilian culture and African history. Afro-Brazilians are utility maximizing individuals who choose identities according to preferences and to perceived gains. Afro-Brazilians who choose the black categories of preto and negro do so for strategic reasons. Afro-Brazilians who choose non-black identities likely do so because they do not see the immediate benefits of claiming a black identity. They are not simply passive believers in racial hegemony who are “less-racially conscious.” In local low-income communities where blackness has negative connotations (Sheriff 2001), there are low incentives to claim a black identity thereby resulting in high incentives to whiten ones color identity. While I argue that at the outset, identities are strategically chosen I argue that those who choose black identities may become emotionally attached to these identities and gain psychic benefits when choosing this identity. Sales Augusto Santos, an Afro-Brazilian Sociologist concurs that Afro-Brazilians with higher incomes continue to face discrimination despite the myth that money whitens and it is the experience of racism that leads them to claim a black identity.Footnote 1 I believe that color choices are rational not random choices. Further, although I believe lower-income Afro-Brazilians may not recognize the benefits of choosing black identities, I believe that some do choose black identities and external factors such as the Hip Hop movement, non-governmental organizations dedicated to addressing discrimination, and daily experiences of racism such as police brutality make it very difficult to deny blackness.",5

Social Definitions of Race: Implications for Modern Biomedical Research,March 2010,Joseph L. Graves Jr.,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"What do we mean when we say race? The vast majority people do not comprehend the origin or present day meaning of this word (Graves 2005). Generally, the lay person is referring to both a biological and social content when they use this term. When university students are asked to name how many races exist within the human species their answers range between one—infinity (Graves 2006). When asked what characteristics distinguish human races, they reply that physical and cultural characteristics must be used to identify human races (Graves 2006). Unfortunately, these misconceptions are just as true for those who conduct biomedical research. For example, a recent search of Entrez Pubmed utilizing the term race returned 135,953 articles from the human biomedical literature. More specifically, searches on Caucasian, Mongoloid, and Negroid race returned 37,044, 20,656, and 51,039 citations respectively. While one can still debate the utility of the term race in the human biomedical literature, almost no one defends the idea that the 19th century racial categories Caucasian, Mongoloid, or Negroid are of much use in 21st century research. Yet these terms still remain. This paper argues that this confusion results in part from the general ignorance of evolutionary mechanisms impacting biological variety in species and their results on the human species, specifically. Without an evolutionary perspective, notions of human races and their reputed characteristics persist in society at large, as well as in biomedical researchers. This false paradigm has important implications for the way biomedical research studies are structured, data collected, evaluated, and the public policy proscriptions which result from this process. Indeed more than ever, 150 years without Darwin are enough, especially in the fields of medicine and public health.",13

Spader,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The development of credit scoring is closely connected to the increased prevalence of risk-based pricing in mortgage and consumer credit markets. The aggregation of consumer credit data by the credit bureaus during the 1980s allowed creditors to more precisely observe consumers’ past payment histories. By 2000, almost every mortgage origination referred to the borrower’s credit history score. Today the influence of credit scores continues to grow, as scores are increasingly being used to evaluate applications for insurance, rental housing, employment, and other activities outside of lending and credit markets.Footnote 1 This expanded use of credit scores may create an efficiency gain to consumers, if the credit record provides valuable information to users. However, the expanded use of credit scores also raises the stakes involved in ensuring that both the calculation and use of credit scores do not disadvantage underserved groups.Footnote 2
 Existing studies document two concerns:
 The three major credit bureaus—Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion—all currently seek to collect comprehensive information on the credit histories of all individuals in the United States, collecting information from creditors, utility companies, legal records, and collection agency files. The credit bureaus lack legal rights to any information, instead soliciting voluntary reporting from these sources (Avery et al. 2003).Footnote 3 The resulting data create substantial records for most borrowers, but do not reflect complete records of individuals’ credit histories. The Information Policy Institute estimates that 35 to 54 million Americans do not have sufficient information to generate a score (PERC 2006). In particular, households that rely on small lenders and alternative financial service providers may not have the payments made on these accounts reflected in their credit records. The data used to construct individuals’ credit records commonly contain mistakes and factual errors (Avery et al. 2004). The Fair Credit Reporting Act provides all individuals a right to review their credit record at no cost and mandates mechanisms for appeal and correction. However, no analysis has been performed of the ability of individuals to easily and successfully correct mistakes. Equally important, no analysis has been performed of which individuals review their records and pursue corrections. To the extent that underserved individuals lack knowledge of this right and/or lack access to the internet (see Lyons et al. 2007; Gates et al. 2002), fewer individuals will be likely to pursue corrections. This article presents a more fundamental issue related to the interaction of credit scores with the operation of consumer credit markets. Specifically, it outlines the potential for credit scoring to contribute to disparities in the segmentation of low- and high-cost credit markets, describing the consequences of defining credit scores with respect to a universal measure of default—serious delinquency on any open credit line. Definition of the outcome and payment history measures in this way fails to distinguish between default on a fixed-rate prime mortgage and default on a subprime ARM with a teaser rate and/or a balloon payment, credit products that carry very different incentives to prepay and default. The analysis shows that disparities in credit scores emerge when: (1) disparities exist in the processes through which borrowers are assigned to credit products and (2) alternative product characteristics carry varying risks of default. In the wake of mounting subprime foreclosures, this mechanism contains the potential to exacerbate the concentrated impacts of the subprime crisis in low-income and minority communities. In particular, disparities in credit score outcomes may emerge as a result of the concentrated lending activities of brokers and subprime lenders, even in the absence of discrimination. Unfortunately, the proprietary nature of credit scoring has largely prevented scrutiny from regulators and academics.Footnote 4 The primary exception is that the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (FACTA) directly instructed the Federal Reserve Board to test for disparate impact in the calculation of credit scores. The resulting report offers a seminal analysis of the credit scoring process. However, because the credit bureaus do not currently record the terms of an observed loan, the Federal Reserve analysis also relies on universal measures of payment history and default. The first sections of this article present and discuss the calculation of generic credit history scores, focusing on the consequences of using universal measures. A stylized example is then developed to illustrate the mechanism through which credit scores may capture disparity in the surrounding credit markets, passing it into future periods and into other credit markets. While the use of simulated data in this model is partly motivated by the lack of public data on credit scores, this approach is also useful in that it circumvents the issues with omitted variables and unobserved risk that accompany analyses of default and credit risk. The resulting model of credit scoring shows that credit scores reflect the assignment of borrowers to credit products, in addition to borrowers’ underlying risk of default.",5

Hoover,Mehmet E. Yaya,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Social scientists have devoted much time and resources to understanding the causes and implications of high levels of income inequality within and between countries. Researchers have vigorously explored the impact of gender or educational differences among populations on the root causes of income inequality and on society as a whole. Another interesting way of examining income inequality is to explore the underlying racial/ethnic group dynamics that might have significant influence on the distribution of income. In this paper, we examine regional variations in the distribution of income by race and ethnicity. We examine the factors that might explain income inequality and whether they are the same across racial and ethnic groups. Finally, we examine the impact of within group inequality on overall inequality. The results are two-fold. First, they suggest that income and the square of income both are significant factors influencing income inequality. With the sign of the square of income being negative, the results are consistent with those of others supporting the Kuznets hypothesis. Moreover, increases in unemployment were found to increase inequality, while the percentage of males leads to a decrease for all the groups, however these effects were largest for blacks. There are also regional differences in equality. Inequality is higher in the South than any other region. Second, we present the results of what the overall distribution of income and corresponding inequality measures would have been if the given racial/ethnic group were omitted. The exclusion of whites from all regions but the South increased inequality. Blacks being omitted led to an increase in inequality in the Northeast and South but the levels were virtually zero. Over the last half-century there has been a tremendous amount of interest in the proper measure of inequality ranging from the, now-standard, Gini coefficient to the Relative Mean Deviation measure to the Theil Index. Recent work by Campano and Salvatore (2006) provides an excellent overview of the latest developments in the measurement instruments used in income distribution research. Most work in this area only uses the Gini coefficient as the measure of income inequality. We include the Gini which allows us to incorporate the concept of movements towards or away from the average. This work also uses two types of income: personal income and household income. Given the increasing reliance on several income earners to contribute to total family income, the results derived from household income inclusion are quite telling. This analysis is a first attempt at examining the counterfactual argument of racial/ethnic group importance to overall income inequality by omitting given groups individually and examining the resulting level of inequality.Footnote 1 In addition, this work seeks to explain what factors affect income inequality among given groups and what factors help explain the impact of our counterfactuals. In the next section we present a review of the literature on both inequality and measurements in use along with a discussion of the findings of the impact of these measures on racial/ethnic groups. The third section discusses the data sources used and rationale for the inclusion of our explanatory variables. The fourth section has the model and results. This section also includes a discussion of the counterfactual investigation of racial/ethnic group removal. Concluding remarks are in the final section.",11

The FCC does not, however, provide programs that are specifically targeted to improve ownership opportunities for minorities and women. This is because the FCC eliminated all race-based programs in awarding spectrum licenses after the Supreme Court issued its decision in Adarand Construction, Inc. v. Pena.Footnote 2 In Adarand the Court held that race-based government programs were subject to strict scrutiny. That is race-based programs must serve a compelling governmental interest, such as remedying past discrimination, and must be narrowly tailored to serve that interest. Section 257 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 directs the Commission to identify and eliminate market entry barriers.Footnote 3 In 2000, the Commission released a set of Market Entry Barrier Studies,Footnote 4 and the studies show that race affects opportunities for ownership in telecommunications. Against this legal backdrop, a simple theoretical model is developed to clearly reveal and detail the process or mechanics of racial discrimination in a FCC spectrum auction. Given capital market discrimination and all other factors being equal, we show that a minority firm has no chance or zero probability of winning in an auction for spectrum. In addition, we show that, if equal bidding credits are given to all firms, if there is capital market discrimination, and if all other things are equal, the minority firm has a zero probability of winning. We prove that a policy of auctioning spectrum, when there is capital market discrimination, is an inferior policy among policies that can be used to allocate spectrum. We finally show that a policy of auctioning spectrum, when there is capital market discrimination, results in an inefficient auction. These theoretical results suggest that the FCC is discriminating against minorities and distorting the efficient allocation of spectrum through its auctioning of spectrum under conditions of discrimination in capital markets. The results also suggest that the opportunities for diverse spectrum licensing/ownership can be increased and that spectrum auction efficiency can be improved through the re-introduction of race-based programs that remedy capital market discrimination. The FCC attempted to address an aspect of capital market discrimination by using installment payments to finance winning bids in some spectrum auctions.Footnote 5 Installment payments were abandoned, however, because of failures to pay. Both the economic literature and the telecommunications press suggest that FCC Installment Payments were an absolute failure and that the Commission should not offer any form of credit in the auctioning of licenses. For its part, the FCC has ceased to offer credit and has no proposal to evaluate its lending failures or to initiate a new installment payment system. We suggest that the FCC consider some form of credit arrangement or mechanism in conjunction with other financial institutions. As a first step to resuming some form of governmental financing of licenses to minority/women firms, the failings of the FCC as a lender must be understood. To assess the problems of FCC installment payments, we critically examine the C-Block installment payment plans. After this analysis, we offer several proposals that the FCC may consider in order to address capital market discrimination that is embedded in the auction process. The paper contains six sections. “Literature review” is a review of the literature on the relationship between capital market discrimination and auction outcomes. In “A simple model of an FCC auction and capital market discrimination”, a simple theoretical model of an FCC auction that is based on existing law/rules is developed. We analyze the theoretical relationship between outcomes of an auction and capital market discrimination. “The question of different bidding credits” contains the analysis of the hypothetical case of different auction bidding credits for minority and majority firms. “FCC installment payments” contains a description and critique of the FCC’s Installment Payment System for the C-block Spectrum Auction. In “Installment payments: new proposals” new proposals are presented in order to mitigate the harmful effect of capital market discrimination on auction outcomes and efficiency. We conclude our analysis in “Conclusion”.",1

Okolie,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"On May 29, 1999 Olusegun Obasanjo, a retired army general and former military dictator assumed office as an elected civilian President of Nigeria after 15 years of successive brutal military rule. His deputy was Atiku Abubakar, a former civil servant and wealthy businessman. They contested the election on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). In 2003 they were reelected in what were widely seen as rigged elections. Another set of general elections were held in April 2007. Obasanjo, having served the constitutionally allowed two terms, was not eligible to contest. So, although the ruling party maintained its hold on power, a new man, Umaru Yar’Adua, is the President. It is those April 2007 elections that I discuss here. I was a participant in the events narrated here, having been a senior Presidential aide serving in the office of the then Vice President, for part of the period covered in this essay.

Leigh,Anna L. Wheatley,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Since 1980, healthcare expenditures in the United States have increased markedly as a percent of gross domestic product (GDP)—increasing from less than 10% in 1980 to a projected 17% in 2009 and 19% by 2019 (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 2010). Costs of this magnitude constitute a challenge to the economy overall but, in particular, for the federal government and its budget deficit. Almost half of healthcare spending is by federal, state and local governments through programs such as Medicare,Footnote 4 MedicaidFootnote 5 and CHIP (Children’s Health Insurance Program)Footnote 6 (Council of Economic Advisers 2009). The fraction of healthcare expenditures borne by governments is expected to grow in the near future as early waves of the Baby BoomFootnote 7 become eligible for and sign up for Medicare and as many also become eligible for and enroll in Medicaid (Council of Economic Advisers 2009). Mushrooming healthcare expenditures cause stresses not only at the macro level but also at the micro level—for employers and individuals. The cost to employers, especially those with 100 or fewer employees, to provide health insurance continues to rise, as does the share of this cost borne by employees. As a result, some employers cease offering health insurance coverage, and some employees do not enroll in the health insurance coverage that is available through their employers. The proportion of non-elderly individuals with employer-sponsored health insurance coverage has steadily declined in recent years—from 64.2% in 2000 to 59.3% in 2007 and 58.5% in 2008 (Families USA 2009; Gould 2009). In addition, between 1996 and 2008, the average annual premium for family coverage grew from $6,462 to $12,298, a 90% increase in real terms (Council of Economic Advisers 2009; Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation 2009a). Retaining health insurance coverage is a growing problem in this country. This is true regardless of the measure used or its data source. In 2007, nearly 46 million Americans did not have health insurance (Council of Economic Advisers 2009). More recent data that reflect the impact of the national recession show a continuation of this trend. In 2008, a total of 46.3 million U.S. residents (15.4% of the population) lacked health insurance (Center on Budget and Policy Priorities 2009). Without changes to our healthcare system, this number is projected to grow to 72 million by 2040 (Council of Economic Advisers 2009). The percentage of full-time working adults ages 18–64 who lacked health insurance coverage was 17.2% in 2008, a modest increase over the 2007 share. In 2008, although people of color (African Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Americans who are Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders) were 35% of the U.S. population, they were 54% of the uninsured in our nation (Families USA 2009). In particular, between January 2009 and September 2009, black non-Hispanics (17.3%) and Hispanics (31.1%) were more likely to be uninsured than white non-Hispanics (11%) (Martinez and Cohen 2010). Regardless of insurance status, African Americans experience disparities in the quality of care received and in health outcomes. The 2008 National Healthcare Disparities Report found that for 19 of the 38 core measures of quality analyzed, African Americans received significantly poorer quality of care than whites (AHRQ 2008). Health outcome disparities also were evident during this same time period, in the form of lower life expectancy, higher incidence of diabetes, and higher incidence of HIV/AIDS among African Americans than among whites (US DHHS 2009). Persistent racial/ethnic disparities in access to insurance, receipt of quality care and health outcomes are reflected in the nation’s overall healthcare spending as well. A recent study (LaVeist et al. 2009) found that if health disparities between whites and African Americans, Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans (as a group) had not existed during the 2003–2006 period, the U.S. would have incurred $1.24 trillion less in costs associated with direct medical care, productivity loss due to disability and illness, and premature death. When direct medical care expenditures alone were examined, 31% of this spending for these three subpopulations of color between 2003 and 2006 would not have occurred if racial/ethnic disparities between these groups did not exist.",3

Moreover, blacks are enjoined to stop making particularistic claims on America and solely pursue programs of social change designed to reach all Americans. All of these sentiments were expressed plainly by Barack Obama in his “More Perfect Union” speech in Philadelphia during the campaign: For the African-American community, that path means embracing the burdens of our past without becoming victims of our past. It means continuing to insist on a full measure of justice in every aspect of American life. But it also means binding our particular grievances—for better health care, and better schools, and better jobs—to the larger aspirations of all Americans—the white woman struggling to break the glass ceiling, the white man who’s been laid off, the immigrant trying to feed his family. And it means taking full responsibility for our own lives—by demanding more from our fathers, and spending more time with our children, and reading to them, and teaching them that while they may face challenges and discrimination in their own lives, they must never succumb to despair or cynicism; they must always believe that they can write their own destiny. It should be noted that the post-racial perspective typically does acknowledge that racial discrimination still exist. However, it tends to trivialize and downplay its significance. For example, during his address at the 100th Anniversary of the NAACP this past summer, Obama states that: I understand that there may be a temptation among some to think that discrimination is no longer a problem in 2009. And I believe that overall, there probably has never been less discrimination in America than there is today... But make no mistake: The pain of discrimination is still felt in America. By African American women paid less for doing the same work as colleagues of a different color and a different gender. By Latinos made to feel unwelcome in their own country. By Muslim Americans viewed with the suspicion simply because they kneel down to praise God. By our gay brothers and sisters, still taunted, still attacked, still denied rights. Both implicitly and explicitly, Obama is arguing that there is nothing unique about the discriminatory barriers faced by black Americans today, and further, whatever discriminatory barriers that they may face, are at their lowest point ever. However, Obama does seem to uniquely target his personal responsibility rhetoric to blacks. What is lacking from his discrimination narrative is the empirical evidence which indicates that since the mid to late 1970s black-white wage inequality, along with the measured component of that inequality attributable to discrimination, has remained roughly flat. Indeed, the election of Barack Obama has given the discourse of post-racialism added fuel. For example, after the 2008 presidential election, actor Will Smith proclaimed “...(a)ll of our excuses have been removed. There’s no White man trying to keep you down, because if he were trying to keep you down he would have [also tried to keep] Obama down” (John-Hall 2009). The example of the ascendency of blacks to elite positions is the typical evidence put forth by post-racialists. Common examples before Obama included the hiring of black CEOs at fortune 500 corporations like AOL Time Warner and American Express, the appointment of blacks at the highest level of the cabinet, such as Secretary of State and National Security Advisor, as well as successful black candidate in many major local and state-wide elections. Post-racialists attempt to bolster their case by arguing that these examples of black exceptionalism result from individual or familial acts of perseverance and hard work. In fact, during his recent address at the 100th Anniversary celebration of the NAACP, Barack Obama offers himself and the hard work and parenting behavior of his mother as an example: … I was raised by a single mom. I didn’t come from a lot of wealth. I got into my share of trouble as a child. My life could have easily taken a turn for the worse. When I drive through Harlem or I drive through the South Side of Chicago and I see young men on the corners, I say, there but for the grace of God go I. They’re no less gifted than me. They’re no less talented than me. But I had some breaks. That mother of mine, she gave me love; she pushed me, she cared about my education; she took no lip; she taught me right from wrong. Because of her, I had a chance to make the most of my abilities… What Obama omits in his narrative is the fact that his single mother had a Ph.D., and the fact that he received an elite education both abroad in Indonesia and domestically while on scholarship at one of the best private schools in Hawaii. Instead, his narrative emphasizes the love, motivation and discipline that his mother instilled, which presumably was lacking in the household of his black inner city comparisons. One of the biggest proponents of the post-racial narrative is the highly acclaimed author, Charles Johnson. In the top story of the Summer 2008 edition of the American Scholar, entitled “The End of the Black American Narrative,” Johnson (2008) qualifies himself as a social theorist by describing how fictional writers concerned with social issues use their craft to put forth narratives addressing actual social experiences. His own social theory on race begins with a tale of exploitation and victimization in his award winning novel, Middle Passage. But, as a result of the successes of the civil rights movement, including the Civil Rights Acts, the Voting Rights Acts, and the growth of the middle class, he argues that that narrative has changed—we are now in a post-racial American and that the narrative of black victimization is over. He asserts that it “…is no longer the case that the essence of black American life is racial victimization and disenfranchisement, a curse and condemnation, a destiny based on color in which the meaning of one’s life is thinghood, created even before one is born.” But how does the new and improved Charles Johnson narrative explain the racial wealth gap, and the fact that this so called black middle class dramatically shrinks when wealth is used as the indicator of class position?",83

Harris,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Over the past few decades the United States (U.S.) population has undergone major demographic changes. Whereas black Americans’ share of the U.S. population was 11.8% in 1990 and is projected to be 12.2% in 2010, the Latino/a population’s share is expected to increase from the 9% observed in 1990 to 16% in 2010. Although the black population is projected to increase steadily over the next half century, it will likely not comprise more that 12% of the U.S. population by 2050. This is primarily due to the rapid growth of the Latino/a population, which will nearly triple by 2050 and comprise roughly a third of the total U.S. population. In contrast, the non-Hispanic white population will remain virtually unchanged over the next 40 years (U.S. Census 2008). These changes make it tempting to shift the economic policy focus toward Latino/as, the largest and fastest growing minority group within the U.S. However, black Americans continue to experience large disadvantages and face factors that will make it challenging for them to become upwardly mobile and achieve socioeconomic parity. Furthermore, both blacks and Latino/as face many of the same socioeconomic and educational obstacles that must be eradicated if the United States is to fulfill its commitment to achieving race-neutrality so that the American “creed of opportunity” is inclusive of all groups. This report presents an overview of the economic and educational status of black Americans. In addition to summarizing blacks’ current economic condition, long-term trends are also presented. The purpose of this report is to highlight information that will accentuate the magnitude of the black socioeconomic disadvantage. My goal is to generate discussion about policies in which people have an awareness of the scale and time it will take to address racial inequality. Therefore, this report is more descriptive than prescriptive.

For example, convergence in the black-white gap in basic premarket skills can be a factor that contributes to a reduction in black-white inequalities in educational attainment and earnings (Farkas and Vicknair 1996; Johnson and Neal 1998; O’Neil 1990). Furthermore, the recent rejection of affirmative action initiatives designed to offset achievement disparities in K-12—such as Proposition 209 in California and Hopwood v. Texas (78 F.3d 932 Fifth Circuit 1995) in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi—has serious negative consequences for minority students’ acceptance and enrollment rates in premier institutions of higher education (Brown and Hirschman 2006; Harris and Tienda 2010). The use of test scores in college admissions decisions still disadvantages minority students, and contributes to racial/ethnic disparities on future life-chance outcomes (Carnervale 1999; Ogbu 1994), as many elite colleges and professional schools continue to rely on test scores as in their admissions process (Vars and Bowen 1998). Scholars generally agree that black-white differences in achievement are present at every stage of schooling within K-12 education (Fyer and Levitt 2004; Hallinan 2001). There is less agreement, however, on the nature and extent of these differences. A main reason for this is that the achievement gap has been measured differently across studies. Some have used national average tests based on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and SAT scores (Campbell et al. 2000), whereas others have used either regional or specialized tests created by private entities (Orr 2003; Stevenson et al. 1990; Roscigno 2000). The NAEP has been particularly important for measuring change in achievement over time for national cohorts of fourth, eighth, and twelfth graders. These data have shown that significant differences exist among racial and ethnic groups. Assessments indicate that black students tend to perform below the national level while whites perform above the national level. The black-white gap declined across subject area and grade level from 1973–1999, with the largest gains by black students occurring in the late 1980s. Since then gaps have widened among 4th, 8th, and 12th graders. Thus, although black students have made achievement gains in the last several decades, they continue to exhibit lower reading and mathematics skills compared to their white counterparts. A number of longitudinal studies have assessed black-white differences at various stages of schooling. These reports have illustrated that blacks score much lower than whites in reading and mathematics at school entry, and these differences become larger at each grade level (Rathbun et al. 2004; Fyer and Levitt 2004). A few studies have emphasized that the white advantage in reading over blacks increases during summer (Entwisle and Alexander 1993; Entwisle and Alexander 1992), with some estimates suggesting that this increase is as large as .15 points per month during kindergarten and .19 points per month during first grade (scores based on a 92-point reading test) (Downey et al. 2004). However, it remains unclear how the black-white achievement gap and the achievement distribution changes throughout the K-12 schooling period.",4

Mason,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The individuals observed in this study were born during 1890–1951, between “the Nadir” and the rise of the post-World War II movement for African American equality. Historians refer to the years from 1877 to 1917 (the start of American participation in World War I) as “the Nadir,” that is, the low-point of the African American post-Civil War struggle for racial equality. During 1882–83 the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional the Civil Rights Act of 1875, stating that it interfered with the property rights of individual (white) citizens. In the infamous Plessy v. Ferguson case of 1896 the Supreme Court enshrined “separate but equal” as the law of the land. The Court declared that it was acceptable for public and private entities to provide racially separate but equal facilities and, thereby, the Court provided legal cover for decades of political, legal, and economic exclusion and disparity within both markets and extra-market social processes. Historically, private and state-sponsored violence against African Americans has been a complementary force with market competition in allocating economic opportunity across racial groups. Tolnay and Beck (1992) estimate that at least one African American man, woman, or child was lynched every week during 1882–1930. Most of these lynching were in Southern states. On January 13, 2000, the New York Times reported that 4,742 African Americans were lynched between 1882 and 1968, a rate of about 1 lynching every 6.6 days (Smith 2000). But, most of these lynching occurred prior to 1955. Woodward (1951: 351–352) estimates 127 blacks were lynched every year between 1889 and 1899, a rate of nearly 2 1/2 African Americans per week. Lynchings of African Americans were not mere chance events related to idiosyncratic acts by bigots. Rather, lynchings were an essential element of private sector initiated but state-accepted acts of terrorism. In 1892, Ida B. Wells Barnett wrote that lynching was “an excuse to get rid of Negroes who were acquiring wealth and property and thus keep the race terrorized (quoted in Jacqueline Jones 1998:333).” Lynchings were designed to stifle African American political and economic competition with whites, most especially the political and economic competition arising from independent black males (Olzak 1990). In the midst of the Nadir and therefore despite economic incentives to the contrary, African Americans closed the literacy gap with whites, experienced exceptional entrepreneurial development, and inaugurated an impressive period of institution buildingFootnote 1 For example, illiteracy rates among African Americans declined from 81% in 1870 to 34% by 1910 (Collins and Margo 2003).Footnote 2
 The period from World War I to 1965 was characterized by migration out of the South, urbanization within the South and other regions, and, ultimately, the so-called Civil Rights Movement. The African American tradition of self-help found significant expression in the rise of the black women’s social clubs and the increasing prominence of Historically Black Colleges and Universities.Footnote 3
 The Civil Rights Movement of 1954–1965 and the Black Power Movement of 1965–1973 were eras of great progress for African Americans, even as they were also years when new challenges arose. Migration, urbanization, and sharp declines in the racial gap in the quantity and quality of education lead to a substantial reduction in the black-white wage gap during 1940–1980 (Smith and Welch 1989). By the early 1970s, African Americans 25–36 years of age had achieved nearly equal years of education with their white cohorts (Bernstein 1995). The dismantling of Jim Crow and the federal government’s second reconstruction of Southern society also made an exceptional contribution to reducing the racial wage gap (Donohoe and Heckman 1992). It should also be noted that 1945–1973 was a period of declining unemployment, stable prices, and rising real wages for all workers; hence, this sustained macroeconomic boom, combined with racially progressive public policies and self-help by African Americans, created an economic environment which fostered greater racial wage equality. An analysis of a sample of 1960 help wanted advertisements from selected major newspapers shows a remarkable pattern.Footnote 4 Prior to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, private for-profit competitive employers openly engaged in racial, gender, marital status, and age discrimination within their labor market practices. They had no fear of being penalized by either the competitive forces of the market or governmental agencies. Executive Order 11246 (September 24, 1965) required federal contractors to develop a written affirmative action plan. The plan did not force contractors to hire, train, or promote anyone. Rather, the plan requirements were designed to help the contractor take the necessary steps to remove impediments (if any) to the hiring, training, and promotion of women and racial and ethnic minorities by the contractor. Affirmative action included aggressive steps in outreach, recruitment, training, and other activities that would help women and racial and ethnic minorities compete on a level playing field. Over time, the concept of affirmative action spread from federal contractors to other private companies, state agencies, and universities. Yet, by 1978 this modest effort to breakdown disparity was under full assault (Katznelson 2005). That year, the Supreme Court declared that the University of California—Davis Medical School’s affirmative action plan had discriminated against Alan Bakke, a white male applicant. Thereafter, a series of court challenges have considerably reduced the nature, scope, and effectiveness of affirmative action. The stagnation in racial equality during the mid-1970s and 1980s is also correlated with changes in federal anti-disparity policy (Anderson 1996; Leonard 1996; Rodgers and Spriggs 1996). According to Leonard (1990:105), “affirmative action under the contract compliance program virtually ceased to exist in all but name after 1980s.” He provides strong evidence that the federal government gutted the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Program, the enforcement vehicle for affirmative action within the federal government. Leonard writes that by the mid-1980s affirmative action “no longer aided blacks.” Five major recessions have occurred since the demise of Jim Crow: 1974–1975, 1981–1982, 1990–1991, 2000–2001, and the Great Recession of December 2007–2009. These recessions have varied by length and by intensity, but each has had an impact on racial disparity. The National Bureau of Economic Research reports that there was a 16-month inflationary recession from November 1973 to March 1975.Footnote 5 There was a 6-month recession from January 1980 to July 1980, with a one-year recovery from July 1980 to July 1981. The next major recession occurred over the 16 months of July 1981–November 1982. The one-year “recovery” of 1980–81—the shortest recovery of the post World War II era—was only a brief respite in a long period of stagnation from December 31, 1979 to December 31, 1982. A third major recession occurred from July 1990 to March 1991. A 10-year expansion followed this recession. The penultimate recession lasted just 8 months, starting in March 2001 and reaching its trough in November 2001. The Great Recession started December 2007 and does not yet have an official ending date, making it the nation’s most severe recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Prior to 1991, the average recession lasted just 11 months while the average boom lasted 43 months. Excluding the 1973–1975, 1981–1982, 2007–2009 recessions, the average recession lasted just 9 months. Hence, the recessions of 1974–1975, 1980–1982, and 2007–2009 represent periods of exceptional adjustments in the American economy. The Federal Reserve System (FED) reacted to the stagflation of 1974–1975 and the following years of inflation by making a fundamental change in macroeconomic policy, viz., it became much more concerned with fighting inflation than fighting unemployment. Carpenter and Rodgers (2005) show that the African American employment-population ratio is more sensitive to restrictive monetary policy than the white employment-population. This is so because interest rate increases by the FED increase African American unemployment (especially among teenage African Americans) more so than white unemployment. In particular, they find that African Americans are not necessarily disproportionately employed in interest rate sensitive industries, but that African Americans have a relatively more difficult time finding employment during recessions. Importantly, they also find that contractionary monetary policy does not decrease labor force participation rates; hence, the fall in employment-population is due entirely to the rise in unemployment.",5

Modeste,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In studying the behavior of the demand for imports in Guyana (GY), Jamaica (JA), and Trinidad and Tobago (TT),Footnote 1 Gafar (1995) utilized a traditional import demand model.Footnote 2 In that model, the dependent variable was the volume of imports and the explanatory variables were the level of real income and the price for imported goods relative to the price for domestic goods. When that model was estimated by ordinary least squares (OLS), the estimated income elasticity for each of the three countries was found to be positive and statistically significant with values ranging from 1.29 to 2.29. The estimated price elasticity for each country was also negative and statistically significant with values ranging from −0.26 to −0.34. Given that no test was conducted to determine if the data used in estimating the import demand equation were stationary, the warning expressed by Granger and Newbold (1974) about spurious regressions must not be overlooked. Since, if the data for testing the model are nonstationary, the results on the statistical significance of the various regressions that are reported in the Gafar study may be misleading. In order to ascertain if the data have this statistical property, many empirical studies now routinely conduct unit root and cointegration tests on the numbers used to evaluate the empirical model. Indeed, for recent studies on the import demand function, these new econometric methods are seen to have been applied by Matsubayashi and Hamori (2003), Razafimahefa and Hamori (2005), and Harb (2005), among others. Apart from the stationarity issue, a re-assessment of the determinants of aggregate imports for GY, JA, and TT is also warranted on the grounds that a number of recently conducted studies on import demand have replaced the single real income variable in the import demand equation with the different components that underlie the total expenditure on final goods and services in the macro economy (see Giovannetti 1989; Abbott and Seddighi 1996; Mohammed and Tang 2000; Min et al. 2002; Tang 2003; Narayan and Narayan 2005; Oteng-Abayie and Frimpong 2008). This shift from the real income variable to the components of total expenditure is justified if the import contents for the different components of total expenditure are not the same. Indeed, as Abbott and Seddighi have pointed-out, there could be aggregation bias if the single aggregate expenditure variable is used in the import demand function when the various components of total expenditure exert a different impact on imports. Based on the traditional and the disaggregated expenditure models of import demand, there is a twofold purpose to this paper. The first is to provide new estimates of the income and price elasticities of import demand by means of the bounds test for cointegration. The second is to provide estimates of the consumption, investment, and export elasticities of import demand also based on the bounds test for cointegration. As explained by Pesaran et al. (2001), the bounds test is concerned with determining if the regressors in the model are purely I (0), I (1), or mutually integrated. A major advantage of this test is that once the computed Wald or F-statistic falls outside of the critical value bounds it is not necessary ‘to know the integration/ cointegration status of the underlying regressors. However, if the Wald or F-statistic falls inside these bounds, inference is inconclusive and knowledge of the order of the integration of the underlying variables is required before conclusive inferences can be made’ (Pesaran et al., p. 290). The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the bounds test as presented by Pesaran et al. is described. In Section 3, the empirical findings of the study are reported using the unrestricted error correction model and the bounds test for the traditional and disaggregated expenditure models of import demand. In Section 4, the concluding comments and policy implications are given.",4

The purpose of empowerment zones was to encourage economic development strategies aimed at revitalizing distressed neighborhoods. Such strategies across the country would include four goals: to generate economic opportunities for residents living in the empowerment zones; to create sustainable community development; to build broad participation among community-based partners; and to generate a strategic vision for change in the community.Footnote 2
 Reviewing the history and impacts of empowerment zones remain important given current policy strategies and proposals for revitalizing urban areas. The unfolding Promise Neighborhoods initiative in the US Department of Education and the national administration’s Choice Neighborhoods initiative in the US Department of Housing and Urban Development are being presented as neighborhood-based strategies for improving living conditions in distressed urban areas.Footnote 3 Examination of empowerment zones as a strategy for neighborhood revitalization may have implications for how these new programs are modeled and implemented in urban areas. Within this context it is important to assess the impact of individual empowerment zone programs because as concluded by Rich and Stoker, “the empowerment zone initiatives was not a national program that was implemented in several different sites; it was a set of local programs that were sponsored by the same federal grants and made use of the same market-oriented tools.” Further, “our evidence shows that some of the local programs were effective (Rich and Stoker 2007).” In a follow-up article they write: “Our evaluation findings suggest that what happens locally is a vital concern for federal urban policy and also informative for local communities with responsibility for crafting and executing revitalization strategies (Rich and Stoker 2010).” Boston was selected as an Empowerment Zone (EZ) site in 1999 by HUD under the Tax Payer’s Relief Act of 1997. The 10 year empowerment zone designation (1999–2009) included authorization for provision of tax-exempt bonds and various kinds of tax credits up to $130 million.Footnote 4 This initiative included authorization of $10 million per year to advance objectives associated with economic opportunity and job creation; enhancing the health and well-being of residents; providing education and job readiness; and, community capacity building. Based on congressional legislation Boston’s empowerment zone (EZ) came to an end in December 2009.Footnote 5 Appendix A provides a time chart of major events and developments in the history of Boston’s EZ. Was this economic development initiative a success in Boston? And, how should success or failure be determined for this kind of strategy? What are the implications for civic leaders regarding neighborhood revitalization and the idea of community empowerment?",3

According to Brown and Larson (1977), the number of Black-operated farms reached a peak of 925,710 in 1920. By 1969, the number of Black-operated farms had dropped 90.6% to 87,393, compared with a drop of 64% for all farms in the South and 57.7% for all farms in the nation. According to by Calvin Beale (1966), the rural population for African-Americans was highly concentrated in agriculture, and 97% of it was in the South. He also stated that African Americans migrated away from southern farms as a result of new opportunities in the industrial Northern part of the United States (U.S.) and that a decline in the total rural black population took place that had never been reversed until the time of writing, 1966. However, the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (USDA/NASS 2008) released their 2002 Census of Agriculture results in June 2008 that showed an increase in the percentage of land ownership among Black or African American principal operators since the previous Census. According to the 2002 Census of Agriculture news release, ninety-one percent of Black or African American principal operators represented 1.4% of all principal farm operators in the U.S., indicating an increase in the representation of small minority operated farmers compared to prior Censuses. This result was unexpected, and will be explained below.
 Number of minority farmers, Southeast States, 1920–2002 According to Gilbert, Sharp, and Felin (2001), the total number of African-American farmers decreased over time because of the loss of landownership and farming operations, as well as other contributing factors. Beale (1971) believed that the displacement over the last 20 years was due to voluntary withdrawal or old age of the great majority of black farm operators. The principal role of African-American farmers has changed over time from hired farm workers to machinery operators. The main objective of this research was to identify and quantify the determinants of the number of minority farmers in Southeast Region of the United States from the period 1969 to 1997. A second objective was to determine the potential impact of international trade agreements on the number of minority farmers in their career choices to either stay or migrate into another career field. A third objective is to compare occupational migration rates of minorities out of agriculture with all farmers in the Southeast Region. Discovering the core motives that led to a significant decrease in minority farmers over the period 1969 to 1997 extends the literature on minority migration out of agriculture in the United States. Previous literature has shown that many minority farmers have moved from rural areas into the urban sector largely due to financial resources. Wood and Gilbert (1998) found that most African-American farmers depended principally on off-farm income, with farming as a secondary source. A limited number of studies, mostly census-based, provided evidence for the continuing decrease in the number of African-Americans entering the field of agriculture, and the likelihood of more minority farmers in the future. This research will explore the potential relationship between the number of minority farmers rates of return to agriculture and nonagriculture, and international trade, based on the number of farmers who have migrated out of the farming sector during the years 1969 to 1997.",4

Price,William Spriggs,Omari H. Swinton,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Since their genesis in the aftermath of the emancipation of slaves, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) have been vehicles for social, political and economic progress for black Americans. Their historical efficacy is evidenced by the disproportionate number of HBCU graduates—well into the twentieth century—who are among the black business elite (Boyd 2007), university professors, congressmen, and judges (Fryer and Greenstone 2010; Wilson 2007); and among the clergy and activists who waged the successful battles for civil rights (Redd 1998; Roebuck and Murty 1993). HBCUs also appear to have a positive impact on the social capital—which has been found to be a crucial determinant of economic success (Sobel 2002)—of its graduates (Palmer and Gasman 2008), and on growth rates in rural counties (Mykerezi and Mills 2004). Notwithstanding this evidence of being effective institutions, at least since Solnick (1990), HBCUs have been viewed analytically as labor market interventions that impact the wages of attendees and graduates. In general, the interest has been whether or not HBCU graduates fare better or worse in the labor market relative to black graduates of non-HBCUs. The results have been mixed, as relative to non-HBCUs, HBCU graduation has been found to have no impact on earnings (Ehrenberg and Rothstein 1994; Robinson and Albert 2008), a positive impact (Burnim 1980; Constantine 1995; Strayhorn 2008), or a negative impact (Fryer and Greenstone 2010). The mixed results are not surprising given the variety of data, estimators, and econometric/statistical approaches utilized to estimate the effects of HBCU graduation. For educational policy purposes, the existence of mixed results on the effects of graduating from an HBCU are problematic. Given the historic role that HBCUs have had in effectively providing higher education opportunities for black Americans, their ongoing relevancy is meaningful and significant if there is clear evidence that the tuition and fees that attendees/graduates pay realize a return in the labor market. As HBCUs are no longer the sole option for black Americans, it may also be important for the returns to graduating from an HBCU exceed that of non-HBCUs, if they are to stay relatively competitive. In addition, the Supreme court in U.S. v. Fordice (505 U.S. 717 [1992]) required that state legislatures establish “educational justification” for the continued existence of public state-supported HBCUs. Surely, one dimension of “educational justification” is the extent to which HBCUs confer labor market advantages on its graduates. In this context, a preponderance of empirical evidence on the labor market effects of HBCU graduation—negative, neutral, or positive—could be an important input into legislative decision making on the future of public HBCUs. In this paper, we add to the literature on the labor market consequences of HBCU graduation by estimating the effects of graduating from an HBCU with data from the National Survey of Black Americans (NSBA). As far as we know, the NSBA has not been previously utilized to explore the labor market consequences of graduating from an HBCU. Given that the NSBA is a nationally representative sample of black Americans with respondents who graduated from a broad range of colleges, and reporting a wide range of labor market experience, it can be a source of parameter estimates that are unbiased, or with less bias relative to parameter estimates of the effects of HBCU graduation in the extant economics literature. Existing studies depend upon data such as the the National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS-72), Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B), and the College and Beyond Database (C&B), that either restrict the labor market experience of respondents and/or the type of HBCU respondents attended or graduated from.Footnote 1
 Our use of the NSBA allows us to extend the literature on the labor market effects of graduating from an HBCU in several dimensions. The NSBA does not report on labor market earnings for respondents across all survey waves for respondents. Neither does it provide the type of numeric data that is customarily utilized to estimate earnings equations. However, to the extent that the labor market effects of graduating from college affect permanent income, observed earnings over the early career paths of college graduates may be measuring short run transitory earnings and hence the short run effects of graduating from an HBCU. We estimate the effects of graduating from an HBCU on an individual’s Duncan socioeconomic status index, which can be viewed as a measure of permanent income (Zimmerman 1992), and the long-run effects of attending/graduating from an HBCU. The NSBA also includes two measures of psychological well being for respondents—an index of black identity and self-esteem. To the extent that labor market earnings are a function of self-esteem (Goldsmith et al. 1997), and racial identity (Darity et al. 2006), we estimate the effects of graduating from an HBCU on both of these measures of psychological well being to consider how graduating from an HBCU can indirectly affect labor market outcomes. In this context, our analysis of the psychological outcomes associated with HBCU graduation extends the measures utilized in typical earnings equations to include factors that have indirect impacts on labor market outcomes. Econometrically, we employ a potential outcomes approach to identify treatment effects associated with graduating from an HBCU. We exploit the NSBA categorical data by estimating the treatment effect of graduating from an HBCU by matching on the propensity score—defined as the conditional probability of receiving the treatment, for both a direct measure of labor market outcomes, and an indirect measure. As Brand and Halaby (2006) indicate in a recent application of this approach, matching estimators are attractive for estimating treatment effects as they are not dependent upon a linear functional form governing the effects of covariates and selection into the treatment. As such matching estimates of treatment effects are potentially superior to regression-type estimates (e.g, ordinary least squares, instrumental variables) given that linearity constitutes misspecification. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the second section below, we provide a labor market context for graduating from an HBCU.

More than 95% of those in custody are serving sentences in excesses of 1 year. The number of people entering correctional facilities is increasing at the same time that, offenders exiting the facilities in increasing. More specifically, statistics show that during 2006, the number of offenders entering the system and the number of ex-offenders being released increased by more than 2% from the previous year. About 750,000 were being admitted into prison while 713,000 were being released, in 2006 (Bureau of Justice Statistics 2008). Incarceration rates vary by race, gender and age, among other factors. Most of those in custody are men, however, there about over 200,000 women in custody, also. More than a third of the prison population is comprised of black males (35%). White males make up 33% of the prison population followed by Hispanic males who make up about 18% of the population. Although the greatest percent of black males in custody were between the ages of 20 and 29; black males, between the ages of 30 and 34, had the highest custody incarceration rate of any group. In fact, black males were 6 times more likely to be held in custody than their white counterparts (Bureau of Justice Statistics 2008). The incarceration rates for black women held in custody were greater than for Hispanic or White women. The rate for black women was 348 per 100,000, compared to 146 for Hispanic women and 95 for white women. For the most part, black women in prison or jail were held in custody at higher rates than all other women, irrespective of age. In 2007, black women were about 4 times more likely to be held in custody than white women (Bureau of Justice Statistics 2008). Of the many Americans in custody, millions will not spend the remainder of their natural lives incarcerated. Nearly three-quarters of a million individuals left American prisons in 2005 and nearly 10 million left jails. Many ex-offenders come from a low-income background and return to it upon release. Studies have shown that ex-offenders rely on financial support from family members and friends for months after their reentry and in some cases for years. In Maryland, for example, about 80% of ex-offenders were living with a family member or friend, 2 months after their release. One reason that ex-offenders rely on financial support from their family members and friends is due to a lack of employment opportunities. In the District of Columbia, for example, less than 60% of ex-offenders were working full-time, a year after their release and about 10% were working part-time. Similar findings were observed in cities such as Cleveland, Ohio. Ex-offenders who find employment often do so in industries that require very little or no skills. Popular industries for ex-offenders include jobs in the construction industry as manual laborers food service, maintenance, and manufacturing sectors. Many of these ex-offenders are underemployed when compared with the types of employment opportunities they had before their incarceration. Dual labor market theory focuses on discrimination and poverty in the labor market. Dual labor market theory holds that the labor market is segmented. The labor market consists of a primary and a secondary tier. The primary tier is characterized by well-paying jobs with benefits that require relatively high skill sets. The secondary labor market, on the hand, is characterized by low paying, unsecure, dead-end jobs. Due to factors such as discrimination and low levels of human capital (i.e. relatively lower levels of education), certain social groups are relegated to the secondary labor market. Blacks, women, and ex-offenders are among the social groups over represented among workers in the secondary labor market. Longing for unfettered access to the primary labor market, some look to the underground economy. Underground economic activities can range from babysitting to cutting hair to selling drugs. Participating in the underground economy, especially in illicit activities like selling drugs, places some ex-offenders at-risk of incarceration. Not only is the over representation of ex-offenders in the secondary labor market a risk-factor, but the indebtedness of some ex-offenders upon release is another risk-factor. Ex-offenders fortunate enough to find employment in the primary sector or even in the secondary sector, may find significant proportions of their pay committed before they even receive their paycheck. McLean and Thompson (2007) found that many ex-offenders have difficulties meeting their financial obligations, some of which are ordered by the court. These financial obligations might include, but not be limited to, child support, court fees, restitution, fines and drug testing fees. The study paints this bleak picture: Most people released from prisons and jails have few financial resources. It is unlikely their financial outlook will improve soon after their return to the community. On average, people released from prison are about 34 years old. Typically, 90% of these individuals are male, and more than half are African-American or Latino. They have little education and few marketable job skills. Generally, they return to the neighborhoods they came from or similar locales, where job opportunities are particularly limited (1) The financial challenges do not only impact the ex-offender, but they touch family members, friends, neighborhoods and the society at-large.",14

The analysis focuses on their perceptions of career opportunities and discrimination in housing markets. The central argument of this article is that black real estate professionals focus on a niche market. This niche entails residential real estate transaction with black clientele in relatively segregated neighborhood contexts. This focus has emerged in response to perceptions of racial discrimination that close opportunities in the broader real estate market. It is further argued that institutional constraints, coupled with workplace discrimination, segregate black real estate professionals in the real estate industry. It is argued that the concentration of black real estate professionals in firms with other minorities reinforces the tendency to focus on the minority niche in the real estate market. Scholars have referred to the business strategy described above as an economic detour (Stuart 1969; Butler 1991; Silverman 1999; Davis 2002; Kornrich 2009). In order to understand why black real estate professionals adopt an alternative business strategy based on real estate sales in the black community, it is necessary to examine the institutional constraints they confront. Black professionals have historically lacked full access to mainstream markets. The economic barriers they have faced are an outgrowth of historical patterns of racial discrimination in society. In fact, a number of scholars have discussed the status of black professionals over the years (Frazier 1962; Myrdal 1962; Foley 1966; DuBois 1968; Harris 1969; Pierce 1971; Washington 1971; Marable 1983; Butler 1991; Bates 1993, 1997; Drake and Cayton 1993; Silverman 1998; Anderson 2001; Herring 2004; Button et al. 2006). There is a general agreement that black professional employment has historically been abridged by workplace discrimination, capital constraints, market barriers, and general racism. In fact, black professionals have only recently begun to find a narrow range of business opportunities opened to them outside of the black community, often in corporate and government settings (Boyd 1991, 2006; Bates 1997). Despite increased access to career opportunities, black professionals continue to experience hostility and discrimination in the workplace (Feagin and Sikes 1995; Anderson 2001; Bates 2001; Johnson 2004; Button et al. 2006). Consequently, the relative range of opportunities for black professionals continues to be characterized by a lack of full participation in broader markets and a focus on market niches in the black community. These issues are described by Stuart (1969), and later by others (Butler 1991; Silverman 1999; Davis 2002; Kornrich 2009), using the concept of an economic detour. Stuart (1969) argues that during de jure segregation, black professionals and entrepreneurs followed an economic detour. Blacks built businesses in minority markets, since white customers were hesitant to buy from black-owner businesses. Stuart (1969: xxv) stresses that since the average black business owner is undercapitalized and faces racism, “he must choose those lines of commerce and personal services that white competitors have either not elected to invade and nearly monopolize, or the very nature of which tend to make less effective the force of white competition and peculiar racial restrictions.” The concept of an economic detour is further developed by Butler (1991: 72–73), who points out that an economic detour entails government action, or inaction, that allows segregation to interfere with the normal operation of the marketplace. In this discussion, Butler (1991: 72–73) emphasizes that although other entrepreneurial groups have faced discrimination, black Americans, particularly during de jure segregation, were the targets of racism in an institutional context, and this placed them at a greater disadvantage in the economy. Butler (1991: 74–75) draws a clear distinction between the character of black entrepreneurship and immigrant entrepreneurship, arguing that while other race and ethnic groups have been free to operate in the larger economy, historically, blacks were not. Although de jure segregation is no longer in place, various aspects of Stuart’s and Butler’s arguments remain relevant to the analysis of contemporary black professionals and entrepreneurship, particularly where businesses that do not serve corporate and government clients are concerned. In general, black professionals are still stigmatized in society and their economic opportunities continue to be limited due to perceived and actual discrimination. As a result, black professionals often focus on market niches in the black community. Although this strategy has opened some career opportunities to black professionals, persistent wage gaps and capital constraints have threatened the sustainability of activities that focus on these niche markets. This was observed by Silverman (1999) in his analysis of the ethnic beauty aids industry, Davis (2002) in her analysis of black-owned advertising agencies, and Kornrich (2009) in his analysis of black physicians. Past research has also distinguished between niche markets in the black community and those associated with ethnic enclave economies (Portes and Bach 1985; Portes and Manning 1986; Zhou 1992; Light and Gold 2000). These works describe ethnic enclave economies as settings where immigrants can obtain higher levels of social and economic mobility than in the mainstream economy. As a result, ethnic enclave economies entail dual benefits, they offer immigrants higher levels of economic mobility than the mainstream economy, and they serve a social function as ethnic havens. Unlike an ethnic enclave economy, which has a dual economic and social function, the market niche in the black community serves primarily a social function. This is because the market niche in the black community creates a safe haven for blacks, buffering them from racism in mainstream institutions. However, blacks accrue relatively few economic benefits from participation in the market niche. Wong (1977: 460) makes this point clear, stating that black entrepreneurs see business ownership as “an end in itself,” since the black entrepreneur’s “principal motive is the desire to be his own boss—not profit making. Indeed, after overhead, his ‘profits’ are typically no more than prior working wages in the secondary labor market.” Bonds (2007) reaches similar conclusions, observing that black-owned businesses focused on the minority niche lack access to credit and tend to operate on the verge of bankruptcy. Despite limited economic benefits, blacks receive important social benefits from focusing on market niches in the black community. Professionalism and entrepreneurship is a source of social autonomy from mainstream institutions for blacks. The social prestige attached to professionalism and the meaning of black entrepreneurship has become an important rallying point for social change in the black community. For instance, the “doctrine of the double-duty dollar,” which instructs black consumers to patronize black professionals and businesses has been articulated by black leaders since the early 1900’s (Washington 1971; Kunjufu 1991; Drake and Cayton 1993; Light et al. 1994). In effect, black professionalism and entrepreneurship serves as a mechanism for the creation of a protected market niche in the black community. This market niche constitutes an economic detour which insulates black professionals from workplace discrimination, the presence of racial barriers to capitalization, and blocked access to the mainstream economy. Historically, black real estate professionals have worked in an industry where consumers and workers have faced discrimination. This situation began to change with the passage of the Fair Housing Act of 1968. In its present form, as amended in 1988, the Act criminalizes discrimination in the sale and rental of housing based on: race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin (Yinger 1999). Under the Act, it is illegal to discriminate at any point in housing transactions. The Act applies to advertising, sharing information about housing, lending, accessibility, and any other omission or decision which restricts housing choice to a group protected by law. At the state and local levels, additional fair housing protections have been adopted which augment federal law (National Neighborhood Coalition 2001). Since the passage of the Fair Housing Act of 1968 there have been a number of efforts to measure discrimination in housing markets (Abravanel and Conningham 2002; Squires et al. 2002; Turner et al. 2002; Abravanel 2007). Despite some progress in curbing discrimination, housing markets remain segregated and there is limited public awareness about fair housing law. Despite general research on housing discrimination, little is known about the perceptions of real estate professionals. In the absence of survey data measuring real estate professionals’ perceptions, past research on the real estate industry serves as a starting point for inquiry. Historically, three issues have been associated with discrimination and fair housing in the real estate industry. The first involves concerns related to open housing. At its core, this issue focuses on the degree to which minorities have access to housing in all communities. Debates about open housing have centered on whether landlords and sellers of real estate have the right to refuse to rent or sell property to minorities. Fair housing laws have been one of the primary tools used to establish open housing as an underlying principle in contemporary housing markets. Since the adoption of such legislation, surveys of the general population have indicated that growing support exists for open housing (Goring 2007). The second issue associated with discrimination and fair housing in the real estate industry is the practice of steering (Turner et al. 2002, 2007; Ellen 2008; Squires 2008). Steering refers to the practice where real estate brokers or agents guide prospective homebuyers toward or away from certain neighborhoods based on race or some other characteristic. The practice of steering by real estate professionals has helped to produce and reinforce patterns of segregation across the United States. During the early and mid-1900s steering was widespread. It became illegal with the passage of civic rights and fair housing laws. However, instances of steering are still identified in the contemporary period. The third issue associated with discrimination and fair housing in the real estate industry is the practice of blockbusting (Orser 1997; Gotham 2002; Squires 2008). Blockbusting is a practice used by real estate brokers and agents to encourage white property owners to sell their homes by giving the impression that increased numbers of minorities are moving into their neighborhood. Blockbusting is one of the more insidious practices used by real estate agents because it relies on racism as a mechanism to augment property sales. This practice allows unscrupulous real estate agents to pressure homeowners into selling their properties to minority buyers. As a result, real estate agents profit from artificially enhanced sales. Like steering, blockbusting is prohibited under fair housing and other laws. Nevertheless, suspected blockbusting is periodically reported in the contemporary period. In large part, the real estate industry is self regulating with respect to open housing, steering, blockbusting and other areas related to fair housing. One of the primary mechanisms for self regulation has been professional education and training programs. Real estate professionals are required to undergo fair housing training prior to licensing at the state level and continuing education is required for re-licensing. Today, education and training is endorsed by the National Association of Realtors (NAR), its local affiliates, and other professional associations. Nonprofit housing organizations and other local agencies support education and training of real estate professionals. These organizations and agencies also monitor real estate practices and enforce fair housing laws. Yet, in spite of these efforts, discrimination continues to exist in housing markets. The contemporary milieu represents the culmination of a number of changes in fair housing law, public perceptions, and real estate practices. Most of these changes are relatively new and can be traced back to the late-1960s. Prior to that period, there were no fair housing laws at the federal level, public attitudes were less supportive of open housing, and organizations like the NAR openly discriminated against minority clients and realtors. Within the real estate profession, many of the reforms that have occurred contemporaneously were the result of changes in law, public attitudes, and advocacy from black realtors. One of the primary sources of advocacy for housing reform came from the National Association of Real Estate Brokers (NAREB). The NAREB is the largest association of minority real estate professionals and the oldest minority trade association in America. Its membership is predominantly composed of black real estate professionals. The NAREB was formed in 1947 in order to advocate for open housing and the rights of black professionals in the real estate industry. At the time the organization was formed, blacks were not permitted to join the NAR. Consequently, blacks were not permitted to identify themselves as “realtors,” since the term was trademarked by the NAR and only applicable to its members. In response, NAREB members coined the term “realtist” to refer to its members. Although barriers to NAR membership were lifted in response to the civil rights movement, many black professionals remained members in the NAREB only and continued to identify as “realtists” (Smith 2006). Given this historical backdrop, there remains a certain degree of tension between minority and mainstream real estate associations.",1

Changes in economic, political, legal and social structures can render previously effective strategies dysfunctional, requiring new approaches that support existing social hierarchies. While such transformed regimes may appear entirely new, the vestiges of previous eras, and the interests that created them, remain hidden at their core. Wacquant (2001:95) identifies a “historical sequence of ‘peculiar institutions’ that have shouldered the task of defining and confining African Americans.” These include: slavery, the Jim Crow system, the ghetto, and the hyper-ghetto in conjunction with mass incarceration. According to Wacquant, the Jim Crow regime was replaced by the modern ghetto because it lacked the sophistication needed to manage inherent tensions between two institutional goals: (1) the ostracization of blacks from white society and (2) the exploitation of black labor for white profit. Arguably, terror through white mob violence was one of the most important control mechanisms during the post-emancipation period, extending as far as to the mid-1960s. This seems particularly true in the South, where the need to extract black labor was potentially most pressing and simultaneously most at odds with cultural traditions demanding racial separation. However, as Wacquant points out, the brutality of lynching played a prominent role in driving millions of blacks out of the rural South, and into urban areas perceived to be more tolerant (especially large Northern cities). Growing legal opposition and social sentiments hastened the system’s end. Thus, the era of the urban ghetto began in part because the blatant brutality of Jim Crow sowed the seeds of the system’s own destruction, or at least, transformation. In this view, the breakdown of Jim Crow represented an organizational challenge. Racial animus remained; the question was how the racial hierarchy would be preserved in ways that were effective within new social and legal frameworks. This study examines one possibility, namely, racial housing segregation. The central question addressed is whether the racial tensions that were manifest by the violent regimes of lynching and Jim Crow are currently animated in the form of racially segregated housing markets. We first review the use of lynching as a technique of social control and its demise in the face of demographic, social and legal change. We then explain how segregation can function as a replacement for lynching, effectively accomplishing the key goals of its more violent predecessor. Finally, we subject the hypothesized link between lynching and segregation to empirical examination. Specifically, we ask whether the current levels of segregation in southern metro areas are statistically correlated with the rates of black lynching in those metro areas between 1890 and 1960, controlling for a variety of factors normally thought to influence segregation. The noticeable variation in both black lynching rates and segregation levels permits a meaningful analysis of the data. The results of the estimated random effects models, which account for unobserved cross-MSA heterogeneity, indicate that current segregation is significantly related to past lynching rates. Thus, southern segregation appears as more than simply a general phenomena observed throughout the south.Footnote 1 Instead, and consistent with the reasoning of Wacquant (2001), segregation appears at least partly as a direct outgrowth of lynching, a different technique to serve similar ends. These results add to previous social science research that has examined how the history of lynching in a state may be predictive of other ongoing methods of racial subordination, including the current number of death sentences for blacks as well as overall support for capital punishment (Jacobs et al. 2005; Zimring 2003; Messner et al. 2006).Footnote 2

Giedeman,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"On September 7, 2008, as the American economy was approaching the most acute stage of the Financial Crisis of 2007–09, the United States government placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship. By doing so, the government prevented these mortgage giants from going into bankruptcy in the wake of the collapse of the housing market and, in essence, bailed out their debt-holders. The downfall of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac calls to mind, and invites comparisons to, the demise of an infamous post-Civil War bank, The Freedman’s Savings and Trust Company. The Freedman’s Bank, as it is often called, was founded by an act of the United States Congress in 1865. Its purpose was originally altruistic and intended to provide a place of saving for “persons heretofore held in slavery in the United States, or their descendants.”Footnote 1 Initially the Freedman’s Bank was successful in attracting deposits and it soon expanded to include thirty-four interstate branches. A change in the bank’s charter in 1870, however, set the stage for the bank’s demise by providing a means for the bank’s managers to invest in real estate. The bank managers subsequently engaged in the acquisition of risky assets as well as outright fraud. The effects of this mismanagement and fraud were so severe that the Freedman’s Bank was forced to close in 1874, taking with it the savings of over 60,000 depositors. The failure of the Freedman’s Bank left a bitter legacy not only due to depositor losses, but also because it almost certainly precluded the establishment of other government-sponsored financial institutions that might have benefited former slaves and the under-banked population in general. In the same way, it seems that the recent experiences of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have potentially soured the public’s taste for government initiated financial institutions for the foreseeable future even when such institutions could play a positive role in the financial system. This paper notes similarities concerning the initial motivation for the creation of all three institutions and discusses the mismanagement that led to the institutions’ failures. The paper also discusses the government’s response to the institutions’ demise and their possible legacy concerning the creation of similar institutions in the future. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II provides the reader with a brief history of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac while Section III provides a more detailed look at the history of the Freedman’s Bank. Section IV discusses the legacy left by the failure of the Freedman’s Bank while Section V does the same for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Section V provides a concluding summary.",1

The Case of Kenya’s Manufacturing Sector,September 2011,Maureen Were,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The significant rise in export-oriented manufacturing production witnessed in the last two decades of the twentieth century and the associated successes especially in parts of Asia formed a basis on which export-oriented manufacturing production began to be viewed as a major strategy for enabling growth and employment creation in many developing countries. When Kenya embraced comprehensive trade liberalization reforms in the early 1990s,Footnote 1 it was envisaged that increased trade openness would enhance enterprise efficiency and spur export growth, thus leading to increased employment opportunities and economic growth. The manufacturing sector has been the main conduit for the country’s integration into regional and world markets. The sector is large by regional standards, accounting for over 10% of gross domestic product. It is a major source of employment in urban areas with strong backward and forward linkages to the rest of the economy (Wanjala and Kiringai 2007). Manufacturing exports are targeted at both regional markets, including the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the East African Community (EAC) as well as European and American markets. Starting with agro-processing, Kenyan manufacturers have in recent years, thanks to the African Growth Opportunity Act (AGOA) and associated Export Processing Zones (EPZs), increased exports of textiles, mainly targeting the US market. However, spurring economic growth through exporting while at the same time promoting growth of high quality employment remains a development challenge in Kenya. The number of full time, long-term salaried employees seems to be decreasing, as the system evolves towards employment of a diverse pool of irregular workers who are part timers, temporary, casual or high-turnover labourers.Footnote 2 There has been concern that trade liberalization might have led to greater casualisation of the workforce and decline in earnings for less skilled workers (Manda 2002). Available data shows that within the formal sector which accounts for just about 30% of total employment, casual employment as a proportion of total formal sector employment rose remarkably, particularly after trade liberalization—from an average of 13% in the first half of 1990s to 23% in 2006. This nearly doubled to 40% by 2008. This trend is of concern especially for a country like Kenya, where casual workers often have no formal labour contracts with the employer and where their services can be terminated any time at short notice or without notice. They operate without non-wage employment benefits such as medical cover, transport allowance and severance pay and, are often employed on temporary basis. Payment is at end of day or week or on piece rate basis. Concerns about poor remuneration and long working hours have also been raised with respect to casual workers especially in export-oriented sectors. All these have implications for poverty as more people may be joining the ranks of the working poor in an economy where there are no safety nets for vulnerable groups. That notwithstanding, there is paucity of empirical work that analyze the employment effects of export-oriented production, particularly with respect to the manufacturing sector. Generally, there is a research lacuna on how trade and trade policies affect the quantity and quality of employment. In particular, empirical evidence on the African continent is severely limited. Most of the empirical evidence on trade and labour market outcomes has typically focused on issues of wage inequalities in developed countries, and recently on East Asia and Latin America (see Wood (1998) for a review of empirical evidence in developed countries). The few studies that directly address employment issues in relation to trade include one by Greenaway et al. (1999) who found a negative effect of both import and export penetration on labour demand in the manufacturing industry in the UK. In the context of African countries, Milner and Wright (1998) found no significant impact of exporting on employment using industry-level data for Mauritius while in the case of Tunisia, Mouelhi (2005) established that a reduction in effective protection rate (as a measure of trade policy) increased labour demand. However, these studies do not focus on composition of the workforce, that is, the distinction between casual and regular, long term salaried workers. Overall, empirical studies that analyse determinants of composition of casual employment are lacking. Although Mangan and Williams (1999) are exceptional, they focus on factors such as unionization of workers, age and industry dummies to explain determinants of composition of casual employment in Australia, leaving out trade-related factors. Trade-employment nexus has elicited little study in Kenya. Studies on employment effects of trade by Sen (2002) and, Manda and Sen (2004) use highly aggregated industry-level data without delving into the effects of trade on workforce composition. Moreover, the period covered in the analysis by Sen (2002) largely cover the import substitution period when the economy was relatively closed. Other studies have centred on gender differential and employ1ment structure in Kenya’s horticulture industry and garment industry under the EPZs (Dolan and Sutherland 2002; Dolan and Humphrey 2000; McCormick 2001), leaving out the rest of the manufacturing sector. Using Kenya’s manufacturing sector as a case study, this paper adds to the existing works by analysing employment outcomes, in terms of composition between casual versus permanent/regular workers and the extent to which the proportion of casual workers employed in the manufacturing sector can be attributed to the firms’ export-orientation. The empirical evidence for the study derives from survey data collected on a number of manufacturing firms in Kenya under the World Bank’s project “Regional Programme on Enterprise Development (RPED)” in the early 1990s and recently in 2003. The project enabled collection of unique data sets on employee-and firm-level characteristics in a number of African countries, thus alleviating to some extent, the data gaps that are often characteristic of many African countries. In Kenya, the first wave of the manufacturing surveys conducted in 1993, 1994 and 1995 coincided with the period of increased export promotion schemes and liberalization of trade. The second wave, which covered slightly more sub-sectors, was conducted in 2003. Together, these data sets contain detailed firm-level information that was used in doing the analysis for this paper. The analysis shows that although there was increased exporting following trade liberalization in the early 1990s, the proportion of employment in exporting firms shrunk from an average of 76.2% in the period 1993–1995, to 54.2% in 2003. On the other hand, the proportion of casual employment increased from 28% in 1993 to 36% in 2003. However, casualization phenomenon was not only restricted to exporting firms, even though exporting firms employed more casual workers in absolute terms. The empirical findings based on the regression analyses further showed no strong evidence of impact of exporting on the proportion of casual workers employed in the manufacturing sector. Whereas export promotion policy targeting the manufacturing sector is one of the key policy strategies to job creation and expansion of formal employment in Kenya, the quality of employment still remains a challenge. In general however, the rise in casual employment is likely to be exacerbated by other factors beyond exporting. These are likely to include deregulation of labour market policies as well as the highly competitive market environment in which firms operate, both domestically and internationally. That notwithstanding, efforts should be directed towards addressing the quality of jobs associated with export growth and expansion, taking into consideration the plight of casual workers, particularly in the absence of safety nets for such vulnerable groups of workers.",7

There is considerable research on analyzing reasons for the differences in white and black earnings.

This paper investigates the causes of regional differences in Black earnings discrimination by city in the United States. Data for this paper comes from the 2000 Census Public Use Microdata 1% Sample (PUMS). Regional differences in minority earnings discrimination have been a topic since Gary Becker’s original work in 1957. Becker (1971) argued that minorities face less earnings discrimination in areas where they are a relatively small percentage of the population compared to areas where they are a greater percentage of the population. Assuming an equal percentage of employers discriminate across regions, differences in the percentages of Black Americans in the regional labor markets lead to greater Black-White earnings differentials as non-discriminatory firms face a greater supply of African American workers which depress black wages. Many economists studying Black earnings have noted the importance of regional differences in earnings based on quality differences in education and occupations across regions in explaining long term trends in Black-White earnings during the 1960s–80s. (See, for example, Smith and Welch 1977; Card and Kreuger 1992.) Reich (1981) provided a radical interpretation of racial differences in regional earnings based on class conflict. Reich argued that racial discrimination was utilized by capitalists to keep workers divided. As a result, greater racial discrimination would historically be associated with greater exploitation of workers. Here, the causal effect is greater discrimination leads to greater inequality. Empirically, he did find that greater Black-White earnings differences across SMSA’s (Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas) was associated with greater earnings inequality for all workers. In their widely cited paper on Black-White earnings differences, Juhn et al. (1991) find that long term trends in Black-White earnings differences are strongly related to nationwide changes in earnings inequality. Their method decomposes the earnings gap over time into 4 components: changes in measured characteristics, changes in the prices of measured characteristics, changes in unobserved characteristics, and changes in the prices of unobserved characteristics. This method allows them to examine how much the residual or unexplained black-white wage gap is due to changes in the overall distribution of earnings and or changes in changes in the black positions of income distribution. Unlike Reich, who interprets differences in income distribution as an indicator of class struggle, Juhn et al sought to explain the reversal of Black-White earnings convergence from the mid 1970s onwards in terms of changes in returns to education and skills in the labor market which are captured by the change in earnings distribution over time versus institutional changes such as affirmative action policies. They use Current Population Survey data from 1964 through 1988 to first estimate a differential and then to explain the causes behind the change in the Black-white earnings differentials. Couch and Daly (2002) update the Juhn et al results with data for the 1990s. They find that the black-white earnings differential to be narrowing in the 1990s as opposed to the stagnating in the 1980s. Again, using the same methodology as Juhn et al they find that changes in unobserved characteristics or residual earnings differences to continue to contribute to changes in the Black-White earnings differential. Rogers (1997) employs a variation of the Juhn et al decomposition to examine black-white earnings differences for men in the central city versus the suburbs. He finds that increasing labor market discrimination is more likely to have contributed to changes in the black-white earnings gap from 1979 to 1989 within the two metropolitan areas as opposed to changes in overall earnings inequality or unobserved productivity characteristics. Hirsch and Schumacher (1992) examine the effects of differences in the racial composition of jobs across regions on wage earnings across all workers. They use 1983 individual level CPS data including a racial “density” variable computed as the ratio of the number of Black workers to the total of Black and White workers in a region employed in an industry and occupational group from the 1980 Census. They find the density variable to be significant in lowering wage earnings for most workers. However, the density variable was not significantly related to Black-White earnings differences. Carlstrom and Rollow (1998) find that regional labor market differences continue to be important in explaining Black-White earnings differences. Using 1993 CPS (Current Population Survey) data, they find that much of the differences in earnings outside the Southern US can be attributed to differences in observable productivity related characteristics. However, within the South, differences in observable productivity related characteristics still leave considerable differences in earnings unexplained. More recently, economists have studied the impact of immigration on the labor market outcomes of native-born Blacks in the US by examining the effects of city differences in the percentage of immigrants on wages and employment. There is an ongoing debate on the magnitude of the effects of immigrants on native-born blacks. Card (2001) finds that immigrants have relatively small effects on wages and employment. Borjas et al. (2006) find a relatively large effect, estimating that a 10% increase in immigrants lowers wages of Black workers by 4%. Ottaviano and Peri (2008) find relatively small effects of immigrants on Black workers when immigrant labor is not easily substitutable for native-born workers. However, none of these studies have explicitly examined the effects of immigration on black earnings discrimination. Even with this rich background, there has been relatively little recent examination of explicitly examining regional differences in earnings discrimination. This paper’s primary objective is to examine the role labor market differences by city affect racial earnings discrimination as opposed to explaining the entire black-white earnings gap. The methodology employed in this paper is a two step process. It begins by calculating the difference in black earnings by city based solely on observed characteristics as a measure of discrimination. A city is operationally defined as an MSA or PMSA—Census defined Metropolitan Statistical Area and Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area) using the well known Oaxaca decomposition method (Oaxaca 1973; Oaxaca and Ransom 1994). Once these earnings differences have been estimated for each city, the differences are used as dependent variables. The paper’s primary focus will be to explain these city differences in earnings. Explanations suggested by the literature include: the percentage of the city labor force that is Black, the degree of city income inequality, the difference in industrial structure in each city, the size of city itself, and the percentage of city labor force that is foreign born.",1

According to some, privately initiated and controlled streams of resources made up for much of the government’s “failure,” especially at the federal level, to provide leadership and resources in the disaster’s aftermath (Chamlee-Wright, c.2006). Others lamented this situation, calling the billion dollar commitment a relatively small sum of money for the hyper-wealthy US philanthropic sector, and a poor, ineffective substitute for state-led reconstruction (Henry J. Kaiser Foundation, 2008). One commentary in the Chronicle of Philanthropy, 6 months after Katrina, noted that “just a trickle of foundation money has gone to grass-roots, advocacy, organizing, or other activists causes.” The author explained that the situation was unlikely to improve as donations were distributed to a relatively small number of community foundations by big national funds, and that these regional foundations, “have a poor record of supporting such causes.” Based on these observations the commentary concluded that: “foundations have failed to understand the level of devastation wrought by the hurricanes on needy families and African-Americans and other minorities in Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi” (Eisenberg 2006). A different essay appearing almost a year later called the foundation response a “catastrophic failure,” raising significant questions about whether the reliance of grassroots activists on foundations is a sustainable model for social movements (Flaherty 2006). Both essays suggest that foundation staff simply didn’t understand the degree of need, nor have respect for grassroots organizations. Both interpretations of organized philanthropy’s response to Katrina pay little attention to the specific effects foundations and NGOs have actually had in the Gulf South, however. Far from being benevolent providers of resources and facilitators of a value neutral recovery, foundations and the largest nonprofit organizations, often with the full cooperation of local, state and federal government, have played central roles in political struggles over the nature and meaning of the recovery process. This contradicts the two dominant narratives about civil society after Katrina. Foundations and NGOs were not saviors, as the first account puts it, nor have they been bumbling responders, ill-equipped to empower local recovery efforts as others have expected. Rather, foundations have specifically served as institutional traps to capture resources, mostly financial contributions made during the immediate aftermath of the hurricanes. National foundations have channeled funds through a relatively small number of favored regional foundations controlled by local elites who in turn have granted out tens of millions to specific political and economic projects serving the interests of particular parties, harming others. Foundation directors, executives, and staff have exercised power as key social change-managers in concert with elite allies across multiple levels of government and industry. Acknowledging that the post-Katrina Gulf South would see both a need and opportunity to rebuild not just the physical environment, but to rebuild the political-economy itself, foundations have intervened, very successfully, to manage the kind of reconstruction that has taken place. The role of organized philanthropy as a private-parallel government has been actively encouraged by federal, state, and city officials, many of whom have complex affiliations with large funds and non-profit organizations, as well as the business community. This all highlights shortcomings with scholarly analyses and popular narratives of the disaster that emphasize the “failures” of government alongside the seemingly independent role of civil society organizations. More so, it calls into questions theories of institutional autonomy and pluralist conceptions of power (Evans 1995; Nordlinger 1981; Skocpol 1979). Instead it points to an interdependent and often cooperative relationship between elites in government and foundations, steered by business leaders, all to carry out a commonly understood reconstruction project. The project is to create new opportunities for capitalist accumulation in previously public sectors of the regions political economy. A complementary way to understand the totality of foundation and NGO behavior in post-Katrina New Orleans is that they have taken the lead in the region’s growth coalition (Logan and Molotch 1987). Katrina provided an especially momentous set of opportunities and sum of resources for the city’s growth coalition to accelerate and even expand their longstanding plans for transforming real estate use values in working class, predominantly black neighborhoods into exchange values for private developers, corporate capital and large institutions like LSU, all in line with the desire to attract new desirable industries and affluent residents. That this reinvigorated growth machine bases its new urban fortunes on the overall shrinkage of the city after a disaster is no small irony. Displacement of the city’s working class African American majority, and significant transfers of land in their historic neighborhoods, especially around the Canal/Basin Street Corridor, lower Mid-City, and the “Big Four” public housing developments is the lynchpin of the growth coalitions post-Katrina platform. This paper analyzes the organization, grantmaking practices, function, ideology, and leadership of the largest and most influential national and regional foundations in post-Katrina New Orleans. By describing the three largest regional foundations, the two largest foundations established as a direct response to the Hurricane Katrina, and the most closely associated and well funded NGOs to these funds, I describe the overall role of philanthropy in the post-Katrina Gulf Coast.",25

Residents, organizers, and advocates from New Orleans, Chicago, and Atlanta rallied to greet him with housing justice messages. Bearing signs that read: “Housing is a Human Right,” “Bring the People Home,” “Let the People In,” and “Right to Return,” the group stood outside on a rainy day chanting, “No Justice, No Peace.” The post-disaster demolition of New Orleans’ “Big Four” public housing communities included over 5,000 homes at the St. Bernard, B.W. Cooper, C.J. Peete, and Lafitte communities. Those apartments, located in short stack buildings, generally withstood the hurricane and aftermath of flooding. Re-development has made way for new, mixed-income housing with fewer affordable apartments available at newly developed sites.Footnote 1
 The vast majority of those in New Orleans public housing before Hurricane Katrina were African American, as is 99 percent of those living in the new mixed income sites.Footnote 2 According to the Housing Authority of New Orleans (HANO), by June 2011, the total number of occupied, public housing units in New Orleans was 2,192.Footnote 3 The number of households living in public housing was dramatically fewer than pre-Katrina with an overall decrease of 2,956.Footnote 4 Moreover, only about half—1,512—of the “Big Four’s” pre-Katrina households have returned to New Orleans with approximately 7 per cent of the original families—just 238 households—moving into the redeveloped “Big Four” sites.Footnote 5 Problems with availability of and access to affordable housing have particularly burdened African American New Orleanians who, in large number, struggled to return home following hurricane Katrina. Indeed, approximately 100,000 African Americans have not moved back to New Orleans.Footnote 6
 This article reflects on the post-Katrina demolition of public housing communities in New Orleans and associated loss of affordable apartments with a focus on the Columbia Parc redevelopment. Some key issues regarding displacement, race, gender, and public housing policies are referenced throughout. A concluding discussion of advocacy efforts to frame housing as a human right highlights central, unmet movement demands: one for one replacement of demolished public housing apartments and prioritization of a broad, domestic housing guarantee for all.",3

Johnson,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Before discussing the various inequities in higher education funding, it may be helpful to provide a context so that a reader unfamiliar with New Orleans will gain an understanding of the landscape for higher education institutions, particularly in the aftermath of the levee breaches. There are eight postsecondary institutions in New Orleans which includes one community college and seven four-year institutions. Two of the four-year institutions are state-supported universities while three of the four-year institutions have a religious affiliation with various orders of the Catholic Church. In addition, three of the four-year institutions serve predominantly African American populations while the others have a predominantly White student enrollment. The state-supported community college has the most diverse racial composition of students of all of the higher education institutions in Orleans parish. A brief overview of each institution follows. While most of the higher education institutions in New Orleans did not resume classes until January 2006, the University of New Orleans (UNO) began offering classes during the first week of October 2005 in an attempt to serve the 17,000 students that were enrolled for fall 2005. The main campus of UNO, a member institution of the Louisiana State University system, is located on the site of a former naval air station situated on the southern shore of Lake Pontchartrain. Only the buildings adjacent to the main campus entrances on Leon C. Simon Boulevard received minimal flood damage. The rest of the campus facilities were uninhabitable due to excessive mold that grew at exponential rates because of the extreme humidity and lack of air conditioning. The mold infestation created conditions that required several buildings on the state-supported campus to be remediated prior to the university receiving approval from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to allow employees and students to return to campus. Consequently, the majority of classes offered by UNO in fall 2006 were online with a small percentage held at satellite locations in neighboring parishes. These satellite locations provided cramped office and classroom space and computer access for a limited number of faculty, staff and students who were able to return to their homes in adjacent parishes. Our Lady of Holy Cross College (OLHCC), affiliated with the Marianites of the Holy Cross Catholic order, is situated on the West Bank of the Mississippi River. The campus was not flooded because all of the levee breaches were on the East Side of the River. After the storm, OLHCC provided food and lodging for the community as it served as a formal command post and operations base for over 2,500 military personnel and government officials. Once the immediate needs of the community were addressed, OLHCC was able to resume classes for its student population of less than 1,000 students. The three historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in New Orleans (Dillard, SUNO and XULA) were located in close proximity to canals that overflowed or levees that were breached and resulted in these campuses being inundated with storm water. Dillard University, served a population of approximately 2,200 students, is affiliated with the United Church of Christ and United Methodist Church. Situated within 2 miles of Lake Pontchartrain, Dillard is located less than 1 mile from the London Avenue Canal, which had four levee breaches, resulting in 8 ft of water flooding the campus and remaining stagnant for several weeks. Moreover, three residence halls caught on fire and were destroyed while two others were demolished because of their rapidly deteriorating conditions (Hamilton 2006). Southern University at New Orleans (SUNO) is located just south of Lake Pontchartrain and west of the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal which connects the Lake to the Mississippi River. While the levees surrounding SUNO were not breached, there were five breaches on the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal that submerged the campus in 4–11 ft of water (Hamilton 2006). SUNO is located less than one-half mile from the campus of UNO and is a state-supported institution that is governed by the Southern University System. Prior to the storm, SUNO served a student population of approximately 2,500 students. While Xavier University of Louisiana (XULA), located close to downtown New Orleans, did not experience a levee breach, it was the overflow of the Washington Avenue Canal that caused flooding to the lower levels of campus buildings. Many of the buildings at XULA have entrances that are raised approximately 3 ft from the ground. Because of the raised structure, the institution was able to resume classes in January 2006 with some staff and faculty housed in trailers on the campus and students residing on upper levels of residence halls. XULA is the only black Catholic institution in the United States and served a pre-Katrina population of 4,000 students. In addition, XULA is one of only two pharmacy schools in Louisiana and is recognized nationally for the number of baccalaureate graduates who annually enter medical school. Loyola University New Orleans, a Jesuit institution, enrolled approximately 4,500 students before Katrina. The university is located in the section of New Orleans referred to as the ‘Uptown’ area of New Orleans. The President of Loyola, Father Kevin Wildes, did not leave the campus during Katrina and reported that the university received minimal flooding which was not atypical of a heavy rainstorm in New Orleans. Located literally next to Loyola is Tulane University. The main campus of Tulane in the Uptown area enrolled approximately 11,500 students prior to the storm in both undergraduate and graduate degree programs. Tulane’s main campus received minimal flooding but its downtown campus comprising the medical school and hospital received substantial flooding. Prior to the landfall of Katrina, Tulane had the distinction of being the largest private employer in New Orleans. Delgado Community College is located in the ‘Mid-City’ section of New Orleans. Before the landfall of Katrina, Delgado served over 17,000 students from New Orleans and surrounding parishes at its four locations. However, it was the City Park location in Mid-City that provided educational offerings to over 60% of the enrolled students at Delgado. The West Bank location served 23% of the population and the North Shore location (located on the northern shore of Lake Pontchartrain) served 11%. The nursing school in downtown New Orleans served 6% of the Delgado population. Delgado is situated between the London Avenue Canal and 17th Street Canal and several buildings were destroyed because of the flooding incurred as a result of breaches of both levees. Damage estimates varied widely across the institutions from $95 million to $650 million with some institutions providing estimates based solely on damage to physical facilities while others considered the loss of students and research expenditures when calculating losses. Initially, Tulane cited damages of $200 million but subsequently increased their projected damages in excess of $650 million. It was unclear if Tulane included a loss of one-third of the student population and $17 million in research funding in the anticipated costs for total damage to the institution (Mangan 2006; Marcus 2007; “Tulane University announces cutbacks” 2005). Due to the heavy flooding experienced by the three HBCUs, these campuses had capital damages that ranged from $95 to $400 million. Specifically, the estimated damages to the physical facilities and structures, coupled with the loss of tuition, were $400 million for Dillard, $350 million for SUNO and $95–$100 million for XULA (Hamilton 2006). Dillard estimated that one-quarter of its student population would return in January 2006 while XULA projected 2,800 of 4,100 students would re-enroll (Fogg et al. 2006). When the official numbers were released in spring 2006, the enrollment of all institutions in NOLA decreased with Dillard experiencing the largest decrease at 50%, XULA had a 25% drop in enrollment, Tulane a 24% decline and Delgado and SUNO experienced a decrease of 19 and 17%, respectively (Mangan 2006). The Federal Emergency Management Assistance (FEMA) Agency provided partial reimbursement for repairs related to Katrina damage but did not provide any assistance with salary losses. While FEMA provided financial resources to assist with clean-up and recovery efforts there were different rules imposed on state-supported versus private institutions. For example, SUNO received over 400 trailers to house employees and students as well as classroom and campus offices through a streamlined process because of its status as a public university (Fogg et al. 2006). In contrast, the private colleges often cited the plethora of paperwork necessary to negotiate the FEMA bureaucracy may not have been worth the time and effort (Hamilton 2006). To further exacerbate the financial burden that institutions experienced in Katrina’s aftermath, the HBCUs did not have enough insurance to cover the projected estimates to repair their campuses. Additionally, the HBCUs did not have business interruption insurance coverage, due to the expensive premiums, which could have provided critical financial resources post-Katrina (Hamilton 2006). When higher education institutions in New Orleans resumed classes on their physical campuses in January 2006, two historically black institutions, SUNO and Dillard, were unable to do so because of the extensive flooding of their campuses. Dillard University held classes for 1,100 students at the downtown Hilton Riverside which also served as the temporary lodging quarters for 800 students and occupied 30% of the hotel’s rooms (Fogg et al. 2006). Likewise, SUNO attempted to establish hotel lodging but eventually set up a makeshift community of trailers on a 38 acre site north of their flooded campus on the shore of Lake Pontchartrain. This temporary campus was less than a quarter mile from the flooded SUNO campus. While SUNO served a post-Katrina population that was 63% smaller, the institution experienced its largest increase in enrollment in its history in fall 2008 (Mangan 2008). Three years after Katrina, the low-lying SUNO campus occupied only 40% of its campus operations in 6 buildings with no street level floors being used because of the mold damage and potential for flooding during a typical New Orleans rainstorm (Pope 2008). Classes and the remainder of the operations remained in trailers north of the campus as the State of Louisiana and FEMA came to resolution in August 2009 to renovate the original site and rebuild new structures on higher ground at the current location of the temporary campus on the southern shore of the Lake. Loyola, Tulane, XULA and Delgado were able to resume classes on their campuses in spring 2006 after making arrangements for lodging for faculty, staff and students. For instance, Tulane rented a cruise ship to provide housing for students and reserved space in several downtown buildings for faculty and staff to reside. Other institutions allowed FEMA trailers to be placed on campus property so employees and students would have lodging. Today, all of the institutions in New Orleans have attained 85 to 90% of pre-Katrina enrollments. This overview of the higher education landscape in New Orleans pre- and post-Katrina provides the context to understand the impact of decisions that were made after the crisis as institutions struggled to rebuild their campuses both literally and figuratively.",2

As such, it is studied and applied across disciplines: anthropology, communication studies, comparative literature, gender studies, and race studies, among others. This interdisciplinarity has been characterized as a “small revolution” where performance operates as a window into creating, understanding, and transforming culture (Madison and Hamera 2006, xii). Dwight Conquergood provides a clear map for doing this work in the academy and beyond, emphasizing performance as both “a pragmatics of inquiry” and “a tactics of intervention” (2002, 152). As a mode of inquiry, performance suggests a research method that “privileges the body as a site of knowing” where researchers situate their own “experiencing bodies” in the particular times and places they study (Conquergood 1991, 180). As an intervention, performance suggests “an alternative space of struggle,” a radical form of representing research that calls attention to the lived experience of the bodies being studied (Conquergood 2002, 152). Performing one’s research displays a commitment to authentic representations of cultural practices, especially when those practices are comprised of performing bodies. Consider the redundant ways in which New Orleans culture and the bodies that populate that culture appeared to us in the months following Hurricane Katrina. Glenda Dicker/sun observed the makings of a “blockbuster film” staged on television with “the rolling, roiling, repetitive pictures of Black suffering … used as mise-en-scène for the ‘real’ human-interest stories” (2005, 615). National and local media alike directed their attention to the white middle-class response to Mayor Ray Nagin’s 2006 Martin Luther King Day address in which he called for the rebuilding of a “chocolate New Orleans.” Nagin, of course, was referring to Parliament’s 1975 Chocolate City album and the city’s pre-Katrina population as a majority African American city. Yet as Christopher Dunn observes, defining a “place in terms of race” exposes its identity to “competing characterizations:” New Orleans as African, New Orleans as European, or New Orleans as Creole (2007, 848–49). For Conquergood, the scholar is not immune from the “fabricated, invented, imagined, constructed nature of human realities” (1989, 83). Even while we examine the construction and re-construction of culture, we rely on our own “poetics” to build a “scholarly persona” who takes up the “persuasive telling of a story about the stories one has witnessed and lived” (Conquergood 1989, 83). The act of research is thus tied up in a struggle to assert or maintain power: of authenticity, of appropriation, and of representation. Moreover, the study of culture implies a study of ideology, where bodies are situated at a “site of struggle where competing interests intersect, and different viewpoints and voices get articulated” (Conquergood 1989, 84). At the moment of representing these struggles, scholars face the ethical dilemma of how to capture the authentic experiences of those observed while also acknowledging their own stakes in the ideological conflict. Performance, especially the performance of scholarship as a mode of representation, suggests one direction. Performance effectively illustrates culture as “kinesis,” in persistent motion and reinvention. Representing research through performance seeks to portray this restlessness, using scholar’s bodies to display what has been studied: “culture in motion, ideas in play, hierarchies unsettled” (Conquergood 1995, 138). A central challenge in performing research lies in the position a scholar takes in representing the Other. How might a performance of others’ lived experience negotiate the dual tensions between detachment from and commitment to, between identifying with and distancing from the Other (Conquergood 1985)? Drawing on Mikhail Bakhtin’s concept of dialogue, Conquergood calls for a “dialogical performance” of research, marked by a “conversation” between “different voices, world views, value systems, and beliefs” (1985, 9). Dialogical performance is committed to raising questions and sparking debate, juxtaposing the identity of the Other alongside the identity of the researcher. It precariously balances between the two, recognizing the moral dilemma inherent in the extremes that were clearly on display following Hurricane Katrina. In welcoming displaced New Orleanians to the Houston Astrodome as an improvement on their pre-flooded homes, Barbara Bush performed an oversimplified identification with the Other. The media loop of a “teeming mass” of “predatory looters, packing pistols and raping women” was a performance that fetishized the Other’s difference (Dicker/sun 2005, 615). The profitable disaster tours that still make regularly scheduled stops in the Lower Ninth Ward perform a naïve commitment to the Other’s experience. And politicians and media pundits who wonder aloud why New Orleanians do not possess the same self-reliance as their neighbors in Iowa, Texas, or even other Gulf Coast states perform a complete detachment from the Other (Conquergood 1985). In contrast, dialogical performance is characterized both by reflexivity (a self-critique of one’s position in relation to the Other) and attentiveness to the other. Ultimately, performing research as dialogue pursues a “sensuous immediacy and empathic leap” with the Other, while reminding the audience that performance is itself an intentional and ideological construction of the scholar (Conquergood 1985, 10). It is difficult to conceive of post-Katrina scholarship outside the motive of a public good. Certainly that motive existed, even if latently, within the hundreds of cultural and political critiques that followed the successive failures of evacuation plans, federally constructed levees, rescue efforts, and rebuilding campaigns in New Orleans. A small sampling of the titles of such academic work suggest as much: “Hurricane Katrina: Was there a political economy of death?” (Price 2008), “Why Katrina’s victims aren’t refugees: musings on a dirty word” (Masquelier 2006), “Katrina: Acting black/playing blackness” (Dicker/sun 2005). Recognizing that academic critique often is grounded already in progressive values such as social justice, public scholarship pushes the academy toward hope as a practice that reconciles the tension between skepticism and desire for substantive change (Ellison 2010.). Public scholarship connects research practices to the public good with the explicit goal of producing knowledge that concretely benefits a designated community, and public scholars do not exchange their critical lenses or methods for community service. Instead, they “negotiate the tension between hope and opposition, desire and critique, feeling and the labor of analyzing feeling” for the purpose of collaborating with communities to produce usable knowledge (Ellison 2010, 2). Approaching post-Katrina New Orleans from the perspective of public scholarship connects “plausible hope with the emerging economies of cultural work” (Ellison 2010, 3). The “Performance and New Orleans” project is an example of such work.",

Most of the community came to New Orleans as refugees from the Vietnam War, and as a group they have been Catholic and conservative. Located in a tight-knit section of New Orleans East, the Vietnamese community raised their profile through post-Katrina efforts to bring back their neighborhood in the first months after the storm. Shortly after, organizers turned their energy to fighting a landfill project planned nearby. These grassroots protests developed into political power, helping to elect Anh “Joseph” Cao in December 2008 as the nation’s first Vietnamese-American congressman. The U.S. Vietnamese population, with its anticommunist roots and “model minority” status, may not seem at first likely to be major players in the story of progressive organizing in New Orleans post-Katrina. The media played on these stereotypes in their coverage of the New Orleans Vietnamese community’s response to the storm. As journalist and scholar Eric Tang noted, Local and national presses were thus quick to enlist the Vietnamese as symbols of survival amid despair…. The headlines and articles insisted on more optimistic themes: “We will rebuild;” “We never expected anything from government;” “We’ve been through worse.” Thus, from Katrina’s toxic floodwaters resurfaced the model minority, a much-needed elixir for those unable to stomach the hard truths coming from the regions’ hardest hit Black communities (Tang 2006). But the city’s Vietnamese community has defied expectations and dodged prejudices. As Tang reflected, “The nuanced political and racial location that Vietnamese Americans of New Orleans occupy…doesn’t quite conform to traditional left-to-right political ideologies.” In fact, the Vietnamese community here has been among the reliable supporters of a range of issues, from the campaign to close the Youth Study Center, a notorious youth prison, to environmental justice activism. As Tang described, Indeed, the Vietnamese Americans of New Orleans pride themselves on self-reliance, yet they also demand government accountability, especially when confronted with injustice. They seek to advance themselves politically and economically, yet seem to do so without sacrificing solidarity with other racial groups, particularly neighboring African Americans. Nowhere were these values more clearly on display than in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Less than 6 weeks after the storm, the Vietnamese Americans of New Orleans East returned to their homes, doing so over the objection of local and federal officials. Their leader was Father Nguyen The Vien, a political firebrand and head of Mary Queen of Vietnam church. “Before the storm, I guess you could call us libertarians,” Father Vien said. “Our attitude toward government was: ”you don’t bother us, we won’t bother you.“ But Katrina changed all that. We had a responsibility to speak out.” And so with each step of the rebuilding process, the priest and his congregation battled those who stymied their efforts: foot-dragging FEMA officials, The Waste Management Corporation that sought to dump Katrina debris in their backyard, city leaders all-too-eager to sell off New Orleans East to developers. Through it all, the priest was surrounded by a coterie of experienced community organizers, policy wonks and attorneys.Footnote 3
 One of the major initiatives in this community is the Vietnamese-American Young Leaders Association (VAYLA), which has organized Vietnamese youth along several issues, especially education, and has collaborated closely with other youth groups in the city, including Young Adults Striving for Success, Fyre Youth Squad, and ReThink. The groups have formed a youth organizing collaborative to work together on arts and cultural efforts, such as spoken word events and Through the Youth Lens, a youth photography project. They are also committed to collaborative organizing through a series of youth convenings, aimed at bringing together young people in the city as a grassroots political force that crosses traditional barriers of race, background, and neighborhood.",

Furthermore, when analyzed in more detail, the unemployment figures told a bleaker picture of labor markets. A racial decomposition of unemployment showed the unemployment rate among Whites was 8.1%, but among Blacks it was nearly twice as high at 15.2% (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2011a, b). And although the idea of a double-dip recession had lost appeal with the media, for the economists attending the conference, the threat of this scenario remained as real as ever. In the months following the conference, these fears seemed to be materializing, as the unemployment numbers began a slow rise once again. On the political front, the conference was called at a time when the reactionary rhetoric of the Tea Party movement, budget deficit fear mongering, and veiled racist nationalism swept the airwaves. In other words, it was election season. The message of “tightening our belts” struck a chord with those disenchanted with the government response to the biggest economic crisis since the Great Depression, the so-called “Great Recession.” Conservative libertarianism dominated the politics of the Republican Party whose takeover of Congress in the upcoming elections was becoming increasingly certain. While the GOP was able to harness this right-wing populism to great success, the Democratic party and other progressive voices were either unable or unwilling to effectively counter-message the government reduction slogans of the Tea Party. The landmark Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, allowing corporations to make undisclosed donations to 501(c)(4) organizations (non-profit lobbying groups), opened the floodgates for corporately-financed campaign ads through non-profits like Citizens United, Americans for Prosperity, and the U.S.Chamber of Commerce (US Supreme Court 2010). This, in addition to the national Tea Party organizations (funded by the likes of conservartives Dick Armey, Sal Russo, and Howard Kaloogian), provided a manufactured grassroots movement around fiscal conservatism. These ideas were often presented against a backdrop of hatred of immigrants and Muslims (Polman 2010). These movements also managed to distort history to their advantage. In addition to lending Ronald Reagan a legacy of slashing deficits 30 years prior, they also managed to shift blame for the 2008 bailout of the financial system from George W. Bush to Barack Obama (Cooper 2010). The war in Afghanistan was called Obama’s war by Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele, despite the fact that it had started 7 years prior to Obama’s term as president (Seifert 2010). America, it appeared, had become swept up in a collective amnesia, frenetically looking at the same unsuccessful tax plans instituted only 5 years prior with a significant degree of favor. The question of the budget was not one of whether to cut, but rather what to cut. In response, the Chicago Political Economy Group in conjunction with the Howard University organized this conference to give a venue to the progressive voices in economics and political science. The purpose of the conference was not only to consider short-term policy prescriptions to alleviate the burden of mass unemployment, but also long-term structural changes to mitigate future economic crises. The conference sought a fiscal policy expansion of Keynesian and Marxist principles, particularly in terms of employment. At the heart of these policies was the radical restructuring of labor markets to accommodate changes in the manufacturing and energy sectors, sharply opposing many of the fiscal and monetary policy approaches to the Great Recession such as the recent bailouts in the financial sector. While the conference was aimed primarily at policy prescriptions for the present institutional system, it also was aimed at the mass overhaul of the capitalist system. For instance, members of the Progressive Labor Party and other attendees gave reference to growing wealth gap across race, gender and other social divisions. Specifically, there was a call for a massive restructuring of the United States’ economic system, stating that capitalism serves to continue a system of booms and busts that most negatively impacts working class Americans. This paper summarizes the ideas presented at the conference, including a bill presented by Representative John Conyers (D-MI). In addition to a brief literature review of the papers and presentations discussed and introduced by the speakers, a summary matrix was developed to better present both the common elements and points of departure of the various policy prescriptions offered. The challenges to these policy options, both on the legislative floor and in the court of public opinion are considered and summarized",

The official unemployment rate hovered around the double-digit mark for nearly 2 years. Official unemployment has dipped some in 2011. Nonetheless, in April 2011, the number of officially unemployed workers was 13.7 million, 9% of the labor force.Footnote 1 An additional 15.1 million workers, the hidden unemployed, either wanted full-time work but were forced to work part-time or wanted jobs but were not looking for them due to such reasons as discouragement or lack of child care or transportation. Add to this the working poor, an estimated 16.4 million persons earning less than the poverty level for a family of four for year-round, full-time work.Footnote 2 Thus, 45 million people were unemployed or underemployed (Table 1). Moreover, the numbers of people afflicted by unemployment multiply when the families of jobless workers are included Nearly one in four people (including children) lived in a family in which at least one member was unemployed at some time during 2009 (CBO 2010). Official unemployment for African Americans, consistently the highest for any ethnic group except Native Americans, was 16.1% (April 2011). Thus, after a multi-billion dollar federal stimulus (the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 or ARRA), the job crisis continues, and unemployment continues to take its heavy toll. In fact, in April 2011, the unemployment rate was 11% higher than in February 2009 when the stimulus was enacted (9.0% compared to 8.1%). In searching for ways to end the current employment crisis, it is important to bear in mind that unemployment is a chronic problem, particularly for certain population groups. Indeed, in 2000, when official unemployment was 4%, the lowest in over 30 years, 13 million people or 9% of the labor force were either the official or the hidden unemployed. In that year nearly 16 million people or 16.8% of full-time, full-year workers were earning less than the official poverty level for a family of four. And there were many more persons wanting work than there were job vacancies, 3.5 officially unemployed persons for every available job. It is thus important to think in terms of approaches to the current, acute problem that would begin to address the chronic shortage of living-wage jobs as well. An unemployment crisis is hardly new to the African American community. In 2000, when official unemployment was at a 40-year low, 8.2% of African Americans were officially unemployed. This was slightly higher than the unemployment rate for the total labor force in February 2009—when unemployment was considered sufficiently high for Congress to enact the $787 billion stimulus (ARRA). It is important to note that these official unemployment statistics are of the civilian, non-institutional population. If the large number of incarcerated black men were included among the jobless, the unemployment rate of black males, aged 22 to 30 would have been nearly one-third in 2000, instead of just under one-fourth (Western 2006). The purpose of this paper is to identify some political strategies for reducing crisis and chronic unemployment. Strategies, of course, are shaped by policy and program goals. Thus, although these are not the subject of this paper, it is important to detour briefly for the purpose of describing the policies for which these political strategies are proposed.",2
39.0,1.0,The Review of Black Political Economy,20 January 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12114-011-9125-z,"Jobs and Freedom Now! Functional Finance, Full Employment, and the Freedom Budget",March 2012,Mathew Forstater,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"2011 marks the 45th anniversary of the “Freedom Budget,” a policy program developed by A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin, working with New Deal Keynesian economists such as Leon H. Keyserling, former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors in the Truman Administration. Randolph presented the proposal at the 1966 White House conference “To Fulfill these Rights,” calling for a government-sponsored job guarantee for those ready and willing to work, a guaranteed income for those who cannot or should not be working, and an increase in the minimum wage to lift the working poor and their families out of poverty (A. Philip Randolph Institute 1966). The two main (and complementary) components of the Randolph-Rustin proposal for full employment and the job guarantee, encompassed in the term public service employment, were government as “employer of last resort” and public works: “We should be demanding immediate passage of an accelerated public works program” (Rustin 1971 [1965], p. 130). While accepting the basic Keynesian macroeconomic analysis that unemployment can be an aggregate problem due to lack of effective demand, Rustin and company also took the view that generic demand stimulus would not address the unemployment problem in toto. In addition to Keynesian unemployment there is also structural unemployment, a catch-phrase meant to include unemployment due to structural and technological change. A campaign to address structural unemployment would have to go beyond conventional fiscal stimulus: the private sector would never provide enough jobs, even when being pumped up by government expenditure. True full employment and poverty-reduction can be achieved “only when the government takes responsibility of creating work for those whom the private sector can no longer use” (Rustin 1971 [1968], p. 235): [T]he government becomes the employer of first and last resort for the hard-core poor…Neither individuals nor the private sector of the economy has, or can take, responsibility for full employment in American society. This is the responsibility of all segments of the society and thus, finally, of the government. (Rustin 1971 [1968], p. 235) In addition, the thinkers working around the Randolph Institute saw that a WPA-style program could not only create jobs, but produce goods and services that could address other important needs, such as increased community and social services and infrastructure creation and revitalization. The program thus rejected the “culture of poverty” and “human capital” approaches gaining followers at the time, insisting instead that jobs must come first, with training coming on-the-job: We are going to have to have public works programs to put these people back to work and to do it without a lot of talk about pre-training. These people don’t have to be pre-trained. All they need to know is that there are jobs. John Dewey said that a man learns by doing. I want to go Dewey one better: we must put these people to work learning while doing, and while being paid. In World War II we did not ask if people were too black, or too old, or too young, or too stupid to work. We simply said to them this is a hammer, this is a tool, this is a drill. We built factories and sent these people into the factories. We paid them extraordinarily good wages and in 2 months they created the miracle of making planes that flew. We can find a peacetime method for doing this—public works for schools, hospitals, psychiatric clinics, new modes of transportation, of cleaning the air, of cleaning the rivers. All these improvements would benefit not only the poor but also the affluent. (Rustin 1971 [1968], p. 236) Rustin saw public service employment as providing a number of benefits in addition to job creation and increased public works and social services. First, he viewed the program as resulting in a reduction in both crime and government spending on the poor and unemployed: The way things are now we are twice damned. We are paying $15 billion a year for the support and misdeeds of those who cannot find work and end up in prison or on welfare. If they are provided with work and improve the economy, then we have additional growth plus the $15 billion we are now paying for keeping them on welfare and in jail. (Rustin 1971 [1968], p. 237) Secondly, he viewed the program as good for everyone, Black and white, rich and poor. The job guarantee would be for everyone (i.e., no means tests), regardless of race, and thus would benefit poor whites and others. Furthermore, full employment benefits everyone, even business, whose sales and profits are supported by increased incomes and spending: But I want to assure businessmen that the people who benefit from the programs are not going to sit on the money when they get it. They are going to act like Americans. They are going to buy all the junk that is advertised, thereby raising the GNP, raising the economic production and growth of the country, and fundamentally adding to its economic stability. (Rustin 1971 [1968], p. 237) While the Freedom Budget was never passed, or even officially introduced as legislation, the momentum eventually contributed to discussions within the Congressional Black Caucus that led to the introduction of a new full employment bill by African American Congressman Augustus F. Hawkins (D-CA) in the early 1970s. The original bill included a job guarantee, the creation of a Job Guarantee Office, a Standby Job Corps, and the changing of the name of the United States Employment Service to the United States Full Employment Service (see Hawkins 1975). The bill went through several iterations and name changes until it finally passed in 1978 as the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act, stripped of the job guarantee. Randolph, founding President of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, and Rustin had previously worked along-side the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in organizing the 1963 March on Washington, the full, official name of course which was the “March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.” The two men had also led the March on Washington Movement (MOWM) of the 1940s that resulted in then-President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s Executive Order 8802, which created the Fair Employment Practice Committee (FEPC). During the same period as the Freedom Budget was issued, Dr. King was increasingly including similar themes in his writings and speeches, proposing a federally-guaranteed job creation program as the centerpiece of both his “economic bill of rights” (an idea revived from FDR) and his “Poor People’s Campaign” (King 1986 [1968], p. 67; see also Forstater 2002). But King was only one—albeit an extremely important one—of a host of African American leaders and organizations in the sixties and seventies to support not only full employment in general but the specific idea that “government… become an employer of last resort” (King 1971 [1963], p. 32). “This would guarantee a job to all people who want to work and are able to work…It would mean creating certain public-service jobs” (King 1986 [1968], p. 67). This notion in one form or another was embraced by virtually all the most prominent African American organizations, with the list of African American leaders and organizations supporting the policy encompassing a wide swath of the political spectrum (Forstater 2007). Among those supporting true full employment and the job guarantee were U.S. Rep. John J. Conyers, Jr. (D-MI), James Farmer, Charles V. Hamilton, Bernard Anderson, and Robert S. Browne, the founder of the Black Economic Research Center (BERC) and the Review of Black Political Economy. Browne was also a charter founder of the Caucus of Black Economists, a predecessor of the National Economic Association (NEA; Alexis, Spratlen, and Wilson 2008). To assist him in formulating a new full employment bill that would address the limitations of the 1946 Employment Act, Rep. Hawkins organized a small working group in 1972 that included Robert S. Browne and Bernard Anderson, among others (Anderson 2008): Robert Browne helped shape and reinforce Mr. Hawkins’ thinking about full employment, and how to make the Bill a tool for addressing black joblessness. He emphasized that the declaration of policy would mean little if not accompanied by specific measures to guide policy makers toward reaching the goal. Browne urged specific language in the Bill to spell out how the government would act as the employer of last resort. (Anderson 2008, p. 95) Also of note, Coretta Scott King was very involved in the struggle for full employment during the 1970s, when she was Co-Chair of both the National Committee for Full Employment and the Full Employment Action Council. More recently, a job guarantee has been embraced and supported by William Julius Wilson (1996), Ronald B. Mincy (1994), Marable (1997), the National Urban League (1996), Tyner (1994), and the Black Radical Congress (1998). In the context of the current and ongoing crisis of the 2007-onward “Great [i.e., Terrible] Recession,” NEA Past-President William A. Darity, Jr., in an article in the Review of Black Political Economy, has revived the proposal that the federal government should guarantee a job for all by serving as the employer of last resort (Darity 2010). Job creation and public investment have tremendous potential social and economic benefits, and many have argued that such programs would essentially ‘pay for themselves’ and produce benefits that exceed their costs. Nevertheless, it is clear that one of the primary roadblocks in the way of a true full employment policy regards public perceptions concerning the perceived cost, and the impact on the government budget and the national debt. It would serve those concerned about unemployment well to review the arguments surrounding deficit spending, the national debt, and government ‘solvency’.",1

But what was it about FDR and the New Deal that these commentators thought the Obama administration should emulate? The only clear answer at the time seemed to be the New Deal’s boldness. Ironically, though, in the policy debate that attracted the most attention at the time—the design of an economic stimulus plan—these economists expressed a decidedly mixed judgment of the Roosevelt administration’s performance. They praised Roosevelt for loosening the federal government’s purse strings, but they also criticized him for not spending enough to achieve a complete economic recovery. That did not occur, they noted, until World War II generated a far more massive burst of federal spending. Viewed from this perspective, the New Deal example invoked by progressive commentators was mainly negative. The Obama administration was encouraged to be less timid than the Roosevelt administration in spending money to boost aggregate demand (Krugman 2008a; b; Kuttner2008a, b; Blim 2008). Anyone with a passing familiarity with Keynesian economics and the history of the New Deal can appreciate the force of this advice. The stimulus package the Obama administration proposed and Congress enacted in February 2009 does appear in retrospect to have been too small. As the two-year initiative drew to a close at the end of 2010, the nation’s unemployment rate was about 1 1/2 percentage points higher than it was when the stimulus was enacted. Still, this paper makes a different point—that progressive economists overlooked a more important lesson the New Deal can teach us about stimulus economics. That lesson concerns the issue of how stimulus dollars should be spent during a recession rather than how large the stimulus should be. While it undoubtedly is true that the Roosevelt Administration could have achieved a quicker recovery from the Great Depression if it had been willing to run larger budget deficits, the more important lesson progressives should take away from the New Deal experience is that the way stimulus dollars are spent may be more important than the size of the stimulus package. What the New Dealers showed us is what a progressive fiscal stimulus should look like. How large the stimulus should be is a separate question and one that depends far more than progressive economists have recognized on how the stimulus spending is structured. Indeed, if President Obama and Congressional Democrats had adopted the “New Deal strategy” of direct job creation in responding to the “Great Recession,” they could have driven the unemployment rate down to pre-recession levels almost immediately while providing a larger and more effective fiscal boost to the private sector with a smaller stimulus than the one actually enacted in February 2009. In other words, this paper argues that the problem with the federal government’s response to the Great Recession mainly concerns the way stimulus dollars have been spent rather than the size of the stimulus. The Great Depression was the most severe economic contraction in United States history. In 1929 the country’s GDP was $8389 per capita expressed in 2009 dollars. The average unemployment rate was 3.2%. Four years later, per capita GDP had fallen to $5975, and the unemployment rate had risen to 25.2%. If only non-farm employees are counted, unemployment rose from 5.3% in 1929 to 36.3% in 1932. In a total civilian labor force of just over 50 million in 1932, approximately 12 million were jobless (Bureau of the Census 1975, pp. 232, Series 125; 126, Series 1, 9). Herbert Hoover was President of the United States during the entire 44 month economic contraction that followed the 1929 stock market crash. Despite his reputation today as a diehard conservative, Hoover was not a free-market ideologue. He considered laissez-faire a doctrine of the past and believed that public works spending could and should be used to reduce unemployment in periods of economic contraction; however, he argued that the paramount need in responding to the Great Depression was to restore business confidence, and this led him to resist the kind of fiscal policies that could have funded a large public works initiative. Instead, Hoover’s response to mass joblessness was to promote businesses expansion while encouraging voluntary action to provide for the relief needs of the population. Consistent with this view, he maintained that the relief challenge could and should be met by self-help initiatives organized at the local level. Hoover expressed his views on this subject in the following terms. This is not an issue as to whether people shall go hungry or cold in the United States. It is solely a question of the best method by which hunger and cold shall be prevented. It is a question as to whether the American people, on one hand, will maintain the spirit of charity and mutual self- help through voluntary giving and the responsibility of local government, as distinguished, on the other hand, from appropriations of the Federal Treasury for such purposes. . . . The basis of successful relief in national distress is to mobilize and organize the infinite number of agencies of self-help in the community. That has been the American way of relieving distress among our own people, and the country is successfully meeting its problem in the American way today (Charles 1963, 9–10). State and local governments, along with private relief agencies, did try to respond to the needs of the unemployed, but they were overwhelmed by the magnitude of the task. Total public and private relief expenditures in 120 urban areas (containing approximately one third of the nation’s entire population) increased over 700% between 1929 and 1932, from $43.7 million to $308.2 million (Geddes 1937, 29–31). In real terms, the increase was even greater, since average prices declined over 20% during the period. At the same time that claims on relief systems were mushrooming, public resources were shrinking and/or taking a larger bite out of taxpayer income. Real federal tax receipts fell 37% between 1929 and 1932 (Bureau of the Census 1975, 1104, Series Y335–Y338). Since state and local government revenue was derived mainly from taxes on property rather than income and excise taxes, state and local government receipts were more stable, actually increasing in real terms between 1927 and 1932 by 23% (Ibid., 1126, Series Y655 and 224, Series F5); however, this meant the effective state and local tax burden rose dramatically, measured against either personal income or declining real property values. The same forces had an even greater effect on the ability of private charities to raise funds for relief purposes, as evidenced by their declining relative share of all relief spending between 1929 and 1932 (Geddes 1937, 31). In addition to suffering fiscal strain, the nation’s public relief system also was ill-suited to the task of relieving victims of mass unemployment. Public assistance law in the United States prior to the 1930s was based on the English poor law regime. It was designed to distinguish the deserving from the undeserving poor, to stigmatize all the poor as a means of discouraging dependency, and to dispense aid in meager amounts in order to minimize program costs. The system was predicated on the assumption that the able-bodied poor generally were at fault for their own condition and accordingly should be denied aid except when there was good reason to believe that their joblessness was genuinely involuntary. In the latter case, their willingness to work should be tested by requiring them to perform unpleasant labor. Since the purpose of this work was to test the applicant’s willingness to work rather to supply the applicant with work, there was no necessary relationship between the amount of work required and the amount of aid dispensed. It also was common to require aid recipients to perform required labor in public to add an element of humiliation to its deterrent effect. Aid recipients were commonly termed “paupers”—both as a formal statutory designation and in common usage—and in many jurisdictions they were required to execute formal declarations of destitution and incapacity which were generally referred to as “pauper’s oaths.” Poor law administrators were commonly called ‘poor masters” or “overseers of the poor,” designations with a long history in the poor law but also redolent of associations with slavery (Burns and Williams 1941, 11–20). The system was generally despised by the unemployed because of its unsympathetic and demeaning treatment of applicants for relief. With the onset of the modern business cycle in the second half of the 19th century, this system began to be supplemented during recessions with ad-hoc efforts by public officials to provide emergency relief to the unemployed in the form of temporary work assignments. These “work relief” initiatives generally were confined to larger cities and lasted only a few months—typically over the winter when it was hardest for the unemployed to scrape by on their own. The work they were given usually consisted of menial outdoor tasks such as street cleaning and snow removal (Harvey 1999, 36–40). Interestingly, these initiatives were almost always organized by public officials or private parties who had no responsibility for the administration of the poor law system. The unemployed had never been deemed an appropriate object of “pauper relief,” and though the provision of small amounts of emergency relief to the families of unemployed workers was not unusual during recessions, public relief officials had neither the experience nor inclination needed to organize a public relief effort targeting the unemployed. Between 1929 and 1933 the nation’s public relief system was forced by circumstance to take on this task, but it did so in keeping with its historical suspicion of the able-bodied poor. In keeping with this tradition, what little public aid the unemployed received during this period was generally conditioned on the performance of work ranging from a straightforward work test to what today would be referred to as badly-organized workfare. Leaf-raking was both ubiquitous and emblematic of the kind of work required of relief recipients. When the Roosevelt administration assumed office in early 1933, a consensus existed across the political spectrum that some form of government intervention was needed to meet the relief needs of the unemployed, reduce the level of unemployment, and facilitate a return to prosperity. The continuing debate concerned the form this intervention should take. The Roosevelt administration was eclectic and pragmatic in the strategies it pursued, guided by varied and often conflicting visions of how the economy should be structured. The policies that emerged in this environment were not based on a unified vision, and different policy-making centers within the Roosevelt administration and Congress pursued different ideas. Nevertheless, the New Dealers did share a common view of the general nature of the nation’s joblessness problem. This view contradicted the presumptions embedded in the nation’s existing public relief system and in mainstream economic theory as well. The New Dealers believed that joblessness was caused by a lack of jobs, not by a failure on the part of jobless individuals to seek or accept work. They believed that cutting wages would likely increase joblessness, rather than reduce it, because of its depressing effect on consumer purchases. They believed the goal of government initiatives addressing the problem of joblessness should be to close the economy’s job gap, not to correct moral failings on the part of jobless individuals or to put pressure on them to seek and accept presumptively available work. Concerns about the negative effects public assistance might have on jobless individuals persisted, but they were counterbalanced by more pressing concerns about the negative effects of joblessness itself. The New Dealers believed that society had an obligation to offer aid to persons denied the opportunity to be self-supporting by an absence of jobs and that this aid should be delivered without stigmatizing its recipients. Despite the incompatibility of this vision with the nation’s existing public relief practices, the Roosevelt administration’s first steps in reforming the nation’s public relief system were cautious ones. Rather than attempting to restructure the existing public relief system, the first legislation enacted by the New Dealers in this area was a straightforward financial bailout of the system. A new agency was created, the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA), to distribute $500 million in aid over 2 years to existing state and local public relief agencies. Moreover, believing the need for federal financing would be temporary, the legislation that created the FERA provided for its automatic demise once its two-year funding authorization had been dispersed. True, the use of federal funds for poor relief was unprecedented in the United States, but compared to other New Deal initiatives, this legislation was remarkable mainly for its lack of reformist goals. The only lever for reform created by the legislation was that half the funds were to be distributed at the discretion of the Director of the FERA. The person tapped to head the FERA was a social worker by the name of Harry Hopkins who had been the top public relief official in New York State under Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt before Roosevelt was elected President. Hopkins’ second in command was Aubrey Williams, another social worker with a strong administrative background. Hopkins did try to use his control over the dispersal of FERA funds to change the system. His primary goals were first, to increase average aid levels, and second, to improve the quality of work relief programs. The first of these goals was easy to achieve since local relief officials had no objection to dispensing federal money. But the second goal was another matter. Steeped in the poor law tradition, local relief administrators resisted the blandishments of FERA officials, and Hopkins had no authority either to replace them or order them to reform the manner in which they dispensed relief. All he could do was deny them FERA grants, but that would only hurt the relief recipients he was determined to help. Stymied in their reform efforts, Hopkins and Williams devoted considerable energy to thinking about the kind of system that should replace the existing one. The key flaws in the system, in their view, were its assumptions that the able-bodied poor did not want to work and that the private sector could be relied upon to provide the jobs they needed to be self-supporting. Hopkins expressed his views on these two points in the following terms. [People] suggest that we make relief as degrading and shameful as possible so that people will want to get “off.” Well – I’ve been dealing with unemployed people for years in one way and another and they do want to get off – but they can’t, apparently, get “off” into private industry. Well – if they can’t get off into private industry, where can they turn if they can’t turn to their government? What’s a government for? (quoted by Flanagan 1940, 74–75). It was Williams, though, who best described the trajectory of their thinking. In a conceptual memo to Hopkins drafted in the fall of 1933, Williams proposed that “[r]elief as such should be abolished.” Instead, the unemployed should be offered real jobs doing genuinely useful work that suited their individual skills, and they should be paid a good daily wage for the work they performed. The unemployed should not be forced to submit to a means test to obtain this employment, and their earnings should not be limited to a public assistance “need” level. In other words, instead of public relief, unemployed workers should be offered quality employment of the sort normally associated with contracted public works. However, to minimize both the cost of this undertaking and the amount of time needed to launch it, the government should serve as its own contractor, and the projects undertaken should be both less elaborate and more labor-intensive than conventional public works (Schwartz 1984, 36). This conception of the proper role of government in responding to unemployed individuals was revolutionary not only in its rejection of the poor law regime but in the substitute it proposed for it. The goal Hopkins and Williams pursued was to treat able-bodied recipients of public relief as workers whom the economy had failed rather than as failed workers. The goal of work relief, according to this model, should be to give unemployed workers what the economy denied them – decent jobs. As Hopkins commented in a 1936 speech: I am getting sick and tired of these people on the W.P.A. and local relief rolls being called chiselers and cheats. . . . These people . . . are just like the rest of us. They don’t drink any more than the rest of us, they don’t lie any more, they’re no lazier than the rest of us—they’re pretty much a cross section of the American people. . . . I have never believed that with our capitalistic system people have to be poor. I think it is an outrage that we should permit hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people to be ill clad, to live in miserable homes, not to have enough to eat, not to be able to send their children to school for the only reason that they are poor. . . . I have gone all over the moral hurdles that people are poor because they are bad. I don’t belief it. A system of government on that basis is fallacious (Hopkins 1936, as quoted in Leuchtenberg 1995, 254–55). Frustrated by their inability to implement the reforms they sought in local relief practices under the FERA umbrella, Hopkins approached President Roosevelt in early November 1933 with a proposal that an emergency employment program be established along the lines described in Williams’ memo. Hopkins proposed the establishment of a program that would operate separately from the existing relief system and which would provide immediate employment to 4 million jobless workers. One of Hopkins’ concern in advancing this proposal was the apparent overlap between what he proposed to do and the mandate of the Public Works Administration (PWA). Created (like the FERA) during the New Deal’s 100 day legislative blitzkrieg following President Roosevelt’s inauguration in March 1933, the PWA was established to create jobs for the unemployed and “prime the pump” of economic recovery with a conventional public works spending program. Established under Title II of the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 (NIRA) with an initial appropriation of 3.3 billion dollars, the PWA had a broad mandate to “construct, finance, or aid in the construction or financing of” a wide range of public works. PWA projects were statutorily required to pay prevailing wages and to observe a shortened 130 hour month (a 30 hour work week) in order to maximize the program’s employment effect. Headed by Harold Ickes, the PWA was destined to log an impressive record of achievements over the 7 years of its existence, but Ickes determination to concentrate on major construction projects (like the Triborough Bridge and Lincoln Tunnel in New York City and the Grand Coulee, Bonneville and Boulder Dams in Washington and Colorado), his reliance on private contractors to undertake the work, and his insistence on using a competitive bidding process to award contracts meant that the program was slow to start up. No projects had been begun by November 1933. Still, Hopkins felt it necessary to emphasize in his meeting with Roosevelt that the program he proposed would complement rather than compete with the PWA by concentrating on smaller-scale projects that could be started and terminated on short notice. In his meeting with Hopkins, Roosevelt mused that it would take about $400 million to put 4 million people to work through the winter. Noting that the NIRA was broadly-enough worded that money could be taken out of the PWA’s appropriation to fund such an initiative, he surprised Hopkins by accepting his proposal on the spot. A week later the Civil Works Administration (CWA) was formally established by executive order, with Hopkins at its head and a budget allocation of $400 million diverted from the PWA (Schwartz 1984, 37–39). To understand the subsequent fate of the CWA it is important to understand that Roosevelt’s motives in accepting Hopkins’ proposal were different from Hopkins’ own. Hopkins wanted to reform the nation’s public relief system—permanently and totally. Roosevelt’s goal was more limited. He wanted a temporary employment program to fill the gap left by the slow start-up of the PWA, something that would tide the unemployed over the winter while providing a quick “pump-priming” to the economy. Disappointed by Ickes’ slow pace in getting the PWA up and running, and concerned about growing political unrest among the unemployed, Roosevelt was quick to embrace Hopkins’ proposal, but his long-term commitment to Hopkins’ and Williams’ vision of work relief was still untested. Hopkins realized this from the beginning. At a December 6 staff meeting he responded to a suggestion that Congress might be persuaded to make the program permanent by cautioning his colleagues that he did not think it was “humanly possible for anybody to inject any chance of permanence in this thing” (Adams 1977, 61). That lack of permanence, known from the beginning, made what Hopkins and his staff accomplished all the more impressive. Though it lasted only 5 months from its establishment in early November 1933 to its effective termination in early April 1934, the CWA still stands as the largest public employment program ever established in the United States. With a peak employment of 4.2 million in a labor force of 51 million, the CWA provided employment to about 8% of the nation’s work force during the winter of 1933–34. A program of similar relative dimensions in the United States today would have to create 12 million jobs. Moreover, the CWA also was the New Deal program whose administrative structure, eligibility requirements, and wage policy came closest to achieving the policy goals Williams had formulated in the policy memo to Hopkins that crystallized their thinking on the subject. The administrative task of establishing the CWA—which moved from nothing more than an idea to a fully-operational program with 4 million employees in about 10 weeks time—was gargantuan. The program employed six and one half times as many people as the rest of the federal government combined. To illustrate the scale of this task relative to the existing capacities of the federal government, it is useful to note what was required simply to distribute that many paychecks. At the time the CWA was established the federal government was writing an average of about 33 million paychecks a year. During the next four and a half months an additional 60 million were issued. To insure that the first batch of one million would be available on time, President Roosevelt ordered several federal agencies to suspend normal operations in order to provide the CWA what it needed. The U.S. Government Printing Office undertook its largest single order ever in delivering enough check-writing paper. The Bureau of Printing and Engraving scheduled triple shifts to print the checks which were then flown by the Postal Service’s fledgling pilot corps to local Veterans Administration offices – the agency designated as the program’s paymaster because it was the largest and most heavily automated federal disbursing system then in existence (Schwartz 1984, 48–50). The CWA’s administrative structured mirrored FERA’s. In fact, the entire FERA staff was seconded by Hopkins to work on the CWA while continuing to perform their normal duties for the FERA. Parallel assignments were typical. Hopkins served simultaneously as director of the FERA and the CWA, and the existing FERA staff similarly assumed dual roles. At the state level, Emergency Relief Administrators appointed by Hopkins to supervise the distribution of FERA funds were now called on to administer the CWA. To fill out this structure a much expanded staff was recruited, and whereas the existing FERA staff was dominated by social workers, the new personnel tended to be engineers, managers, and economic planners. This infusion of administrators whose interests lay in production rather than social work caused some tension, but it also facilitated the CWA’s break with older work relief practices. The new staff clearly viewed their task as the establishment of an emergency employment program for unemployed workers rather than providing public assistance to the poor. Since the $400 million Roosevelt turned over to Hopkins came from funds appropriated under the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA), the CWA was subject to the same statutory restrictions as the PWA. The most important of these was that the funds could be used only for the planning and execution of construction projects. To allow for the employment of persons for whom such work would not be suitable, FERA funds were used to establish a parallel Civil Works Service (CWS) Program administered by the same officials that ran the CWA. Altogether the FERA contribution amounted to $89 million, with the CWS accounting for ten percent of combined CWA/CWS enrollment. The program’s administrative structure also included a Women’s Division which, like the CWS, used FERA funds to establish non-construction work projects for working-class women while also encouraging the hiring of women in non-construction positions in CWA construction projects. These efforts were not particularly successful. The Women’s Division staff consisted mainly of people with backgrounds in voluntary charity work. They tended to hold more traditional views of the functions of work relief and, consequently, the projects they organized (mainly sewing rooms) tended to be run more like traditional work relief programs than CWA and CWS projects. The CWA also failed in its goal of filling at least 10% of all positions with women. In the end, women accounted for only 7.5% of total employment in CWA, CWS and Women’s Division projects combined (Schwartz 1984, 158–80). Racial and ethnic minorities also received disparate treatment. Discrimination on the basis of race or color was prohibited in the application of eligibility and wage standards, but segregation was permitted in project assignments. In some areas of the country separate projects were established for white and minority workers. The CWA staff in Washington did not direct this activity, but they failed to object to it. It also was common for skilled minority workers to be discriminatorily categorized as unskilled. On the other hand, minority workers were paid the same as white workers with the same job classification, and this was enough to precipitate significant political opposition to the CWA in the South where employers relied extensively on cheap African American labor (Charnow 1943, 40–41). Altogether the combined CWA/CWS program cost $976 million (1.4% of GDP), with the federal government providing over 90% of that total. When the program’s initial allocation of $400 million in PWA funds was exhausted in February 1934, an additional $337 million was obtained from Congress to allow the program to wind down in an orderly fashion. The balance of the federal contribution consisted of FERA funds. The 10% of program costs contributed by state and local governments was provided in the form of payments for materials and supplies used in CWA work projects. The program’s goal was to require local sponsors of work projects to bear all such non-labor costs, and they did so to a substantial degree. Participant earnings totaled $750 million or approximately 79% of total program cost. This was a much higher ratio than for the PWA, reflecting the intentional selection of labor-intensive projects. No studies were conducted of the indirect employment effects of CWA expenditures, but they probably were substantial since, in addition to the program’s purchases of capital goods, program wages typically were spent very quickly on consumer goods and services. Given the structural links between the CWA and the FERA, Hopkins and his associates were unable to create a program as devoid of associations with public relief as they wanted. This was apparent in the CWA’s eligibility standards. The source of the problem lay in the fact that only 4.2 million jobs were created at a time when unemployment stood at approximately 11.5 million. This meant that program jobs had to be allocated among the unemployed. Since Hopkins immediate goal was to replace locally-administered FERA work relief projects with federally-administered CWA projects, the decision was made to reserve half of all CWA positions for persons on relief. This meant that eligibility for those positions was made contingent on submission to a means test. The other 2.4 million jobs were filled using normal hiring criteria for public employment. No means test was required to apply for those 2.4 million positions, and hiring decisions were supposed to be based exclusively on considerations of skill, training and experience. In accordance with this policy, the first round of CWA hiring involved the transfer of 1.5 million former FERA work relief recipients to the CWA payroll. A total of 9 million people applied for the 2.4 million program jobs available without means-testing—a staggering number considering that total unemployment is estimated to have stood at 11.5 million at the time. To emphasize the non-relief character of this hiring, it was performed by the newly organized United States Employment Service (USES) rather than local relief offices. However, relief offices also were swamped with new applicants for public aid, since job seekers quickly realized that qualifying for relief was a surer means of getting a CWA job than applying for one through the USES. Special hiring procedures also were adopted for skilled craftsmen. Instead of requiring applicants for these positions to apply through the USES, unions were allowed to refer their members in accordance with customary procedures for the trades in question. More importantly, the CWA agreed not to fill these positions from among USES applicants unless a local union failed to refer enough qualified workers. In other words, the CWA formally adopted a union shop policy for the skilled trades; however, local CWA administrators often ignored this policy unless local unions insisted on its observance (Schwartz 1984, 105–09). The area in which the CWA broke most decisively with prior work relief practices was in its earnings policy. Customary practice in work relief programs had been to limit an individual’s earnings to the individual’s “budget deficiency”—that is, the difference between their available resources and their “need” as determined by local relief officials. Consequently, the number of hours an individual was required to work in a traditional work relief program depended on the size of the individual’s budget deficiency, and this was true of FERA-funded work relief projects as well. Thus, despite a minimum wage which would have generated a $12 weekly income for a 40 hour work week, actual earnings on FERA-funded work relief projects averaged less than $5 per week in the period immediately preceding the establishment of the CWA. No such working-hour limitation existed under the CWA. Hourly wage minimums were higher, but the more important difference was that everyone worked the same number of hours. The result was that average weekly earnings among CWA workers were three times as great as the benefits received by FERA-funded work-relief recipients. Because the CWA’s original funding came from the PWA, Hopkins also felt bound to use its wage scale—even though he was not statutorily required to do so and privately thought the CWA scale was too high (Schwartz 1984, 117–18). The minimum hourly rates for unskilled workers under this scale were $.40, $.45 and $.50 respectively (equivalent to $6.65, $7.47 and $8.32 per hour in 2009), depending on the area of the country in which the program operated. The corresponding rates for skilled workers were $1.00, $1.10 and $1.20 (equivalent to $16.62, $18.27 and $19.94 per hour in 2009). In highway construction, though, the usual rates paid by state highway departments were used, with a minimum set at $.30 per hour (Charnow 1943, 58 n. 23). It also was national policy (though often ignored at the local level) to recognize locally negotiated union contracts in the construction trades as determinative of prevailing wage rates. The hourly rates paid by the CWA were controversial because they often were higher than the rates employers in particular regions (especially the South) or industries (especially agriculture) were accustomed to paying. What this debate tended to ignore was that actual earnings were much lower than the published standards suggested because of the program’s relatively short work week of 30 hours (the maximum work week permitted under the NIRA—the source of the PWA funding transferred to the CWA). When these funds began to run out in mid-January, the program workweek was shortened still further to 24 hours per week in order to spread the remaining work as widely as possible. As a result, average program earnings declined from about $15 per week to about $11.30 per week. For purposes of comparison, average weekly earnings of privately employed workers equaled about $20 in 1933. Hopkins’ goal was to give the unemployed work in jobs that utilized their existing skills, but both statutory and practical limitations made this impossible. First, as previously noted, statutory restrictions limited the CWA to construction projects. Second, a pre-existing FERA policy required that projects be performed only on public property. Third, no project was supposed to be undertaken that would duplicate work normally performed by state and local government employees. Fourth, no projects were supposed to be approved that could qualify for funding by the PWA. Project selection also was constrained by timing issues and the desire to maximize the program’s employment effect. This meant projects had to be labor intensive and capable of completion in a short period of time. It also meant they could not require significant advance planning or be hard to shut down on short notice. Finally, project selection also was subject to weather and political constraints. Although the CWA hired its own workforce and carried out all projects without relying on private contractors, the CWA model called for projects to be sponsored by other government agencies at either the local, state or federal level. At the state and local level the sponsoring agency was expected to provide plans for the project and contribute the cost of the materials and supplies used in it, but that was the extent of their involvement. As a general rule, the program adhered to this model and state and local governments were enthusiastic in proposing projects. At the federal level the CWA assumed all program costs but still relied on sponsoring agencies to propose and plan the projects. The quality of the sponsored projects varied widely. First, by taking over all FERA-funded work projects from the local relief officials who had been administering them, the CWA burdened itself with an initial portfolio of poor-quality work projects. While the CWA gained direct administrative control over these projects, it took time to implement significant quality improvements. As noted above, these projects comprised a substantial share of all program activities, employing 1.5 million former FERA work-relief enrollees at the outset of the program’s operations and additional CWA employees as more were hired. A second large group of projects originated with suggestions for new undertakings by local government officials. Approval authority for these projects was exercised by state CWA Administrators whose review of the projects was often cursory. The quality of these projects varied greatly. Where sponsors had already developed plans for suitable construction projects, the activities tended to be quite successful and provided good value in terms of finished product. Where advance planning had not been completed, the results were less satisfactory, though the CWA’s newly recruited and very competent Engineering Division was able to achieve steady improvement in the quality of the program’s construction work over the life of the program. A third large group of projects originated at the federal level. These projects were sponsored by a variety of federal government agencies including the Treasury Department, the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture, the Commerce Department, and the War Department. Most of these projects were developed in collaboration with CWA staff and also required the approval of a special office established within the Engineering Division that vetted them for quality control purposes. By all accounts the CWA’s highest quality projects were found in this group. As for the type of work performed, the single largest category of CWA projects consisted of road work. These projects accounted for 35% of all project expenditures and employed close to half of the program’s entire workforce. Former FERA work-relief projects mostly consisted of this type of work. The road work consisted mainly of minor repairs and improvements rather than new construction. In many rural areas this was the only type of CWA work available. The CWA administration was not happy with the predominance of road work in the program’s activities. This type of project was associated both historically and in the public’s mind with the kind of work relief the CWA was supposed to replace. Indeed a large proportion of these projects were taken over from FERA-funded programs. The difference between these earlier programs and their CWA counterparts was not immediately apparent to the public walking or driving by a CWA work crew. The fact that these projects were more visible than other, higher quality projects also made it more difficult for the CWA leadership to explain the innovative character of the CWA to the public. Nevertheless, the social utility of this work cannot be denied. Road repairs are valuable, and the CWA improved over 250,000 miles of roads. Sometimes these projects were very large. In Chicago, the second largest city in the United States at the time, 11,500 CWA workers laid brick pavements in a major street-improvement project. The next largest category of CWA projects consisted of construction and repair work on public buildings. This type of work accounted for about 15% of project expenditures. Approximately 60,000 public buildings were repaired or constructed, two-thirds of which were schools. Public health and sanitation activities constituted another major activity. Almost 2,300 miles of sewer lines were laid or repaired, swamp-drainage projects to fight malaria employed 30,000 CWA workers, and 17,000 unemployed coal miners were employed sealing abandoned coal mines to protect ground-water supplies. CWA workers also were employed in emergency disaster relief—either fighting floods or assisting in post-flood clean-up and repair work. Other CWA project categories included improvements to public recreational facilities and to public transportation and utility systems. Over 3,700 playgrounds and 200 public swimming pools were constructed along with countless comfort stations, park benches and water fountains. Surprisingly, the CWA built 469 airports and improved another 529, but this was the dawning of the aviation age, and the facilities in question mainly consisted of unpaved landing fields. Because the CWS was not limited to construction projects and employed professionals, the projects it undertook were more varied. Since most of these projects were sponsored by federal government agencies, they also benefited from the attention of the CWA’s Washington staff. Professional associations also assisted in the design and management of many of these projects. Large numbers of unemployed teachers were employed by the CWS. Education projects started under FERA provided jobs for 50,000 laid-off teachers in local schools. Another 13,000 kept small rural schools open through the winter. 33,000 were employed in adult education and nursery school programs. Adult education classes staffed by CWS teachers were attended by 800,000 people during the winter of 1933–34, and 60,700 pre-school children attended CWS nursery schools. The latter were generously staffed and provided warm clothes, hot meals, medical care, and parent education services in addition to childcare. 23,000 CWS nurses staffed a nationwide child health study, and 10,000 more were employed in a variety of other programs. The U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey sponsored a triangulation and mapping project that employed 15,000 CWS workers. An aerial mapping project charted hundreds of U.S. cities and employed another 10,000 CWS workers. The National Park Service and the Library of Congress undertook a survey of the nation’s historic buildings that provided work for 1,200 draftsmen. Over 70,000 people were employed in CWS pest-eradication campaigns, and a group of 94 Alaskan Indians were employed restocking the Kodiak Islands with snowshoe rabbits. Cultural projects were also undertaken. A well-organized Public Works of Art Project sponsored by the Treasury Department employed 3,000 artists. Actors staged dramatic works in hospitals, schools and libraries. Opera singers toured the Ozark mountain region. CWS orchestras gave free concerts in major cities. The CWS also provided staffing assistance to public libraries and research assistance for scholarly projects. The Smithsonian Institution employed 1,000 CWS workers at archeological excavations in 5 states. The single largest category of CWS employment, though, consisted of work performed on statistical surveys. The Department of Commerce employed 11,000 CWS workers to conduct a census of real property in 60 cities. An Urban Tax-Delinquency Survey documented the fiscal condition of 309 cities. The CWA’s own Statistical Division employed 35,000 CWS workers to collect and record data and documentation concerning program operations, labor market conditions, and the nation’s public relief problem. The establishment of a program as large, as complicated and as innovative as the CWA within a span of weeks was a major administrative achievement. A War Department engineer assigned to study the program compared it favorably to the country’s mobilization effort in World War I (Schlesinger 1959, 271). A New Deal historian commented that the “CWA stands out in all American history as one of the greatest peacetime administrative feats ever completed” (Charles 1963, 65). The CWA was a remarkable experiment. More ambitious in its goals than any other New Deal employment program, it contemplated nothing less than the replacement of means-tested work relief with a promise of quality employment paying decent wages for performing work of genuine social utility. The quick demise of the program cut the experiment short. Still, Hopkins and his associates continued their reform efforts, hoping that by stepwise movement they could win the political support needed to establish a more sustainable version of the CWA—even if that meant compromising on their goals. This is exactly what the establishment of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) achieved 2 years after the termination of the CWA. The major lesson to be learned from the CWA concerns the vision it embodied, however imperfectly. That vision repudiated three important orthodoxies. The first was the assumption that the able-bodied poor were responsible for their own condition. Although discredited by the Great Depression, this assumption still survived in the administration of the nation’s public relief system. Hopkins and his associates believed the able-bodied poor were no more responsible for their joblessness than laid-off members of the middle class. As Hopkins commented, “They don’t drink any more than the rest of us, they don’t lie any more, [and] they’re no lazier than the rest of us” (Hopkins 1936, quoted in Leuchtenburg 1995, 254). The second orthodoxy challenged by the CWA was the assumption that helping the able-bodied poor to obtain work required a different strategy than helping other categories of unemployed workers. In simple terms, the prevailing view then (as it is today) was that helping the able-bodied poor to overcome their joblessness requires changes in them, whereas helping other unemployed workers requires nothing more than the creation of more jobs. The CWA was premised on the contrary assumption that the reason the jobless poor didn’t work was the same reason other categories of unemployed workers remained idle. There weren’t enough jobs to go around. The remedy for this problem also was the same for the poor and non-poor alike. Create the jobs they needed. Finally, the CWA challenged the assumption that social welfare policy should limit itself to relieving the non-able-bodied poor while leaving it to someone else to provide jobs for the able-bodied poor. Hopkins and his associates accepted that it was not their responsibility as social welfare administrators to fix what ailed the private economy, but they believed it was their job to provide jobs for the unemployed when the private sector did not. That was as natural a function of social welfare policy, in their view, as distributing food to the poor during a famine.Footnote 1
 Work relief conceived in this fashion fit naturally with the New Dealers’ understanding of social insurance. The function of programs like the CWA was not so much to relieve poverty as it was to insure the nation’s labor force against a loss of employment. The New Dealers’ embrace of this model became clear when President Roosevelt appointed a Cabinet level “Committee on Economic Security” just 2 months after the official termination of the CWA. Roosevelt directed the Committee to develop a set of legislative proposals addressing the economic security needs of the American people—to provide them “some safeguard against misfortunes which cannot be wholly eliminated in this manmade world of ours.” Chaired by Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins and including Hopkins, the Committee submitted its report to the President 7 months later in January 1935. The social welfare strategy it proposed can be described as having two legs. The first leg consisted of a promise of employment security for everyone who depended on wage labor for their livelihood, to be secured by active measures to stimulate private employment and, whenever necessary, direct job creation by the government. Since most people must live by work, the first objective in a program of economic security must be maximum employment. As the major contribution of the Federal Government in providing a safeguard against unemployment we suggest employment assurance—the stimulation of private employment and the provision of public employment for those able-bodied workers whom industry cannot employ at a given time. Public-work programs are most necessary in periods of severe depression, but may be needed in normal times, as well, to help meet the problems of stranded communities and over manned or declining industries. (Report of the Committee on Economic Security 1935, 23). The second leg of the strategy was designed to provide income security for persons who were not expected to be self-supporting. A new configuration of means-tested and non-means-tested transfer programs were proposed for this purpose. Federally-administered and/or federally-financed programs were proposed to provide unemployment compensation, old age security, and children’s aid. The Committee proposed that responsibility for the nation’s residual relief needs (which would have consisted mainly of providing relief for persons with disabilities) remain with state and local governments. However, even in that case the Committee made clear its intention that the nation’s traditional poor law regime be replaced with a system founded on the non-stigmatizing insurance principles that Hopkins espoused. To prevent such a step from resulting in less humane and less intelligent treatment of unfortunate fellow citizens, we strongly recommend that the states substitute for their ancient, out-moded poor laws modernized public-assistance laws, and replace their traditional poor-law administrations by unified and efficient state and local public welfare departments, such as exist in some states and for which there is a nucleus in all states in the federal emergency relief organizations [i.e., the administrative structure that Hopkins had set up to run FERA and the CWA]. (Ibid., 27) The Committee also prepared a national health insurance plan to meet the needs of “American citizens with small means.” This plan was designed to cover both the costs of medical care and to provide partial wage replacement for persons who lost work due to illness or maternity. When it became clear, however, that the medical profession was implacably opposed to any such initiative, killing any chance that it would enacted by Congress, the president directed the Committee to omit it from the report they submitted to him. President Roosevelt forwarded the Committee’s remaining proposals to Congress in early 1935, and Congress responded by enacting legislation during the spring and summer of 1935 implementing every one of them to one degree or another. Leaving aside the abandonment of the Committee’s unreported proposal to establish a national health insurance system, the most significant shortfall in implementing the Committee’s social welfare vision was President Roosevelt’s and Congress’s failure to seek and provide adequate funding to fully implement the Committee’s employment assurance proposal. The WPA was established (with Hopkins and Williams at its head) to supplement the PWA and the Civilian Conservation Corps in performing this function, but instead of authorizing enough funds to provide jobs for all the unemployed, the more modest goal was adopted of providing jobs for all the unemployed who qualified as needy—and even that goal was not consistently met. Still, despite the failure of the Roosevelt administration and Congress to fully implement the proposals of the Committee on Economic Security, the vision of governmental obligation and individual entitlement expressed in its 1935 report came to comprise the core of what William Forbath has called the “New Deal Constitution of Social Citizenship” (Forbath 1999). More than any other reform initiative from the era, it was the Committee on Economic Security’s conception of the obligations of government that defined the New Deal in the minds of the public, and the foundation on which that vision rested was the plan Hopkins and Williams developed in the fall of 1933 to close the economy’s job gap. What distinguished the New Deal’s fiscal strategy is that it was driven mainly by social welfare rather than macroeconomic considerations. The economists and businessmen who advised President Roosevelt on economic policy believed that increased government spending could promote economic recovery by “priming the pump” of business activity, but unlike Keynesian theory, the “pump-priming” metaphor provided no support for deficit spending per se, nor any guidance as to how large a fiscal stimulus was needed to “prime” the economic recovery “pump.” In this policy environment, Roosevelt’s desire to increase government spending to meet social needs often had the support of his economic advisors, but his decision about how much to spend was based on his weighing of social welfare needs against the goal of reducing the federal government’s budget deficits, rather than a judgment about how large a fiscal stimulus was needed for counter-cyclical purposes. Over the course of the decade that followed the articulation of the New Deal strategy in the Report of the Committee on Economic Security, President Roosevelt and other New Dealers regularly reaffirmed their commitment to the social welfare vision embodied in the Committee on Economic Security’s proposals. Moreover, they increasingly came to express this commitment in the language of human rights, a frame of reference that ultimately found expression in Articles 22–25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Harvey 2007). My argument is that the New Dealer’s instincts were right. The proper way to design an economic policy response to a recession is to focus on the social welfare needs of the population viewed as human rights. Viewed from this perspective, the problem with President Roosevelt’s fiscal conservatism was not that it prolonged the Great Depression unnecessarily, although it undoubtedly did, but that it prevented him from fully implementing the social welfare strategy his administration devised to see the American people through the Depression by securing their economic and social human rights. The Keynesian strategy of aggregate demand management that progressives embraced in the post World War II era and which continues to command their allegiance today was not based on their New Deal experience but rather on their experience in paying for World War II. Guided by Keynes General Theory, the lesson progressive economists took away from the war was that it didn’t matter how economic stimulus dollars are spent during a recession. As Keynes famously quipped, you could bury bank notes in bottles at the bottom of abandoned mines, fill the mines with trash, and then invite capitalists to dig them up (Keynes 1936, 129). All that mattered was that the stimulus be large enough to raise aggregate demand to the full employment level. The New Deal strategy is fully compatible with a Keynesian commitment to boosting aggregate demand. Nevertheless, it is important to understand that the strategy’s commitment to securing the economic and social human rights that recessions threaten is independent of that macroeconomic goal and provides a justification for the strategy irrespective of its macroeconomic effect. That said, Keynesian economists have good reason to embrace the New Deal strategy based solely on its advantages as a means of delivering a fiscal stimulus to an economy in recession. These advantages can be grouped under two headings. The first consists of enhancements to the anti-cyclical effect of the fiscal stimulus. The second consists of enhancements to the short-term job-creation effect of the fiscal stimulus. Using the New Deal strategy to deliver a fiscal stimulus will enhance its anti-cyclical effect in two ways. First, by providing immediate reemployment to laid-off workers, the New Deal strategy would provide a faster and more effective means of short-circuiting the negative spiral that does the most harm during a recession—the tendency for job losses to cause further job losses. No other means of delivering a fiscal stimulus to an economy can promise to reemploy unemployed workers as quickly and with as little disruption to their normal consumption expenditures as the New Deal strategy. Second, because most of the fiscal boost provided to the private sector by the New Deal strategy would result from a resumption of ordinary consumption spending by reemployed workers, it would tend to fill precisely the same gap in business income that the spread of unemployment during a recession causes. Businesses that suffered losses due to the depressing effect of unemployment on consumer demand would not have to wait for the benefits of a fiscal stimulus delivered somewhere else in the economy to trickle through to them. They would feel the effects of the stimulus almost immediately, and their healthier balance sheets would make it possible for them to participate both more quickly and more aggressively in a resumption of economic growth. Stimulus spending distributed in other ways is unlikely to be as well-positioned microeconomically to foster a resumption of economic growth; and even if the stimulus has been delivered to industries with a high growth potential, their expansion is not going to be capable of lifting the entire economy until the damage done to consumer-oriented businesses by the recession is repaired. There is only one caveat to this assessment of the enhanced anti-cyclical effect of a fiscal stimulus delivered via the New Deal strategy. The caveat is that the multiplier effect of stimulus spending delivered in this way would be somewhat smaller than that of some other forms of stimulus spending (Harvey 2011). The practical importance of that caveat pales to insignificance, however, in light of the other major advantage of the New Deal strategy as a means of delivering a fiscal stimulus—its short-term job creation effect. Simply stated, the New Deal strategy outperforms all other anti-recession measures as a means of creating jobs, including stimulus measures with a higher income multiplier than the New Deal strategy. The reason for this is that the front-loaded round of direct job-creation that kicks off the multiplier effect of the New Deal strategy adds far more to the overall job-creation effect of the strategy than is lost as result of its possibly diminished multiplier effect compared to some other types of stimulus spending (Ibid.). Table 1 illustrates this difference. Table 1 estimates both the direct and indirect job creation effects of a $100 billion fiscal stimulus delivered to the U.S. economy during the so-called Great Recession of 2008–09 using three different spending strategies. The first is a continuation of the so-called Bush-era tax cuts that were included in the compromise tax cut agreement negotiated between the Obama Administration and Republican leaders of Congress following the 2010 mid-term elections. The second strategy consists of an increase in Unemployment Insurance (UI) and Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) benefit payments, two types of stimulus spending with among the highest income multipliers (Blinder and Zandi 2010). The job-creation effect of these three stimulus strategies are measured in several ways, since different measures of job creation are not necessarily proportionate to one another. What the table shows is that the estimated job creation effect of the New Deal’s direct job-creation strategy far exceeds that of the other two strategies. Indeed, the model on which these estimates are based suggests that if the New Deal strategy had been deployed in February 2009, the nation’s unemployment rate could have been reduced to its pre-recession level and kept there for as long as it took for the economy to recover for far less than the federal government actually has spent on fiscal stimulus measures. From this perspective, the problem with the federal government’s response to the Great Recession has not been that it spent too little, but that its spending has been very poorly allocated. The New Deal strategy constitutes not only a far more progressive response to recessions on social welfare and human rights grounds. It also constitutes a far more effective response on purely economic grounds.",2

These problems continue to plague Detroit and a few other cities, but they seem to have eased for the nation’s cities overall. Stoll and Covington (2010) found a decline nationwide in job sprawl and in racial housing segregation between 1990 and 2000.Footnote 1 In contrast to Stoll and Covington’s findings at the national level, Detroit Michigan’s population faces increases in both job sprawl and residential segregation. Detroit was experiencing “rapid decentralization” in 2006 according to a Brookings Institution study (Kneebone 2009:12). The study listed Detroit first among 98 U.S. metropolitan areas in job sprawl in 2006, with 77.4% of jobs located more than 10 miles outside the city center (2009:8). Only 7.0% were located within 3 miles of the city’s core. According to the Census Bureau, between 1990 and 2009 the share of the population of Detroit City that is black rose from 75.6% to 77.2% as the population of the city fell from 1,027,974 to 916,133.Footnote 2
 Detroit’s unemployment rate, 22.6% in September 2010, was nearly twice that of the rest of Michigan (12.3%), according to Michigan.gov, the official state website, and the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS 2010).Footnote 3 BLS data shows that total non-farm industry employment in the Detroit metropolitan area fell 2.1% (compared to 0.2% growth in the U.S) between September 2009 and 2010. This continued a trend that started in 2005. Employment declined primarily in trade, transportation and utilities (3.1%), government (2.8%) and financial activities (4.7%). There were small increases in professional and business services (2.1%), education and health services (2%), manufacturing (0.1%) and leisure and hospitality (0.7%).Footnote 4 The next two sections, respectively provide an overview of worker and job characteristics for central city Detroit and regression analyses of wages for the Detroit metropolitan area.

In January 2011, official unemployment averaged 9.0%--representing 13.9 million persons. However, persons working part time who would like full-time employment, as well as persons who want jobs but have not looked for work in the past 4 weeks, are not included by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the official figures. Including them, as the National Jobs for All Coalition (NJFAC) does monthly on its website (NJFAC), brings the figure to 18.0%–28.7 million people. While all groups have seen sharp rises in unemployment, there are wide disparities. For white workers the jobless rate was 8.0%--but for African Americans it was a depression level of 15.7% and for black 16–to–19 year olds it was an astronomical 45.4%. In addition, in 2009 (the latest year available) 16.3 million people were working year-round full time, yet earned less than the inadequate official poverty level for a family of four (NJFAC). Professor Darity (2010) laments “the failure to undertake or even to consider more daring and imaginative policies [than the stimulus of 2009] to produce a healthy and equitable economy.” And he proposes a “powerful transformative policy,” “a federal job guarantee that would insure that all persons willing to work would be able to obtain work” (see also, e.g., Harvey 1989 and 2000; Wray 1998). Darity (2010) also shows its economic feasibility, at a minimum annual salary of $20,000 (a mean of $40,000) plus $10,000 in benefits, to provide jobs for all of those currently jobless. He spells out the extensive advantages that would accrue both to the unemployed, to workers and to society, including addressing the nation’s vast unmet physical and human infrastructure needs, security for workers, improved health, elimination of working poverty and a chance for former prisoners to become useful members of society. Professor Darity’s idea and variants of it have deep roots (Nixon 1973) and some of these roots are part of 20th century US history. In this article I briefly explore some New Deal job creation efforts and President Franklin Roosevelt’s Economic Bill of Rights. The main focus is on two major attempts to secure full employment and the right to a job through legislation. In the 1940s, the ill-fated Full Employment Bill of 1945, failed to pass; the Employment Act of 1946, passed, but did not have full employment as its goal. The second major attempt, in the 1970s, led to passage of the weak Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act of 1978, which has been virtually ignored. In the article, I draw partly from my experience as a participant observer. In the 1970s, I was an academic economist and active participant in the struggle to attain strong full employment legislation in the United States. During that period, I wrote, consulted with many groups (mostly faith-based) provided testimony to Congress, and spoke extensively throughout the country on unemployment and the need for a federal government commitment to full employment. I am a co-founder and currently serve on the executive committee of the National Jobs for All Coalition (NJFAC), an organization that educates and advocates for a government policy of living-wage jobs for all who want to work.",8

More than with previous mid-terms reversals such an outcome was expected to transform the ideological tone of policy debates as much as their partisan character. The results, with the loss of Democratic power in the House of Representatives, met the most pessimistic liberal expectations. Within weeks of the new Congress’ inauguration, however, liberal fears of a regressive agenda were matched by widespread anxiety over legislative stalemates and inertia. Yet, in the months that followed the real meaning of that inertia for domestic policy began to sink into the consciousness of the optimistic liberal voters. The White House would be seen as conceding to major conservative demands for federal restraint in terms of social welfare and employment policy while conceding to federal largess in terms of upper income tax policy. The prospective for Obama’s employment policy, whatever the congressional context, increasingly seemed to be understandably restrained in openness to federal intervention and yet pragmatically unconstrained in its willingness to go with the flow of the strongest private sector pressures. As a consequence, the balance between public and private sector prerogatives appeared to swayed between an unreflective moderation and a latent inclination toward extending federal authority. During the first years of his administration as President Obama as carried his campaign theme of “Yes, We can” into the policy-making arena, the biggest controversy formed around the general question of what could or could not be done, first, for failing banks and their financial networks and, second, for a dysfunctional healthcare system. Subsidiary questions of administrative competence, systemic capacity and national resources took center stage. In particular, conservatives questioned the competence of federal intervention in financial markets and its capacity for healthcare reform. Liberals questioned the availability of national resources expected to sink into private insurance corporations in substitute for a public initiative. Yet, both sets of critics may have missed the mark, the real point of fundamental conflict that underscored, though only imperceptibly, the controversy over these major federal initiatives. Analysts would do well to focus more the “we” and misunderstandings about whom it includes and rather than on what can or cannot be done. The legislative struggles of the Obama administration have shed more light on what it can or cannot get done than on the political and ideological composition of those influencing the decisions. It can be argued that the locus of compromise in the White House has moved from the ideological center of policy debate to the ideologically represented center of those who are influential in policy debates; the representatives, administrators, lobbyists and a few others who defined the limited circle of policy influence. The fairly rambling administrative search for an effective jobs program serves to illustrate the ambiguity and inconsistency in perspectives on the issue. When it comes to economic questions, in general, and employment policy, in particular, the national consensus about the composition of federal decision-makers is less solid than Americans are otherwise accustomed to believing. Who regulates, how and by what means, seems to emerge more from operational adaptation than from policy consensus. In particular, the further policy making moves into complex areas of employment, the more boundaries of public-private interdependence are obscured. However wide the ideological distance between positive and negative prognosticators of employment growth, the pragmatic center is where the White House preferences are likely to fall. This pragmatic center, it is important to recognize, may be far from the ideological center between public-private program alternatives. Instead, it is closer to the pressure center of partisan and interest-group forces that normally participate in fiscal policy-making. It is useful to take a closer look at the history of pragmatic center in order to understand current options.",

Green,Michael S. Isaacson,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Winning the battle against unemployment would mean that there would be living wage jobs for all. Despite decades of struggle at both the legislative and street level, such an outcome has never been achieved in the capitalist world, suggesting that it is incompatible with capitalism. Even the most advanced social-democratic countries never achieved these goals (see, for example, Eurostat 2010), and to the extent that any progress was made, the Great Recession of 2007, maturing into a Great Stagnation, is further eroding those safety nets. If achieving jobs for all is a Sisyphean endeavor within capitalism, what additional measures of success could be used to assess progress in this struggle? The strongest efforts to overcome involuntary unemployment have historically been made by the political left, especially communist parties seeking to advance the interests and class consciousness of the working class. Their aggressive response to unemployment and its racist character flows from the communist goal of ending capitalist exploitation through a workers’ revolution and the establishment of socialism/communism. In this political framework, the battle against unemployment becomes both an end in itself and, dialectically, part of the process of developing class consciousness among the masses, leading the working class to become a “class-for-itself”, shedding bourgeois individualism, reformism, and racism, and wielding its collective power to create a new mode of production and a new egalitarian, collective society. One additional measure of success in the battle for jobs, then, would be progress made in raising anti-racist class consciousness as the struggle proceeds. Conscious class unity in the U.S. context requires addressing the historic differential exploitation of African American workers and the increasing differential exploitation of Latino workers. Anti-racism and multi-racial unity are core aspects of class consciousness. Communists in the U.S. have historically stressed the need for black leadership and multi-racial unity in the fight for working class interests, especially in the battle against unemployment (Harris, 2009, Naison, 1983; Kelley, 1990; Foster, 1954). The success of the bourgeoisie in preventing the formation of such consciousness through racism in economic, political and cultural spheres has held back the struggle against all forms of exploitation, a fact lamented by many writers (e.g., Spero & Harris 1931). Success in the jobs struggle then can be measured in two ways: the extent to which palliative measures are wrung from the system through class struggle (e.g., countercyclical public works programs, unemployment insurance, relief payments) and the extent to which anti-racist, internationalist class consciousness grows among the working class, creating a powerful force for advancing the long-term interests of the global proletariat. In this paper, a review of the theory and early history of the fight against unemployment, especially in the U.S., is followed by an assessment of the relative success of two specific examples of communist-led job struggles according to the criteria noted above. The examples are the St. Petersburg Unemployed Council of 1906 and the Unemployed Councils of the early years of the Great Depression. Suggestions for the current struggle against unemployment are drawn from those experiences.",

Indeed, anxiety over men’s economic status is on the rise. This is reflected in the suggestion that the global crisis that began in the 2008 led to a “mancession,” due to a more rapid rise in male than female unemployment early in the crisis in developed economies. The pronouncement that the end of gender inequality is upon us, however, is premature. Race/ethnicity and household structure are key factors influencing gender outcomes, contributing to a troubling degree of inequality among women. Racial wage and employment inequality among women persists unabated in the US and in other racially heterogeneous societies (such as South Africa and Brazil). Further, despite evidence of narrowing of wage gaps in developed economies and educational gaps in developing economies, we see continued and worsening economic conditions among single mothers. Women’s disproportionate responsibility for children can inhibit their ability to get and keep stable jobs. This is because employers see them as “flexible” workers more than, for example, white men. Single parents face diminished social protection as governments cut spending. Further, declining job prospects for men reduces child support payment to custodial parents, usually women.",

Most of the literature notes unequivocally that discrimination in the mortgage market has been, and remains, race-based and that it has had a disproportionate negative effect on the African American population (Brown 2010; Goldstein and Urevick-Ackelsberg 2008; Leigh and Huff 2007; Phillips 2010; Rugh and Massey 2010). For instance, the Consumers Union analyzed Texas refinance loans and determined that those affected by subprime lending were overwhelmingly minority (80%) with race being the strongest indicator of who received a high-cost mortgage. After accounting for credit and neighborhood characteristics, Black borrowers were 3.9 times as likely to end up with a subprime refinance as non-Blacks (Consumers Union 2002b). Federal Reserve studies reveal that Blacks and Hispanics are more likely, and Asians, less likely, to receive a higher-priced loan even after controlling for borrower and loan characteristics (Avery et al. 2006). Income was found not to be a contributing factor in the disparity between Whites and Blacks with regard to subprime loans. In fact, in a report titled “Income is No Shield against Racial Differences in Lending” published in 2008, the higher the income level, the more likely an African American would get a subprime loan. The study revealed that middle- to upper-income (MUI) African Americans were more likely to receive high-cost loans than low- to moderate-income (LMI) African-Americans when compared to similarly situated Whites. Comparable results occurred in 2006 and 2009 studies. What may be interesting for this group is that, while LMI African-American borrowers were over three times as likely to receive a high-cost loan compared to LMI White borrowers in Durham; Greenville; and Wilmington, NC; MUI African-American borrowers in Greenville and Durham were over four times more likely to get high-cost loans than MUI White borrowers (National Community Reinvestment Coalition; The Opportunity Agenda; Poverty and Race Research Action Council 2006; National Community Reinvestment Coalition 2008; National Council of Negro Women and National Community Reinvestment Coalition 2009) Figs. 1 and 2.

Wealth is an especially important indicator of economic well-being, because, unlike income or educational attainment, this measure of economic status captures the consequences of the accumulation of assets across and within generations. Wealth can be used to pay for college, put a down payment on a home, or start a business—keys to upward socioeconomic mobility. Moreover, it cushions the economic impact of unexpected costs associated with job loss, medical expenses and divorce. Wealth also has consequences for future generations because it can be passed on in the form of inter vivos transfers and inheritances. Existing research shows that there are large race and gender disparities in wealth, with blacks possessing less wealth than whites (Oliver and Shapiro 1995) and women having less wealth than men (Chang 2010a). Nevertheless, studies on wealth have tended to treat race and gender as separate dimensions, ignoring the ways that race and gender may intersect to shape the accrual of economic resources. An intersectional approach to understanding how race and gender produce wealth trajectories would consider the unique position of individuals who must navigate both race and gender statuses simultaneously. The central aim of this study is to investigate how much wealth black women possess in middle and late life. An intersectional lens may be especially important for understanding outcomes for black women, who occupy two lower statuses (i.e., “black” and “woman”) in American society (see e.g., Shields 2008). In terms of wealth accumulation, black women encounter barriers to opportunities due to both racism and sexism, which may even emanate “from members of their own social groups—they may experience sexism from within the black community and racism from other women…” (Settles 2006, p. 590). Furthermore, taking into account the aging process, the number and proportion of black older adults is projected to increase over the next two decades (He et al. 2005). Although it is well-documented that black women have longer life expectancies than their male counterparts (Kochanek et al. 2005), less is known about how the numerous race and gender barriers to building wealth faced by black women affect them in this stage of the life course. That is, little is known about black women’s wealth trajectories in later life. An intersectionality perspective would suggest that racial and gender disadvantages are likely to exacerbate each other and compound over time, and consequently that black women are likely to experience substantial economic insecurity, accumulating little wealth over the life course. Wealth holdings are especially important among older black women given their economic insecurity over the life course (Brown and Warner 2008; Christie-Mizell et al. 2007), limited employment opportunities, and the increasing likelihood of health limitations as they age (Warner and Brown 2011). The life cycle hypothesis (LCH)—the dominant economic paradigm for understanding savings and consumption behavior—posits that rational actors should accumulate wealth until they retire, whereupon they begin decumulating wealth, such that average wealth levels will increase until around retirement age, after which they decline (Modigliani and Brumberg 1954; Modigliani 1986). Implicit in LCH is the untenable assumption that individuals are able to achieve economic success without the constraints of artificial barriers such as institutional racism and sexism. However, well-documented discrimination on the basis of both race and gender faced by black women (Darity and Mason 1998) makes the LCH unlikely to be adequate for explaining their wealth trajectories. Therefore, this study utilizes an intersectionality approach and panel data from the Health and Retirement Study to investigate black women’s wealth trajectories (net worth and net financial assets) between ages 51 and 73. Black women are hypothesized to have extremely modest wealth holdings throughout middle and late life. Below are brief reviews of the literature on racial and gender inequality in wealth and explanations for the wealth gaps, followed by a discussion of how race and gender disadvantages are hypothesized to shape black women’s wealth trajectories. Next, the data and methods utilized are discussed, followed by a description of analysis results. Finally, the conclusion section contextualizes the findings and discusses future directions for research as well as policy prescriptions.",33

Freeman,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The U.S. economy is characterized by persistent differentials in unemployment rates by race and Hispanic origin. Almost four decades ago, Leigh and Rawlins (1973) noted that “the ratio of the unemployment rate of black workers to that of whites has remained strikingly stable near 2 to 1 during the postwar period.” Since then the ratio remained well above 2.0 before finally declining in 2008 to 1.94 and further to 1.83 in 2010. The black/white disparity persists despite the near-doubling in completion rates of high school and college for blacks relative to whites since the early 1960s, and the passage since that time of a considerable amount of legislation aimed at ending discrimination in the workplace. Smaller but still substantial gaps exist historically between the rates of unemployment for Hispanics and whites, though as we show below, the latter gap has narrowed considerably. Are these gaps converging at all in the long run? Are they the same in different regions of the country, where the proportions of minority populations differ? This paper will address these questions by conducting time series tests on unemployment rates for whites, blacks, and Hispanics and on the ratios of black/white and Hispanic/white rates nationally and across the four regions of the U.S.: Northeast, Midwest, South, and West. The experiences of these groups are very different over time and across space. Over the past 40 years, for example, white unemployment on an annual basis has only briefly exceeded 10%, during 1982–1983, and then only in the Midwest. By contrast, black unemployment in the Midwest has been more than 10% for all but 6 years in the same period. In another example, Hispanic unemployment rates have often matched and even exceeded rates for blacks in the Northeast and West, but have remained well below black rates in the Midwest and South. Such disparities in outcomes call into question the concept of the unemployment rate, whether nationally or for a specific group or region. Simple calculations like those above are enough to show that historical averages are different across groups and regions, but determining the degree of persistence of these differences requires a deeper analysis. At the extreme, rates for one or more groups may be non-stationary, or integrated of order one, implying differences may well diverge. Even when series are stationary, different subgroups may converge to different levels, so that gaps may persist over the long run. The basic hypotheses to be tested are three: That unemployment rates converge to stationary means: rates may fluctuate, but eventually converge to levels that are, for given demographic groups and given regions, constant over time. Even in periods of strong economic growth, some percentage of the population, amounting to millions of workers, are unemployed; that these percentages differ across demographic groups is well-documented and the subject of a large literature, as briefly summarized in Previous research section. If confirmed, this hypothesis implies that ratios between demographic groups and across regions are likewise constant over time. That unemployment rates converge to means that are subject to occasional shifts, or “structural breaks.” Conditions in labor markets are subject to change: for example, better information, fewer rigidities, and more flexible regulations could lead to declines in frictional unemployment. On the reverse side, greatly enhanced worker protections and increasingly generous unemployment benefits likely contributed to significant increases in many European unemployment rates since the oil crises of the early 1970s. Shifting means describe moving targets for adjustments to transitory shocks and could imply a narrowing of the gaps if, for example, educational differences between groups were to narrow. That unemployment rates diverge; that is to say, that rates are the sums of random shocks, so that any new shock has a permanent effect. Blanchard and Summers (1986), noting relatively high rates of European unemployment and stable, not falling inflation rates, attributed persistent unemployment to groups of “insiders” and “outsiders”: the former the remaining employed, who wish to preserve their relatively privileged status; the latter the unemployed, who lack the power or influence to get their jobs back. An alternative version of this story is that being detached from the labor market for a length of time makes the unemployed undesirable to employers, as skills erode or become obsolete in a dynamic environment. The term “hysteresis,” denoting a system with memory, exhibiting path-dependence, describes unemployment that arises from being unemployed. Gaps between groups will be stable provided only that the series are cointegrated; that is, that their difference is stationary. In the language of time series analysis, Hypothesis 1 is characterized by stationarity; Hypothesis 2 by stationarity with structural breaks; and Hypothesis 3 by non-stationarity. The techniques to be employed are straightforward applications of the Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt, and Shin (1992, hereinafter KPSS) test with the null hypothesis of stationarity, generalized to accommodate structural breaks (Hypotheses 1 & 2); and confirmatory analysis using augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests, with the null of non-stationarity, again accommodating the possibility of structural breaks (Hypothesis 3). These tests will provide, in addition to confirmation of stationarity, evidence of the evolution of the gaps between demographic groups and regions. The stylized facts so described provide a record to policy makers of the progress (or lack of it) in ensuring that no group suffers disproportionately in response to economic distress. The plan of the paper is as follows. Previous research section provides a brief review of previous literature. Description of the data and methodology section describes the data and lays out the empirical approach; Results of stationarity tests on unemployment rates section conducts stationarity tests on unemployment levels; Results of stationarity tests on employment ratios section conducts stationarity tests on unemployment ratios; Discussion section provides some additional discussion, and Conclusion section concludes.",3

Given many more welfare recipients are women versus men, an analysis focused on women’s preference or inclination for welfare usage is useful. In the early 90s there were several studies that suggested abuse of the welfare system. In reaction to these findings and public perception that individuals, specifically immigrants and minorities, were abusing the U.S. welfare system, Congress decided to tighten the grips by passing the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) in 1996. The legislation ended welfare as an entitlement program, restricted the eligibility of immigrants to various programs, and provided stricter conditions for eligibility for Americans. Post welfare reform, the share of the population on welfare shrunk considerably as many past welfare recipients were forced to seek jobs (Greenwell et al. 1998). However, recent studies suggest significant negative effects of welfare reform on the poor, especially poor women (Carnochan et al. 2005). They note that the vast majority of these individuals are still living below the poverty line and thus at risk of going back into the system. Though there is evidence in the literature that immigrants and minority racial groups use welfare more than citizens and Whites respectively (Borjas 1994, 1999; Borjas and Hilton 1996; Blau 1984; Hansen and Lofstrom 2003), the relevant question to ask is if immigrants or minorities have an inclination for welfare in comparison to comparable Whites. This is because a higher use of welfare by one group over the other may just reflect the differences in income or employability across these groups. A priori there is no reason to expect differential inclination for welfare across race. This is important because welfare eligibility is determined on the basis of needs; hence usage should be driven by similar criteria. However, given past research that suggests a public perception of preference for welfare for most minorities and immigrants, and the fact that some attribute poverty and welfare dependency of welfare recipients to their own lack of drive and attitude towards employment (Gilens 1999; Davis and Hagen 1996; Hunt 1996; Smith and Stone 1989; Greenwell et al. 1998), it becomes useful to investigate if an inclination for welfare exists for women from certain birthplaces or race/ethnicity. Although the existing literature on welfare programs has widely discussed the impact of the reform on poverty, marriage and other socioeconomic indicators,Footnote 1 it has, however, failed to discuss if there is racial preference in its usage—despite widespread public perception (Kellstedt 2003). Only a few papers have focused on preference for welfare usage across groups in the U.S. For example, Oyelere and Oyolola (2011) investigate differences in welfare by birthplace and citizenship status. We follow along these lines in our analysis of women’s welfare usage. Our two main questions of interest are: (a) Is there any racial/ethnic differences in welfare usage among comparable women? (b) Does experience/exposure as captured by birthplace affect welfare usage among comparable women? By comparable women, we are referring to women who should have similar levels of welfare usage given their characteristics. The characteristics we are referring to here are the factors that traditionally explain welfare usage. Our initial results suggest that race matters for welfare usage. However, this result is not robust and through further investigation we show that though some specific subgroups of women seem more inclined to use welfare in comparison to comparable White women, there is no evidence of differences in inclination for welfare use based on race. We also find that for most comparable women, birthplace does not matter for welfare usage. The only exception being women from U.S. territories. We find that these women are more likely to use welfare than comparable White women born in the U.S.Footnote 2
 This paper contributes to the literature by highlighting that among comparable women, there is no inclination for welfare usage based on race. Second, among comparable U.S. born and immigrant women, there is no difference in welfare use. This finding is important given evidence that the urge to pass welfare reform in 1996 was driven in part by a sense that immigrants and minorities had a preference for welfare use or were the face of welfare. (see Kellstedt 2003 and Martin Gilens 2003). Although the issue of race was rarely explicit, in the pre reform debates, Soss and Schram (2006) noted that arguments tended to carry a racial underpinning because so many Americans identified welfare recipients as poor black women or immigrants. The remainder of the paper is as follows. In “Data” we highlight the data and provide some descriptive statistics. In “Empirical strategy” we outline our empirical strategy and in “Results” we present our results. We conclude in the last section.",

Conrad,LaTanya N. Brown,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In addition to being an integral part of the American dream (Leigh and Huff 2007a,b), research has consistently demonstrated that homeownership is an acceptable indicator of social integration and economic well being. Homeownership, being a primary component of household wealth, confers benefits to the homeowner not just in terms of the value of home equity itself, but also the tax benefits and inflation protection associated with acquiring a property (Kain and Quigley 1975). Along with the private economic benefits, there is recent evidence that homeownership may have a positive effect on the owner’s behavior and on the children of homeowner (DiPasquale and Glaeser 1999). Additionally, a homeowner’s neighborhood choice has been found to create positive neighborhood externalities (Estrada 2005). The prevalence of homeownership however, is not universal. Across different demographic groups and even within different regions, homeownership rates vary widely. Many of these demographic inconsistencies are longstanding, resulting in significant differences in access to the social benefits of homeownership from community to community (Sykes 2005). For instance, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (n.d.) reported that despite increases in housing sales there were differences in homeownership rates for households of different ethnicities. Specifically, from the first quarter in 2007 to the first quarter in 2010 the African American homeownership rate dropped from 48% to 45.6% (2.4% decrease), while whites homeownership dropped by 0.8% from 75.3% to 74.5% (Jourdain-Earl 2011). In essence, African Americans are three times more likely than whites to lose their homes. While there are a number of demographic and socioeconomic factors that have been identified as determinants of homeownership, research demonstrates that race differences in homeownership rates persist even after accounting for life-cycle, resource, preferences, and regional differences across groups (Myers and Chung 1996 and Alba and Logan 1992). For example, Leigh and Huff (2007a, b) reported that the homeownership gap between the lowest income blacks and lowest income whites is the greatest gap between black and white homeowners at any income level and this gap has increased from 22% to 25.8% between 1970 and 2001. Because neighborhood quality, including schools, may have disproportionate effects on children, racial gaps in homeownership and home values may tend to perpetuate themselves and to reinforce gaps in other social outcomes such as income, employment, and criminal behavior. Past studies used the various twentieth century Integrated Public Use Microdata (IPUMS) to study the long-run evolution of racial differences in homeownership and housing values among male household heads. However, the proportion of black households headed by females has increased over time relative to the proportion of whites. Consequently research should be expanded to include female households to avoid giving a misleading portrait of racial change over time. In addition to the paucity of studies that examine the effect homeownership inequality among women. William Darity (2005) challenges economists to develop and / or adopt a theoretical framework to understand the persistence of ethnic and racial inequalities of well-being, income, and wealth. To this end, this study seeks to examine the impact that cyclical fluctuations in the economy have on the likelihood of homeownership for black and white women.",2

Teacher Perceptions of Black Girls in the Classroom,September 2012,Dania V. Francis,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"In Margaret Simms and Julianne Malveaux’s influential volume Slipping through the Cracks, Margaret Wilkerson (1986), Lynn Burbridge (1986) and Harriett Harper (1986) sounded the alarm with regard to continuing disparities in black women’s educational attainment and on-the-job training. Twenty-five years later, there is still cause for concern. Diette (this issue) demonstrates that black female students still are less likely to take advanced math courses than their white counterparts and Campbell (this issue) sheds light on the mechanisms behind the differences in advanced course taking by exploring the relationship between the characteristics and behaviors of black female students and the probability of their being recommended for advanced courses. This paper complements the work of Diette and Campbell by examining the ways in which teacher perceptions of student behavior relate to their likelihood of recommending students for advanced courses. Teachers often make subjective judgments about student behavior, and these behavior perceptions may influence their decisions to recommend those students to advanced or remedial courses or instructional ability groups (Condron 2007; Hughes et al. 2005). There is evidence that being placed in a low-level instructional group can have negative repercussions for student academic performance not only in a student’s current grade, but throughout the remainder of their academic trajectory as students who start in low level groups are less likely to take the advanced courses required for admission in to selective universities (Darity and Jolla 2009; Dauber et al. 1996; Eder 1981; Lleras and Rangel 2009; Oakes 2005). For this reason, it is important to have a better understanding of the degree to which teacher perceptions of student behavior vary across student racial background categories. In this paper I pay specific attention to teacher perceptions of black female students by using a nationally representative sample of eighth grade students and their teachers to compare the perceptions that teachers hold for black females with the perceptions that teachers hold for female students from other racial backgrounds in the areas of attentiveness and disruptiveness. I control for a host of other variables that might influence teacher perceptions such as student socioeconomic status, student test scores, classroom racial composition, and school racial and socioeconomic composition. I extend the analysis by estimating the relationship between teacher subjective perceptions and the likelihood of that teacher recommending a student for honors classes. I find that black female students are perceived as less attentive and more disruptive than their white, Hispanic, and Asian counterparts. The differences in perceptions of attentiveness but not disruptiveness are mitigated after controlling for academic performance and socioeconomic status. Further, perceptions of attentiveness are significantly related to the probability that a teacher recommends a student for honors courses. This can have important implications for the academic trajectory of black girls.",21

Racial Composition and Access to School Resources for Black Students,September 2012,Timothy M. Diette,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Rigorous courses are an important resource, distributed within schools, that merit attention as a central determinant of student achievement and future outcomes (Cook and Evans 2000; Rose and Betts 2004). Yet, black students are less likely to be enrolled in advanced courses (ex. Darity et al. 2001; Klopfenstein 2005) and specifically Algebra 1 (Riley 1997). Some researchers and policymakers have put the primary focus for improving opportunities and outcomes for black students on increased access to white students (ex. Orfield and Lee 2005). This view is supported by research that suggests that black students are negatively affected by attending schools with higher concentrations of black students (ex. Hanushek et al. 2009; Grogger 1996). Other research questions whether increases in exposure to white students improve outcomes for black students (ex. Darity 2001; Diette et al. 2011; Kelly 2009). This study examines the relationship between the disparity in access to Algebra 1 in middle school and school characteristics in North Carolina. Of particular concern is investigating the relationship between access and the percentage of white students in a school. Following previous work, the study investigates potential nonlinear effects of racial composition. The results of this study suggest that: (1) black students are underrepresented in Algebra 1 in essentially all middle schools; (2) the largest disparities in enrollment occur in schools that are highly integrated while the disparities are reduced in schools with either large majority white or large majority non-white populations; (3) schools with a larger share of white teachers have larger disparities in enrollment between black students and white students; (4) the disparity in enrollment between black female students and white females students appears to be more responsive to changes in racial composition than the disparity for males. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a brief survey of related literature. Section 3 discusses the data and the descriptive statistics. Section 4 explains the empirical strategy and Section 5 reports the results of the study. Section 6 concludes.",7

Jeffries,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"When what we now know as HIV/AIDS was first diagnosed in the early 80s, it was called 4-H disease, because it was primarily found among Haitians, homosexuals, hemophiliacs and injection drug (heroin) users (Gallo 2006). Over time HIV and AIDS came to be more solidly associated with gay, white men. But a look at the data shows that the rates of HIV infection are rising at alarming and disproportionate rates among black women. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the rate of new infection is almost 15 times as high among black women as that of white women. And African Americans are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS at every stage of the disease—from diagnosis to death rate. Some research shows that HIV/AIDS related illness is now the leading cause of death among black women ages 25–34 (U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services 2010). While the notion has been that certain women were at risk—women with multiple partners, women partnered with incarcerated men or men who sleep with men—HIV infection rates are also high among Black women outside these risk groups. For example, Michelle Linster’s research addresses the rise in the HIV rate among black women over the age of 50 (Linster 2011). According to the CDC, HIV/AIDS rates were 12 times as high among African Americans over age 50 compared with whites (Dept. of Health and Human Services 2008). Why are older women at risk? Some experts believe this population of women do not see themselves as “at risk” so they may not be as proactive about being tested, checking their partners’ status or taking measures to protect themselves. Stigma and denial are contributing factors as well, according to the CDC (Dept. of Health and Human Services 2008). Stigma is so acute in the Black community that some people would rather not to know their HIV status than to admit to having it. If there is good news it is that, over the past three decades, treatments have become more effective in prolonging the lives of people living with AIDS (PLWA) (Dept. of Health and Human Services 2008). And there is continued effort to address the infection rates, access to care and HIV-related health disparities—from the federal level to the grassroots.",1

Gray,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This section describes the data of the 1998 and 2003 Surveys of Small Business Finance as it relates to college education and BFHB and NFHB relative loan repayment ability. Both surveys oversampled minority-owned firms but provided weights to be nationally representative. The 1998 survey was collected in 1999 and 2000 and provided information on 1998. The 2003 survey was collected in 2004 and 2005 and provided information for 2003. There were 2,256,175 NFHFs in the 2003 survey, of which 681,496 (30.2 %) applied for a loan; and 1,400,932 NFHFs in the 1998 survey, of which 302,071 (21.6 %) applied for a loan. In the 2003 survey there were 121,062 BFHFs, 42,406 (35 %) of which applied for a loan, and in the 1998 survey there were 79,999 BFHFs, 15,024 (18.8 %) of which applied for a loan. From 1998 to 2003 both NFHFs and BFHFs had a significant increase in their application rate but NFHFs had an significant increase in there average approval rate, from 71.4 % to 87 %, while BFHF’s experienced only a minor increase in their approval rate from 35 % to 38 %. Neither the difference in the approval rates nor the difference in the change in approval rates is evidence of discrimination in credit markets between BFHFs and NFHFs across the two periods. The weakest evidence of discrimination requires that firms of similar creditworthiness have different loan approval rates due to their race. The data shows that on average BFHFs and NFHFs have different characteristics that could drive the two groups diverging approval rates. Both the 1998 and 2003 SSBF data show that on the average BFHFs and NFHFs differ substantially in both willingness-to-pay and ability-to-pay. Table 1 presents weighted-sample means for measures of credit-worthiness and other characteristics of BFHFs and NFHFs in 1998 and 2003. In 1998 BFHFs were on average rated riskier by Dunn and Bradstreet’s credit score, an industry measure of willingness to pay. They were more likely to have demonstrated a firm or owner delinquency, were smaller, younger, had less cash, and were less likely to have a college-educated owner. In 2003 BFHFs were still on average riskier but now the selected sample is larger, older, with more cash on hand, higher profit to liability ratios, and higher educational attainment which suggest a higher ability-to-pay. Another interesting thing to note when comparing the 1998 and 2003 sample is that, in 1998 NFHFs and BFHFs were equally divided between operating in competitive and non-competitive areas as indicated by the firms Herfindahl index while in 2003 BFHFs were more likely to operate in a concentrated market than NFHFs. Since the average characteristics of BFHFs and NFHFs are so different differences in average approval rates do not imply discrimination. The differences in average characteristics do provide insight as to why members of the two groups may be illegally treated with different standards; as no one expects an apple’s crispness from a lemon. The next section delineates the evidence and shows that controlling for the BFHFs relative lack of credit worthiness, high application rates, high presence in concentrated markets, etc., cannot account for their significantly lower approval rates. As such, this paper presents strong evidence of discrimination against BFHFs in the market for small business loans.",5
39.0,4.0,The Review of Black Political Economy,20 June 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12114-012-9140-8,The Plight of African American Women: Employed and Unemployed,December 2012,Linda Loubert,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Women’s participation in the labor force has grown over the past centuries. Today, women constitute almost half of the payroll employment and their parity in pay compared to men has grown to 80 % (U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee 2010). Changes are taking place for greater parity in pay but at a slow pace. Affirmative Action and Equal Employment Opportunity laws from the 1950s and 1960s have helped mitigate some the unfairness, but, alas, it still remains. These laws appeared to reduce the racial and gender disparities in the beginning but by the 1980s the disparities grew (Darity and Mason 1998), particularly for black women (Newsome and Nii-AmooDoDoo 2002; Pettit and Ewert 2009). Employment patterns as well as wages declined (Newsome and Nii-AmooDoDoo 2002) while no new policy was implemented to improve social or economic status of black women to counteract growing disparities. African American women showed gains of human capital and from what traditional economics explains, they should have shown gains in access to jobs but that was not the case (Newsome and Nii-AmooDoDoo 2002). As the need for family financial security increases women have joined the labor market even while juggling the care of their children. Some of these women are single with children noting that the 2000 Census indicates that about 25 % of households are single parents raising their families, which is an increase, however small, since 1990. Black families have even much higher rates of single parent households (Darity et al. 1998). There’s been over a 40 % increase in the numbers of women working over the last 25 years, but the percentages of full and part-time workers remain pretty constant(U.S. Department of Labor 2009, U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee 2010). The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2011) reported that 59 % of working-age women were in the labor force as of 2009, representing an increase of approximately 18 % since 1970. It is expected that there will be a 9 % increase by year 2018. The basic economic cost of unemployment for any group within the borders of the United States is foregone output. Under the rubrics of neoclassical economics, the circular flow expands when businesses can employ workers who then have the money to buy the outputs. It follows to have as many workers as possible employed so the demand for products and services not only continues, but grows. This model, also, gives no insight as to why discrimination in employment opportunities and wage rates continues to exit between black and white workers. If workers are paid by their marginal product then workers with the same skill who do the same work, should be paid the same amount. Workers who compete for a job will keep the wages no higher than the additional output or marginal product of the last worker. Firms on the other hand will compete for workers and thus keep wages no lower than the marginal product. In other words, wages then settle at the level that reflects marginal productivity. The problem, with this approach from a productivity side, is that a wage differential for white and black women still exits. Even the big picture of aggregate demand and aggregate supply give no explanation as to why unemployment for black women, at its lowest rate was still slightly above the highest rate for white women. During times of declining GDP and slower growth, finding ways to make sure that more people are working is important and yet that task remains undone. This investigation sheds light on the racial differences for Blacks and whites and then, in particular, with the female gender it underscore a divide that keeps growing even when the economy bounces back from a business cycle trough. The following data in Figs. 1 and 2 help to illustrate the disparities found in employment/unemployment for African Americans women. We round off our investigation by using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to underscore the significance of the location of work.

Loving,Michael S. Finke,John R. Salter,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"The racial gap in wealth between minorities and Whites has been a subject of research for quite some time (Terrell, 1971; Smith, 1975; Blau & Graham, 1990; Wolff, 1998; Menchik and Jianakoplos, 1997; Altonji and Doraszelski 2005, 2001; Altonji et al. 2000). The explanations for this large and persistent gap in wealth typically focus on either, past inequity and the inheritances Whites receive because of it or present differences in saving and investing and their impact on wealth. The period between 2000 and 2004 is a source of discussion for the latter. Blacks and Hispanics had made tremendous strides in investing in the nineties, and early 2000’s to the point that participation rates of minorities and Whites were nearly identical in 2000 once education and income were accounted for (Hanna & Lindamood, 2008; Ariel-Schwab, 2007). However, by 2004 minorities had a much lower likelihood of being equity investors. In contrast, Whites were just as likely to be investors in 2004 as they were in 2000. This difference in minority participation is attributed to the drops in equity prices over that time period. The cause for this divergent behavior is unknown. Hanna & Lindamood (2008) examine the race-based differences in market participation using the Survey of Consumer Finances. They find that their model which includes risk tolerance and a host of demographic characteristics fails to explain the difference in stock ownership likelihood among the races. They suggest that these differences may be due to investor inexperience. This paper examines whether the racial differences in investor behavior in 2004 were due primarily to race or to differences in cognitive ability and investor experience. We use proxies for cognitive ability (IQ) and investor experience and discover that racial effects do not remain significant in predicting the likelihood of owning stock in 2004. We then examine racial effects on the amount of stock ownership in 2000 and 2004 and find that minority status does not impact stock and mutual fund holdings once we account for differences in cognitive ability and investor experience. However, there is a strong significantly positive effect of being White on the balance of stocks and mutual funds in 2000 and 2004. Finally we find that the tendency to divest from the market is a phenomenon independent of race. We conclude with discussion of how policy might improve the likelihood of more productive investment behavior among minorities.",

Hamilton,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Most subgroups of black immigrants from the Caribbean earn less than U.S.-born blacks (black natives) when they first arrive in the United States (Model 2008). However, these immigrants begin to close their initial earnings deficit as their tenure in the United States increases. This pattern of earnings assimilation results in greater unadjusted earnings for some subgroups of Caribbean immigrants, particularly those from the English-speaking Caribbean (Kalmijn 1996; Model 2008). Since Caribbean immigrants and black natives share the same phenotype, some scholars and policy makers argue that differences in work ethic, attitudes toward work, and work culture between Caribbean-born blacks and black natives produce labor market differences between the two groups (Glazer and Moynihan 1979; Sowell 1978). While research shows that unadjusted differences in labor market outcomes between Caribbean immigrants and black natives are partly the result of disparate labor market characteristics (Mason 2010; Model 2008), much of this literature has ignored the experiences of black Caribbean women, particularly those from the non-English-speaking Caribbean, as well as cohort of arrival variation in earnings among subgroups of Caribbean immigrants. Moreover, few papers have empirically tested the mechanisms—culture, employer preferences, or selective migration—that are argued to generate the earnings assimilation patterns observed for both male and female Caribbean immigrants (Model 2008; Sowell 1981; Waters 1999). This paper tests whether selective migration explains earnings differences between U.S.-born and Caribbean-born black women in the United States. Utilizing data on U.S.-born and Caribbean-born women from the 1980–2000 U.S. Censuses and the 2000–2007 American Community Surveys, I show that upon arrival in the United States, most arrival cohorts of Caribbean women have lower earnings than black native women (collectively). In models that attempt to account for the impact of selective migration on earnings by comparing the earnings of black immigrant women to U.S.-born black women who have moved across states since birth (black native movers), I show that the initial earnings gap between black native movers and Caribbean immigrants is significantly greater than the gap between all black natives and Caribbean immigrants. I also show that while arrival cohorts of women from the French-speaking (Haiti) and English-speaking Caribbean are projected to achieve earnings parity and eventually surpass the earnings of black natives (collectively), fewer cohorts from these regions are projected to surpass the earnings of black native movers. Additionally, a longer tenure of U.S. residence is required for these immigrants to surpass the earnings of black native movers. In summary, since the earnings profiles of black immigrants are more similar to the earnings profiles of black native movers than of black native non-movers, these results suggest that selective migration is an important determinant of nativity differences in earnings among black women in the United States. This paper also documents significant variation in earnings by cohort of arrival for each immigrant subgroup. The primary mechanisms that are purported to generate cultural differences among blacks are socialization in a majority black society or differences in slave histories (Sowell 1978; Waters 1999). Since neither the racial composition nor the slave histories of the major sending countries of black immigrants change over time, the documented variation in earnings by cohort of arrival suggests that cultural differences among blacks is not the primary mechanism that drives labor market differences among blacks. Moreover, it is unlikely that employers possess sufficient information to engage in disparate treatment of different arrival cohorts of immigrants. As a result, these empirical findings do not support the claim that employer preferences drive labor market differences between U.S.-born and Caribbean-born black women. While previous studies show this result for immigrants from the English-speaking Caribbean (Model 2008), this study shows that this trend also holds for women from Haiti and the Spanish-speaking Caribbean. The remainder of this paper will proceed as follows: Section II presents the background, Section III describes the data and methodology used in the study, Section IV presents results, and Section V offers conclusions.",4

Kenney,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"This publication is a written record of the symposium, “The Invisible Woman: The Status of and Challenges Facing Black Women” that was co-sponsored by Bennett College for Women, The Research Network on Racial and Ethnic Inequality, Duke University and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The symposium convened a new generation of scholars to expound on the research from the landmark book, Slipping through the Cracks: The Status of Black Women, which was published 25 years ago. Slipping through the Cracks elevated the experiences of Black women, a group of whose needs are often silenced and problems left unsolved. Dr. Julianne Malveaux, President of Bennett College, argues that the intersection of race and gender renders Black women invisible as policies that focus on Blacks and women typically focus on Black men and White women respectively. However, the intersection of race and gender both determine Black women’s economic, social, political and educational status and therefore, Black women warrant their own analysis. Footnote 1
 Over the past 25 years, there have been significant triumphs for Black women, including the prominent rise of the first Black first lady Michelle Obama—wife of the United State’s first Black president, Barack Obama. However, Black women continue to face significant challenges. In addition, Black women are shouldering more responsibilities due to what Dr. Malveaux calls the “third burden”—the consequences from the demonization and marginalization of Black men.Footnote 2 Therefore, any recommendations to improve the Black community must examine the status of Black women, specifically as it relates to single parent families, education and training, employment, health, wealth and development. The remainder of this introduction places readers in the context of Black women’s experiences by providing a brief overview of their status, with respect to the aforementioned areas, 25 years ago in relation to today. By the 1980’s, Black women headed over half of the Black households and out-of-wedlock births were the leading cause. Due to their limited economic and human resources, low-income single Black mothers struggled to cover household expenses (e.g., food, childcare, etc.) and over one-half of these families lived in poverty.Footnote 3 Legislative policies exacerbated the challenges facing these families. The federal government began curtailing financial assistance to needy families and over the past couple decades the government instituted other provisions severely weakening the social safety net. For instance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) have not always lead to self-sufficiency nor provided substantial support and relief to single Black families. In fact, despite TANF moving many single mothers into jobs, poverty rates for Black single families remains obstinately high.Footnote 4
 Twenty-five years later, Black single parent families have increased significantly. Black women head over 60 % of Back households due to factors such as the shortage of men, delay in marriage, low marriage rates and the overall rise in cohabitation across the population.Footnote 5 Research will show that early cohabitation rates among Blacks remain low in comparison to White and Hispanic Americans. However, Black women account for the second highest rate of out-of-wedlock births relative to other racial groups.Footnote 6 Using the economic theory of fertility and marriage, we attempt to understand the growth of out-of-wedlock childbearing in the Black community. The theory suggest with men in short supply, low-income women are more likely to bear children outside of wedlock at their own cost, thereby driving down the costs of fatherhood. And the economic costs facing single Black mothers are tremendous. In 2008, the median income for single mother households was $30,129 with Black and Latino single mother households yielding even less at $25,011 and $23,866, respectively.Footnote 7 Limited jobs skills and education exacerbate these economic hardships as these limitations constrain low-income single Black mothers’ earning potential in the future. By the 1980’s, Black women’s education gains began to erode. Black women were graduating from high school at higher rates; however, their dropout rates were higher than white women and men. In addition, Black women’s matriculation rate in higher education institutions decreased. Black women represented less than 5 % of students enrolled in U.S. higher education institutions and even fewer Black women were represented at graduate and professional level schools. It is important to note that in absolute terms more Black women were earning degrees at all levels of higher education - a notable achievement. However, in relative terms, Black women’s degree attainment rate remained lower proportionately than white men and women. Several policy changes contributed to the erosion of Black women’s education gains, including the federal government’s reduction in financial assistance programs. In addition, the federal government distanced itself from education equity, which notably affected Black women and was demonstrated by the decline of Black women’s applications to graduate and professional schools.Footnote 8
 Twenty-five years later, Black women are making significant strides in both secondary and post secondary education; but they continue to face challenges. “No Child Left Behind” has not closed the racial achievement gap and resource disparities, such unequal access to quality classes, continue to exist in schools based on race and socioeconomic status.Footnote 9 We examine research that suggests that while Black girls participate in advanced placement courses more frequently than Black boys, Black girls lack access to these classes relative to Whites. In addition, research suggests that Black girls access to these classes is contingent upon their teacher’s perception of them, which tends to be less favorable relative to non-black students. These implications are significant as Black girls lack of access to college preparatory courses significantly affects their educational outcomes in secondary and post secondary institutions. Almost 30 % of Black women have college degrees and Black women earn over two-thirds of Bachelors, Masters and Doctoral degrees.Footnote 10 In addition, research suggests that Black women’s professional outcomes in academia are improving. In the 1980’s, Black women held fewer academic positions, were more likely relegated to junior ranks and received tenure in lower numbers.Footnote 11 However, 25 years later, research will demonstrate that Black female professors are facing fewer challenges than their predecessors. The employment status of Black women 25 years ago compared to today suggests that progress has been slow with marginal improvement. Historically, Black women have experienced unemployment and underemployment at disproportionately higher levels than their white counterparts have. During the 1980’s, the proportion of Black women in service occupations was substantially higher than that for white women.Footnote 12 In addition to occupational segmentation, Black women have lower lifetime earnings due to the racial wage gap. While Black women are more likely to be employed, they earn significantly less wages.Footnote 13 Presently Black women earn 64 cents for every dollar a white man earns.Footnote 14 While wage disparities exist across industries, we examine the nursing industry, where research suggests that non-union Black nurses are more likely to experience a wage penalty than non-union white nurses. In addition, Black women’s income vitality is examined as research suggests that Black women’s income volatility is rising; but that it is also influenced by education level and marital status. Over the past 25 years, legislation, such as the Equal Pay Act, were enacted to protect women and minorities from labor market discrimination. However, Black women’s benefits from these policies are mixed as Black women continue to experience discrimination in the labor market due to race and gender. To begin to remedy these disparities, President Obama passed the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to restore victims’ protection against wage discrimination based on age, religion, national origin, race, sex and disability. It is with cautious optimism that we hope this Act will significantly begin to improve the employment outcomes for Black women. From the cradle to the grave, Black women have some of the poorest health outcomes relative to other racial groups.Footnote 15 In the 1980’s, Black women were at a higher risk for both acute and long-term illnesses including obesity, diabetes and cancer.Footnote 16 A quarter of a century later, Black women’s mortality and morbidity rates remain higher than most other racial/ethnic groups. Black women and obesity receive considerable attention due to its prevalence in the Black community. Therefore, we examine the social determinant religiosity and its relationship to for obesity. We further broaden the conversation on Black women’s health by discussing another social determinant, mass imprisonment, and its impact on increasing Black women’s risk factors for cardiovascular disease (e.g., hypertension, diabetes and obesity). In addition, we discuss preventing HIV/AIDS in older Black women as they are contracting the deadly disease at an alarming rate.Footnote 17
 Before the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2011, decades passed since the passage of any major health care reform to address Black women’s health. Fortunately, the Affordable Care Act represents a major overhaul of the Nation’s healthcare system and it enables millions of Black women to have access to health care coverage. In addition, the bill includes provisions such as increasing black women’s access to preventive screenings such as mammograms, colonoscopies and immunizations, which are major steps to addressing the racial health disparities Black women face. We hope this legislation significantly improves the health outcomes of Black women because as Dr. Malveaux states “… maintaining the health of Black women is important to maintaining the health of the community.”Footnote 18
 One of the greatest challenges facing Black women is the racial wealth divide, as Black women posses significantly less wealth than Black men, White men and White and Hispanic women.Footnote 19 Historically, discrimination, government policies and even acts of violence have prohibited Blacks from generating wealth.Footnote 20 Consequentially, prior to the age of 50, the majority of Black women have virtually no wealth at all.Footnote 21 And at middle-age and older-age, research suggests that Black women have low levels of net worth and net financial assets suggesting that they are more likely to face economic insecurity later in life. Therefore, we examine how the intersection of race and gender places Black women in a vulnerable economic position and identify strategies for asset building and wealth generation. Homeownership is the main pathway to wealth; yet, research shows that there are significant differences in the likelihood of homeownership between White women and Black women. Policies deregulating the financial market have contributed to the rise of subprime mortgages and predatory lending and black women, particularly upper income black women, were one of the primary targets.Footnote 22 We examine the consequences of the subprime mortgage crisis on black women and its implications on home equity and wealth for Blacks and future generations of Blacks. In 2011, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act were enacted to address the existing and entrenched structural and institutional barriers to wealth accumulation. It intends to promote financial stability and protect families from future unfair financial practices. We recognize this Act as an important step to assist Black women in accessing fair and equal opportunities to build wealth and equity. Many of the challenges facing Black women are not unique to the United State; but are challenges experienced by many women of the African Diaspora. Therefore, this research provides valuable insight into these women’s economic and social contributions in developing countries. We examine the intersection of race, class and gender in Nigeria, in respect to children’s work in which poor young girls are more likely to work relative to other children. We examine the earnings of black immigrant women and U.S. black women in comparative perspective. In addition, we examine the relationship that race and immigrants’ birthplace has on welfare usage. The research suggests that the intersection of race, gender and class has similar implications on Black women in both industrial and developing countries.",2

40.0,1.0,The Review of Black Political Economy,12 May 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12114-013-9167-5,Still Slipping: African-American Women in the Economy and in Society,March 2013,Julianne Malveaux,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"African American women still “slip between the cracks” with some data collection and reporting. For example, the most recent report of the Digest of Educational Statistics reports on race or gender but not both (Tables Eight and Nine). Still, we know that the proportion of African Americans with college degree nearly doubled from 10.9 % in 1986 to 20.2 % in 2011 (www.nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid+2012001). While African American male college enrollment once exceeded African American women’s enrollment, for the past decade, two-thirds of the African Americans in college have been African American women. As African American women increased both their numbers and proportion of college attendees and graduates, occupational options increased. Still, African American women, whether in elite occupations or crowded into typically female service and clerical jobs, experience a pay gap between their earning and those of white women, Black men, and white men. To be sure, African American men are more likely to be unemployed than African American women, but when they are in the labor market, their median income is higher than that of African American women. While African American women’s occupational options have expanded, occupational opportunities have eroded both because of the Great Recession (2008–2012) and because of the rising tide of conservatism in our nation. The focus on balancing the federal budget, which means cutting the federal workforce, and freezing federal salaries (which have been level since 2009), has a disproportionate impact on African American women, more than 22 % of whom work for governments, compared to just under 17 % of white workers (Wright 2011). Why? African American women are more likely to be teachers, nurses or social workers than others, and the public sector is more likely to employ those workers. Additionally and parenthetically, African American women and men have a smaller pay gap through government employment than through private sector employment. State and local governments laid off at least142,000 workers in 2011 (Williams 2011). Again, a disproportionate number of these were African American women. Many would argue that pay freezes and payroll cuts are economic necessity, not racially motivated, but all too often race-neutral public policy has a disproportionate racial impact. Affirmative action policies opened some doors for African American women, yet these policies have been repeated attacked and the reach of affirmative action eroded, since 1986. The rationale is the fiction that our country is now “race-neutral” and that the election of an African American president reflects the diminution of racial attitudes in our nation. The rising tide of conservatism has meant a retreat from affirmative action policies. The majority of the Supreme Court ruled, in 2003 that certain forms of affirmative action are illegal in Gratz v. Bollinger, a case where a mediocre white student argued that she would have been admitted to the University of Michigan but for affirmative action policies. Because of public referenda, race based affirmative action is illegal in California, Michigan, Washington, Nebraska, and Arizona. The Supreme Court will hear the Fisher v. University of Texas case sometime in the fall of 2012. This is yet another case of a mediocre white student arguing that she would have been admitted to UT but for affirmative action. While lower courts have ruled in favor of the University of Texas, and the Supreme Court had no obligation to take this case, those who oppose affirmative action have taken advantage of the fact that the Roberts court has been hostile in race matters. The disporportionality in these policies is reflected in differential unemployment rates by race and gender. The overall unemployment rate dropped from 9.0 % in May 2011 to 8.2 % in May 2012 has been heralded as a sign of economic recovery, albeit one that is weak and unstable. There were similar drops in every race-sex group, with white women’s rate dropping from 7.1 to 6.7 %, and Black women’s rate dropping from 13.4 to 11.4 %. In the 3 months between March and May 2012, however, every race-sex group saw employment rise in every race-sex group except African American women. White women’s employment rose by 200,000, while African American women’s employment dropped by 100,000. Some would consider this miniscule (less than 1 % of total Black women’s employment), but the crowing about recovery while African American women have lost work speaks to a systematic disregard for black women (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2012). The employment situation for African American women is compounded by the pay gap that these women experience. African American women earn 85 cents for every dollar earned by white women, and 63 cents for every dollar earned by white men (www.NationalPartnership.org). While we are regularly reminded of the narrowing pay gap between men and women (with women currently earning 77 cents for every dollar men earn), and President Obama’s Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act (2008) addresses some ways to close the gap, the pay gap that African American women experience is rarely addressed. Gaps in both employment and pay explain the limited wealth of African American women. A 2010 study by the Insight Center for Community Economic Development (www.insightcced.org/uploads/CWRG/LiftingAsWeClimb-WoemnWealth-Report-InsightCenter-Sopring2010.pdf) reported that the average net worth of single middle aged (36 to 49) Black women (including those who head households and have children) is just $5, compared to $42,600 for single white women of the same age. This low level of wealth has implications for the children of these low-wealth women, and for African American families in general. African American women are the primary breadwinners in 44 % of African American families with children, and 72 % of all Black children are being raised in households headed by women. These families have no cushion at all, so recession, unemployment and economic turbulence hit these women-headed households harder than other households. While it is important to focus on the economic status of African American women, from Black community perspective it is also critical to consider it in the context of African American family formation and the economic status of African American men. Low wages, limited college participation, and higher unemployment rates affect the economic status of African American women, as well as African American families, and in many families shifts the burden of support from one that is shared to one that falls fully on the shoulders of women. Thus, African American women experience a third burden beyond race and gender, in that the economic status of African American men directly affects the status and options of African American women. Fully 3.1 million African American women are single mothers, and the status of these women affect’s their children’s options and life chances. While a college education is often seen as a bridge to a broader range of career options, affordability is a significant barrier to college for many African American youngsters, especially those who have been raised by single mothers whose low level of wealth precludes saving for college. Thus, while African American women outnumber men who are enrolled in college, hundreds of thousands of African American young people cannot go to college, or stay in college, simply because of the financial status of their parents. This has implications not only for these young people, but also for our nation, especially as President Obama has declared that the United States should lead the world in educational attainment, measured by the percentage of people who have had at least a A.A. degree. According to OECD data, while the United States leads the world in producing 55 to 64 year old bachelor’s degree recipients, with 31.1 % of that population holding degrees. The educational attainment of 25 to 34 year olds perhaps reflects more recent investments in education. Among that population, 32.3 % of US residents in that age group had BA degrees, placing us sixth behind Norway (43.8 %), the Netherlands (37.5 %), Denmark (34.9 %), Korea (34.5 %) and Sweden (32.4 %) (*). We will not lead the world again unless our nation is prepared to specifically invest in the education of African American and Latino young people, as this group represents the expanding demographic in our country. The economic status of African American women, combined with the “drug wars” affects the high levels of incarceration among African American women who are eight times as likely to be incarcerated as white women. Indeed, African American women are currently the fastest growing prison population in our nation. According to Meda Chesney-Lind, a sociology professor at the University of Hawaii, “National policies like zero tolerance are responsible for the school to prison pipeline. And a dual justice system that treats white girls differently from Black girls is disproportionately affecting African American girls”. Indeed, a 6-year-old Black girl was handcuffed in Milledgeville, Georgia for having a temper tantrum. One might wonder if a white girl would have been incarcerated, or if this incident is reflective of our nation’s disregard for Black women and girls. In 2008 in California, the arrest rate for Black girls was 49 for every 1,000, compared to 8.9 per 1,000 for white girls (Jefferson 2011). The differential economic status of African American women affects non-economic aspects of African American women’s lives, including health and health access. According to a recent study by the Kaiser Foundation, African American women are far more likely than white women to have no health coverage (22.4 % compared to 12.8 %), no personal doctor (17.3 % versus 13.2 %), to have had no dental checkups in 2 years (35 % versus 25 %), no doctor visit due to cost (21.9 % versus 14.7 %), and late prenatal care (23.9 % versus 11 %). While there may be other factors, these disparities are at least partly a function of cost (James et al. 2009). The outcome of these differences in access and affordability result in the differential incidence of life-threatening diseases by race. According to Dr. Doris Brown, “The leading cause of death for all women in the United States is heart disease, cancer, AIDS stroke, and diabetes. The death rates for these diseases among African American women continue to rise despite declining rates for whites. African American women have the highest cancer death rates for breast, colorectal and pancreatic cancers.” Dr. Brown also found that the 5-year cancer survival rate for African American women is 57 %, compared to 67 % for white women. While Dr. Brown writes that lifestyle choices affect health status, income and economic status are also a factor (Browne 2008). There is some good news in the health care arena, in that the life expectancy gap is narrowing, among white and Black women from 4.6 years to 3.7 years. The gap is closing because drug abuse is rising among whites. While proportionately more, African Americans abuse drugs than whites, the rate of drug use among African Americans is falling more rapidly (Harper et al. 2003). Perhaps public policy has ignored African American women so systematically because popular culture and the popular media have tended to demonize African American women as dependent welfare mothers, lewd, lascivious and sexually available women, and as unattractive, evil, neck-rolling and emasculating women. Given these stereotypes, Black women may be seen as less worthy of public policy attention. Since 1986, we have seen the vilification of Anita Hill, the law professor whose allegations against then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, were dismissed by some senators with demeaning statements about “erotomania”. From the floor of Congress, during the “welfare reform” debate in 1995–96, African American women on public assistance were derided in harsh and perjorative terms, with only members of the Congressional Black Caucus voicing objections. In 2007, radio talk show host Don Imus described the Rutgers women’s basketball time as “nappy headed hos”. While he was dismissed by CBS and MSNBC, he returned to the air a mere year later, on different networks. During the Obama Presidential campaign, the New Yorker Magazine chose to depict Michelle Obama as an Afro-wearing, gun-toting, fist-bumping Black militant. After President Obama’s election, Mrs. Obama has garnered mostly favorable press, but the “angry Black woman” allegations surface far too often. In 2011, the Psychology Today website posted an article titled “Why Are Black Women Less Physically Attractive Than Other Women”, written by a so-called “evolutionary psychologist” Satoshi Kanazawa. The relative acceptance of these stereotypes indicates that there are no consequences to vilifying African American women. With few African American women in decision making positions in majority media, (and with the penchant of some African American male producers and rap artists to vilify African American women), the cessation of this damaging media is unlikely. These images affect young Black women’s self-esteem, as well as their treatment by others in our society. Our 1986 volume had a section on development issues, with case studies on women in Tanzania and Jamaica, and an essay on women’s activism in South Africa. The purpose of this section was to make a connection, as Stephanie Wilson wrote, “between denied opportunities of Black women in the developing world, and Black women subjected to low-income status in the developed one.” As with African American women, women in the developing world have experienced both progress and regress, but the involvement of the US State Department and many in the private sector to provide entrepreneurial opportunities, including micro-finance opportunities has improved the global economic status of women of African descent. African American women’s involvement in developing African policy has increased since 1986. In the Clinton years, Rosa Whitaker served as White House Advisor on Africa and Singleton McAllister led the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Robin R. Sanders was appointed Ambassador to Nigeria, the first African American women to serve in such distinction. As Hilary Rodham Clinton leads the State Department, she has included African American women in leadership positions as special advisors and assistant secretaries of State. Still, the bottom-line economics have not changed much. Nearly half of the world lives on less than two dollars and 50 ¢ per day. The economist Jeffrey Sachs says that poverty can be eliminated globally by 2025 through carefully focused development aid, which represents less than 1 % of world GDP, but a lack of commitment, combined with a global recession and an unstable euro, suggests that these contributions are not forthcoming in the short run. Sachs also supports the cancellation of debt to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in the world’s poorest countries, including those on the African continent (Sachs 2005). Any efforts to eradicate world poverty have a disproportionately positive effect on women of African descent in the diaspora. These women are more likely to raise and support children, and to have limited employment opportunities. Black women in the United States, despite many challenges, have a privileged position when compared to women in the developing world. From that perspective it is important that our policy work include advocacy for economic justice for women around the globe, and especially in the diasporic world. With differential economic status affecting everything from health to image to global presence, what must happen to improve the status of African American women? The legislative agenda that Margaret Simms and I developed in 1986 is as relevant now as it was then, with a focus using legislation to create more favorable outcomes for African American women in the economy. The agenda suggested items such as preserving affirmative action, providing or legislating more affordable child care, increasing both financial aid and Title III funding to Historically Black colleges and Universities (HBCU’s), and providing more training opportunities for African American women. Although our legislative solutions did not specifically mention targeting public policy to Black women, we suggested ways to tweak legislation to provide more favorable outcomes for African American women. As we stated in 1986, “While our panels have documented some inequity, it is the challenge of legislators and policymakers to shape our research findings into legislation that corrects measured inequities.” We did not use terms like “social and economic justice” that are more frequently used today, although this goal is implicit in our focus on closing gaps Because our work was first presented at a legislative forum, the focus on legislative outcomes is understandable. Given the current legislative climate, which chooses economic austerity instead of economic investment and expansion, we can no longer depend solely on legislation. Legislation has clear limitations, even when it is well written. Government employees resistant to change may not implement those policies they do not support. This means that when we consider the future of African American women, we must also look to non-legislative efforts to improve the status of African American women. These include: Organizing. The Occupy Movement suggests ways that organized groups can bring attention to issues of economic inequality. To the extent that these organizations focus on issues of economic justice. African American women should have a presence, both to support efforts that might support us, and also to leverage these organizations’ visibility to advance issues that affect African American women. Presence. In civil rights organizations, Black leadership specifically means the leadership of African American men. In women’s organizations, with few exceptions, leadership means white women. Our few national African American women’s organizations are all too often missing from the policy table. African American women’s presence has been hampered by the 2010 death of Dr. Dorothy Irene Height, who led the National Council of Negro Women since 1955 and whose stature did not permit anyone from rendering her as invisible as African American women have been rendered collectively. Those of conscience who advocate for social and economic justice cannot have policy or advocacy conversations without African American women in the room. Advocacy. African American women must develop an effective presence as advocates for economic advancement, both in the public and in the private sector. Many corporations talk the diversity and inclusion talk, but do not walk the walk in terms of their policies to advance the careers of African American women. Indeed, at the upper echelons of corporate America, with few exceptions, African Americans are invisible. Employee support groups can be advocates for inclusion, and corporations have an obligation to include African American women, and other women of color, in their governing bodies so that they may be internal advocates for equal opportunity in the workplace. Similarly, women legislators have often been effective advocates for the advancement of African American women, but they need constituent support to maintain their level of advocacy. Slipping Through The Cracks offered both a legislative and a research agenda more than 25 years ago. While African American women have made some progress since 1986, those agendas remain relevant because gaps have not been closed, social and economic justice has not been attained, and these inequities will have a deleterious effect on the African American community, our nation, and our world.",

This is important because nursing and teaching represent two relatively well paid professional occupations with large representations of African American females. Some research argues that a nursing shortage exists (Bergmann 2006; Lovell 2006; Seago et al. 2001). However, few studies have examined the prospects for African American nurses to help alleviate the purported shortage. An impediment to these prospects could be real or perceived racial inequalities in the labor market. Some researchers argue that healthcare employers possess monopsony power (Bergmann 2006; Yett 1975). Monopsony power may allow them to indulge in exercising racial preferences; in light of purported shortages, this would represent a market failure. Others argue that unions may offer countervailing power as the result of imposing standard wages based on seniority that could prevent this situation from occurring in occupations such as nursing (Schmitt 2008). Research exists that suggests the presence of a black–white wage gap in nursing. Buhr (2010) found immigrant nurses from Africa and the Caribbean received a 9% wage penalty in Canada. Scott (2008) contends that Black nurses earn less than White nurses in New York. Possible explanations for black–white differences in nurses’ pay include racial differences in: occupation; returns to skills; metropolitan residency; union membership. This study addresses the issue by performing regression analysis on the wages of RNs, which allows for a more focused analysis of the returns Black and White nurses receive for their characteristics.",10

Elu,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Economic growth appears to be related to improvements in human capabilities as measured by several components of the Human Development Index (Human Development Report 2009) that measures those functional capabilities important for economic well-being (Anand and Ravallion 1993; Elu 2000; Ranis and Stewart 2000; Ranis et al. 2000). Since 1990, when the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) introduced the Human Development Index (HDI) the majority of Sub-Saharan African countries have been classified as being low in human development, despite the positive growth rate. The HDI, motivated to measure the capabilities of individuals to enjoy a high quality of life (Sen 1985), is a summary index of the incomes, education and life expectancy of the average individual in a country. As gender inequality in Sub-Saharan Africa appears to be particularly pernicious (Izumi 2007; Rebouche 2006), in this Presidential Address, I link 2009 UNDP HDI data for with data on measures of gender inequality provided by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, to explore the consequences of gender inequality for human development in Sub-Saharan Africa. The HDI is a composite index based on three sub-indexes capturing three different dimensions of Health, Education, and Living standard respectively for individual well-being in a country: a long and healthy life measured by the Life Expectancy Index, knowledge measured by an Education Index, and a decent standard of living measured by the GDP Index. I will consider the extent to which the HDI, as a broader measure of the welfare on individuals in a country, is conditioned on measures of gender inequality. If so, gender inequality can possibly inform the extent to which human development and living standards s in Sub-Saharan Africa are low in general, and relative to other countries.Footnote 1
 My inquiry is important for at least two reasons. First, promoting gender equality in Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the key Millennium Development Goals (2011). My analysis will inform how sensitive human development in Sub-Saharan is to the status of women, and permit some insight into how prioritized gender equality should be. Lastly, my inquiry extends the analysis of Morrisson and Jutting (2005), and will inform the extent to which particular Sub-Saharan African laws, norms, traditions, and codes of conduct toward women in Sub-Saharan Africa are important for human and economic development.",3

Price,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Differences in neighborhoods—the physical space where individuals and households reside—appear to play a central role in racial inequality in the United States (Wilson 1987). Black-white differences in neighborhoods appear to matter for black-white differences in health status (Lochner et al. 2003), poverty (Massey and Denton 1993),and are likely to be the mechanism by which black-white inequality is transmitted across generations (Loury 1977). The importance of neighborhoods for socioeconomic outcomes (Jencks and Mayer 1990) can be a result of behavior being subject to social interactions (Manski 1993) whereby individual outcomes and payoffs are linked to the outcomes and payoffs of others (Akerlof 1997), leading to so-called peer effects.Footnote 1 When peer effects are operative, neighborhood begets neighborhood, so that over time neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics persist along with the socioeconomic outcomes of the individuals that reside in the neighborhood. As a random event, Hurricane Katrina induced hundreds of thousands of New Orleans citizens to evacuate and relocate to different neighborhoods, both within the state of Louisiana, and across the United States. As such, Hurricane Katrina engendered an experiment in the effects of housing mobility and changing neighborhoods due to the dislocations it caused. The extent of dislocation was quite dramatic. As of 2000, Census data reported that New Orleans had a population of 484,674 individuals. Post-Katrina, various estimates reported in the media indicated that on December 2005, the city had approximately 100,000 individuals (Grier 2005). Thus, at least in the short-run, over 300,000 individuals in the City of New Orleans were dislocated and either temporarily homeless or relocated into new neighborhoods as a result of Hurricane Katrina. Relocation decisions are typically voluntary, and correlated with unobserved characteristics of households and individuals. The relocations induced by Hurricane Katrina provide an opportunity to examine the causal effects of moving from high poverty to low poverty neighborhoods on socioeconomic outcomes—or neighborhood effects. With survey data from a small sample of Katrina evacuees in the City of New Orleans who registered for absentee voter ballots, this paper considers whether or not there were treatment effects associated with housing mobility that moves individuals to destination neighborhoods with poverty rates lower than in origin neighborhoods. Viewing a household move from origin to destination neighborhood as a treatment, we estimate the effects of moving to a neighborhood with a lower poverty rate with a matching estimator. Our choice of a matching estimator is motivated on several grounds. First, as our sample data are unweighted, possible correlation between unobserved sample weights and the treatment could undermine identification of treatment effects. A matching estimator allows us to condition selection into treatment on observables, obviating the need for weights. Second, neighborhood effects need not be linear (Patterson 2008). A matching estimator does not impose linearity upon parameter estimates, and are therefore likely to yield robust parameter estimates of treatment effects, and where there are thresholds. To date, the effects of moving low income households in high poverty neighborhoods to low poverty neighborhoods appears, in some instances, to improve their welfare. Experimental analysis of neighborhood effects reveal that the beneficial effects range from lower rates of delinquency among females (Kling et al. 2005), to improved health and lower crime victimization rates among children (Katz et al. 2001). Quasi-experimental analysis also show that low-poverty neighborhoods favorably affect the schooling (Boston 2005) and labor market outcomes of youth (Rosenbaum 1992, 1995), and on teenage pregnancy (Harding 2003). Our inquiry contributes to the literature on the effects that neighborhoods have on socioeconomic outcomes, and the implications such effects have for antipoverty policy. That neighborhoods engender social interactions and peer effects suggest that effective antipoverty policy could operate through housing mobility policies that change the neighborhoods individuals with low socioeconomic status reside in. This is the premise of the United States Department of Housing and Development (HUD) Moving To Opportunity Program (MTO).Footnote 2 The MTO program randomly assigns housing vouchers to low income households from high poverty neighborhoods in five cities for use in relocating to neighborhoods where the poverty rate is less than 10 %. Below, we consider neighborhood relocations from and to neighborhoods across a range of poverty rates. As such, our inquiry will broaden the analysis of neighborhood effects, recognizing that if indeed neighborhood poverty, constrains household and individual welfare, then it is useful for antipoverty policy to consider how changes in neighborhood policy affect household and individual welfare across a variety of destination and origin neighborhood poverty characteristics. Our analysis also represents one the few efforts, outside the analysis of the Gautreaux housing mobility program, that neighborhoods effects are estimated based on origin and destination neighborhood poverty characteristics.Footnote 3 Findings from the MTO experiment are based upon low income households moving to neighborhoods where the poverty rate is less than 10 %, and there is no consideration of the exact poverty characteristics of the origin neighborhood. To the extent that there are nonlinear thresholds in the relationship between neighborhood poverty and socioeconomic outcomes (Patterson 2008), ignoring the poverty characteristics of both the origin and destination neighborhood could lead to biased estimates of neighborhood effects. Below, we estimate neighborhood effects based on moves by low-income households where the treatments measure origin and destination neighborhood poverty. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section “Data and methodology” describes the data and methodology. Our econometric strategy for estimating neighborhood identifies neighborhood effects by assuming selection on observables, which justifies the use of propensity score matching estimators. In section “Results”, we report parameter estimates of the treatment effects of moving from and to neighborhoods with differential poverty rates on five measures of individual welfare. The treatment effects of neighborhood change measure the poverty rate of both the origin and destination neighborhood. The last section concludes.",2

Winchester,Sandra J. Huston,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Since individuals who use professional financial advice tend to display more financial responsible behaviors, having access to a financial expert within a Black household’s social network and sharing this access through word-of-mouth (WOM) referrals may lead to the household having a more positive and persistent financial condition. As such, this review of literature will include studies that focus on social networks and access to experts, word-of-mouth referrals, the value of expert access, and the importance of referrals within Black social networks. Information transfers within social networks may occur in the form of word-of-mouth referrals. Consumers frequently depend on word-of-mouth (WOM) referrals in making purchase decisions (Bansal and Voyer 2000; Brown and Reingen 1987). WOM referrals not only serve as a means of transmitting information regarding the evaluation of a good or service, but they also allow for convenient access to the specialized knowledge of an expert, at a lower cost, and in a more trusting environment. Individuals who have or have access to an expert within their social network may benefit from receiving specialized knowledge at reduced search costs and increased convenience and flexibility (Cornwell and Cornwell 2008). Researchers have found WOM referrals to be the most influential source of information when consumers do not fully understand a product or service and when the product has credence characteristics (Anderson 1998). Hiring a financial expert and financial advice are credence goods since most people are neither confident in their financial knowledge nor their ability to properly evaluate the quality of financial advice or its provider prior to, or even after, receiving the good (Bluethgen et al. 2008). As a consequence, people tend to turn to their social network for referrals and service-provider recommendations since it is assumed that friends and family will not recommend an inferior product or service (Chang 2005). There is substantial literature relating to the use of social networks for employment recommendations.Footnote 1 Job-search literature includes social networks as an indirect source of job information related to availability of jobs of different types and about conditions of employment. Holzer (1987) finds in the job-search domain Blacks and Whites rely on WOM recommendations at similar frequencies as represented by only a small non-significant racial difference in the use of friends and family for job referrals in younger workers (66 % of Whites compared to 67 % of Blacks between the ages of 16 and 23) and 23.9 % of Whites compared to 21.5 % of Blacks among all age categories. Yet, minimal empirical research has examined the use of social networks in referrals for financial experts. In a sample of California mortgage holders, Reed (2010) finds the majority of individuals rely on their social network for information about mortgage products with Blacks and Whites reporting similar frequencies. Pittman (2008) looking at a sample of only Black borrowers finds that over 80 % of the sample received mortgage advice in regards to choosing a lender from friends or family. Barrett (2011) finds that nearly 40 % of 1,000 surveyed investors between the ages of 25 and 70 relied on their social network to select a financial expert. Fischer and Gerhardt (2007) report that financial experts may be particularly valuable to individuals who lack financial literacy and/or are prone to cognitive biases that lead to financial mistakes. Financial experts improve household savings and investment behaviors by reducing anxiety during volatile market conditions, helping clients avoid acting irrationally (Haslem 2010; Winchester et al. 2011), and enhancing portfolio diversification (Bluethgen et al. 2008). Marsden et al. (2011) find that working with a financial expert improves goal setting, calculation of retirement needs, and the accumulation of emergency funds, and Grable and Joo (2001) find financial planners increase the ability of a household to better use complex financial instruments. The current economic condition and behaviors of Black households suggest that they may benefit from the use of a financial expert. The number of studies that find Blacks display less than optimal financial behaviors is staggering. It is suggested that 55 % of White households are adequately prepared for retirement compared to 39 % of Black households (Yuh et al. 1998). Blacks hold less stocks in defined contribution plans and are almost twice as likely to take a hardship withdrawal from their 401(k) accounts than Whites (Mitchell 2012). Oliver and Shapiro (1995) find that 73 % of the value of all wealth held by Blacks is in consumable assets, compared to Whites who invest over half (51 %) of their aggregate wealth in income-producing assets, with Blacks holding nearly two-thirds of their wealth in homes (compared to 43 %) and 10 % in vehicles (compared to 6 %) (DeVaney et al. 2007). Loving et al. (2012) find that Blacks are not only less likely to be homeowners than Whites, but also experience lower levels of home appreciation. Last, Blacks have lower savings rates and use more of their credit line on average than Whites, as well as report higher scores on debt stress indices (Drentea and Lavrakas 2000). To the contrary, Black households with access to a financial expert have been shown to be more likely to own wealth accumulation and asset protection products than Black households without an expert. In addition, those who use a financial expert are significantly more likely to have a detailed plan to meet all of their financial goals and nearly double the confidence in their ability to meet those goals (Prudential 2011).Footnote 2
 Receiving expert financial advice that leads to changes in savings and investment behaviors that result in wealth accumulation in Black households is threefold. First, increases in wealth lead to increases in a household’s ability to withstand income shocks such as unexpected health and/or medical expenses, a temporary loss of employment, and/or other emergencies (Wolff 2002). Second, having more wealth enables Black households to provide intergenerational transfers of wealth. It has been hypothesized that racial differences in financial inheritance contribute to racial wealth inequality (Martin 2011). It is estimated that wealth transfers, both inter vivos and bequest, account for 12 %–51 % of the receiving generation’s net worth (Gale and Scholz 1994; McKernan et al. 2011). Third, added wealth can be used to fund formal education, accumulate additional financial assets, and to finance entrepreneurial ventures (Martin). Therefore, the successful building and accumulation of wealth within Black households may also decrease the persistent wealth gap between Blacks and Whites. Consulting with a financial expert may also reduce the number of Black households that fall victim to predatory lending practices, as evidenced by the number of Black households who face bankruptcy and foreclosure in the wake of the 2007 Recession. Researchers have found that the use of subprime loan products varies significantly by race, with Blacks being significantly more likely than Whites to hold a subprime loan (Reid 2010). These finds support the contention that households lacking financial expertise have a tendency to enter into risky financial contracts (Lusardi and Mitchell 2007). Therefore, gaining access to financial knowledge, in the form of a financial expert, may allow for a better analysis of the technical aspects of various financial products as well as offer guidance that results in less risky financial contracts being undertaken (Agarwal et al. 2009). Consumers must be knowledgeable in the selection process for a financial expert to ensure that the chosen expert is ethical, competent, and appropriate (Alcon 1999). However, Blacks have been shown to have a lack of knowledge regarding selecting a competent financial expert, and have been shown to be wary of financial service providers because of negative historical experiences and/or perceptions (Toussaint-Comeau et al. 2001). Consequently, Chang (2005) finds that Blacks are more likely to seek financial advice and planner recommendations from members of their social network than any other source. Since social network members tend to be economically homogeneous and share similar financial concerns and needs, relying on friends and relatives for referrals improves the quality of the match between user and service provider. Pittman (2008) finds that relying on information from social networks enables borrowers to more thoughtfully evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of particular loan products. In the job-search domain, Datcher (1983) finds that those who found employment through personal contacts were less likely to quit, and Devine and Keifer (1993) find that they had longer tenure on their jobs. Brown and Reingen (1987) contend the likelihood of establishing a successful client-financial expert relationship in increased by using a recommendation provided by a friend or family member.",
40.0,2.0,The Review of Black Political Economy,10 October 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12114-012-9146-2,Using the Blinder-Oaxaca Decomposition Method to Measure Racial Bias in Achievement Tests,June 2013,Kevin Duncan,Jonathan Sandy,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The robust and persistent gap in black-white performance on achievement tests is well documented. For example, results from the 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress indicate that black eighth graders have math and reading scores that are approximately 90 % of the average white student score. While all students had higher math and reading scores in 2009 compared to 2007, or to the 1990s, there has not been a significant change in the racial gap over time (see U.S. Department of Education 2009). Research dating to the 1960s reports a significant racial test score gap after controlling for detailed individual characteristics, socioeconomic status, and school quality (see Coleman et al. 1966; Kaufman and Kaufman 1983, and Phillips 2000 as examples). Given the persistence of racial differences in test scores, educational attainment and earnings, some claim that reducing racial differences in academic achievement will do more to reduce other racial disparities than any other plausible policy (see Jencks and Phillips 1998 and Harris 2010). In the search for a better understanding of the test score gap, and for relevant policy recommendations, recent research has examined the effects of factors such as teacher and student characteristics, school quality, segregation and socioeconomic factors on test score differences (see Ferguson 2003; Hanushek and Rivkin 2009; Fordham and Ogbu 1986; Nye et al. 2004; Card and Rothstein 2007 and Grissmer et al. 1994 for examples). A recent volume of the Review contributes to this body of research by calling for improved, comprehensive models to appropriately estimate the gap, understanding the roles of racial discrimination and racial identity in achievement motivation and outcomes, and the need to attend to minority students at both ends of the test score distribution (see McMillian et al. 2010; Seaton 2010 and Robinson 2010). In general, the studies examining the achievement test score gap reflect an optimism that narrowing the gap will reduce other racial disparities in economic outcomes. However, other studies suggest that this optimism may be misplaced since reduced disparities in academic achievement are often associated with increased racial disparities in other areas. For example, several studies report increased racial pay and career disparities at higher levels of education, salary and power (see Tomaskovic-Devey et al. 2005; Arias et al. 2004 and Elliott and Smith 2004). These results are consistent with the view that outright discrimination intensifies when members of subaltern groups compete with members of the dominate group for social rewards in a hierarchical setting (see Darity 2001). These studies imply that equality of academic achievement is not sufficient to offset the inequities rooted in pre-market and labor market discrimination. While the relation between the achievement gap and racial disparities in pay and other economic outcomes is controversial, standardized achievement tests play important roles in access to higher education, employment and promotions (see Harris 2010 and Hedges and Nowell (1998). Consequently, it is necessary that achievement be measured without bias. Jencks (1998) describes 5 ways that standardized tests can be biased.Footnote 1 For example, tests suffer from “content bias” when they contain questions that favor one group over another. This study contributes to the literature on test score bias by illustrating how the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition technique can be used to measure the relative racial bias in achievement tests that arises due to the content of the exams. This Blinder-Oaxaca method, described in more detail below, can be used to measure the portion of a gap between two groups that can be attributed to, or explained by, differences in average characteristics. In an application of this technique to test scores, if two tests are unbiased, or equally biased, the percent of the test score gap that is attributed to differences in characteristics will be the same for the two tests. However, if one test explains more of the racial gap in scores than another test, that test is relatively less biased. The approach used in the present study differs from standard methods of detecting content bias. For example, Cole (1981) and Medley and Quirk (1974) detect bias within a test by altering questions and measuring subsequent performance differences between groups. Other efforts to address bias in achievement tests focus on identifying, modifying, or removing biased test questions. There are different methods of identifying faulty test items. For example, Schratz and Wellens (1981) describe how panels of minority educators can be used to develop tests and remove biased items. On the other hand, others use statistical methods where significant deviations between group scores on particular items and overall group mean scores can be used to find faulty test questions (see Green 1971 and Scheuneman 1979). However, this method of detecting bias in a test is controversial. For example, Hunter and Schmidt (2000) argue that findings of test item bias can be attributed to measurement error, assumption violations, or to small differences between groups that are statistically significant because sample sizes are very large. Given this controversy, the application of the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method to the test score gap can be viewed as another statistical technique to confirm the presence of racial bias in achievement tests. The remainder of this paper is organized along the following lines. In the next section the data and the achievement tests used to illustrate the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition technique are described. A detailed description of the decomposition technique follows. The model and empirical results are presented and the paper concludes with implications for practice and future research.",7

Pitts,Daniel M. Yost,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Sport has long been heralded as having paved the way to such significant actions as Brown v. Board of
Education and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Jack Johnson held the world heavyweight title in boxing, Jesse Owens won four Olympic gold medals in track and field, Jackie Robinson broke the Major League Baseball (MLB) color barrier, and Ernie Davis won the Heisman Trophy in college football all before 1964. Thus, one might argue that sport has served as an avenue to equal opportunity for African Americans. At the very least, it would seem that the sports labor market opened up earlier to African Americans than the general labor market. Currently, 67% of players in the National Football League (NFL) are African American (National Football League 2011), and 78% of players in the National Basketball Association (NBA) are African American (National Basketball Association 2011). Furthermore, over half of the top 50 highest paid American athletes are African American (Sports Illustrated 2011). However, U.S. Census data on median earnings among full-time, year round workers reveals that African American males earn slightly less than white females and only about 73.5% as much as white males.Footnote 1 Indeed it seems that the labor market outcomes of African Americans in sports labor markets are more similar to their white counterparts than those in non-sports labor markets. However, the sports labor market may not be free from racial discrimination. For example, Holmes (2011) finds evidence of salary discrimination against African American MLB players, while Berri and Simmons (2009) find evidence of salary discrimination against African American quarterbacks in the NFL. Branham (2008) and Madden (2004) bring to light that African American coaches in the NFL are seemingly on a shorter leash and held to a higher standard than similar white coaches. Also, Kanazawa and Funk (2001) find evidence of customer discrimination against African American NBA players. Thus, it seems that none of the three major American sports is without some form of discrimination. In this study, we examine the issue of racial position segregation or racial “stacking” in intercollegiate football. Racial position segregation refers to the phenomenon of white and African American players being relegated to certain types of positions on a team. Viewing a team as a firm, the issue can be seen as a case of inter-firm segregation. Carrington and Troske (1998) show that the wage gap between white and African American workers is primarily a “within-plant phenomenon”. That is, whites tend to occupy higher paying positions than African Americans within a given firm. Similarly, Bayard et al. (2003) find that much of the gender wage gap can be attributed to women being segregated into lower paying occupations within firms. Just as the wages of African American and female workers suffer from inter-firm segregation in the general labor market, the earnings of African American athletes have been shown to suffer from position segregation in the sports labor market. Yetman and Eitzen (1972) and Eitzen and Yetman (1977) show that those positions dominated by white players in sports generally receive higher salaries and more endorsement opportunities. Thus, racial position segregation is not without economic consequence for African American players. General observation suggests that racial position segregation is not as significant an issue as in the past. One need not look very hard to find examples of African Americans playing positions that were generally considered off-limits by many in the past. As the first African American to play in the Atlantic Coast Conference, Darryl Hill is considered by many to be the “Jackie Robinson of southern college football.” As Hill acknowledges, college football provided an opportunity for upward mobility, yet it did not come without a price. “One of the toughest places I played was Clemson University. You know, 50,000 drunk southern gentlemen are waiting to see this brother come out on the field. Not a black person in the stands anywhere. The black people had to sit outside the stadium on a red, dirt hill called ‘Nigger Hill.’ And that’s where they watched the game. Talk about double-teamed, I was triple-teamed. Every time I look up there and see these black people sitting on this dirt hill, I said, I’m gonna show these folks.” (Darryl Hill in Greenberg and Bernstein 2008) Since Hill’s ground breaking 1963 season, there has been significant improvement in the racial integration of college football (Eitzen and Yetman 1977; Hawkins 2002). Prior to the 1960’s, organized college football was almost completely segregated. Those who played did so mostly at a limited number of African American institutions. As desegregation took hold, African American participation grew. In 1992 and 2002 respectively, it has been reported that nearly half of Division I football players were of African American decent (Lewis 1995; Hawkins 2002). In 2010, pursuant to the 2009–2010 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Student-Athlete Ethnicity Report, African American players composed the majority of Division I football players at 45.8% (National Collegiate Athletic Association 2010a). This is the first time African American players represented the dominant demographic since the NCAA began monitoring African American participation. Wilbur Hackett can personally attest to the transformation of college football. As a linebacker for the 1967 University of Kentucky football team, Hackett became the first African American to captain a Southeastern Conference (SEC) football team. This was no small accomplishment given that most SEC teams had yet to include African American players on their rosters. Following his playing career, Hackett became a college football official. As an official, he recognized the improvement in the racial make-up of college football teams. “When I look around and I see 11 African American football players on defense and I look over there and there’s a black quarterback, it does my heart good. And, I do feel good about the fact that these young men are getting these opportunities. It makes me feel good because I know where it was and where it is now.” (Wilbur Hackett in Greenberg and Bernstein 2008) Given the immense pressure placed on coaches to win, it seems selecting and assigning players based on racial stereotypes would have no place in the modern college football era. As any coach will agree, talent wins football games. Indeed, a head coach’s continued employment is predicated on his ability to evaluate and integrate talent. By assigning positions on the basis of race, a coach negatively affects his team’s ability to win games. However, even though considerable progress has been made with respect to racial relations in college football, can we properly conclude that organized college football is free of racial position segregation? Our study employs data from Rivals.com to observe a player’s position in high school and college. Estimating a probit model, we examine the impact that a player’s race has on the probability of him changing positions when he moves from high school to the collegiate ranks. If a player’s race is a significant determinant of whether or not he changes positions, then there is evidence supporting players being stacked along racial lines in college football. Also, given that a player does change positions, we are interested in observing what position he switches to and whether that tends to differ between white and African American players. The remainder of this paper progresses as follows. Relevant literature is reviewed in section 2. Section 3 details the data and our empirical methodology. Section 4 provides an analysis of position changes. Our probit results are reported and discussed in section 5, and section 6 contains our concluding remarks.",13

40.0,3.0,The Review of Black Political Economy,03 May 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12114-013-9160-z,Race: China’s Question and Problem,September 2013,Vera Leigh Fennell,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Although it is now a commonly accepted truth that race and racial difference has no cultural, or scientific/biological basis, race has a social truth that has been buttressed by and reflected through history and power. That social truth came from meanings that have been assigned over time to certain physical features of the body—the shape of the head, skin color, hair texture, eye shape, and body type. Perpetuating the meanings and values attributed to these physical features is/was an expression of power. This means that Western definitions of race traveled wherever powerful Western states have. Yet, as Dikotter has pointed out, an awareness of a classificatory hierarchy based on relative skin color existed in China long before the arrival of Euro-American missionaries and colonialists. Stories of contact between the Chinese and Africans from the Tang (618–907) and Song (960–1279) Dynasties are part of the historical narrative. There is the story of Du Huan, an officer in the Tang Dynasty, who wrote about his travels in Africa (possibly Eritrea) in the 8th century. According to other narratives, Canton was already the site of an Islamic trading enclave by the 10th and 11th centuries and interest in the lands in the “southwest”, as Africa was referred to, was growing. With trade as the primary purpose of these exchanges, merchants of the Tang and Southern Sung Dynasties wrote of their initial disappointment with these regions, but by the 13th century, opportunities for trade seemed more favorable. This increasingly favorable impression led to expanded economic interest. Chinese writers of the time began describing African wildlife, the landscape, and the nomadic people of the east African coast. Descriptions focusing on skin-color appeared as early at the 4th century and there seems to have been a time when dark-skinned persons were presented to the Chinese imperial court as slaves, called “Kunlun” (initially meaning “…primeval chaos”…. and then coming to mean something close to “…peoples from a magical western mountain…”). The Chinese Columbus, Zheng He, arrived in the 15th century and trade and Chinese exploration of Africa accelerated.Footnote 3
 The repeated telling of these stories shows how the Chinese incorporated Africans into their cosmology. The Chinese held a belief of the cosmological ordering of the universe that included a structured a hierarchy of civilizations with the Chinese imperial order at the core and placed other civilizations in descending degrees of civilization radiating in concentric circles out from this core. Notions of skin color mapped these radiating circles of civilization. But these ideas about skin color and the recognition of skin color differences were not absolute; attaining civilization defined skin color. At this time, China did not share the absolutist notions of skin color of the European Enlightenment not did they believe that the state was a container for those differences. For example, the Chinese imperial clan was thought of as “white” because white was the center of the civilized world. Chinese laborers were considered uncivilized and, therefore, black.Footnote 4 In this discursive field, those from the Kunlun, the outskirts of the known world, would be described as black. So, skin color and a sense of racial hierarchy mapped onto a spatial hierarchy based on civilizational attainment. Initially, Europeans, coming from a place far from the civilizational core, were considered just as strange as Africans. Yet, the addition of Western notions of racial identity and difference should not be minimized Beginning with the late imperial era, the confluence of Chinese notions of the civilizational basis of fundamental difference and Western racial classification hierarchy shaped the discourse surrounding the creation of the modern state. The questions to ask interrogate the understandings of China’s 19th and 20th century reformers and revolutionaries, like Kang Youwei [康有为] (1858–1927), Liang Qichao [梁启超] (1873–1929), Sun Yatsen [X中山] (1866–1925), and Mao Tsetung [毛泽东] (1893–1976) and Zhou Enlai [周恩来] (1898–1976) about the role of race and racial difference to the global order as they attempted to construct a modern Chinese political order. Did they see a racialized picture of global difference, hierarchy and power? Did race and racial difference play a role in their understanding of the modern state form? Did that racialized understanding influence the form of the modern state in China? The concept of the modern state as a sovereign participant in a global community of Westphalian states was a raced concept. Enlightenment thinkers like Kant, Linnaeus, and Locke believed that there was a direct association between appearance, culture, and political acumen and the capacity for self-rule. Used as the premise for scientific classification, European whites were defined (by European whites) as being the most advanced group and, despite the differences between various groups within the white group, inhabited and controlled the most powerful states. Coinciding with Europe’s transition from feudalism to capitalism, this concept was used to justify their control not just of the territory where they lived but also their expansion to lands far from their capitals. European power, expressed by their expansion beyond their territorial borders, also spread and imposed the meaning of sovereignty and ideas about those who were not worthy of nor ready for self-rule. Their power also served to inculcate the meaning and relevance of the inferiority to those they ruled over. This created a psychological feedback loop whereby the inequalities created by racial classifications increasingly reflected economic inequalities. As Baum has written, “…it [was] not race that [gave] rise to inequality but inequality that [gave] rise to race…”Footnote 5 The American and European states with ethnically and racially diverse populations were, nonetheless, politically, economically, and socially dominated by those who based their claims on their European descent and their proof was white skin color. Western notions of “race” entered the minds of the Chinese elites in two ways. First, elites in Japan attempted to answer the critical question: what was the secret of white Europe? It was in Japan that many exiled Chinese reformers, fleeing from the Empress Dowager’s coup after the 100 Days reforms of 1898, first encountered translations of Western political and social philosophical texts on the use of Spencerian Darwinism to understand the international political order. They also defined the modern state form as the central vehicle for national survival in the global struggle for dominance.Footnote 6 Reading both Darwin’s writings and the commentaries that (mis)used Darwin to analyze contemporary societies and politics, Liang began to write about a global race competition between states in neo-Darwinist terms. For the groups to successfully compete with one another, they had to accentuate their ability to unite together for a common purpose or goal. What created this ability to group? The recognition of a common essence. Kang and Liang, along with other reformers used the term “tongzhong” (同种), meaning similar kind or similar/same seed, to describe this sense of groupness.Footnote 7 Skin color seemed to be a visible manifestation of the ability to group. The second way that Western notions of race entered the Chinese society was through Westerners living and working in China. They circulated ideas about skin color as race, identity as singular and fixed, culture as inheritable that were translated into notions of superior state power. Western missionaries in mission schools, for example, taught that the ability to politically group as a nation was a manifestation of race. According to Dikotter, these missionaries even taught their students how to recognize the characteristic colors of the world’s races, with the Chinese, Japanese, and Filipinos as the “yellow” race, the Europeans as “white”, Africans and the American slave population, as “black”. They taught about the hierarchical order of races, with whites and North American/European states at the top and blacks, held in slavery in the West and colonized in territorial Africa, at the bottom.Footnote 8
 The power of the narrative of white superiority within the racial hierarchy and the superior power of white states was successfully challenged by the victory of the Japanese army against a white, European nation, Russia, in 1904. The Russo-Japanese War demonstrated that a non-white nation could militarily defeat a white one. In just 40 years, from 1868’s Meiji Restoration to the early years of the 20th century, Japan went from being a closed feudal system, part of the Chinese imperial tributary order, to a major global power rivaling the West. This victory provided important inspiration for Asian, African, and Arab nationalists and revolutionaries. African-American scholar, activist and Pan-African internationalist, William Edward Burghardt Du Bois (杜波依斯博士) (1868–1963), wrote aof the Japanese victory The accomplishment of Japan has been to realize the meaning of European aggression on the darker peoples, to discover the secret of the white man’s power, and then without revolutionary violence is [to] change her whole civilization and attitude toward the world, so as to emerge in the twentieth century the equal in education, technique, health, industry and art of any nation on earth. It was a colossal task….it called for team work………………………………….….Footnote 9
 Yet, the affinities that the West defined as being fundamental to racial identity did not lead to mutual recognition and group-ness between China and Japan. In the treaty that ended the conflict, Russia ceded influence over Korea to Japan and turned over its leases in the Liaotung Pennisula and the southern half of the Sakhalin Islands. The Japanese population was angered that it did not get additional territory or monetary reparations. This only fueled Japanese militarism, leading to the outcome that Du Bois had warned about in his essay “What Japan has Done”—a militarized and economically prosperous Japan mirroring the American/European models in their aggression against other Asian states. For Chinese reformers and revolutionaries, Japan was poised to exploit China’s weaknesses, as had the white Western states. If China did not develop its ability to group, they faced extinction as a culture and a civilization. On the other hand, it also re-emphasized the importance of the ability to group within the state. Without this ability, the Chinese socio-political order would always lose in confrontations with white European states and Japan. During this same period, as China and the Chinese appeared less able to unite for a common purpose, a series of internal rebellions—the Taiping Rebellion, a civil war in the south, and the Nian Rebellion in northern Anhui Province, along with the two great Muslim rebellions in Yunnan (1856–1873) and Shaanxi/Gansu (1862–1873)—demonstrated how the Chinese socio-political order was increasingly fractured. These rebellions strengthened local elites at the expense of imperial forces, splintering China at a time when other more unified states were gaining power. Desperate to stave off extinction, both Liang and Sun Yatsen turned to identity as a political concept for the salvation of the civilization. The concept of identity defined a unity of peoples called the “Han” linked by their common descent from the Yellow Emperor. At that time, the Han lived under the Qing imperial order, which was controlled by a non-Han group, the Manchus. To save China, the Han would have to remove from power all of those of irreconcilable difference, those who are not “tongzhong”—externally, this meant the West and, internally this meant the Manchus. In a lecture delivered in 1924, entitled “Chinese Nationalistic Spirit”, revolutionary and father of a representative republican political order in China, Sun Yatsen, said, According to the law of social evolution, the fittest survive, and the weak are killed by the strong….at present Great Britain and the United States are the most powerful nations in the world…If either Great Britain or American should conquer the world, it would become du qiang (独强) or “the Single Power”. Could it be ethnically justified, if the Chinese nation were conquered by Britain and the Chinese people were made British subjects?..... Naturally we would not feel comfortable in our conscience. That means that our spirit of nationalism still exists…Nationalism is the means of existence for a race, just as a scholar depends upon his pen and ink to earn his living…I fear that we may perish in the near future……………….Footnote 10
 For young revolutionaries, a sense of groupness would be facilitated by ending an imperial system where “tongzhong” did not dominate. Control by a non-Han group, the Manchus, who were under the control of foreign, European powers, had to end. To ensure the survival of Han Chinese civilization and Chinese territorial sovereignty, the Han needed to institutionalize a national political constitutional regime. Both Liang and Sun inaugurated their programs through political parties. Liang launched the Baohuanghui or “Protect the Emperor” Party for a constitutional monarchy and Sun formed the Tong Men Hui (Alliance League 同 盟黨) and began promoting the replacement of the imperial system with a republican style government. Sun’s formula for groupness, the San Min (三民主義) doctrine, “The Three Principles of the People”, would provide the necessary salvation for China, “…by promoting the recognition of China as the equal of other nations; by producing political equilibrium and economic justice, it will fit China for perpetual existence in the world.” The three principles were (1) nationalism, (2) democracy, and (3) people’s livelihood. Sun’s formulation exposed the ambiguity of the concepts of “race”, “nation”, and “nationality” in modern Chinese politics. Their racialized group, translated as “zu” (族), a term used to refer to lineage groups including a geographical and biological referent, would exist within the notion of minzu (民族), meaning nation as an ethnicized, community, linked by blood like a large clan (zongzu 宗族). Like Liang, Sun believed that this racial “zu”, the yellow race, included only Han, not Manchu. For both men, the guomin (国民 nation), signifying a political community, would be fused with a minzu (nationality 民族), creating an ethno-national community of biologically descendant Han Chinese, a racial state.",27

When compared to industries as a whole, technology based industries, in particular the high technology sector employ higher than average numbers of scientists and engineers, who are critical to the success of the ventures. Science and engineering (S&E) jobs require high levels of skills to drive the creation of knowledge that produces innovations; and society places a high value on these jobs, which often are more highly rewarded than many other types of jobs. African Americans, Hispanics, and others continue to lag behind whites and Asians in the level of educational attainment, particularly in S&E studies despite making educational gains since the mid-1970s (NCES 2003). It is possible that racial/ethnic differences in human capital investments in S&E fields of study could result in a representation and reward structure in high technology industries that is divided along racial lines even though no deliberate acts of discrimination exist. On the other hand, it is possible that the demand for highly skilled, technical individuals may result in employment opportunities and wage premiums for minorities with the requisite skills that are as high as or even higher than those enjoyed by whites. Although it is argued that the competitive demand and supply of skills play the major role in determining employment in high skill, high reward jobs, Grodsky and Pager (2001) found that black men suffer greater racial penalties in highly rewarded occupations. Thus it is not clear that the demand for skill will outweigh long-standing prejudices and discrimination against qualified blacks and Hispanics. Further, since the number of minority-owned companies as well as the social networks that contribute to employment are typically weak or absent in African American communities (Wilson 1996), the potential for African Americans, Hispanics and other minority groups to participate in and establish successful high technology businesses may not be as strong as whites. This paper explores the question of whether the effects of education on employment in S&E jobs in high technology industries as well as outside this sector are the same for minorities and the white majority during the period 1992 to 2002. This study uses multinomial regression analyses to systematically examine effects of changes in the level of educational attainment on the employment patterns of minorities and the white majority in order to determine the relative importance of human capital (educational attainment and experience), race and other factors on employment in four groups of jobs demarcated by the intersection of high technology industries and S&E occupations.",3

Because African Americans have suffered economic shortfalls for so long, experts and the public worry about the labor market outcomes of this growing population. Do they earn less than similarly qualified whites? Do they earn less than similarly qualified African Americans? Is their foreign birth a handicap? Is their ethnicity? To be sure, black immigrants are a diverse group. But, to date, scholars have methodologically rigorous answers only in the case of English-speaking West Indians (Geschwender 2003; Kalmijn 1996; Dodoo 1997; Model 1991, 1995, 2008). Research on other black ethnic groups has yet to disentangle the effects of race, ethnicity and nativity (Cotton 1993; Darity et al. 1995; Bradbury 2002). The present paper seeks to remedy this gap by examining the earnings of Cape Verdean Americans, a group with African and European roots who speak a Portuguese-based Creole. In their homeland, most Cape Verdeans identify racially as mestiço (or mixed). But residents of the US honor the ‘one-drop rule’, a custom that labels ‘black’ all persons with any visible African ancestry. Cape Verdeans merit study for several reasons. First, they have a long history in the US; thus, unlike most immigrant groups with some African ancestry, their native born population does not consist disproportionately of young labor force entrants. Second, Cape Verdeans’ skin tone ranges from light to dark, but many are reluctant to identify as ‘black’. Finally, Cape Verdean culture is a unique blend of African and Portuguese elements (Halter 1993, 2009; Lobban 1984; Meintel 1984). This cultural and linguistic heritage may have consequences for labor market success. The data come from the 2000 US Census and eight waves of the American Community Survey. The paper is organized as follows. First some background on Cape Verdeans in their homeland and in the US is offered. This is followed by a summary of relevant theory and research. The data analysis comes next: a description of the sample, a synopsis of the methods, and a report of the results. The paper ends with a discussion of its implications and a plea for further research on black ethnic groups.",

Moreover, since the housing crisis and the “Great Recession,” wealth holdings have decreased and these wealth gaps are increasing significantly (Kochlar et al. 2011). During the recent housing crisis, many people, particularly people of color, women, and workers (many of whom are now unemployed), have been losing what few assets they had, particularly homes, because of sub-prime mortgages and other predatory lending practices that targeted women and people of color (see Rivera et al. 2008 for example). These assets such as home equity, and even small business equity, are assets finally gained over the past two decades by people who had often been left out of mortgage and credit markets. In 2006 subprime loans as a percentage of all mortgages had grown from 10 % in 1998 to 23 %; and from $35 billion in 1994 to a volume of $665 billion in 2005 (Rivera et al. 2008). Foreclosure filings reached their peak in 2010 at 2.87 million properties (see Realtytrac Staff 2013a). In January 2013, foreclosure filings decreased by 36 % from January 2012 continuing this trend (RealtyTrac Staff 2013b). Recent levels, however, remain significantly higher than 2007 (1.28 million) when the crisis began. In addition, while the number of foreclosures are decreasing nationwide, in 2012 the number of foreclosures actually increased from 2011 in 25 states, while decreasing in the other 25 states (RealtyTrac Staff 2013a). In addition, bank repossessions increased again by 7 % (on a monthly basis) in May 2012, after previously being on a downward trend (RealtyTrac Staff 2012b). Because unemployment levels remain high, banks are not helping working people to refinance, and new federal policies have not done enough (see Adler 2010 and Iley 2009). In addition, as banks fail, merge, and abandon certain neighborhoods (again), increasing numbers of people of color, women, and low-income people become or remain unbanked. In 2011, 28.3 % of U.S. households were unbanked or underbanked, an increase from 2009 (Adler 2012). “Over 29 % of U.S. households lack a savings account, while about 10 % lack a checking account” (Adler 2012: 1). Low-income families and people of color were found to be more likely than the rest of the country “to have little or no contact with a traditional bank” (Adler 2012: 2). Use of fringe financial institutions such as check cashers, pay-day lenders and pawn shops is increasing–often the only option for low-income unbanked people (Kumeh 2012). Many of the fringe financial businesses actually deplete people’s assets rather than help them to build assets because they charge high fees and interest rates. In addition, without a bank account it is difficult to buy plane tickets online, rent a car, do other transactions that require a credit card, or obtain a mortgage on a house. Without a savings account it is difficult to save money. Kumeh (2012) quotes Greg Kato (policy and legislative manager of the Office of the Treasurer-Tax Collector in San Francisco) that “check-cashing fees at the fringe institutions could total $1,000 a year and interest rates for loans are as high as 425 %.” Some describe this as predatory lending. Predatory Lending is a credit market lending practice that manipulates low-income and uniformed borrowers to borrow money under conditions of excessively high interest rates and penalties. These borrowers become unsuccessful borrowers (default) under these conditions. Predatory lending practices include charging excessively high interest rates regardless of credit rating or ability to pay; pre-payment penalties; excessive late fees; adjustable rate mortgages (exploding); exclusion of taxes and insurance; steering; interest-only payment plans; and lack of stated income or ability to pay (see Rivera et al. 2008). These fees can reach up to 400 % or higher (NFCDCU No Date “Payday Lending Alternatives”)–similar to debt peonage. The practices of pay-day lenders are best described by the Atlanta Journal Constitution: “the payday loan industry depicts itself as a financial crutch propping up struggling borrowers until their next paycheck. In truth, the loans are financial straightjackets that squeeze the working poor into a spiral of mounting debt” (Atlanta (GA) Journal-Constitutional Editorial, 12/8/2003). In the 2012 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) press release, acting chair Martin Gruenberg concludes that the results of their survey “indicate that insured financial institutions have an important chance to grow their customer base by expanding opportunities that bring unbanked and underbanked individuals into mainstream banking” (Adler 2012:2). Access to affordable financial services and savings accounts is thus also needed, in addition to access to credit markets and safe asset ownership. Availability of financial services that are affordable, appropriate and secure facilitate savings and aid acquisition of a home as well as business and real estate ownership. Lack of these services remains an important reason why marginalized and underserved groups have difficulty building assets. Gordon Nembhard (2008a: 25) remarks that one approach to address lack of financial services, credit and asset ownership among low-income people is to explore structures and mechanisms where “pooled resources” give people access to and participation in economic activity and savings, and give them “some economic stability, relative independence, and asset ownership, as well as the ability to help one another.” I term these pooled resources, community assets. Joint ownership is a stepping stone to individual/household wealth, as well as an end in itself.",6

Price,Maxton Allen,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Arguably, a case can be made that with respect to the status of blacks in the economics profession, the problem of the 21st century remains the color line (Price 2009). Using the median as a measure of representation, the typical Ph.D granting economics department in the United States has no black economist. To paraphrase Yogi Berra, relative to the status quo at the founding of the Caucus of Black Economists in 1969—the forerunner of the National Economic Association (Alexis et al. 2008; Browne 1993; Handy 2008)—it’s like Deja Vu all over again, as the current status of blacks on the economics faculties of Ph.D granting departments appears no better, on average, than it was in 1969 (Price 2009). It was of course the status quo in 1969 that motivated the founding of the National Economic Association (NEA) to address and remedy the underrepresentation of blacks in the economics profession. At its inception, the NEA identified three core issues (Alexis et al. 2008): (1) The supply of black economists was intolerably low (2) Black economists were almost invisible on the programs of the American Economic Association, and (3) The programs at the annual meetings of the Allied Social Science Associations were virtually devoid of topics relevant to black Americans/economists such as, discrimination, poverty and the economics of the black Diaspora. Given the complementarities among these concerns, an implicit and related issue is the scholarly publication options for black economists with research interests/concerns in the economics and political economy of race. Indeed, this at least partly motivated the launching of the the Review of Black Political Economy (RBPE ). In retrospect, the creation of the RBPE seems an optimal intervention to enhance the scholarly productivity and status of black economists overall, as there is evidence of discrimination against the publication of research by scholars in economics who find/report evidence that race—particularly being black—matters for a wide variety of economic outcomes (Coleman 2005; Mason et al. 2005; Stewart 2005). In this paper, we consider whether the NEA and its journal the RBPE, have enhanced the status of blacks in the economics profession by enabling a scholarly publication outlet for black economists with research interests in the economics and political economy of race. Bibliometric data on all known black economists in academia and research-oriented institutions/agencies as of December 2011 is exploited to examine black economist research output in the RBPE, along with a consideration of the RBPE share of research by black and non-black economists on the economics and political economy of race. To consider the importance of the RBPE for scholarly activity, we rank black economists by publications in the RBPE, along with their RBPE share of all own articles published over the 1979–2011 time period. We also consider the extent to which all known black economists in academia and/or research-oriented institutions/agencies contribute to the RBPE—as measured by their ranking—relative to black economist research agendas/interests in the economics and political economy of race—as measured by black economist publication shares in all publications related to the economics and political economy of race. The RBPE did not become an official journal of the NEA until 1977. Prior to that, it was published under the auspices of the now defunct Black Economic Research Center (Handy 2008). Nonetheless, the aims/aspirations of the RBPE were indeed compatible with those of an explicitly scholarly organization prior to it becoming an official journal of the NEA. In the inaugural 1970 issue the Publisher—the late Robert S. Browne—articulated that an aim of the RBPE was to “welcome articles describing the findings of empirical research which black scholars are doing” (Publishers Forward, p. iv, 1970). Thus, even before the RBPE became the official journal of the NEA, it aspired to be a research platform for black economists with research interests in the economics and political economy of race. Indeed, Robert S. Browne felt that “no other publication was likely to undertake the type of task” (Publishers Forward, p. iii, 1970) for which the RBPE was created. Such an impetus for the creation of the RBPE was also articulated at the inaugural meeting of the Caucus of Black Economists, who lobbied for more black representation among the research paper sessions and panels at the annual American Economic Association (AEA) meetings, and on the editorial boards of major publications of the AEA (Bulletins 1970). Our inquiry will enable some insight into whether or not the NEA and RBPE have enhanced the scholarly status of black economists with research interests in the economics and political economy of race. It is plausible that at least some of the scholarly output enabled by the NEA and RBPE would not have been realized if the NEA and RBPE did not exist given the research interests/agendas of black economists in the economics and political economy of race. To the extent that the RBPE publishes a nontrivial fraction of the research of black economists and captures a proportion of black economist research that approximates black economist research agendas/interest in the economics and political economy of race overall, an implied counterfactual would be that the NEA and the RBPE have indeed enhanced the scholarly status of black economists. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The second section describes the bibliometric data and methodology that informs our descriptive analysis. In the third section, we report by rank the contributions of all known black economists in academia and research-oriented institutions/agencies to the RBPE over the 1979–2011 time period. We also report descriptive statistics on the black economist share of contributions to the RBPE, and on the share of black economists with research agendas/interests in the economics and political economy of race so as to benchmark a possible counterfactual that informs the impact of the NEA and the RBPE on the scholarly status of blacks in the economics profession. The last section concludes.",7

Using both parametric and nonparametric analysis, most academic research suggests little improvement over time in the performance of minority-owned banks (MOBs) when measured by either efficiency or profitability (Lawrence 1997; Price 1990). The MBDP was designed to promote the placement of deposits in minority owned financial institutions, and specifically directs the U.S. Treasury to make efforts to place deposits with these institutions. MOBs therefore have enhanced access to deposits from the Treasury, access which should in turn generate economic rents. The question of how these rents are used led to the studies mentioned above regarding potential improvements in efficiency or profitability. Given little evidence that the rents are devoted to those purposes, they might instead be passed along to employees in the form of improved employment, wages or benefits, or be given to the community in terms of servicing unprofitable clients (e.g., those with limited financial resources) or sponsoring community events. The rents may also be shared with the customers the banks serve. This paper focuses on the latter possibility, hypothesizing that rents flowing from the U.S. Treasury to MOBs are passed along to retail customers in the form of an interest rate premium. Given there is no direct measure of Treasury deposits available, the study borrows an analytical strategy originally pioneered in studies of wage discrimination (e.g., Oaxaca 1973; Blinder 1973). Specifically, the regressions control for a variety of alternative explanations for differences in CD rates, leaving a residual effect for MOBs which is interpreted as attributable to the MBDP. A variety of studies are reviewed to identify relevant controls. The data set employed here (described below) is unique, drawing upon a variety of sources, including regulatory reports, on a large sample of U.S. banks for the period 2002 to 2011. Due to historical circumstances, all of the MOBs in the MBDP (and in the data) are one market banks (where the market is defined as an MSA). Therefore, although the analysis draws on literature addressing differences between multiple market and local market banks, for comparability the sample is limited to small banks.",8

Till the 1990’s, job satisfaction itself was paid relatively little attention by economists, being largely dismissed as a particular example of a broader category of variables dealing with SWBFootnote 1 (Subjective Well Being). Seminal work by Hamermesh (1977, 2001) and Freeman (1978) demonstrated that job satisfaction conveyed useful economic information being a closer approximation than total earnings to total well-being from a job.Footnote 2 Hamermesh (2001) argued that job satisfaction can measure a worker’s utility from a job which can be conceptualized as a bundle of diverse characteristics, potentially useful as a “single metric allowing the worker to compare the current job to other labour-market opportunities”. Other research (Bender et al. 2005, Clark et al. 1998, Ostroff 1992, Rogers et al. 1994) have reinforced why job satisfaction needs to be studied by economists; it is correlated with objective outcomes such as, for example, the performance of a firm, consumer satisfaction, rates of absenteeism, intentions to quit as well as actual quitting behavior .Footnote 3
 With the acceptance of the economic importance of job satisfaction, a substantial portion of the economic literature has dealt with gender differences in job satisfaction, in particular with the paradox of the contented female worker (Clark 1997; Sloane and Williams 2000; Sousa-Poza and Sousa-Poza 2000a among others). The last study specifically on racial differences in job satisfaction was done in 1981 when, using national level U.S. data from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Mature Men for 1966, 1969 and 1971, Bartel (1981) showed that blacks had significantly more job satisfaction and further, this racial gap had widened over that period. However, her results applied only to older, male adults. Though the reasons for this gap and its widening were not investigated, it was suggested, in a close parallel to the reason for the contented female worker, that lower expectations due perhaps to discrimination in the labor market, could be a reasonable explanation. Surprisingly, in the decades that followed, there have been only a handful of studies and these have focused on smaller, specific groups as the following examples indicate. Bender and Heywood (2006) studied job satisfaction of PhD-level scientists in the United States and in the estimates, black females had lower job satisfaction in the business sector and black males had lower job satisfaction in the academic sector. Their focus, however, was on gender differences and the effect of tenure in academia. Antecol and Cobb-Clark (2009) found that racial harassment significantly increased job dissatisfaction and strengthened intentions to quit the military. A Canadian panel study (Hagan and Kay, 2007) of lawyers since the mid-80’s studied the link between job satisfaction, depression and gender. Using Spanish data for 1995 to 2001, Pagán and Ángel Malo (2009) compared job satisfaction between disabled and non-disabled individuals. Since the last national level study almost four and a half decades ago, more data have become available, and this paper takes the opportunity to exploit two U.S. national level data sets, the GSS and the NLSY 1997, to examine the racial gap in job satisfaction, not only for older males, but also for all working adults, both male and female. Each data set has particular strengths and advantages that complement each other. Table 1 shows, from 1972 to 2010, the job satisfaction averages for blacks and whites using the GSS cross-sectional data. In the first decade 1972–81, 50.7 % of all whites were very satisfied with their jobs as against 38.8 % of all blacks. Both experienced a dip over the next two decades, 1982–2001, but in the last period 2002 to 2010, though both blacks and whites have improved their satisfaction percentages, the gap remains significant. Thus the picture shown by Bartel in the mid to late 60’s has apparently changed. Disaggregation by sex reveals a more nuanced picture. During this time, the satisfaction gap between black and white men narrowed slightly in the second period as dissatisfaction among white men increased more than amongst black men. However, by the last period black men were worse off with 39.7 % satisfied and white men had not improved satisfaction rates in nearly four decades. Among women, in the first decade, only 37.2 % of black women as against 50.9 % of white women were very satisfied. As in the case of the men, both experienced a dip subsequently, but by 2001–2010 both had gained with 44 % of black women and 54.8 % of white women being very satisfied. The overall picture is that though some gains were made by women, job satisfaction among white males has stagnated, black males are less satisfied now and the job satisfaction gap between the two races remains significant. The unconditional difference in mean job satisfaction between blacks and whites can be due to many reasons ranging from demographic differences to occupational differences and other factors. To isolate the pure race effect, a sequential process is adopted by first examining the simple difference in the mean of job satisfaction, then seeing the impact of demographic characteristics, finally progressing to the incorporation of job attributes as well.",10

It may appear that market fundamentalism has seemingly made the social life subservient to corporations (Sandbrook 2003, 2). However, this is not the case when one looks closely at people organizing from below. Karl Polanyi’s (1944) double movement is very much alive in the world when we find stories of people organizing themselves to bring back the social life. Women in the slums mobilize local economic resources through mutual aid to resist dependence on corrupt politicians and corporations. These women reorganize money markets in their communities, and they do not wait by idly for rescue from local elites, rather they have organized financial systems for themselves and others. In Portfolios of the Poor, Collins et al. (2009, 26), trace 250 financial diaries of hundreds of poor people in the developing world, and they posit that informal banks are an important financial device for the poor entrepreneurs who cannot access sufficient levels of financing. Informal banks, usually run by women, are well-documented (Rutherford 2000; Collins et al. 2009; Ardener and Burman 1996). Yet few scholars, if any, have studied the role of “banker ladies” (women who organize community-based banks) and their politics. While scholars recognize the importance of informal banks for meeting cash flow needs, they do not analyze the deeply embedded forms of political action women undertake when they create alternative financial systems. In fact, the work of the banker ladies benefits the community as a whole. In Money-Go-Rounds, Ardener and Burman (1996) show that women rely on informal banks mainly for support networks. I argue in this paper that women have a strong desire to improve one’s living conditions and they will organize business activities in a way that they do not undermine their social lives. In their action to reclaim local economic resources and meet the social needs of poor entrepreneurs excluded from conventional banks, banker ladies insert a program of social connectedness and social justice to agitate against profit-driven forms of business practice in the Caribbean. My empirical study of 398 people in Jamaica and Guyana describes women’s creation of, and participation in, informal banks. I describe women’s politics of banking, and examine informal banks as a counter-movement to mainstream commercial banks. These informal banks are a counter-movement because they are localized, community-driven and share financial resources amongst each other in an equitable manner in contrast to conventional financial systems. Commercial banks have long excluded poor women from financial programs. Now the microfinance lenders, charged with reaching the poor, are also alienating a segment of the urban poor who do not meet their rigid requirements (Hossein 2012). These microfinance programs are not trusted by the very target group they are designed for, and at times perceived by the people to be politically motivated (ibid). It seems logical that some entrepreneurs would turn to informal banks created locally to avoid being manipulated by outside managers and politicians who target them. Despite the odds against them, banker ladies persevere under difficult conditions to incorporate systems from their ancestors to make banks inclusive. Poor women through informal banks reach the economic and social needs of the marginalized and are creating spaces for social justice when they present an alternative economy for Black communities. In 2013, the World Bank’s partner agency, Consultative Group to Assist the Poor(est) has launched its updated version, The New Microfinance Handbook (Ledgerwood 2013), where advocates and practitioners alike can learn about 101 microfinance and inclusive financing. With such guides and books, the fact is that local economic development programs fail to reach many micro/small entrepreneurs. These programs are not trusted by the very people they are designed for, because they are perceived to be politically motivated. We have seen a growth of scholarship detailing how female entrepreneurs take it upon themselves to organize community banks to ensure people have access to non-politicized funds. For example Stuart Rutherford (2000) in his class text, The Poor and their Money found that poor people deemed “unbankable” will fulfill the gap of commercial banks by creating and participating in locally-based financial programs that collect deposits and on-lends money to each other. Throughout the global South citizens viewed as ‘unbankable’ now have a place where they are listened to and can partake in financial transactions as needed. These informal community banks are grounded in self-help ideas that are grass-root and outside of the control of local elites (Ardener and Burman 1996). Informal banks are unregistered institutions, and based on people-to-people agreements. Throughout the scholarship we see that while this informal aspect of these banks can lead to misunderstandings (Collins et al. 2009; Rutherford 2000), there are many people who prefer to deal with these informal lending organizations. After several years of field work, I found that the personal risk to banker ladies is non-existent in these two countries unless they were to abscond with the funds (Hossein 2012). Local people respect and value the community engagement in these banks and work to protect them. Moreover, the rate of default is also negligible in these personal arrangements because the possibility of ostracism is so real that people would never default on their payments (Field work in Jamaica 2009; Handa and Kirton 1999; Ardener and Burman 1996). In fact, participants have admitted they would rather default on a bank loan than in an informal bank. One main reason being, that members trust and respect the people managing these banks as well as the other members in the bank. Informal banks mobilizes people especially ones excluded from formal economic programs. Social capital can also exclude people if they do not know the right kinds of persons. Microfinance programs, highly structured financial programs for the poor, rely too much on external managers (those not from the community) to organize the activity, and demand people to conform to their ideas of good forms of social capital. For example, when potential borrowers are unable to secure a reference letter from a certain type of dignitary, they are discredited as risky because their social network is localized. Bridge et al. (2009, 8) posit that organizations with a people focus builds the collective spirit. Informal banks benefit the poor business person because the banker ladies are building social capital and action within the community to finance activities based on local knowledge and the collective. Informal banks are grounded in the social life and business, and it is meshed with human compassion and values. The social economy literature has demonstrated that organizations such as self-help groups and informal banks rooted in civil society are reaching people’s needs when states and the private sector fail to do so. When the private and public sectors are limited in their capacity to reach an entrepreneur’s needs, it appears that informal banks can fill the gap. Haynes and Nembhard (1999) find that cooperatives in the inner-cities of the US can provide alternative livelihood options for poor African-Americans. Through collectivity they argue that Black Americans can move towards sustainable economic self-reliance as well as politicizing community activism. Yet, the social economy literature does not capture the ways Black people are organizing alternative financial services to contest partisan politics in formal financial institutions and programs. Banker ladies draw on African traditions of collectivity and they are building a just and equitable economy. Informal banks are well known globally as Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCAs) which are systems that provide quick access to savings and credit systems for people, mostly women, who are excluded from formal micro banking channels (Rutherford 2000; Rogaly 1996; Geertz 1962). In many parts of the world, informal community micro banks are operating, including in rich countries like the US and Canada with large diaspora populations. Ardener and Burman (1996) show that informal institutions are not only entrenched in the Third World but have moved to cities of developed countries when people migrate. Informal banks are a massive global phenomenon with hundreds of millions of people engaged in them. Rutherford’s The Poor and Their Money found that ROSCAs are in high demand among the poor because they function efficiently, offering both low defaults and low transaction costs and require less formalities. The informality of informal banks is what make them distinctive in their own right, and attractive to people. The practical aspect of making money accessible in the community for a low cost has resonated with entrepreneurs around the world. Poor people pooling money is one of the most studied phenomena which has political implications particularly in highly diverse cultural settings as in the Caribbean. The informal banks in the Caribbean are a valued African tradition, rooted in the local saving systems susus (term known in English-speaking Caribbean) and tontines (term used in French-speaking countries) brought by slaves to the Americas (Wong 1996; Witter 1989; Mintz 1955). Guyanese scholar, Maurice St. Pierre (1999) explains that informal banks were in existence in Guyana, when African slaves rotated funds among each other, as they did in the susu, or box hand groups. Faye V. Harrison’s work (1988) showed that since slave times Jamaican higglers have long struggled to make a livelihood in precarious economic and political environments and used Partner to meet their financial needs. During slavery and colonization in the new lands, African slaves Haiti had rotational credit groups in their markets (Heinel and Heinel 2005; St. Pierre 1999). Under colonialism, British banks in Jamaica and Guyana did not lend to the local people so women turned to their own local savings systems handed down to them by the generations before them. Even after emancipation, indentured servants from India also relied on their indigenous systems of sharing resources. In a documentary, Poto Mitan: Haitian Women, Pillars of a Global Economy (2008), shows Haitian women in Cité Soleil (large urban slum in Port-au-Prince) borrowing on the African traditions of Sol (informal banks) to manage their businesses. Social inequality in the Caribbean explains why informal banks are vital to the region. Stigma against Black business persons in the slums has mobilized Black entrepreneurs as a group. Hustlas and higglers (also considered small entrepreneurs) in the downtown slums of Kingston, Jamaica have developed a strong social consciousness that sets them apart from outsiders or people who are not from the area (Gray 2004). The banker ladies are fully aware of this distinct identity, they know the context, and are able to organize people in such a way that benefits the collective group. Banker ladies are well-respected because of the fact that they manage their own business affairs and do not rely on hand-outs. Anirudh Krishna (2002) argues that high levels of community mobilization in India can be turned into active capital to resist oppressive forms of social capital embedded in a culture with forms that are locally nurtured. Informal banks in the Caribbean demonstrate that people participate in these community banks and opt out of formalized pro-poor financial programs as a way to resist unfair economic systems.",8

Even before our current Great Recession racial wealth inequality was high and had begun to increase significantly in the first decade of the 21st century. Currently wealth inequality and racial wealth inequality are the highest on record (Kochhar et al. 2011). We don’t yet have national wealth data from 2010 or after the Great Recession. We know from the 2011 Pew Research Center Study (Kochhar et al. 2011, from tabulations of the U.S. Survey of Income and Program Participation data) that in addition to the net worth numbers being very low for Blacks and Latinos, there is a huge drop in wealth for everyone from 2005 when things were starting to look better (see Table 1). I am also concerned with gender wealth inequality which has been persistent and is particularly appalling for parenting women of color. Here when we disaggregate we uncover even more disturbing conditions a huge and growing gender wealth gap for single parenting women. Chang (2006, from the Survey of Consumer Finances 2001) provides a benchmark for median wealth in 2001Footnote 3: All households $74,600; Married couples $148,700 Widowed: Male $125,000; Female $73,400 Separated: Male $44,000; Female $19,380 Never Married: Male $10,700; Female $2,500 By 2007, the gender wealth gap increased, according to Chang and Mason (2010): All Households: Married/Cohabitating—$127,300 Men—$31,150 Women—$15,210 Households with Children: Married/Cohabitating—$99,170 Men—$25,300 Women—$100 Single mothers who receive child support have more wealth than those who do not receive support: $6,800 compared to zero (Chang and Mason 2010). In addition, single Black and Hispanic women in 2007 have a median wealth of $100 and $120 respectively; the median for single white women is $41,500 (Chang 2010). While white women in the prime working years of ages 36–49 have a media wealth of $42,600, the media wealth for women of color is only $5 (Chang 2010). Chang (2010) also finds that nearly half of all single Black women and Latinas have zero or negative wealth (when debts exceed assets). We know how important a stable income is and having discretionary income both as an anti-poverty strategy and for wealth building. We know that poor people, working class people and some middle class people do not have stable incomes and have consumption needs that exceed their incomes, especially if they are raising children. In fact most women of color are poor because their incomes are low and do not cover the costs of raising children (Chang 2010). The asset building movement and the major efforts to close the racial wealth gap all focus on increasing individual savings rather than guaranteeing a family income, finding ways to reduce consumption needs, and changing discriminatory policies. The current movement is still focused on teaching people to save—as if lack of savings was mostly because people don’t know how to or don’t want to save. We know that when we control for income, there is no difference between Black and white savers, or sometimes Blacks in the same income groups save more than other groups (see Hamilton and Darity 2009
Footnote 4). In addition, of the four most frequently held assets, two are consumable. The most frequently held is a motor vehicle which depreciates over time (Leigh 2006). Second is housing equity which is not very liquid and costs money to maintain—and as we recently have seen, can depreciate. In addition, of course the latest economic crisis was in the housing market and Blacks and Latinos and women were the hardest hit by subprime lending and foreclosures (Otabor and Gordon Nembhard 2012; Gordon Nembhard 2013). For example, foreclosure filings reached their peak in 2010 at 2.87 million properties (RealtyTrac Staff 2012). Predatory Lending is a credit market lending practice that creates unsuccessful borrowers by manipulating low-income and uniformed borrowers into borrowing money under conditions of excessively high interest rates (subprime) and penalties (see Rivera et al. 2008). Excessive fees can reach up to 400 % (Center for Responsible Lending n. d.). In 2005 subprime loans increased in volume from $35 billion in 1994 to $665 billion. In 2006, subprime loans as a percentage of all mortgages had grown to 23 % (from 10 % in 1998) (Rivera et al. 2008). During this housing crisis, many people, particularly people of color, women, and workers who are now unemployed, began losing what few assets they had, particularly homes, because of subprime mortgages and other predatory lending practices that targeted women and people of color (see Rivera et al. 2008; Otabor and Gordon Nembhard 2012; Gordon Nembhard 2013). These assets such as home equity, and even small business equity, are assets finally gained over the past two decades by people who had often been left out of mortgage and credit markets (Gordon Nembhard 2013). So the second most frequently held asset for people of color is under assault. The 3rd most frequently held asset is pass book savings accounts—but many fewer hold these; and in this recession interest on savings accounts is almost miniscule while costs keep rising. Many cannot pay for everyday life, need liquid assets and savings enough to use both for emergencies and for the accumulation of wealth. These individual savings accounts and such do not enable that. In addition, given the functional nature of many assets, not having them creates an additive disadvantage (Gordon Nembhard 2013). Bank accounts provide means for making and receiving payments for example, and automobiles provide transportation services. Families that do not own these types of assets have to obtain these services somewhere else, and spend more money on the alternative services—so not only do they not have the asset, they also lose money because they still need the functions those assets facilitate. This is a vicious cycle. Some of the standard asset-building strategies will help individuals to reduce their costs and increase their income, which should allow people to save more. However, most of the time the issue is not about what an individual has done or could do. Rather, we have systemic issues such as structural and institutional racism, employment stratification, and unequal access to knowledge and services, that get in the way of people being able to accumulate wealth. I suggest that community-wide and community-based asset building, and assets that democratize capital and help the group in one swoop as alternative strategies. Looking at the gender wealth gaps and the inadequacies of mainstream asset building strategies indicates to me the importance of joint ownership and joint wealth—married and widowed people have more wealth because they have access to joint assets. What about joint or collective wealth at the community level?",9

Why have many of the legislations to improve secure tenure failed to achieve efficient land administration? Considerable efforts have been made to resolve the contradictions in land management, albeit with little success. This paper uses both historical and contemporary evidence to show that the major driver of insecure tenure is the assumptions on which current land policies are based. Land in Ghana could be classified as public or privateFootnote 1. Public land, according to the 1992 Constitution of Ghana (Article 257(2)), includes: …any land which, immediately before the coming into force of this Constitution, was vested in the Government of Ghana on behalf of, and in trust for, the people of Ghana for the public service of Ghana, and any other land acquired in the public interest, for the purposes of the Government of Ghana before, on or after that date. Private land, by inference, is land that falls outside the brackets of the definition above—land that belongs to individuals, families and communities which is held by traditional authority in trust for the community (chiefs, priests, elders). Private land constitutes 78% of all land in Ghana. Government/Public land is about 20%. 2% of all land is held in dual ownership with the legal estate in the public and the equitable interest in the community (Kasanga 2003). Land is managed through a mixture of customs, market, and state regulations. How these institutions relate to one another is complex and controversial. This complexity dates as far back as the colonial period. As noted by one colonial officer, land tenure and legislation in British West Africa is characterised by peculiarities and complexities but ‘[to] try to crystallise and codify it by an artificial and repugnant statutory form of Government interference…will only result in intense dissatisfaction among those whom it is intended to benefit, and will be as doomed to failure as putting old wine in new bottles’ (Geary 1913, p.246). There are many problems with land tenure in Ghana, especially in urban and peri-urban areas. As a result, the courts have had to deal with many cases on competing claims to land. The Greater Accra Region alone is reported to have about 15,000 land cases pending before the courts (World Bank 2003). In the High Court of Kumasi, there were a total of 9, 214 land cases as of 2002 being an 18% increase from 1997 when land cases as a percentage of total cases constituted 46% (Crook 2004). In Ghana as a whole, it is estimated that there were about 60,000 land cases in court as of 2002 (Kasanga 2003). These cases go on for a long time. The uncertainty during the pendency of these land cases means that, generally, land tenure in Ghana is insecure (Ubink, 2002). This insecurity has resulted in the proliferation of land guards, individuals (e.g., ex-soldiers) who are privately contracted to guard or protect the land of others from competing interests. Exactly how many people work as land guards is hard to tell but it is widely believed that the number is increasing and land guards are becoming more dangerous. The former minister in charge of the interior or internal security believes that the land guard menace ‘is beginning to eat deep into the very fabric of our society’ (Avoka 2009). Another minister at the presidency believes that 80% of these land guards are armed (GNA 2009). These views are indicative of how deep the problem is and explains why several studies on land have focussed on this problem, albeit with different conceptual frameworks. There are those studies which emphasise law in their enquiry and those that stress economics. Still, there are others that fuse economics and law. The law-heavy approach is predominant and is popular with scholars from land economy and law (e.g. Kasim Kasanga, KW Brobby, Lennox Agbosu, Gordon Woodman and SKB Asante). These studies have been very useful in shedding light on the different laws and customary practices that shape and are, in turn, shaped by land tenure but, they tend to suffer two main weaknesses. First, many tend to hive off the impact of colonialism and often begin their enquiry with phrases like ‘since independence’ (e.g., Gambrah 2002). When they engage with some historical material, it is mainly to chronicle changes in laws relating to land. Though important, these studies are vulnerable to the criticism that the present cannot be fully understood without a context—an appreciation of the history which gave rise to the present (See Austin 2005 for elaboration of this critique). A more fundamental setback of these studies is that many take the system of land tenure as given and hence work within a framework that makes only incremental changes possible or that leads to a public administration analysis of land which emphasises improvement in human resource capacity, the production of maps, and the institution of more laws. The second category of studies, undertaken by economists, has been relatively few. Locally, these studies have mainly emerged from the Institute of Statistical Social and Economic Research (ISSER) of the University of Ghana (e.g., Aryeteey et al. 2007) and have tried to make the land question a part of the economic discourse. They have tried to steer the land problem away from the predominance of law and principles of land management to issues of economic growth and development. Unfortunately, not many of them engage with the legal dimension and politics of the land question and how these politico-legal dynamics impinge on the value of land. They have, to use what J.K Galbraith (1978, p.19) said of economics generally, taken ‘a virginal view of the subject from which government is excluded’. Studying land from a purely legal view is problematic but, it does not follow that the study of land should be divorced of law completely. Unfortunately, these economists have, in their study of Ghana’s land economy, thrown the baby out with the bathwater. For that reason, they too produce an incomplete picture. The third group has members from the first and the second. There is a fusion of economics and law in the method of enquiry. Generally, their framework leads them to what Catherine Boone (2007, p.557) calls ‘a referendum on the market’. Two sets of conclusions are typical. The first, akin to the position taken by the architects of the current land policies in Ghana, uses an evolutionary
Footnote 2 discourse. It argues that customary land tenure is inefficient. It inhibits investment, prevents individual thrift, and impedes the development of land markets (Firmin-Sellers 1996, p.151). Therefore, land reform should be such that it would enable land owners to access credit market and, in turn, be able to improve their standard of living (including increasing their income and improving their quality of housing). The second is strikingly different. Argued by a communitarian school, the characteristic claim is that land reform should revert to traditional land tenure system. According to communitarians, the current system of insecurity is the result of state-led policies and the duality of law—customary and statutory—which was created by colonialism (see Amanor 2001, pp. 5–20 for a full discussion). The weakness of the evolutionary view is that it parochialises the question of land into a matter of only efficiency and loans. It fails to come to terms with the dynamic nature of land and overlooks questions of inequality. These weaknesses are the strengths of the communitarian view. However, the communitarian view also suffers a major weakness in terms of its view of traditional society as inherently egalitarian (see, for example, Ubink 2008 for discussion). However, as we shall see, the view of the ‘holy’ traditional society does not seem to be correct. For instance, A.J Loveridge (1943, pp.32–33, emphasis in original) notes that ‘[a] Chief with his Council may be benevolently minded but the calls of the present are usually more pressing than those of the future and yet it is the tribal inheritance that is disposed of parcel by parcel. The protector becomes the disposer of the inheritance. The trustee becomes the owner’. More fundamentally, Loveridge observes, if a little exaggerated, that ‘[t]here is no Doomsday Book’ for a chief. A new type of research on land is emerging. Not only does it merge the two frameworks of economics and land economy/law but also it uses a political economic approach which emphasises the socio-economic and political dimensions of the land question set in a historical context. Questions of class, gender, and distribution are important to its epistemology. Locally, this research has come from a source usually unknown for studies on land tenure, the Institute of African Studies, at the University of Ghana, where Associate Professor Kojo Amanor is decidedly the main voice (see, for example, Amanor 2006, 2005, 2001). Others outside Ghana such as Janine Ubink of the Van Vollenhoven Institute of Law, and Gareth Austin of the London School of Economics and Political Science have also been part of this relatively new way of looking at the effectiveness of land policies (see, for example, Ubink 2008; 2007a, b; Ubink and Quan 2008; Austin 2005). This paper adopts the political economic method used by this latter group of scholars in evaluating the effectiveness of land policies and how they have impacted cities. The key elements of this approach are its emphasis on class, the relations between the economy and the state (traditional and modern institutions), the influence of economic forces on changes in land use and revolutionary strategies for reform. It contrasts with an orthodox, neoclassical economic methodology based on the use of the individual as the unit of analysis, restrictive assumptions such as perfect information, an emphasis on the price mechanism as the best means of allocating resources, and a methodology of modelling and formal statistical analysis (For a demonstration of how this method is used in analysing the land question in the case of Ghana, see, for example, Aryeetey and Udry 2010; Owusu 2008; Goldstein and Udry 2008; Hammond 2008). The political economic approach emphasises evolution in historical time, distributive efficiency and analysis of how institutions of varying degrees of power interact with the economic system to produce different social, political, economic and environmental outcomes (see Butler et al. 2009, pp.112–114; Stilwell 2006, pp.4–5; Anderson 2004, pp.141–144; O’Hara 2001, pp. 861–862; Keen 2003; Stilwell 1995, pp.16–17). It does not insist all factors must necessarily be precisely estimated to be deemed ‘proved’ or established. Historical accounts from sources as diverse as newspapers and letters, case study analysis, theoretical characterisations, and qualitative descriptions can be used, as many socio economic phenomena do not lend themselves easily to quantification. Using both historical and contemporary evidence, this paper argues that the assumptions on which current land policies are based, the supposed pristine Ghanaian customary laws (Amanor 2005; Ubink 2007a), are flawed. Pre-colonialFootnote 3 Ghana was tribopatriarchal. It was closed and self-contained. There was trade but this was local and on barter basis. Although the society was primitive, it did not have all the characteristics of a ‘primitive communal’ society as Marx conceived of it, because there was exploitation based on age, sex, and class. It is those features that explain the existence of ‘domestic’ slavery at the time. The society underwent radical transformation with the introduction of market economy and peripheral capitalism through trade, the defeat of Ashanti and the takeover of the tribopatriarchal society by Britain (collectively labelled ‘colonialism’). In turn, exploitation based on the mode and relations of production began (Howard 1980). Though the levels, intensity, and nature of exploitation differed, neither pre colonial nor colonial Ghanaian society was egalitarian. Hence, land policy based on the architecture of these societies tends to be inherently unequal, not because of government failure to deal with a few backward areas: it is a structural problem that strikes the core of land policy in Ghana. This paper argues that the perceived custodians of land have consistently acted in their individual and class interests while successfully using a discourse of ‘communal’ to secure the backing of the colonial and post colonial state. Overall, the state has substantially promoted the interest of private capital. Not surprisingly, the ‘public good’ outcomes the current land policies ostensibly seek to achieve have only been modestly attained. Instead, land policies have had perverse implications for weaker groups like the poor, especially women, and impacted cities negatively. This story is told in two main parts: a critical narrative of land policy from the colonial times to date; and an analysis of the effects of recent reforms.",29

Ahmed,Andrew van Hulten,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"In response to slow economic growth and financial crises in the 1970s and 1980s, many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa implemented market-based reforms, often at the behest of the Bretton Woods institutions. A common aim of these reforms was to better integrate African economies into the global financial system. Key policy measures included (domestic) financial liberalization, capital account liberalization, financial services liberalization and the floating of exchange rates. These policy reforms were informed by neoclassical economic theory, which predicted that the removal of financial controls would increase investment and growth rates and improve consumption smoothing. The withdrawal of government controls in the financial sector was also an attack on rent seeking and corruption, which was endemic in many African countries. Liberalization policies were especially attractive because they required little government expenditure; an attractive feature for many fiscally constrained African countries. The Asian financial crisis was an important intellectual turning point. Short-term capital flow reversals and unregulated lending instigated the crises in Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea, and were implicated in subsequent crises in Latin America, Russia, Turkey and elsewhere. Around this time, empirical research began to demonstrate that a simple and robust relationship between capital account openness and growth may not exist. Some economists argued that financial and capital account liberalization adversely affect growth by increasing macroeconomic volatility and the incidence of financial and currency crises (Eatwell and Taylor 2000; Stiglitz 2000). Out of the Asian crisis emerged a new and more cautious approach to advocating financial and capital account liberalization, which we term the ‘thresholds paradigm.’ This new paradigm can be traced to the IMF’s initial attempts to explain and respond to the Asian financial crisis.Footnote 1 In the midst of the Asian crisis, while rescue packages were being hastily put together, economists from the IMF began the task of explaining the causes of the crisis. IMF staff (1998) lay most of the blame on the crisis-affected countries rather than on international financial markets. Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia—previously held up as exemplars of the benefits of economic globalization—were criticised for having poor prudential regulation and data dissemination standards, misaligned exchange rates and corrupt lending practices. In the following years, a series of influential academic papers developed this general position (Prasad et al. 2003; Kose et al. 2006, 2010, 2011). These papers argued that certain preconditions needed to be met before countries could enjoy the benefits of ‘financial globalization’. These thresholds, or preconditions, included deep financial markets, good institutions and macroeconomic policies, and a high level of trade openness.Footnote 2
 This paper critically reviews and analyses the ‘thresholds paradigm.’ It does this, first, by analysing the manner in which the thresholds paradigm introduces complex issues, such as the quality of institutions and macroeconomic policy, to the debate about financial globalization. It argues that the thresholds paradigm, while an important evolution in the financial globalization debate, leaves important questions of causal relations between growth and ‘threshold variables’ under-examined. A consequence of this is that important policy questions have not been adequately addressed. Second, the paper analyses how well the thresholds paradigm captures the contrasting experiences of two African countries—Nigeria and Botswana—that pursued policies of financial globalization. The cross-country comparison demonstrates that important country-specific factors, which are neglected by the existing thresholds literature, shaped the outcomes of financial globalization in Nigeria and Botswana. The case studies re-iterate that the thresholds paradigm engages with complex and important issues, such as the origins of ‘good’ institutions and macroeconomic policies, in a superficial manner. The paper concludes that researchers need to delve deeper into the complex interrelationship between global financial integration, institutional evolution and macroeconomic stability rather than simply appending policy and institutional variables to a fundamentally neoclassical understanding of the operation of financial markets. The paper comprises five remaining sections. Section “A Critique of the Thresholds Paradigm” defines ‘financial globalization’, traces the evolution of the thresholds paradigm in the empirical literature and demonstrates some important oversights of the existing literature. Section “Methodological Justification” justifies our case-study approach and Section “Botswana and Nigeria’s Contrasting Experiences of Liberalization” compares the outcomes of financial globalization in Nigeria and Botswana. Section “How Well Does the Precondition Paradigm Explain the Contrasting Experiences of Botswana and Nigeria?” examines how well the thresholds paradigm captures the contrasting trajectories of financial globalization in Nigeria and Botswana. Section “Conclusion” concludes by summarizing the strengths and oversights of the existing thresholds literature and outlines important areas for future research.",3
41.0,2.0,The Review of Black Political Economy,22 February 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12114-014-9177-y,Poor Eyesight and Educational Outcomes in Ethiopia,June 2014,Robert Poppe,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Poor health is recognized to be a major obstacle to the progress of developing countries (World Bank 1993). Yet, little is known about the mechanisms linking health and development. This paper explores the link between health and development by documenting the relationship between poor eyesight and educational outcomes. Poor eyesight is a considerable burden in developing countries. Bundy et al. (2003) report the prevalence of refractive errors among school age children in developing countries at 10 percent, most of which could be corrected by eyeglasses. This paper investigates the role of poor vision on educational outcomes using data from high-poverty school catchment areas in rural Ethiopia. The dataset is unique in that it collected data on visual acuity for close to 2000 school-age children. The paper explores the relationship between poor eyesight and school dropout rates, grade repetition, learning achievement and cognitive development. This is one of few studies that have examined the role of vision impairment on educational outcomes in developing countries and the only paper, to our knowledge, using data from Sub-Saharan Africa. Gomes-Neto et al. (1997), using data from rural Brazil, find that poor vision increases dropout, hinders grade promotion and decreases performance in achievement tests. In a randomized controlled trial administered in rural China, Glewwe et al. (2012) investigate the role of providing eyeglasses to visually impaired students and find that for students who accepted eyeglasses, average test scores increased by 0.15 to 0.22 standard deviations, equivalent to 0.33-0.5 years of additional schooling. Drawing on the same data, Hannum and Zhang (2012) find that students who wear glasses perform better on literacy and math tests, and are less likely to fail a class. Few studies have investigated the relationship between poor eyesight and learning outcomes, although it is believed that children with poor eyesight can lose educational opportunities if in fact eyesight problems lead to low grade attainment and prevent better learning outcomes. Schooling decisions can be viewed as parental decisions that are based on (perceived) net marginal returns to schooling.Footnote 1 When a child’s school performance is anticipated or revealed to be low, as a consequence of poor vision or other learning hindering factors, perceived net marginal returns may become negative.Footnote 2 Low school performance increases the likelihood of non-promotion which in turn increases the likelihood of dropout and repetition.Footnote 3
 There is growing interest in the relationship between health and educational outcomes.Footnote 4 A positive correlation between health and education has been firmly established in the literature. However, the causal relationship between health and education remains uncertain. First, health may causally affect education. Stronger health may result in children obtaining more education (Behrman and Rosenzweig 2004). Second, education may causally affect health, lowering morbidity and mortality in adult life (Lleras-Muney 2005). Third, there may exist a third omitted factor affecting both health and education such as time preferences (Eide and Showalter 2011). This paper contributes to the literature by investigating the role of poor eyesight across gender in one of the poorest countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Of the few studies which have investigated the relationship between poor vision and schooling outcomes among children, most have used data from Asia. Whereas other studies have looked at the impact of poor eyesight of children, the gender dimension of poor eyesight on educational outcomes in developing countries has not been explored in the literature. If households view net returns to education to be lower for girls than for boys, then girls will be more at risk of dropping out due to health problems that hinder learning. Psacharopoulos and Patrinos (2004) find that returns to primary education are much lower for girls than for boys.Footnote 5 In a study on the impact of increased job opportunities for women, Jensen (2012) finds large positive effects on educational attainment, suggesting that investments in women’s education are low because returns are perceived to be low. Broussard (2012), who focuses on nutrition’s role for human capital, provides evidence that households allocate more resources to male household members whose market returns are higher. Hence, when, possibly due to poor eyesight, school performance is low, girls’ net returns to continued schooling will be more likely perceived to be negative, resulting in withdrawal from school. While poor eyesight may indeed negatively impact learning, it may also be the case that poor eyesight is associated with improved learning outcomes if students who study more are more susceptible to vision problems. Angle and Wissmsann (1980) argue that vision can be affected by individuals’ activities, in particular how much time they spent doing ‘near-work’ activities. Near-work activities, such as reading, are likely to be correlated with schooling outcomes potentially making inference on the relationship between eyesight and schooling outcomes spurious. Students’ vision may suffer from reverse causality as children who study more will have their eyesight deteriorate faster. In studies in Asia, the correlation of prevalence of myopia (nearsightedness) and educational attainment has been found to be positive (Tay et al. 1992; Au Eong et al. 1993).Footnote 6
 Poor eyesight is influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. In urban areas, a higher prevalence of myopia has been documented in a number of studies (He et al. 2004; Lin et al. 2004; Wu et al. 2001). As mentioned above, one possible explanation is that children in urban areas spend more time reading and writing outside the school compared to children in rural areas (Saw et al. 2001). Parents that have myopia tend to have children that have myopia. However, the roles of environmental influences and genetic predisposition to myopia remain uncertain (Mutti et al. 2002). In particular, parents may pass on their inclination to reading to their children rather than myopia itself. Identifying the effect of poor eyesight on educational outcomes is complicated due to these endogeneity issues. Although there are a number of limitations in identifying the causal impact of poor eyesight on educational outcomes, documenting the relationship between vision problems in school age children and educational outcomes is an important first step in identifying mechanisms that either improve or hinder children’s learning outcomes. The results obtained in this study show that poor vision is positively related to school dropout among girls. Girls that suffer from poor eyesight have an 8 percentage points higher probability of school dropout. The results also show that learning achievement is negatively related with poor eyesight. The outline of the paper is as follows. Section “Data and Descriptive Analysis” describes the data used in this study. Section “Empirical Specification and Results” presents the empirical specification and the results. Section “Conclusion” concludes.",1

Medoff,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The Centers for Disease Control (2012) in its annual abortion survey for the United States in 2009, the latest year available, reported that the abortion rate (i.e. the number of abortions per 1,000 women of childbearing ages 15 to 44 years) was 10.3. A prominent feature of the US abortion statistics is the significant differences between white, black and Hispanic women. A disproportionately large number of abortions are performed on black and Hispanic women. White women have the lowest abortion rate of 8.5 abortions per 1,000 white women of childbearing age. The abortion rate for black women was nearly 4 times higher at 32.5 abortions per 1,000 black women of childbearing age. While the abortion rate for Hispanic women was 19.3 abortions per 1,000 Hispanic women of childbearing age. This racial disparity raises the question of whether there is a difference in the way white, black and Hispanic women respond to state restrictions on abortion access. The U.S. Supreme Court’s 1973 Roe v. Wade decision held that a woman’s right to have an abortion was constitutionally protected as part of her right to privacy. In a companion case, Doe v. Bolton, the Supreme Court further held that a woman may obtain an abortion after the fetus was viable if it was necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother taking into account such factors as her physical, psychological, emotional and familial condition. Rather than settle the issue, these decisions spurred a variety of laws at the state level that restricted women’s access to an abortion. The Supreme Court’s Roe/Doe decisions recognized that states have a right to regulate abortion access, but only if the law or regulation had a compelling interest in protecting a pregnant women’s maternal health. In 1992, the Supreme Court in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey reaffirmed the right of states to regulate abortion, but replaced the maternal health criteria with the undue burden standard. The Court declared that states could impose a restriction on abortion access provided that the state law or regulation did not have “… the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.” The undue burden standard gave states considerable more latitude to regulate abortion access. Prior to the Casey decision, the two most common laws enacted by states were restrictions on the funding of Medicaid abortions and parental involvement laws. In 1976, Congress enacted a law (commonly known as the Hyde amendment, which is a rider that is attached every year to the appropriations bill that funds the Department of Health and Human Services) that prohibited federal funds from being used to pay for abortions for poor women on Medicaid and allowed states the discretion to discontinue funding of Medicaid abortions as well. In 1980, the Supreme Court ruled in Harris v. McRae that the federal funding restriction was constitutional and thereafter many states passed laws that prohibited the use of their public funds to pay for Medicaid abortions. In these states, women on Medicaid must pay the entire out-of-pocket cost of an abortion. In the years following the Roe decision the Supreme Court, in a series of decisions, held that pregnant unmarried teen minors (less than 18 years of age) are constitutionally permitted to make the decision to have an abortion (Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth; Bellotti v. Baird; H. L. v. Matheson; Hodgson v. Minnesota; Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health). But, the Supreme Court also held that a state’s interest in protecting the health and safety of a teen minor to be sufficient for a state to require parental involvement − either parental consent or parental notification − before an abortion could be performed on a teen minor. After the 1992 Casey decision, numerous states enacted new laws restricting abortion access. Many states passed mandatory counseling laws that apply only to abortion. These counseling laws require that an abortion provider furnish to every woman, usually 24 h before the procedure, state-approved abortion-specific medical information of possible, but very rare and in some cases inaccurate or exaggerated, complications and side effects from having an abortion. The implicit, and in some states, the explicit purpose of mandatory counseling laws is to dissuade women from having an abortion. In most mandatory counseling states, the abortion provider does not have to furnish the abortion-specific medical information to the woman in person. The information may be given or offered to the woman by telephone, mail, fax or over the Internet. However, five states (Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Utah and Wisconsin) as of 2005 have two-visit laws that require women receive the medical information in person at least 24 h before the abortion is performed. Two-visit laws require that women make two separate trips to the abortion provider − one for the sole purpose of receiving the state-mandated medical information and the second trip to obtain the abortion. Two-visit laws impose substantial travel expenses, lost income and time costs on women seeking an abortion. To date, there have been only three studies (Cook et al. 1999; Morgan and Parnell 2002; Joyce and Kaestner 1996) which have empirically investigated whether restrictive state abortion laws differentially affect the abortion demand of white, black and Hispanic women. However, these were case studies and their findings may not generalize to all 50 states. The answer to the question of whether restrictive state abortion laws differentially affect the abortion demand of white, black and Hispanic women is particularly well-suited to analysis using the fertility control model developed by Becker (1960) and extended by Michael (1973), which emphasizes how changes in costs affect the pregnancy resolution decisions of women in a predictable manner. The purpose of this paper is to empirically analyze the impact restrictive state abortion laws have on the demand for abortion by white, black and Hispanic women. If white, black or Hispanic women are disproportionately affected by restrictive state abortion laws, then it might be argued that, under the undue burden standard, restrictive state abortion laws have the effect of establishing a substantial obstacle or barrier to obtaining an abortion.

Several prominent economists were instrumental in the construction and implementation of policy that promoted greater market influence on the determination of rates and entry on trucking, rail and airline transportation services. Notable among these economists is Marcus Alexis. His unique attributes as a research economist and policy analyst are evident in his stewardship of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), the oldest regulatory agency in the US, during the implementation of deregulation in trucking, and rail transportation service. This article highlights the writings and teachings of Marcus Alexis on the political and economic movement toward regulatory change in surface transportation services.Footnote 1 Analysis of the current state of the transportation industry and the current focus of economic regulation is also presented with the purpose of examining the accuracy of Alexis’ prediction on the effect of regulatory reform on the economics of trucking and rail industries and their labor markets. The following section presents the economic importance of the ICC and the policy decisions of its commissioners by describing the regulatory history of US surface transportation. Section 3 applies the theoretical framework developed by Marcus Alexis to explain the changing political and economic opinion toward surface transportation regulation by the early 1970s. Section 4 test the accuracy of Alexis’ hypothesis on the efficacy of deregulation on product and labor market outcomes in the rail road and trucking industries. Concluding remarks are presented in the last section.",2

Betsey,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The 1971 article, “Some Negro-White Differences in Consumption,” published in the book edited by George Joyce and Norman A.P. Govoni, was my introduction to Marcus Alexis’s work (Alexis 1971a).Footnote 1 The article is in large part based on his Ph. D. dissertation at the University of Minnesota (and other published work) (Alexis 1959a, b; Alexis 1962; Alexis 1970a, b; Alexis 1971b) that sets the context of black consumer behavior in relation to other economic research at the time. Marcus’s work was largely empirical, and when he referenced the major theories bearing on this area of research, particularly Friedman’s permanent income hypothesis (Friedman 1957) and Duesenberry‘s relative income hypothesis (Duesenberry 1949), he did so largely in passing. This is particularly true of Friedman’s work which Alexis acknowledges in his dissertation, but to which he pays little attention.Footnote 2
 Much of the early data that Alexis and others used to examine black consumer behavior came from the Consumer Purchases Study of 1935–36, a joint project of the Works Progress Administration, Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the U.S. National Resources Committee (US National Resources Committee 1938, 1939).Footnote 3 Later, researchers came to rely on family budget studies conducted by the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan (Klein et al. 1954).Footnote 4 The Michigan group at the time included George Katona, Lawrence Klein, John Lansing, James Morgan, and Eva Mueller, among others. The Michigan SRC conducted the Surveys of Consumer Finances for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System annually from 1954 to about 1992 when the survey moved to the National Opinion Research Corporation (now NORC at the University of Chicago). Alexis points to several limitations of the Consumer Purchases Study data that affect the reliability of the studies based on them. He points out that the study sample sizes were not uniform, so that the black sample drawn for Columbus, OH represented about 27 % of its 1930 black population. On the other hand, the black samples in New York City and Chicago represented only about 2 % of their 1930 populations. Additionally, since the samples were confined to non-relief families (a smaller share of whom would be black) the sample may have overstated thre relative economic position of blacks. Alexis points out that the latter concern is overcome to the extent that the studies he reviews compared black and white families in the same income classes. On the other hand, his assessment is that this group of studies provides only “crude measures of economic comparability,” since none explicitly control for family size or composition, and only a few utilize measures of assets or consider their impact on consumption.Footnote 5

Mason,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The data are taken from the Annual Social & Economic Supplement, Current Population Survey (March CPS), 1994–2012. The CPS is a household survey of civilian, non-institutionalized, adults (persons at least 15 years of age).Footnote 1 Our sample includes only working-age persons, that is, individuals 16–64 years of age during the year of the survey. Throughout this paper “African American” and “black” are used interchangeably for Non-Hispanic African American. Similarly, “white” is shorthand for Non-Hispanic white. Most Hispanics in the CPS are self-described as white, while some are self-described as black. Per the CPS usage, Hispanics (or Latinos) are an ethnic category rather than a racial category; hence, “Hispanic” will include both blacks and whites. According to U.S. Census numbers, in 1970 the foreign born population accounted for 4.8 % of the total population, compared to 12.55 % in 2009, representing 38.5 million immigrants out of a total population of 307 million persons. Thirty-two percent of these immigrants have arrived since 2000, 28 % arrived in the 1990s, 20 % arrived during the 1980s, and 21 % before 1980. The regions of origin are Europe (12 %), Asia (27 %), Caribbean (10 %), Mexico and Central America (38 %), South America (6 %), rest of the world (7 %). Immigration has contributed to national population and labor force growth and to the growth of racial and ethnic minorities within American society. During any given year, the immigrant share of the US labor force represents multiple cohorts, having arrived during alternative business cycles or after major institutional or policy changes. Figure 1 presents the immigrant share of the US labor force during 1994–2012, for all immigrants and by period of arrival. In 1994 immigrants represented 11 % of the US labor force and rapidly increased to 15 % by 2002. Thereafter, the immigrant share continued to increase but at a slower rate, rising to just 16 % in 2010 and to 17 % in 2012. The largest group of immigrants arrived during 1982–1991 and 1992–2001. Immigrants arriving during the 1980s represented 4.5 % of the labor force during 1994–2007, before declining to about 4 % of the labor force. Immigrants arriving during the 1990s rapidly increased from 1 % of the labor force in 1994 to 6.5 % of the labor force in 2003 and remained at about 6 % through 2012. Except for immigrants arriving during the mid-2000s, all other immigrants represented a declining share of the US labor force. Immigrants in US workforce, by year of arrival: 1994–2012 Table 1 shows the ancestral origin, race, and ethnicity of immigrants. Mexicans were 29 % of all US immigrants during 1994–2000, but increased to 33 % during 2008–2012. Canadians and Europeans are an increasingly smaller share of US immigrants, falling from 2 to 1.5 % and from 14 to 10 %, respectively. Today’s immigrants are increasingly additions to America’s racial and ethnic minority groups. For example, the black immigrant share rose from 8 % in 1994–2000 to 10 % in 2008–2012, while Hispanic immigrant share rose from 46 to 50 % during the same period. Much of the literature on the effects of immigration on labor market outcomes of native workers has focused on males. Accordingly, Figs. 2, 3, and 4 present important labor market outcomes for native African American males: employment-population ratio, mean weekly workhours, and mean weekly wages for 1994–2012. Each outcome provides a sharp contrast with the long term increase in the immigrant share of the US labor force. Employment-population ratio, African American males, 1993–2011 Mean weekly hours, native African American males, 1993–2011 Mean weekly wage, native African American males, 1993–2011 If immigrants and native African Americans are substitutes, the canonical neoclassical model of immigration predicts a negative relationship between native wages and increases in immigration in the short-run, as well as a negative relationship between native participation and employment and increases in immigration in the short-run. However, African American malewages, employment, and participation did not decline in the 1990s as the immigration share of the labor force increased. Instead, the African American male employment-population ratio rose from 64 % to 71 % during 1993–1999, while mean weekly workhours increased by 2 h from 30.6 to 32.6 during the same period—a 6.5 % increase in weekly workhours. Mean wages of African American males rose from about $702 in 1993 to $866 percent in 2002. The labor market outcomes of African American males did decrease during the 2000s, but this was a period of much slower immigration than during the 1990s. Rather than immigration, the recessions of 2001–2002 and 2007–2009 appear to the primary factors pulling down the employment, participation, and wages of African American males. Table 2 summarizes the data presented in Figs. 2, 3, and 4. Each entry is the slope coefficient from a bivariate regression of a labor market outcome on the aggregate immigrant share or alternative arrival cohorts. When we consider all arrivals, a one percentage point increase in the share of immigrants is correlated with 0.75 h reduction in weekly work time, 0.01 % reduction in the labor force participation of African American males, and 2.15 % increase in the wage rate. Our data cover a period of 18 years and contains three business cycles: 1994–2001, 2002–2007, 2008–2012. The transition years, that is, 2001–2002 and 2007–2009, represent the onset of recessions and the beginning of recoveries. Investment spending falls rapidly during recessions and rises rapidly during recoveries; hence, the transition years represent periods of rapid capital adjustment and provide a natural demarcation of the short-run versus the long-run. Per the canonical neoclassical model of immigration, we would expect the coefficients of Table 2 to be zero. The “all arrivals” coefficients for employment and participants are not zero, but they are small. The “all arrivals” coefficient for the wage equation is large and has the wrong side. The short-run effects of immigration are associated with the most recent arrivals, while the long-run effects of immigration are associated with the most distant arrivals. Hence, the coefficients should be negative and decreasing in absolute value as we move from the 1990s arrivals to pre-1965 arrivals (LaLonde and Topel 1991). Focusing on the coefficients of the arrival cohorts, none of the coefficients have the expected pattern. A one percentage point increase in the share of immigrants who arrived before the Immigration Act of 1965, a minimum of 30 years before the labor market outcomes of 1994–2012, is associated with an increase of 3.65 h of weekly work for African American males, an increase of 0.06 percentage points in the fraction employed, but a 8.7 % reduction in weekly wages. Additionally, as we moved forward from pre-1965 to the most recent arrival cohorts the coefficients for workhours and fraction employed do increase in absolute value but the coefficients are not positive and, hence, are also moving in the wrong direction. For 1990s arrivals, the effect on employment is small and not significant, while the coefficient on wages is positive and large. Collectively considered, these correlations are not completely consistent with the canonical neoclassical theory of immigration. But, Table 2 does establish that the labor market effects of older cohorts (longrun effects) are quite different from the labor market effects of recent cohorts (shortrun effects). Of course, Table 2 provides only unadjusted correlations and hence cannot be used to provide a definitive analysis of the substitutability of African American and immigrant workers.Footnote 2 Competitive substitution in the labor market is in some measure related to whether or not groups have similar regional distributions and similar skills (education and age). Fifty-six percent (1994–2000)–59 % (2001–2010) percent of native African American workers ages 16–64 reside in the South (Table 3). Thirty percent of working-age native Latinos reside in this region. However, the Southern fraction of native Hispanics is heavily weighted by the number of Mexican Americans residing in Texas, the second most populous state in the US. Texas is culturally and geographically Southern and Western, but the CPS identifies Texas as a Southern state. African Americans are 12 % of the population of Texas and mostly live in East Texas and the cities of Houston and Dallas. Mexican Americans are 36 % of the population of Texas and are predominately residents of Western, Southern, Northern, and Central Texas, and the cities of San Antonio, Dallas, Austin, Houston, and El Paso. In short, after accounting for the idiosyncrasies of Texas, far fewer than 30 % of native Hispanics live in the South. Both native and immigrant Hispanics are much more likely to reside in the West, where only 8 % of African Americans reside but 42–48 % of Latinos reside. Moreover, throughout the 1990s and 2000s about ½ of Hispanic immigrants are high school dropouts versus 20 % of native African Americans. Blacks are twice as likely to be college graduates. These regional and educational differences constrain African American—Hispanic job market competition. Immigrant African Americans have increased their presence in the South. During 1994–2000, 34 % (men) and 31 % (women) of black immigrants ages 16–64 resided in the South. By 2001–2010, 38 % of black immigrants were Southern residents. Hence, both native and immigrant African Americans are migrating to the South, which suggests increasing intra-regional competition for employment. Among males during 1994–2000, 23 % of immigrant blacks have one or more college degrees versus 11 % of native blacks; among women, 20 % of immigrant blacks have one or more college degrees versus 13 % of native blacks. Native African Americans were not more likely to compete with immigrant blacks for college jobs during the 2000s: 29 and 14 % of immigrant and native black males, respectively, had at least one college degree, while 23 and 17 % of immigrant and native black women, respectively, had at least one college degree. So, although both native and immigrant blacks are increasingly living in the South, they have different levels of education. Asian immigrants are 1.5 to 2 years older than native African Americans, predominately Western residents (41–47 %), and about 3–4 times as likely to have at least one college degree. All of which suggests prima facie evidence of limited job market competition between native African Americans and immigrant Asians. The Northeast is America’s most populous region. Native whites are the only group whose Northeastern representation did not decline during 1994–2010 and they are also the only group whose Southern representation declined during 1994–2010. All other groups, especially black immigrants, experienced decreases in Northeastern residential location and increases in Southern residential location. Indeed, immigrant blacks also had large increases in their Northcentral location. Table 4 presents immigrant shares of the workforce by age, education, and workyear. The maximum immigrant share occurs for dropouts (persons with less than 12 years of education) who are 31 to 50 years of age. The immigrant share rose from 32 % in 1994 (the highest share for any age-education group in that year) to 53 % in 2010 (also, the highest share for any age-education group in that year). For all workers with less than 12 years of education, the immigrant share rose from 22 % in 1994 to 30 % in 2010. About 1 in 5 African American workers are in this education group (Table 3). For senior workers, that is, persons 51 to 64 years of age, immigrants are less than or equal to 10 % of the labor force for persons with at least 12 years of education. For young and middle age workers, the immigrant share is about 10 to 16 % for high school graduates and is 13 % for persons with a graduate degree. The pattern of immigrant shares suggests that to the extent that immigration has a significant effect on employment and wages, the effects will be greatest for high school dropouts and high school graduates (persons with only 12 years of education), especially for prime-age workers. For 2001–2010, we note then that Table 1 shows that 59 % of native African American male workers and 54 % of native African American female workers are within the education groups facing the highest immigration shares.",2

Logan,John M. Parman,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"There is now a growing body of evidence pertaining to the historical health of the African American population, and this data is currently being used to uncover a number of facts about the historical dynamics of African American health. In this paper, we dispel the myth that our historical data on the health of African Americans is wholly lacking and at the same time show that one prominent myth about trends in African American health does not stand up to historical investigation. Chowkwanyun (2011) notes that analysis of health disparities requires historical investigation. This review is based on ongoing research we have performed on historical dimensions of African American health and human capital (Logan 2009; Logan and Parman 2011), and we review and reframe those previous findings in light of the myths they dispel. We conclude with a brief note about where this research is headed and what future topics should be explored in African American economic and health history. The most prominent conjecture, motivated by contemporary scholarship, is that much of what we attribute to racial differences in health over time (say, mortality or morbidity differences) can rightly be explained by socioeconomic differences such as occupation or income. The argument has intuitive appeal—if both race and socioeconomic status are related to health outcomes and if the racial distribution of socioeconomic status is skewed, then part of what we attribute to racial differences is actually due to socioeconomic differences. This same type of argument has been applied to many other areas of well-being: schooling, income, family formation and composition, labor force attachment, involvement in the criminal justice system, and the like. The general idea is that socioeconomics plays its own role in these sorts of disparities, and to the extent that African Americans are concentrated at the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum, the results we attribute to race should be qualified. Despite the large attention paid to health disparities at present, we know very little about historical dimensions of the relationships. To unpack the myth we must collect and analyze data that looks at a long period of time and that allows us to distinguish between the racial and socioeconomic differences in mortality so that decomposition can be attempted. Building on the pioneering matching methodology described by Preston et al. (1996) and the general techniques laid out by Fogel (1993), we obtain a random sample of death certificates from the Carolinas at 5 year intervals from 1910 to 1970. The Carolina death certificates also contain the usual occupation of the deceased, which allows us to estimate the racial and socioeconomic relationships mortality relationships over the twentieth century. We also advance the field by using the detailed information on the death certificates, which list cause of death, allowing us to look at racial and socioeconomic differences in cause specific mortality over the twentieth century. We find that controlling for occupation actually increases the racial gap in mortality over the twentieth century. African Americans in high-status occupations died at earlier ages than blacks in general, and we show that this result is robust to a number of criticisms. Contrary to the claim that racial gaps in health outcomes are partially explained by socioeconomic differences, the results of our preliminary analysis suggest that racial gaps in mortality were largest at the highest socioeconomic positions over much of the twentieth century. Rather than acting as a buffer for mortality outcomes, high socioeconomic status among African Americans led to higher mortality in the past.",2
41.0,3.0,The Review of Black Political Economy,12 June 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12114-014-9186-x,Hispanic Self-identification and Birth Weight Outcomes among U.S.- and Foreign-born Blacks,September 2014,Tiffany Green,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Economists are devoting increasing amounts of attention to understanding the long term effects of early life health for good reason: evidence demonstrates that poor health at birth affects health throughout childhood, adolescence and adulthood (Masho and Archer 2011; Fanaroff et al. 2007; Currie and Gruber 1996; Green 2011; Barker 1993). Suboptimal health is also related to low human capital acquisition and poor labor market outcomes (Aarnoudse-Moens et al. 2009; Johnson and Schoeni 2011). This issue is particularly relevant and critical for the black population in the United States. In comparison to white children, black children are more likely to be born at low birth weights and to die before the age of one (Mathews and MacDorman 2011). However, these overall infant health trends mask several key within-group differences among blacks. This paper addresses two potentially important sources of heterogeneity among blacks: Hispanic ethnicity and immigrant status. An extensive body of research reports that Hispanic immigrant mothers, despite having socioeconomic profiles similar to those of non-Hispanic blacks and lower levels of adequate prenatal care, tend to have birth outcomes (e.g. low birth weight and infant mortality) that approximate those of non-Hispanic whites. This phenomenon is widely known as the Hispanic paradox (Hummer et al. 2007). While these infant health advantages appear to diminish with the duration of maternal residence and over successive generations (Acevedo-Garcia et al. 2007; Teitler et al. 2012), overall, Hispanic mothers, both native- and foreign-born, exhibit better birth outcomes compared to those of non-Hispanic blacks (Hummer et al. 2007). Public health researchers have hypothesized that these better-than-expected outcomes can be attributed to factors such as lower rates of prenatal smoking, better nutrition, family support and protective cultural characteristics (McGlade et al. 2004; Guendelman and Abrams 1995; Weigers and Sherraden 2001; Singh and Siahpush 2002). Sociologists and economists also point out that selection on health-related factors or other characteristics may also be important factors in driving immigrant health advantages (Palloni and Arias 2004; Antecol and Bedard 2006). These patterns do not necessarily hold across all groups. For example, Landale et al. (Landale et al. 2000) find that infant mortality among Puerto Rican migrants is substantially lower among recent migrants to the U.S. mainland compared to those women remaining in Puerto Rico. Despite evidence that the salience of the Hispanic paradox differs widely across Hispanic subgroups (Acevedo-Garcia et al. 2007; Landale et al. 2000), we know very little about the birth outcomes of self-identified black Hispanics. Racial identity is a complex entity among Hispanics, with many subgroups preferring to identify with their (ancestral) land of origin. While Hispanics are also far more likely to identify as white than black (Mason 1997), recent data indicate that black Hispanics, or Afro-Latinos are a small but growing part of the black and Hispanic populations. Self-identified black Hispanics (and those with darker skin and less European features) are more likely to experience worse educational, labor market and discrimination related outcomes compared to their non-black Hispanic counterparts (Mason 1997, 2004; Arce et al. 1987; Darity et al. 1996; Cotton 1993).Footnote 1 Empirical results from studies of health-related outcomes are mixed (Codina and Montalvo 1994; Montalvo and Codina 2001), but overall, Hispanic women (and men) are also less likely than non-Hispanics to carry health insurance, and the same is true for immigrants compared to the native-born (Derose et al. 2007). While each of these socioeconomic factors may indirectly contribute to worsened birth outcomes, few studies have explored how black Hispanics compare to their non-Hispanic black counterparts. Two important exceptions are Reichman and Kenney (1998) and Howard et al. (2006). In their descriptive study of Hispanic and non-Hispanic mothers in New Jersey, Reichman and Kenney (1998) find that black Hispanic mothers (e.g. Puerto Rican and other Hispanic) are less likely than non-Hispanic blacks to give birth to low birth weight infants. Immigrants, regardless of ethnicity, are less likely than the native-born to give birth to low birth weight infants, and have lower rates of infant mortality (Reichman and Kenney 1998). Howard et al. (2006) find substantial differences in low birth weight and preterm birth across black women of varying ethnic groups. While West Indian, Brazilian and Cuban blacks seem to have similar rates of low birth weight as U.S.-born blacks, black mothers from South and Central America and Africa are comparatively less likely to have a low birth weight infant. Similarly, blacks from South and Central America and Africa are less likely to give birth prematurely. In addition, work using data from New York City suggests that Hispanic groups with greater degrees of African ancestry are more likely to have small for gestational age (SGA) infants (Stein et al. 2009). However, the above studies are of limited generalizability due to limited geographic scope (Reichman and Kenney 1998; Stein et al. 2009; Howard et al. 2006). Furthermore, it is still unclear whether significant differences exist between non-Hispanic and Hispanic blacks across nativity, especially on a national level. Prior research finds that the birth outcomes of foreign-born blacks are superior to those of U.S. blacks, including low birth weight, preterm birth, and infant mortality (David and Collins 1997; Pallotto et al. 2000; Collins et al. 2002). Similar advantages exist among black immigrant adults for a number of health-related outcomes, including self-reported health (Hamilton and Hummer 2011) and disability (Elo et al. 2011). While better health behaviors and socioeconomic advantages may explain a small part of the infant health gap (Elo and Culhane 2010; Cabral et al. 1990; Kent 2007), many of the reasons for these health differences are still unclear. Moreover, while the infants born to black immigrants generally are healthier compared to those of U.S.-born blacks, black infants as a whole are still worse off than non-black infants with respect to rates of very low birth weight and infant mortality (Pallotto et al. 2000; Green et al. In press). Less clear is whether U.S.-and foreign-born Hispanic mothers experience similar patterns of infant health outcomes (Elo and Culhane 2010; Green et al. In press; Acevedo-Garcia et al. 2005a). To remedy these gaps in the literature, this paper addresses two key questions using a large national sample of black mothers. First, I examine whether black Hispanic immigrant mothers give birth to higher birth weight infants compared to U.S.-born black Hispanic mothers. I address a similar issue among non-Hispanic black mothers. Second, I examine whether there are Hispanic/non-Hispanic birth weight differences among both the native- and foreign-born. The latter question is important because it is likely that immigrants are positively selected on health, potentially making within-nativity comparisons a more appropriate test of an ethnic health advantage (Antecol and Bedard 2006). In supplementary analyses, I test for differences in prenatal care initiation and smoking between Hispanic/non-Hispanic immigrants and native-born mothers. To my knowledge, this is the first study to address these questions using a national sample of births. The remainder of this paper will proceed as follows. Section 2 provides a description of the data and estimation sample. Section 3 briefly describes the empirical approach and Section 4 contains a summary of the empirical results. The paper concludes in Section 5 with a discussion and future directions for this research agenda.",7

Andrews,Omari H. Swinton,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Education is a vehicle to opportunity. Better educated individuals have higher earnings (Card 1999), lower levels of unemployment, better health (Cutler and Lleras-Muney 2008), and higher levels of civic participation (Dee 2004). Given that education makes lives better, it is important that policies that purport to enhance educational outcomes are based on firm evidence. With regards to the education of blacks in the United States, two prevailing issues are performance and access. Blacks, on average, lag behind whites in academic performance along a number of dimensions-for example, high school graduation rates, standardized test scores, and college attendance. Access to selective postsecondary institutions for blacks is a controversial issue. The Theory of “Acting White”-which is best understood as a special case of the oppositional culture hypothesis (Fordham and Ogbu 1986)-has been offered as an explanation for the deficits in educational performance for blacks despite the lack of hard evidence in support of this hypothesis. Affirmative Action-which in the context of higher education allows race to be used as a factor in college admission-is a heavily debated policy that contends with race-neutral admission policies that are alleged to be as effective as policies that use race explicitly. Both “Acting White” and Affirmative Action are two politically charged topics that have been sources of misinformation and myths. The purpose of this article is to examine these topics in light of the information provided by extant scholarship. Fordham and Ogbu (1986) introduced the concept of the “Burden of ‘acting white’”, which is a special case of oppositional culture hypothesis. Oppositional culture hypothesis is a term used to explain racial disparities in educational achievement particularly in sociology. Some of the behaviors that are associated with “acting white” within this paper are speaking standard English, spending alot of time in the library studying, working hard to get good grades in school, being on time, and reading and writing poetry. The hypotheses about these behaviors and others described in the paper essentially state that blacks associate good academic performance with “acting white”, where “acting white” consists of blacks adopting behaviors that are associated with whites. The theory states that the fear of being accused of “acting white” engenders opposition to behaviors that are associated with “acting white”-for example, academic achievement- and thus leads to underachievement. Fordham and Ogbu use ethnographic techniques to investigate this hypothesis. The authors interview eight black students who discuss their experiences in school and also draw on Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s experiences as support for the hypothesis. Although this study was a weak foundation on which to build a strong argument, it has received a great deal of coverage in the press as an explanation for the black-white academic achievement gap. In his keynote address to the democratic convention in 2004, then Illinois State Senator, Barack Obama, described the phenomenon of “acting white” as a barrier to black educational progress. Despite poignant anecdotes and public proclamations, there is significant evidence that is inconsistent with the framework put forth by Fordham and Ogbu (1986). A number of ethnographic studies have examined the “acting white” hypothesis. Table 1 describes the sample of students who were interviewed in five such studies. Peterson-Lewis and Barton (2004) find that their subjects provide a positive description of “being black” with respect to fashion but articulate a negative association between “being black” and academics, behavior, disposition and impression. This lends some credence to the belief that doing well in school could be considered “acting white.” However, Bergin and Cooks (2002) find that interviewees do not shun superior academic performance for fear of being labeled as “acting white.” They also find that respondents do not perceive that they achieved superior academic performance at the expense of their ethnicity and are offended rather than demoralized by “accusations of ‘acting white.’ ” Tyson et al. (2005) find evidence consistent with the burden of “acting white” in only 2 of 40 black students that they interview. They find little evidence which suggests that the burden of ""acting white"" is the primary reason that blacks perform poorly in school. Diamond et al. (2007) find that relative to Caucasian students a larger fraction of African American students view their race as a determinant of their success. Interestingly, Diamond et al. (2007) also find that Caucasians are as likely as African Americans to be labeled negatively as a result of superior academic performance; that is, for their sample, superior academic performance adversely affects social standing and these effects are not limited to African Americans. Taken together, the above papers demonstrate that the qualitative evidence does not consistently support ""acting white” as an explanation for the achievement gap between blacks and whites. Few quantitative papers find evidence that consistently supports “acting white” as a plausible explanation for the black white achievement gap. The quantitative papers that examine “acting white” in large data sets propose a set of suppositions that should hold in the data if the “acting white” hypothesis is salient. Cook and Ludwig (1997) examine the implications of “acting white” using the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS 88). They put forth three testable hypotheses that should be borne out by the data if the differences in academic performance are indeed driven by “acting white”: (1) If acting white is salient, then blacks should show more antipathy towards school than non-Hispanic whites. (2) If acting white is salient, then blacks should incur social penalties from their peers for succeeding academically. (3) If these social penalties exist, then they should be greater for blacks than they are for whites. With regards to the first testable hypothesis, Cook and Ludwig (1997) find no evidence that is consistent with blacks having more antipathy than whites with respect to schooling. They also find that whites are more likely to have ten or more days absent from school than are blacks, that African American parents areas involved in children's educations as are white parents of similar means, and that black parents are more likely than white parents to check homework. These findings are inconsistent with the first hypothesis. The authors also find little evidence that supports the second testable hypothesis. In direct contradiction to what “acting white” would predict, the authors find that “black students at predominantly black schools are rewarded by their peers for membership in an honor society.” The authors find evidence that the penalty structure differs between blacks and whites; however, the penalty scores favor blacks which is inconsistent with the third testable hypothesis. While one cannot conclude from a single analysis on a nationally representative sample of eighth graders that “acting white” does not exist, we can say that with respect to this particular sample taken at this particular time there is little to suggest that “acting white” provides a plausible explanation for black-white differences in academic performance. Ainsworth-Darnell and Downey (1998), using the NELS 88 as a source of data, test four hypotheses that are consistent with the oppositional culture model, which includes “acting white”, being cause of the black-white gap in academic performance. In this paper, immigrant minorities are individuals who migrated to the host country of their own freewill and involuntary minorities are groups that were historically enslaved, colonized, or conquered. In their sample, Asian Americans are the immigrant minorities. Although their hypotheses discuss results in terms of comparing whites with immigrant (Asian Americans ) and involuntary minorities (blacks) ,for ease of comparison, the results will be explained in the context of black and white. The first hypothesis states that “involuntary minority students perceive fewer returns to education and more limited occupational opportunities than do dominant students or immigrant minority students.” They find no support for this hypothesis and find that “African American students are significantly more likely than white students to report that education is important to get a job and to have more optimistic occupational expectations.” The second hypothesis states the following: “involuntary minority students exhibit greater resistance to school than do dominant students or immigrant minority students.” The empirical evidence is mixed with respect to the second hypothesis. When the authors focus on skills, habits, and styles, their results are consistent with the oppositional culture model. However, when focusing on attitudes towards education, they find that African American and Asian students are more positive about school than white students. Their third hypothesis states the following: “high-achieving involuntary minority students are negatively sanctioned by their peers for their achievements.” The authors find that “African American students are especially popular when they are good students” and “African American students report more pro-school values among their peers than do white students.” This is inconsistent with the third hypothesis. The fourth hypothesis in Ainsworth-Darnell and Downey (1998) consists of the following supposition: “resistance to school” accounts for the racial gap in school performance between involuntary students and dominant students and immigrant minority students.”Footnote 1They find little to support this hypothesis and state that “it would be a mistake to conclude that racial differences in school performance are solely a result of variations in school behavior.” Given the scant support they find for efficacy of the oppositional culture model, the authors argue that people want to believe the theory and ignore the evidence to the contrary. If this is the case, then policy responses that are based on the oppositional culture model as a primary mechanism that produces disadvantage will likely fail because they direct resources to alter a set of behaviors that explain little of the gap. In contrast to the previous papers, Ferguson (2001) examines the differences in academic performance for a smaller sample. This dataset encompasses virtually all seventh through eleventh graders in Shaker Heights at the end of the spring semester in 1999. Shaker Heights is a relatively affluent community, so by looking within this, Ferguson is attempting to compare black and white students from similar socioeconomic backgrounds.Footnote 2 Having “accounted” for socioeconomic status, it is easier than to relate observed differences in academic performance between blacks and whites to causes that are not rooted in socioeconomic differences. Ferguson makes six main points, and while the explicit purpose of the paper is not to prove or disprove ""acting white"" per se, the results do speak to some of the premises of ""acting white."" The first finding is that skills much more than effort lead to the black-white GPA gap. The second finding is that “blacks report spending as much (or more) time doing homework, but a lower rate of homework completion.” Ferguson posits that this result not only makes it appear to teachers that blacks put forth less effort, but also shows that the peer culture of black students in Shaker Heights are not more opposed to achievement. The third result is that “attitudes and behaviors are more important for predicting within- race than between-race GPA disparities.”Footnote 3 The “acting white” hypothesis posits that attitudes and behaviors are sufficient to explain between-race differences which is not found in this research. The fourth result is that achievement gaps must be clearly thought out and divided into a. what the students know, b. the pace at which they learn, c. strategies and techniques to help them learn at an improved rate, d. effort the student chooses, and e. how everyone is different. Ferguson uses an analogy of two tribes running where there are no systematic differences in effort and ability between the two tribes. For the most part the White tribe is ahead of the Black tribe. Ferguson suggests that it a set of norms and investments that the White Tribe receives that result in the differences in academic performance. How can the Black Tribe catch up without “running faster”?, when there are no shortcuts. He suggests effective coaching and addressing social pressures that place more emphasis on activities-for example, watching television-that are important socially but use time that could put towards academics. The fifth result is that all segments of the school community report negative peer pressures. Black and white students who are not in honor or AP seem more inclined to hold back effort than those in honors or AP courses and black and white students in similar courses do differ in their propensity to hold back. The sixth result is that honors and AP courses maybe socially isolating for black students, which may diminish the degree to which black students aspire to take such classes. Ferguson states that the “black-white GPA gap in Shaker Heights seems to be attributable to a gap in skills rather than a gap in effort.” He provides additional evidence that African American students do not appear to be more opposed to schooling than whites from similar backgrounds. Ferguson suggests that policy should focus on providing “more effective and efficient learning techniques and strategies, so that the pace of new learning can accelerate as the level of effort increases.” Harris (2006) provides an extensive empirical test of the oppositional culture theory using the Maryland Adolescence Development in Context Study (MADICS). Like Ainsworth-Darnell and Downey (1998), Harris tests five hypotheses that are consistent with the oppositional culture model. The first hypothesis is the following: “Black children perceive fewer returns to education and more limited opportunities for upward social education and more limited opportunities for upward social mobility than white children.” He finds that “black students report greater returns to education and have higher educational aspirations than whites” which goes against the hypothesis. “Black children have less favorable affect toward school than whites.” He finds that “both groups experience similar rates of decline over time in school affect and feeling that class enjoyment is important for their school attendance.” These findings suggest that attitude is not the driving force behind white-black achievement differences. “Black children exhibit greater resistance to school than whites.”He finds that blacks “seek help more and spend the same amount of time on homework and educational activities than whites.” He also finds that blacks do not skip school more, but are in trouble more in school. “High achieving black children are negatively sanctioned by their peers to a greater degree than high achieving white children: the “ ‘acting white' hypothesis” His findings suggest “the fear of appearing white for performing well in school is not the reason for difference in school performance between” poor and good performing blacks. He also finds that “students’ level of school performance is not related to their ability to make friends.” “The peer groups of black children have a greater counter-educational culture than those of white children.” He finds that “black students do not have peers that engage in negative behaviors more than whites after controlling for differences in SES.” Harris’s evidence is somewhat generalizable as his results are similar to those of Cook and Ludwig (1997), Ainsworth-Darnell and Downey (1998), and Ferguson (2001) He concludes that “black youths want to learn; they simply are not acquiring skills necessary for academic success.” Fryer and Torelli (2010) use the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) which allows for a different measure of social status in a nationally representative sample. Social status is constructed using an index of friendship measures within the sample. The empirical analysis in the paper tests the prediction of a formal game theoretic model of “acting white” that couches the problem as a “two-audience signaling problem”. (See Fryer Jr et al. (2005)) The predictions from the game theoretic model differ from the notion of “acting white” that was put forth by Fordham and Ogbu. For example, the game theoretic model predicts that it is schools where minorities constitute a small percentage of the student body that are the types of schools where one will observe behavior consistent with “acting white” while Ogbu and Fordham argue (2) that their conceptualization of “acting white” as being applicable in schools where blacks are prevalent. In contrast to the aforementioned studies, Fryer and Torelli (2010) analyze Add Health and uncover three findings that are consistent with their notion of “acting white”: (1) The authors find a substantively large and statistically significant, relationship between popularity and grades that is robust to different empirical specifications and exists in various subsets of the data. For example, Fryer and Torelli point out that their notion of “acting white” is particularly salient for high achieving black students. (2) Fryer and Torelli find that the effects of “acting white”-that is, the relationship between popularity and grades-in schools where blacks are less than a fifth of the population is three times as large as the estimate that is obtained for the overall sample. (3) Fryer and Torelli find that eliminating the relationship between popularity and academic performance would yield significant reductions in the black-white test score gap, black-white effort gap, and the gap in the amount of time spent on homework. Fryer and Torelli perform a similar analysis using NELS 88, and find evidence consistent with the game theoretic notion of “acting white”. They conclude by acknowledging that “like Ferguson (2001) Cook and Ludwig (1997), and Ainsworth-Darnell and Downey (1998),” they find “scant empirical support for the oppositional culture hypothesis described in Fordham and Ogbu (1986).” One reason that the ""acting white"" hypothesis continues to exist is that the previous results found tend to have some limitations. Cook and Ludwig (1997), Ainsworth-Darnell and Downey (1998) are both reliant on the use of self-reported data from NELS. This raises the possibility that differences in the accuracy of the information provided by black and white youths could bias the results. In their response to survey questions, black youths could be portraying themselves as being more academically committed than they actually are. Ferguson and Ronald (2001) and Harris (2006) both focus on relatively local datasets. Ferguson focuses on one school in Shaker Heights, Ohio, while Harris focuses on MADICS dataset which collects information on a sample of Maryland adolescents. In both cases it is hard to make generalizations to the larger population because of sample size issues. A limitation of Fryer and Torelli (2010) is the narrow definition of “acting white” that is academic achievement. The paper focuses solely on social status and academic achievement and implicitly assumes that high grades cause low popularity and not the inverse. In aggregate, the quantitative work that examines this topic-in particular, the work that uses large nationally representative data sets-provide little support for the conventional notion of “acting white” as a primary determinant of black-white achievement gaps. After viewing the evidence that is provided both for and against the hypothesis of the burden of “acting white” as a cause of the black-white achievement gap, we draw three main conclusions. First, the burden of being a high achiever is not something that is unique to blacks. Most studies find that whites struggle with this as well and do not support the notion that blacks are more antagonistic towards black high achievers than whites are with respect to white high achievers. Therefore it cannot be a primary cause of inter-racial gaps. Secondly, the majority of studies indicate that, on average, blacks put forth more effort and care about their performance than whites.Footnote 4 Finally, if the burden of “acting white” does occur, it occurs mainly at schools that are not predominantly black. Where does this evidence leave us? It leaves us with mixed findings in qualitative studies and scant support in the empirical studies. Again, there is little evidence that supports “acting white” as a reasonable explanation for the gaps in academic achievement; that is, the empirical evidence, on the main, does not support the notion that blacks’ attitudes towards education are a major contributor to black-white gaps in educational performance. However, there is evidence that suggests that teacher’s perceptions of minority students and their attitudes towards education impacts minority educational outcomes, primarily through teacher expectations. Ferguson (1998) finds that teachers’ expectations, perceptions, and behaviors maintain and exacerbate the racial achievement gap. Berry and III (2004) finds that the performance of African American males in math is particularly sensitive to teachers 'expectations. McKown and Weinstein (2008) find that teachers’ expectations of European American and Asian American students were between .75 and 1.00 standard deviations higher than were expectations for African American students. They estimate that the difference in expectations account for up to.36 standard deviations of the year end achievement gap. Preexisting negative stereotypes of minority intellectual ability-see, for example, Bobo (2001)-make it far too easy for teachers to fail to provide the supportive environment and appropriate standards that are necessary to encourage learning. Proposals that are currently being put forth to institute culturally sensitive teacher training can affect how teachers both perceive and interact with minority youth. Changes in teacher attitudes, along with a focus on adequate resources are likely to do more to increase academic performance than a reliance on strategies that change student attitudes to combat the “acting white” phenomenon that is not a strong explanation for performance gaps.",5

Kopkin,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Historically, college football has been characterized by an absence of black leadership at the head coaching position. In 2002, there were only four black head coaches at National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) schools, and as recently as 2008, there were just five, while around 50 % of FBS football student-athletes in each year were black (Miller 2012). In fact, in the 30 year period from 1982 to 2012, there were 546 head coaches hired in the NCAA’s Football Bowl Subdivision, but through the 2012 season only 41 black head coaches have been hired at FBS schools (Hightower 2012).Footnote 1 In 2012, while 51.6 % of FBS football student-athletes were black, there were only 15 black head coaches at the 120 FBS schools (Lapchick et al. 2013). While the majority of FBS football student-athletes are black, the vast majority of the head coaching jobs at FBS schools belong to white coaches. There are a number of reasons why so few blacks are hired to the most prominent leadership positions in college football: (1) there are very few minority athletic directors or school presidents, who are responsible for hiring head coaches, (2) there are very few minority head coaching candidates in the pipeline, and (3) there may be discrimination against black head coaching candidates.Footnote 2 However, there may also be a limited number of black head coaches at FBS schools because black head coaches are more likely to be fired, as I show in this paper. In what follows, I will provide a more in-depth discussion of the reasons why there is a disproportionally low number of black head football coaches at FBS schools. First, black candidates for head coaching positions may belong to different social networks than those making hiring decisions since there are a limited number of black athletic directors, who generally hire their school’s head football coach, and even fewer black school presidents, who generally hire the institution’s athletic director. Of the 120 institutions in the FBS, only nine of the athletic directors and five of the school presidents were African-American (Lapchick et al. 2013). Furthermore, all conference commissioners of FBS conferences were white (Lapchick et al. 2013). McDonald et al. (2009) show that differences in social network resources between whites and minorities can explain a substantial portion of the racial deficit in the number of job leads at the highest levels of supervisory authority, such as a head coaching position. According to Henry Frazier III, head football coach at Prairie View A&M, a Football Championship Subdivision school, “it has everything to do with relationships…you’re looking at presidents and athletic directors. If they don’t have relationships with minority candidates, then it’s going to be hard for them to hire them. I don’t think they just actually go out here and say, ‘I’m going to hire a white guy.’ They’re going to hire somebody that they have a relationship with to manage that organization (Turner 2009).” Additionally, there are very few black head coaching candidates at the coordinator level in the Football Bowl Subdivision. Overall, blacks held only 25.5 % of all assistant coaching positions in Division I football in 2012, but only 16.7 % of the offensive and defensive coordinator spots in the FBS were held by blacks (Lapchick et al. 2013, 2012).Footnote 3 Bozeman and Fay (2013) study the career trajectories of assistant coaches, and find that assistant coaches at certain positions are more likely to be elevated to offensive and defensive coordinators, who are then in turn more likely to be elevated to head coach. The catch-22 for blacks is that most coaches are hired to coach the position that they played at, and blacks have historically played at positions requiring a high amount of raw athletic ability, such as running back or wide receiver, than at positions requiring learned craft skills or strategy, such as quarterback, offensive line, or linebacker (Bozeman and Fay 2013).Footnote 4 In this vein, Bozeman and Fay show that among the 120 FBS head coaches, 27.3 % played quarterback, 11.8 % played offensive line, and 12.6 % played linebacker in college. Only 8.4 % and 1.7 % of current head coaches played wide receiver or running back, respectively. However, it is also possible that the correlation between coaching and position played is due to preferences for white coaches as discrimination against blacks could result in differences in position played among head coaches rather than be the reason why there are fewer black head coaches. Another potential reason for the limited number of minority hires in the head coaching ranks is that minorities are simply discriminated against. Sagas and Cunningham (2005) find that fewer promotions and further organizational proximity to the head coaching position among black assistant football coaches cannot be explained by racial differences in human or social capital.Footnote 5 Additionally, Cunningham et al. (2006) find that NCAA assistant football coaches are much more likely to view race as a barrier to getting a head coaching job than NCAA assistant basketball coaches. This may potentially be because blacks make up a much larger share of the television audience for basketball as compared to football, which athletic directors are accounting for either strategically or subconsciously. According to ESPN columnist Jemele Hill, “these athletic directors are, quite honestly, frightful that their donors and their communities won’t continue to support their schools financially if they hire a black coach” and are “using their economic situation as an excuse to continue…racist practices.” Furthermore, very few black head coaches receive a second chance. While there are currently 17 white FBS coaches that previously lost their jobs, it is well noted that Tyrone Willingham is the only black coach in NCAA history to be rehired by an FBS program after having been fired (Dillard 2013; Hightower 2012).Footnote 6 Upon his own dismissal from the University of Colorado, former head coach Jon Embree stated “We don’t get second chances. And that’s okay, you know it going into it…every minority coach knows that going into it (Hightower 2012).” It is irrefutable that the hiring rate of black head coaches in major college football is not representative of the number of student-athletes that are black. However, the main focus of this paper is that minority head coaches may be treated unfairly when athletic directors and school officials decide whether to retain or fire their institution’s current head coach. For example, Tyrone Willingham was fired from Notre Dame in 2004 with a 21–15 record after 3 years (Dillard 2013). His predecessor, Charlie Weis, produced a nearly identical 22–15 record after three seasons at Notre Dame, yet kept his job for two additional mediocre seasons. This phenomenon is not rare. In fact, the average tenure of the last eight black head coaches fired was less than three full seasons, while the average tenure of the 51 nonblack coaches released for performance reasons since the end of the 2009 season was over 5 years long (Dillard 2013).Footnote 7 As expressed by Embree, who was fired after only two seasons as head coach at Colorado, most black coaches “get bad jobs and no time to fix it (Henderson 2012).” This is an especially serious problem when compounded with the fact that almost all previously fired black coaches will not receive a second chance as a head coach. In this paper, I use a rich dataset of FBS football coaches from 1990 to 2012, which contains season- and tenure-specific performance characteristics, data describing the historical expectations of each school, and additional information about each coach, including each coach’s race and whether he was fired or retained at the end of each season.Footnote 8 Using this information, I estimate a discrete-time hazard model of the probability that an FBS head coach is fired, allowing the hazard rate of black head coaches to differ from that of white head coaches. In my full specification, I find that black head coaches are 5.28 percentage points more likely to be fired than white head coaches; this estimate is statistically significant at the 5 % level, and is robust to various modeling choices made by the researcher. Since the overall firing rate of white head coaches is 10.25 %, this represents a 52 % increase in the probability that a black coach is fired. Additionally, I find that black head coaches are more likely to be fired in the initial 3 years of tenure, and again in their seventh and eighth years, but that the difference in the probability of release between black and white head coaches in the fourth, fifth, and sixth years of tenure is small and statistically insignificant.",2

Do Academics Matter More?,December 2014,Catherine Weinberger,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The analysis is based on data from four longitudinal studies of high school students. The earliest is Project Talent, a study that included 5 % of all students enrolled in U.S. high schools in 1960. The others are the more familiar NCES studies: The National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972, the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (1992 seniors), and the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (2004 seniors). All four surveys include questions about extracurricular participation and leadership roles. The statistical analysis is weighted to reflect a representative sample of U.S. high school seniors. Although each survey asks a slightly different set of questions about extracurricular participation, three of the surveys contain a subset of questions fully comparable across cohorts. Much of the analysis is limited to the five kinds of activities covered by these comparable questions: Clubs (vocational, hobby or academic), student government, student publications, performing arts, and sports.Footnote 2 The Project Talent leadership and participation questions have an entirely different structure, and are not directly comparable. However, this cohort is included in the paper because it provides historical perspective and large sample sizes. Another advantage of the 1960 Project Talent study is that it includes a personality assessment administered during high school, including a leadership scale.Footnote 3
 In longitudinal surveys, coding of race presents some challenges in cases where there are conflicting self-reports in different waves of the survey. There are two possible reasons for conflicting reports; one is that an individual self-identifies with more than one racial category (either holding multiple identities at any given point in time or undergoing change in self-identity between survey waves), the second reason is that there is miscoding of some respondents’ answers. In the case of completely random miscoding, there is likely to be a negligible number of minority group members miscoded into the larger majority group, but a relatively large number of majority group members miscoded (due to the large size of the majority group). To alleviate this final concern, individuals are included in the white category if they are ever coded as white in any survey wave. For this study, those included in the black category self-identified as black in at least one survey wave and never self-identified as white. This conservative categorization might exclude some black respondents, but avoids mistakenly including individuals who were miscoded as black in a single survey wave. In the historical 1960 Project Talent survey, the first national survey of U.S. high school students, the base year data collection effort did not include information about the race of each student. While follow-up surveys did collect this information, the sample sizes are far smaller in these follow-up surveys. Complete individual-level race data are available for a small subsample of students. Within this group with individual race self-identified, 69 % of black students were drawn from high schools that reported at least 70 % black enrollment, while only 22 % came from high schools that reported less than 30 % black enrollment (see Appendix 1, Column 3). Among students drawn from schools that reported at least 70 % black enrollment, 97 % of those with known race are black. This evidence suggests that the vast majority of students in segregated schools are black, even when we cannot directly observe the race of individual students. Therefore, rather than compare black students to white students, the primary analysis of Project Talent data compares the much larger sample of students enrolled in segregated black schools to all U.S. students in 1960. Analysis of black individuals in the small subsample followed over time offers supplemental information, and the ability to observe some black students enrolled in predominantly white schools. The 1960 estimates are not informative about long-term trends because the questions asked in the 1960 survey refer to the past 3 years, while the other surveys inquire only about the senior year of high school. However, the Project Talent data provide a remarkable opportunity to understand something new about our history.",2
41.0,4.0,The Review of Black Political Economy,07 September 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12114-014-9199-5,The Glass Ceiling and Relative Arrest Rates of Blacks Compared to Whites,December 2014,Linda A. Bailey,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Employers form beliefs about the reliability of prospective hires based on past experience with employees, especially with regard to the stereotypical views they have of workers along race and gender lines.Footnote 1 Of particular concern is the perception of employers on the returns to transactions with blacks relative to whites. Lundberg and Startz (2002) use a statistical discrimination modelFootnote 2 to predict how uncertainty about the returns to transactions can lead to and perpetuate discrimination against minorities. In particular, minority status signals greater uncertainty of the return even if the average return is the same for minorities and non-minorities. Their model postulates that black stereotypes may lead to lower weighting of individual productivity indicators such as education or experience. Further, Pager and Karafin (2009) use a small number of in-depth interviews to assess general perceptions about black job applicants and the extent to which employers update their stereotypes based on experience. They find that employers do not use their positive experiences with minorities to re-evaluate the black males who apply for jobs as a group. In fact negative interactions with some blacks (reported by some employers) appeared quite memorable and may have larger than warranted weight. Similarly, the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality (MCSUI) finds negative perceptions among employers of black males hired for low-skilled jobs (Moss and Tilly 2001). Punctuality is often cited as a soft skill that is deemed important to employers (Barton 1986; Heath and Mills 2000; Hall and Berardino 2006). This paper presents a model of absenteeism (including punctuality or lack thereof) caused by disparities in criminal justice outcomes which, while exogenous to the individual, would lead to negative perceptions of black workers compared to other races. Absenteeism and arrests are directly related. Being stopped by the police may delay an employee or interviewee sufficiently to affect punctuality, even if it does not result in an arrest. If employers have experienced higher absenteeism among blacks than whites, they may believe that black candidates will be more likely to miss work or be late when compared to whites.Footnote 3 If this is the case, blacks may be less likely than whites to be placed in supervisory roles because the cost of absenteeism is higher in those jobs. As such, this paper theoretically explores absenteeism driven by arrests as a causal mechanism for differences in occupational placement for blacks compared to whites. While previous work has examined the effect of arrest rates on various labor market outcomes, the use of relative arrest as a causal mechanism for differences in relative labor market outcomes is more novel. Western and Pettit (2005), Alexander (2010), and Neal and Rick (2014) describe the impact of relatively higher incarceration of black males as biasing the standard labor market measures of inequality—given that only non-incarcerated black males appear in standard labor market surveys—to give the appearance that the relative status of blacks has improved. The literature on black-white gaps (Heckman et al. 2000; Mason 2000; Neumark 1999) has not focused on occupational segregation. One exception is Hamilton et al. (2011), who find that black men are overrepresented in low paying jobs and underrepresented in high paying jobs. Additional motivation for the study of occupational segregation is provided by Stoll et al. (2004) and Giuliano et al. (2009, 2011), who suggest that assignment of blacks into lower occupation groups may reverberate in the form of lowering hiring rates, retention and promotion of black males. This paper contributes to this understudied area. This work takes the approach of Holzer et al. (2006), who suggest that negative stereotypes of blacks as criminals might be responsible for relatively less hiring of blacks by small firms when compared to large firms. Similar to their work, this study focuses on the effect of a factor that is exogenous to the individual—relative arrest rates of blacks to whites in a city. The relationship between the relatively worse arrest rates for blacks compared to whites and relatively worse labor market outcomes is examined. Though the model cannot be tested directly, weak evidence is found consistent with the model’s prediction that black occupational placement relative to whites will be negatively affected by higher relative arrest rates for blacks compared to whites. Support is also found for another proposed channel in that relative arrest rates are found to be negatively correlated with relative hourly wages in some specifications.",1

Human Capital Accumulation within Mixed Families,June 2015,Marcos A. Rangel,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"A number of studies detect significant association between individual characteristics used to infer ethnic ancestry and various measures of socioeconomic success.Footnote 1 In the United States, Brazil and South Africa, for example, the intense trade of African slaves by English and Portuguese colonizers, and the Dutch displacement of indigenous populations made the color of one’s skin an indicator of European ancestry and play a key role in social stratification.Footnote 2 This historically-rooted stratification remains stark in those three countries, particularly in the case of labor markets, despite the sharp differences in patterns of economic development, institutional arrangements regarding racial segregation, and observed rates of miscegenation.Footnote 3
 There are a number of factors that could explain skin-color differentials in the labor market context. It is possible that dark-skinned individuals receive lower wages, are less likely to be employed, or have limited access to certain jobs due to discrimination by (potential) employers. Alternatively, observed differences may be the result of darker-skin individuals’ relatively lower investment in the accumulation of skills, which translates into a scarcity of economic opportunities. These are most likely simultaneously at work. With skills not being fairly rewarded, members of the group discriminated against have less incentives to invest in them.Footnote 4
 The present article focuses on the possibility that (perceived) discriminatory labor market structures influences differential investments in human capital by parents of children with differing complexion. The idea is to illustrate how optimizing mixed-race families may contribute to inequalities and to a self-sustaining stratified equilibrium − even when parents themselves do not attribute different “preferential weights” to kids of distinct skin tones. Therefore, mixed-race families’ decisions simulate an interesting laboratory for examination of the persistence of skin-color-based differences in labor market outcomes.Footnote 5 I explore this insight on the analysis that follows. In general, empirical applications targeted at identifying the forces behind minority parents’ underinvestment in human capital are plagued by the fact that predictions derived from different hypotheses are, observationally equivalent. Take the case of borrowing constraints, for example. Minority parents may face borrowing constraints that limit their ability to invest in their children. Current racial differentials on income from labor are then transmitted across generations via under-accumulation of skills. Notice, however, that the same implications can be derived from models in which, instead of borrowing constraints, the focus is on parental expectations of employers’ discriminatory behavior, or even genetic transmission of tastes and ability. This is the case because in such models wage determination is related to ancestry, with family connections unambiguously determining membership in different ethnic groups. Hence, any empirical examination of differences in human capital investment across families is bound to capture the role of all family-level characteristics, be they observed or not. In a contest of significant miscegenation in marriage markets, however, connections between ancestry and appearance are less straightforward − family backgrounds (genetic, social, or financial) are shared by siblings of different appearance. In essence, the present paper is based on the examination of how mixed-race families, through parenting practices and decisions, mediate the impact of society-wide skin color differentiation over their children. The analysis considers (without identifying) different conceptual ways by which welfare optimizing parents may generate systematic differences in the patterns of investment depending on skin color:Footnote 6 i) they may respond to differences in expected returns to human capital investments; ii) they may respond to differences in the costs of those investments (including opportunity or psychological costs); iii) they may simply prefer one skin color over another (evaluate identical outcomes differently). The interesting questions here are: Do parents operate so as to maximize or minimize the effects of genetic endowment of “whiteness” on earnings? Do parents compensate darker-skinned kids for the steeper social ladder they are likely to face, as it seems to be the case in the careful analysis of Goldsmith et al. (2006) and discussions in Mason (1997) and Mangino (2010)? This discussion clearly resonates with the ongoing debate within the United States and the United Kingdom regarding the future of racial and ethnic stratification (Hunter 2013). How are multiracials going to fit into the system of racial stratification (see Mason, 1997)? Is the growth in the number of multiracials triggering a stratification system that resembles the Latin American three-tiered system based on skin color (with the addition of a honorary white group), or would they be incorporated on the binary system that prevails today?Footnote 7 Motivated by this Latin Americanization discussion, I focus my analysis on data from Brazil containing specific information on skin-tonalities within and across families.Footnote 8 These are unique features of the Brazilian racial classification system and data collection that, combined with random aspects of the genetics of skin color, can be used to shed light on the inner workings of skin color differentiation at the family level. Moreover, Brazil is an interesting case on its own. Even though the high rate of interracial marriages and the consequent high proportion of mixed-race individuals in the population (mulatoes or browns) are frequently cited indicators of racial tolerance, there is evidence that they coexist with pertinent differences between whites and non-whites in terms of wages and other measures of living standards (see Arias et al 2004; Campante et al 2004; and Telles 2005). These findings have put racial inequality on the forefront of the Brazilian policy agenda. In fact, a recent Human Development Report(United Nations, 2005) states that skin-color differences in economic achievement is one of the main social challenges facing Brazil, suggesting that anti-discrimination policies should be a central component of any poverty reduction program implemented in that country. As with many governmental interventions, the effectiveness of these redistribution policies will ultimately depend on the variation of individual characteristics within and between families, and on intrafamilial rules regarding the allocation of resources (which may either reinforce or attenuate their impact).Footnote 9 This is particularly relevant when mixed-race families represent a large fraction of the population, since they introduce intra-family variation in skin tones into the stratification picture.Footnote 10
 Using data from the Brazilian 1991 Census of Population, I find that light-skinned children (ages 5 to 14) are 0.6 percentage points more likely to be enrolled in school or pre-school during a particular year than their siblings of darker skin tones. A dark-skinned five-year old child is approximately 2% less likely to the enrolled in school or pre-school than his/her lighter-skinned sibling, for example. These figures amount to 49.3% of the raw difference between white and non-white children in mixed-color sibships. Back of the envelope calculations also suggest that the compound effect of this difference would be that, at age fifteen, a child of light skin tone is approximately 6.5% more likely to have completed primary school than his/her darker-skinned sibling (assuming no differential grade retention and time-independent enrollment probabilities). This long term effect in the accumulation of human capital is confirmed by examination of attainment among co-residing older siblings (ages 17 to 25). These data reveal that dark-skinned young adults are 5.7% less likely to have concluded primary school than their light-skinned siblings. These effects are particularly strong for boys, following patterns of observed returns to schooling. I am not able, however, to consider wider implications of the impact of such investments over the marriage market prospects of women of different complexion, an obvisouly relevant element of socio-economic mobility (See Hamilton et al 2009 for a detailed discussion). In any case, these results are incompatible with parents seeking to compensate darker-skinned children by investing more in their formal education. Using an alternative (but much smaller) data set, from the 1989 Brazilian Survey of Nutrition and Health, I also find evidence that, conditional on enrollment, light-skinned children are more likely to attend private schools (within the family). On the other hand, there is no evidence of differences in nutrition and health outcomes. These results point to the importance of family economics for the understanding of racial and skin color differences and social stratification in general. The remainder of the paper is organized into three sections. In Section 2, I discuss the genetics of skin color and describe the data set. Section 3 presents the econometric evidence and assesses the robustness of the findings. Section 4 concludes and discusses extensions left for future research.",20

Diette,Arthur H. Goldsmith,William Darity Jr.,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Stratification Economics is an emerging paradigm in the discipline that accounts for structural and intentional processes capable of generating and maintaining group differences in life outcomes.Footnote 1 It asserts that social phenomena such as group identity, which influence how members of a group are treated and respond to life course developments, must be considered to obtain a full understanding of difference in life outcomes both across and within groups. However, most work in this sub-field focuses on the integration of the notion of behavior guided by self-interest from economics with insights about actions from sociology and psychology to explain differences in outcomes between groups. An example is the work by Hamilton and Darity (2010) to explain the existence, and persistence, of the large racial gap in wealth. An exception is the application of the concept of colorism to explain differences in life outcomes within racial or ethnic groups. Colorism is the allocation of privilege and disadvantage according to the lightness or darkness of one’s skin, with favoritism typically granted to those with lighter skin.Footnote 2 Thus, this construct posits that pooling all blacks together may mask intra-racial and inter-racial differences in outcomes associated with complexion. Goldsmith et al. (2007) advance an explanation of why blacks with lighter skin are likely to receive preferential treatment compared to their darker skinned peers, which they describe as a preference for whiteness, grounded in theories from social psychology and anthropology. In more recent work, Hamilton et al. (2011) extend the notion of colorism to account for other phenotypical characteristics aside from skin shade, including hair color/texture and eye color. They assert that those whose constellation of features most resembles a northern European “ideal” generally receive more favorable treatment in comparison to those with a more Afrocentric phenotype.,Footnote 3
Footnote 4
 In general, given the degree of heterogeneity that commonly occurs within a group, and that groups are oftentimes defined based on at least somewhat ambiguous social classification, individuals may be arrayed along a continuum between in and out-group status, which is governed at least partially based on individual proximity to in and/or out-group characteristics. Specifically, black females vary with regards to skin complexion, and the preference for whiteness theory asserts that the dichotomous classification of black/white masks the within group heterogeneity of black women where lighter complexioned black women might receive better social treatment as a result of their closer proximity to the more socially privileged white “in-group.” This fits neatly into the framework of Stratification Economics which incorporates and extends insights from Blumer (1958) and Forbes (1997) regarding the use of social identity theory and relative group positioning theory to explain how intergroup and intragroup rivalry lead to behaviors aimed at solidifying and perpetuating material and social advantages. The underlying mechanism behind colorism is a desire for the white “in-group” to maintain privilege or advantage with recognition that social identity is more continuous rather than a simple and discrete binary description. The purpose of this paper is to use insights from colorism, and hence stratification economics, to evaluate if emotional damage associated with unemployment is greater for darker complexion black women.",18

Modeste,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"About twenty years after gaining its independence in 1966, Guyana was in the midst of a severe recession with per capita output falling by about 16 % between 1975 and 1988. To improve conditions in the economy, the Guyanese authorities with assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank (WB), and other multilateral institutions adopted in 1988 an Economic Recovery Program. Under this program, trade liberalization was a major plank in the government’s effort to revitalize the economy. As explained by Krueger (1997, 1998) and others, trade liberalization represents a strategy for growing the economies of developing countries that is different from import substitution. For, unlike the latter strategy, trade liberalization requires the reduction or elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers in order to create a more open economy which is expected to result ultimately in more economic growth. Unfortunately, empirical tests of the relationship between trade liberalization and economic growth have produced results that are mixed. In fact, there are studies that have found a positive relationship between trade liberalization and economic growth. At the same time, there are other studies that have found either no relationship, or a negative relationship between these two variables. These inconclusive results suggest that more empirical studies on the topic of trade liberalization and economic growth are still warranted. Moreover, in keeping with the view that there is a need for more country specific evidence on the output effects of trade liberalization, an investigation into the growth effects of trade liberalization in Guyana, using the advanced econometric tools for analyzing time series data, would be highly instructive. With that said, the purpose of this paper is to investigate with annual data for the period 1975 to 2012 the impact of trade liberalization on the economic performance of Guyana. This study will control for other factors that could influence output per worker like, investment per worker, human capital per worker and exports. This study on the effect of trade liberalization on economic performance in Guyana makes at least three important contributions to the literature. First, it makes a contribution by providing country specific evidenceFootnote 1 on the relationship between trade liberalization and economic growth for a CARICOMFootnote 2 member country. This information could be very useful to policy makers in Guyana and other CARICOM member countries as they formulate macroeconomic policies to grow their economies. Second, it makes a contribution by providing results that would complement those from other CARICOM member countries that have looked at the effects of trade liberalization on some given sector of the macroeconomy.Footnote 3 Third, it makes a contribution by investigating the long-run and short-run interrelationships among the variables in the model. To support the estimation of these relationships unit root tests and the Johansen cointegration test are performed on the relevant variables. The method of dynamic ordinary least squares and a general error correction model are used to estimate the long-run and short-run effects of trade liberalization on economic growth in Guyana. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, a brief literature review on trade liberalization and economic growth is undertaken. After that, in section 3, the trade liberalization experience of Guyana is described. Section 4, then presents the model that supports the study. The results from estimating the model using dynamic ordinary least squares are reported and discussed in section 5. The results from the unit root tests and the co-integration tests are also presented in this section of the paper. Section 6 of the paper presents a summary of the study with associated policy implications.",1

Historically, research suggests that these banks have lower measured efficiency (e.g., Iqbal et al. 1999) and, more recently, the banks were found to pay rates on certificates of deposits that were above those of comparable banks Kashian et al. 2014b. The analysis here extends that line of research by asking whether BOBs and HOBs charge distinct fees for ATM usage. Three fees are considered: foreign fees charged for use of a non-bank ATM by the bank’s customers, surcharges for use of bank ATMs by non-customers, and balance inquiry charges for the bank’s own customers. To develop hypotheses regarding ATM fees, we follow tradition and focus on the role of bank size and market competition. To facilitate comparison with earlier findings, the size and competition variables are comparable to those found in Hannan’s (2006) analysis of two of the fees analyzed here. Less traditionally, we additionally focus on the roles of customer incomes levels, race and ethnicity, and the possibility that banks can exploit low income depositors because those customers tend to be myopic (e.g., Campbell et al. 2010). The roles of race/ethnicity and depositor income levels are particularly salient to the present analysis because BOBs and HOBs may be closely tied to economically disadvantaged communities of color Kashian et al. 2014a. The analysis uses information on ATM fees from a sample of banks and branch offices, provided by RateWatch, covering approximately 1500 distinct banks for 2013. The data include information on 21 BOBs and 19 HOBs, and are matched with bank financial information from call reports collated by SNL, FDIC summary of deposits (SOD) data, and demographic data from the Census Bureau’s 2008–2012 American Community Survey (ACS).",

Jerome Utley Jr.,William Darity Jr.,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Marriage, in the historical heteronormative sense, provides both men and women with a measure of social capital. Nevertheless, due the institution’s patriarchal history it is imperative for women, more than men, to first conform to the normalized idea of beauty to individually amass the necessary amount of social capital to be considered marriageable. Women’s often- abased social and economic status force them to follow a strict gender script in order to reflect society’s, or their specific culture’s, interpretation of femininity and beauty. Globally femininity and beauty are correlated with light skin; similarly, India’s complex relationship with colorism means that within the country beauty is synonymous with light complexion. Debate persists about the origins of colorism in India. Some scholars suggest that it is a direct result of European imperialism; others argue that people around the world possess a natural affinity for light skin. However, based upon research it appears that colorism is a significant factor in the mate-seeking process. Colorism complicates both race and gender politics. Arguably, colorism would fail to exist without the presence of racism, which is a symptom of the construction of race. Therefore, colorism adds a color component to the social capital women might seek to possess in order to present themselves as marriageable. Hunter (2013) defines race capital as “the way light skin and Anglo bodies operate as a form of capital.” Just as racism birthed race capital, colorism spawned color capital, which is the privilege afforded to lighter complexioned individuals with Eurocentric physical features. Color capital greatly influences women’s overall social capital. Furthermore, internationally, wealth and status are associated with people of light complexion. Consequently, women who desire to marry men of considerable wealth and/or social status must typically possess or create a high degree of social capital of their own, in this case, color capital. Women who lack the color capital necessary to make them marriageable often use skin lighting products and other cosmetic procedures to borrow the desired color capital. This study extends the work of Hunter (2002) on the international skin-tone bias women face, and Jha and Adelman (2009) on how gendered ideology and colorism affect women during the mate-seeking process on matrimonial websites. The paper highlights the origins of colorism within India and specifically how this form of discrimination affects marriage choices and the institution of marriage. Furthermore, it analyzes the relationship between social capital and skin color for both men and women globally, with an acute focus on Indian women. Most importantly, the matrimonial database composed using 1 day’s worth of advertisements from New Delhi’s Sunday Times tests Ramasubramanian’s and Jain’s (2008) hypothesis which argues that, in regards to Indian matrimonial advertisements, women announce their skin complexion more than men make known their desire for light complexioned women and few if any advertisers describe themselves as dark complexioned.",10

Reece,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Eurocentric standards of beauty reign supreme in the United States (and indeed in the world), placing increased value on features typically associated with whiteness such as light skin and straight hair, which reinforces a system of racial stratification whereby white people are privileged at the expense of black people and other people of color. One latent consequence of this preference for whiteness is intra-racial stratification among black people that also relies on skin color, affording increased privileges to those deemed closer to phenotypic whiteness. This is important because being perceived as more attractive has significant social benefits including higher income (Frieze et al. 1991), higher chances of being hired for a job (Hosoda et al. 2003). Studies consistently show that black people with more of the aforementioned white-like features, particularly skin tone, are deemed more attractive by both blacks and whites and are subsequently afforded the benefits of being attractive. But a preference for white-like features may only be part of the story. Net of skin tone, the near-universal disdain for blackness may also result in people being perceived as more attractive because they do not appear to be “completely” black (to the extent that a person’s racial group can be completely endogamous) or simply because they do not identify as “completely” black. Miscegenation is an integral, if taboo, part of United States history, and even before legal bans on the practice were lifted, the children of interracial unions benefitted materially from their multiracial heritage, especially if they were phenotypically white (Krauthamer 2013). Despite the obvious presence of multiracial citizens in America, the year 2000 Census represented the first time since the “Mulatto” category was eliminated as an official racial designation in 1930 that the United States government recognized people of multiple races. Prior to 2000, respondents were forced to choose only one racial category. (Note that even self-identification was relatively recent on the Census. People were not allowed to select their own racial classification until 1960. Prior to that year, census takers were instructed as to how to classify people according to race.) The 2000 Census allowed people to select all categories that they felt applicable. This official acknowledgement and measurement of multiracial Americans by the US Census led to a boom in studies seeking to explore the role that the more than 6 million self-identified multiracial people play in a racial structure that continues to rely on discrete racial categories (e.g., Harris and Sim 2002; Lee et al. 2003). Many studies conclude that multiracial black people—that is people whose racial background is a combination of black and other racial categories—either choose to discard their multiracial identities for a single-raced black identity, and even when they acknowledge their multiracial heritage, usually they more strongly identify with their blackness (Khanna 2010). I seek to contribute to this literature by exploring whether black people who identify as multiracial are perceived as more attractive than black people who only identify as black.",23

Childers,Kevin Chiou,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The literature on socioeconomic status and health suggests that those in higher positions have better health, and those in lower positions have worse health. Further, not only do the individuals with the lowest socioeconomic status exhibit the worst health, but there is also a continual gradient, from the top to the bottom of the socio-economic ladder, relating status to health (Lynch and Kaplan 2000). Beginning with the Whitehall study in 1974, subsequent research has demonstrated this SES-health gradient in multiple environments (Smith et al. 1990). The SES-health gradient has not been shown to be generalizable across populations. There is little evidence of an SES gradient in non-industrialized countries, and it is uncertain whether the health gradient established in many Western countries would apply in developing countries. Furthermore, the gradient does not necessarily remain uniform across all diseases. Chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes tend to exhibit the standard SES gradient in developed countries (Kaplan and Keil 1993). Evidence suggests, however, that chronic diseases may be considered “diseases of affluence” in developing countries (Rahman and Singh 2011). India presents an interesting case to examine the relationship between SES and health. First, as India is a developing country, any socioeconomic differences in health may be exacerbated by limited resources in the country as a whole (Link and Phelan 1995). This may mean that the gap in health care access is wider. High SES individuals could have greater access while lower SES individuals have little to no access to healthcare. Second, India’s caste system is traditionally marked by limited economic and social mobility across castes. Although the situation has changed substantially over time, caste remains an important social identifier (Shah et al. 2006; Thorat 2010; Thorat and Neuman 2012). The Hindu caste system includes Brahmins, high caste Hindus, Other Backwards Castes (OBCs), and Dalits – a group that includes those once called “untouchables”. If the mechanism for the relationship between social position and health is access to material resources, then individuals may face prolonged advantage or disadvantage in a fixed social system (Power et al. 2007; Singh-Manoux et al. 2004). Third, while socioeconomic status is associated with health outcomes, research suggests that health also may be associated with religion (George et al. 2002; Koenig et al. 2012). India, as a country with a number of religious groups, can offer insights about the relationship between religion and health. While the majority of India’s population is Hindu, a significant number of Muslims, Sikhs, and Christians are also present. As such, it is possible to make relevant health-status comparisons among the groups. The current direction of research on SES and health is toward investigating patterns in various contexts. Previous research has focused on developed countries. This paper examines patterns in health outcomes by caste and religion in India, a developing country. Results from a nationally representative data set, the Indian Human Development Survey, suggest that while high SES social groups report less communicable disease, they do not have better health when examining chronic diseases. High SES groups report more hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes. This provides evidence for considering chronic diseases as “diseases of affluence” in India.",4

Coleman,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Most advanced societies agree that there is a certain level of social wellbeing below which not even the most undeserving individuals should be allowed to fall. The notion of government-supported well being is inseparable from ideas about democracy, equality, and social stability. Accordingly, nearly all of the nations of the West provide social services that are available to all, based either on need or worker and employer contributions. Political scientists have argued about how the provision of social services is related to democracy, political stability, and equality. Leibfried and Steffen (2008, xv) write, “Democracy and the welfare state seem to have an elective affinity for each other,” Yet they also note many examples of autocratic, racist, and fascist regimes that provide welfare. Hewitt (1977) found that, while democracy alone was not related to increased equality, use of the voting franchise in a democratic system to elect socialist governments was correlated with increased egalitarianism. In studying Germany, Jung and Uwe (2014, 69) found that, while democracy is not an automatic outcome of economic development, equitable income distribution is a key to the emergence of democracy. Furthermore, “democracy might fail if income discrepancies and redistributive tensions between the different social groups become too large. . . . Ongoing technical change and economic development that affects different groups of society in different ways, as well as increasing inequality and polarization may potentially lead to a breakdown of the democratic equilibrium and to the (re)emergence of an oligarchy or a mass dictatorship.” Economic inequality based on race diminishes the entire society and culture, if only because of the large number of minority citizens who are not being used most productively. This was true in 1969 and it seems to be just as true today (Thurow 1969). Locking people out of economic advancement means they can have no investment in their future. People without a future for themselves or their families have little reason to support the system. Thus, people outside the system are ripe for dissension and revolt. A large, potentially revolutionary mass in our midst is not good for a stable society. The prospects for genuine racial equality between America’s two largest racial groups, Blacks and Whites, are declining. There are many economic, political, and social reasons for this, but in this essay I want to stress two conceptual reasons: 1) the lack of a word in our society’s lexicon for systematic racialization, beyond the level of individual prejudice or personal bias, and 2) the failure of scholars and therefore policy makers to distinguish absolute, relative, and strategic equality from each other.",2

Myers Jr.,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"This paper investigates the distributional characteristics of racial differences in mathematics achievement. It is well known that black students consistently perform lower than whites on standardized tests (Atkinson and Geiser 2009; Bloom et al. 2008; Bok and Bowen 2000; Coleman et al. 1966; Crossland 1971; Downey 2008; Espenshade and Chung 2010; Fischer et al. 1996; Fryer and Levitt 2006; Gerald and Haycock 2006; Jencks and Phillips 1998; Niu and Tienda 2010; Orfield et al. 1996; Soares 2007; Also see Special Report in The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education
2000). Various explanations for this discrepancy have been hypothesized, but the current literature on achievement tests shows persistent racial gaps even after controlling for family background and socioeconomic status (Fischer et al. 1996; Fryer and Levitt 2006; Myers et al. 2004). Although Fryer and Levitt (2006) propose that a small group of family background characteristics explains the bulk of the racial gap in test scores in early grades, at later grades too the test score gaps persist (Clotfelter et al. 2009). In a recent entry in this Review, Duncan and Sandy (2013) propose that about 50 % of the racial gap in test scores cannot be explained by a reasonable group of individual, school, and family characteristics. Two important caveats are in order when interpreting the Duncan and Sandy results. First, the decomposition uses variables, such as suspensions, that arguably are endogenous to the determination of test scores. In this paper, we account for the possible endogeneity of suspensions and examine the relationship between unexplained disparities in suspensions and the explained and unexplained portions of the test score gap. Secondly, the Duncan-Sandy results are computed at the mean of the test score distribution and fail to take into account that the portion of the racial gap that is unexplained differs between the top and the bottom of the test score distribution. For three reasons, it is not surprising that school suspensions “explain” some portion of racial gaps in test scores. One is that there are wide racial differences in suspensions—differences themselves that are often difficult to explain. Anything that is correlated with race can serve as a proxy for race in a regression model, whether or not the true relationship is causal. A second reason for suspecting a central role of suspensions in explaining racial gaps in test scores is that suspensions tautologically reduce attendance and attendance is known to affect test scores. Differential suspension rates will produce differential attendance rates and thus widen racial gaps in test scores, according to this logic. A third reason is that suspensions seen as unfair might also lead to disengagement from school and reduction of effort on tests and other academic tasks. We estimate a two-stage model of suspensions and test scores and compute the equal treatment value of suspensions for blacks to place a bound on the extent to which racial disparities in test scores might be explained by racial disparities in suspensions. A second concern with the Duncan and Sandy results revolves around the assumption that the portion of the racial gap that is unexplained is the same for low and high performing kids. It is plausible that the mechanisms explaining test performance might be different for students with lower or higher levels of prior academic preparation. Accordingly, we estimate quantile regression models and demonstrate that residual unexplained differences in scores differ between the lower tails of the test score distribution and the upper tails. The rest of the paper consists of the following four sections. First we review what is known about racial disparities in test scores and suspensions. We then sketch a two-step decomposition model designed (1) to compute the determinants of suspension rates and (2) to determine the extent to which unexplained differences in suspensions can explain the racial gap in test scores. We do this both at the mean and at each quantile. Following the model specification, we present and discuss the data and analysis results. In a concluding section, we discuss the implications of the findings and results.",2

Similarly to America with its strong racial divisions, Indian society has long been divided hierarchically. But in India the divisions are more specifically defined among four Hindu castes known as varnas, which in total contain between two and three thousand subcastes, or jatis (Deshpande 2006). Dalits, or “untouchables,” include those jatis that fall outside the Varna caste system, and have long been subject to violent oppression. Both countries have instituted affirmative action policies in higher education to increase the proportion of underrepresented ethnic groups on their nation’s college campuses. Both India and the U.S. also rely upon broad racial and ethnic categories for allocating affirmative action benefits, a practice that subsumes distinct subgroups. This paper will analyze the extent to which affirmative-action policies have failed to achieve equitable representation of caste subgroups and black subgroups in higher education in each country. The first section briefly describes the goals and implementation processes of both countries’ affirmative action policies, and argues that subgroup inequality is a barrier to attaining the objective of equitable representation of minority groups. The next section examines the underrepresentation of subgroups in higher education, as well as explains socioeconomic and cultural differences that merit subgroup divisions. The final section discusses Indian state governments’ attempts to diminish subgroup inequality by further dividing aggregated ethnic groups, and asserts that the U.S. should adopt similar strategies. We suggest that all American colleges and universities collect demographic data for black Hispanics,Footnote 1 multiracial blacks,Footnote 2 black immigrants,Footnote 3 and black natives,Footnote 4 and consider these classifications in recruiting and admissions.",

Weisskopf,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"For our study we first compiled data separately for 8 regional railway zones, from 1980 through 2002, from various annual reports on productive inputs and outputs. In specifying the variables needed for our analysis, we sought as far as possible to make use of physical rather than money measures, because the latter can easily be distorted by changing prices. The output produced by the IR consists of passenger service and freight service, measured physically in terms of passenger-kilometers and net ton-kilometers, respectively. We first generated time series indices for total passenger output and total freight output from underlying time series for passenger and freight transport of different types. We then generated time series indices for total railway output by weighting the indices for passenger output and freight output according to their percentage of total railway revenue generated. Since industry outputs are often measured in terms of gross revenue or value added, we also compiled data on railway revenues to obtain an alternative constant -price time series for total railway revenue. For labor inputs we compiled data distinguishing SCST (i.e., SC and ST) employees from non-SCST employees in four different IR job categories. The upper two job categories are comprised of administrative officers and professional workers; the lower two categories include semi-skilled and clerical staff, as well as relatively unskilled attendants, peons and cleaning staff. To take account of the effects of changes in the job-level-composition of the work force over time, we also constructed time series indices for an alternative measure of total labor input that we call “effective labor.” For the purposes of our analysis we clearly need to be able to distinguish AA beneficiaries from other employees. The IR provides data on employees who declare themselves to be SC or ST, which is necessary to avail of reservations. Almost all SCST applicants for upper-level jobs do declare their SC or ST status, because they know that their scores on the qualifying exams are unlikely to be high enough for them to gain access to an unreserved job. Any SCST applicant for a reserved job who actually scores higher than the cut-off for a non-reserved job is not included in the count of SCST employees. Thus the data on SCST employment in upper-level jobs measure fairly accurately the corresponding number of AA beneficiaries. On the other hand, many SCST applicants for lower-level jobs do not avail of reservations, because they know they can meet the qualifications for a non-reserved job; so the IR data on SCST employment in lower-level jobs significantly over-estimate the number of AA beneficiaries. In our analysis we worked with two measures of the SCST percentage: the percentage applying to all employees, and the percentage applying to upper-level employees only. The latter percentage is the better indicator of the effect of AA on IR operations, because it measures the extent to which apparently lower-qualified AA-beneficiary SCST employees have displaced apparently higher-qualified non-SCST would-be employees; and it is this displacement that most worries critics of India’s reservation policies. For capital inputs we chose to work with estimates of gross rather than net capital stock, because measures of net capital stock decline in value as the number of productive future years decline, whereas measures of gross capital stock tend to be proportional to the capital value actually consumed during a given year. We made use of the perpetual inventory method to generate time series of constant-price gross capital stocks. But these measures fail to reflect the extent to which technological progress embodied in capital increases the productive potential of a piece of constant-price capital stock from year to year. So we found it desirable to adjust our raw measure of capital input to take account of changes in capital quality associated with the age structure of capital in order to generate an alternative measure we called “effective capital input”. The main material input used by a railway system is fuel. Using standard conversion factors to convert all the measures of fuel in physical terms into their equivalent in coal-tonnes, we compiled time series of total coal-tonnes of fuel input. In the case of this input too, we saw reason to generate a second, more nuanced variable to take account of changes in fuel quality associated with changes in the proportions of different kinds of fuel utilized by the IR. The alternative measure of fuel input, which we call “effective fuel,” takes account of the gradual shift toward more efficient diesel- and electricity-powered locomotion.",2

Ragusett,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Segregation refers to the degree of uneven distribution, isolation from the majority, concentration into relatively few places, centralization near the urban core, and/or clustering into enclaves, of a minority population group across a metropolitan area (Massey and Denton 1988). Explanations of racial or ethnic segregation in the United States remain controversial and contested.Footnote 1 An undoubtedly short list of such explanations would include the historical legacy of formal segregation and other forms of “collective action racism” (Cutler et al. 1999), animosity towards another population group (or groups), domestic migration patterns, foreign immigration patterns, the spatial distribution of capital and employment, access to credit, and inequalities in wealth and income, among many others. Segregation is thus a key focus of contemporary and historical scholarship in urban economics and other social sciences. Theoretical and empirical research on the relationship between segregation and land use – in particular, land use patterns characterized as “sprawl” – is an intriguing and growing literature. In a sense, the convergence of the segregation and sprawl literatures is not surprising. Both investigate phenomenon whose very definitions are multi-dimensional and heavily debated. However, both have made progress in resolving methodological inconsistencies in empirical measurement. Such developments allow for more rigorous analysis of the association between the predominant settlement patterns of minorities, and the predominant spatial patterns of land use. While previous studies have contributed crucial insights, important limitations are clear and apparent. First, recent research focuses heavily on density as an attribute and measure of urban sprawl. Although a limited number of studies empirically examine the relationship between multiple measures of sprawl and segregation, an even smaller number take account of countervailing patterns of land use.Footnote 2 Metropolitan areas do not generally exhibit high-sprawl (or low-sprawl) characteristics across multiple measures. Spatial patterns of land use typically exhibit some combination, or ‘configuration,’ of both low-sprawl and high-sprawl attributes. Second, previous empirical research largely utilizes data from the 1980 to 2000 decennial Censuses. This is a significant limitation, in light of the economic and demographic changes in the United States since 2000. Third, the literature often lacks comprehensive analysis of the multiple dimensions of segregation suggested by Massey and Denton (1988). This paper contributes to the literature by exploring the relationship between alternative configurations of land use and Black segregation at a national level, using data from Census 2010. The preceding literature lacks precision in two important areas. First, how is the effect of land-use attributes on changes in segregation transmitted in metropolitan areas with a combination of high-sprawl and low-sprawl characteristics, as compared to those with uniformly high-sprawl or low-sprawl attributes? Second, why do different combinations of multiple land-use attributes contribute to increasing (or decreasing) Black segregation? Regression analysis indicates that, when defined as countervailing, multidimensional phenomenon, land use patterns have contrasting effects on changes in Black residential segregation. These complexities would not be observable by simply controlling for one attribute of land use. The paper is divided into the following sections. Section 2 reviews the literature and its major findings. Section 3 defines the theoretical framework of this paper, namely the various configurations of land use, as well as the selected dimensions and measures of segregation. Section 4 introduces summary statistics for all empirical measures. Section 5 presents the empirical model and analyzes regression results. Section 6 discusses the implications of this study, followed by an exploration of future research avenues in Section 7.",4

In addition to the increasing and persistent black-white wage gap since 1980s (Altonji and Blank 1999), studies find that black workers are more likely to be dismissed from their jobs than white workers with similar credentials (Fairlie and Kletzer 1998; see also Settles et al. 2010, for a review). While objective measures indicate that the risk of job loss is higher for black workers than for white workers, there is little research in economics on how what workers’ expectations of job loss differ by race. I aim to contribute to the literature on black-white labor market indicators by documenting (1) the trend in perceived job insecurity by race and other observable characteristics and (2) how their perceptions of job insecurity respond to current regional unemployment rates. Though higher perceptions of job insecurity among black workers have been documented by Manski and Straub (2000), how they have been changing over time and how differently they respond to current labor market conditions have not been explored. On one hand, the last few decades are often seen as a period in the United States in which discrimination against blacks has come down, and changes in the social and legal status of black Americans brought about by the civil rights movement improved labor market opportunities for blacks.Footnote 1 Thus, one may expect that black workers are increasingly feeling more secure about their jobs. On the other hand, evidence suggests that black employment is more vulnerable than white employment. Fairlie and Kletzer (1998) find that black men were more likely to experience job displacement than were white men during the period 1982–1991 and the large part of the displacement gaps could not be explained by racial differences in education, occupation, or industry distributions. I analyze the trends for black and white workers’ perceptions of job insecurity separately by gender, age group, educational attainment, occupation and industry as well as how they react to current regional unemployment rates. I find that perceptions of job insecurity of black male workers, older black workers, and black high school graduates have increased relative to their white counterparts during the period 1977–2012. Notably, among those who attended college, it is white workers whose perceived job insecurity has increased. Black blue-collar workers’ and construction workers’ perceptions of job insecurity also have increased relative to their white counterparts. Moreover, perceptions of job insecurity among black workers in several groups (older workers, high school dropouts, managers, and construction workers) are more sensitive to regional unemployment rates than those of their white counterparts, which is consistent with the fact that blacks are more vulnerable to unemployment than whites. Labor economists have traditionally used the duration of employment and the involuntary job separation rate as proxies for job insecurity. Some readers may worry about using workers’ expectations of job loss for any useful statistical investigation because of justifiable concerns that workers’ mood at the time of the survey can bias workers’ reported perceptions of unemployment risk. Nevertheless, empirical evidence indicates that subjective job insecurity is significantly correlated with job market realities and not just a state of mind of overly pessimistic workers. Workers’ perceptions of the risk of unemployment are positively and significantly related to regional unemployment rates (Green et al. 2000) and actual unemployment experience in the subsequent year (Green et al. 2001). Also, Schmidt (1999) reports that the trends in job insecurity are largely consistent with the trends in involuntary job loss rates in the United States. Similarly, Linz and Semykina (2008) find that perceptions of job insecurity among Russian workers are largely consistent with actual labor market condition—the fear of job loss was higher during the period of economic change and uncertainty (1995–1998) and lower during the period of relative economic stability (2000–2004). These findings suggest that workers take into consideration changes in labor market conditions when assessing their chances of unemployment and their subjective assessments are to some degree reasonable predictions. More recently, Kuroki (2012) uses the deregulation in temporary employment in Japan as a natural experiment and finds that workers’ perceptions of job insecurity increased when workers experienced or anticipated an influx of cheap and readily available workers. Other recent studies include Brochu and Morin (2012) who investigate the causal link between union status and perceived job insecurity in the United States, and Garz (2012), who examines the impact of media coverage of labor market policy on perceptions of job insecurity in Germany. In short, perceived job insecurity has gained attention and been used by economists extensively in recent years. Economic implications of perceptions of job insecurity are important for economists as well as policymakers. For example, workers may suffer slower wage growth if job insecurity reduces their bargaining power (Cambell et al. 2007). It has also been pointed out that job insecurity affects worker productivity. Facing a threat of job loss, workers may decide to work harder to increase their chances of keeping their current job. However, given that job insecurity is negatively correlated with job satisfaction (e.g. Blanchflower and Oswald 1999), job insecurity may decrease productivity of workers whose motivation to work hard for their current employer has decreased. The fear of job loss also has been hypothesized to encourage workers to invest less in firm-specific human capital. Finally, the consequences of job insecurity could extend beyond the labor market to savings and consumption behavior if households have little confidence to spend due to job insecurity of wage earners. As Hamermesh (2001) points out, “more satisfied workers who are secure in their jobs have a reduced motive to undertake precautionary savings” (p. 3). The microeconomic consequences of job insecurity potentially extend beyond the individual to the macro economy by aggregation; workers’ perceptions of job insecurity can reduce output and consumption, and restrain wage growth at the macroeconomic level. If perceived job insecurity is correlated with job market realities, and given that black workers have a greater probability of involuntary displacement (e.g. Fairlie and Kletzer 1998), then it is likely that black workers have higher perceived job insecurity than white workers. It is also important to keep in mind that perceived job insecurity is likely to be correlated with racial discrimination in the labor market. That is, if black workers feel that they are discriminated in the workplace, they are likely to have higher perceived job insecurity. Even though the experience of racial discrimination is often not straightforward but subjective, there is a plenty of evidence that black workers experience racial discrimination in the workplace.Footnote 2 For example, Stauffer and Buckley (2005) find that white supervisors are more likely to give white workers higher performance ratings than black works, compared to black supervisors rating the same workers. It has been also pointed out that organizational status is negatively correlated with the likelihood that one will be more frequently targeted and discriminated (e.g. Buchanan and Fitzgerald 2008). Thus, it is not surprising that white workers, who are more likely to hold positions of power, perceive lower job insecurity. On the contrary, black workers are less likely to have seniority than white workers in many occupational sectors and thus have higher perceived job insecurity. There are several sociological studies that examine perceived job insecurity among white and black workers. Wilson et al. (2006), using the 1996 and 1998 General Social Survey, find that black workers have higher perceived job insecurity than white workers with similar human capital credentials and job/labor market characteristics, and racial differences in the determinants of perceived job insecurity are more pronounced in the private than in the public sector. Wilson and Mossakowski (2009) find that black workers in privileged occupations (professionals and managers) have higher perceived job insecurity than their white counterparts. Yang and Zheng (2015) find that an organizational commitment to avoid layoffs seems to increase the black-white gap in perceived job insecurity. This study contributes to the sociological literature by examining how perceptions of job insecurity among white and black workers have been changing over time and how differently they respond to current labor market conditions. I use the 1977–2012 American General Social Surveys (GSS). GSS data are available in most of the years from 1977 to 1993, for which the size of sample averages around 1500 individuals per annum, and continues every second year from 1994 through 2012 with a larger sample size.Footnote 3 Since 1977, the GSS have asked workers a question eliciting their expectations of job loss: “Thinking about the next 12 months, how likely do you think it is that you will lose your job or be laid off—very likely, fairly likely, not too likely, or not at all likely?” I define job insecurity on a four-point scale, ordered from 1 signifying “not at all likely” to 4 signifying “very likely”. Regarding the race of respondents, the GSS classifies them as “white,” “black,” or “other.” In order to focus on the white-black differentials, I will only focus on white and black workers throughout this paper. The “other” category comprises approximately 5 % of all respondents. Table 1 summarizes perceptions of job insecurity among black and white workers. Mean job insecurity is substantially higher for black workers than for white workers (1.74 vs. 1.48). Breaking the job insecurity variable into each category reveals that 8 % of black workers answered “very likely to lose job” compared to 4 % of white workers. 54 % of black workers answered “not at all likely to lose job” compared to 65 % of white workers. Figure 1 shows mean job insecurity for white workers and black workers over time along with national unemployment rates.Footnote 4 Unemployment rates and workers perceptions of job insecurity show a strikingly similar trend. Not surprisingly, data reveal that black workers’ mean perceived job insecurity are always higher than those of white workers. National Unemployment and Mean Job Insecurity of White and Black Workers: 1977–2012 Summary statistics shown Table 1 are the raw means, which are likely to be correlated with not only with a number of observable characteristics but also time trends and regional economic conditions. Thus, next I estimate the following equation: where i, r, and t denote an individual, the region in which the individual currently resided, and the year in which that individual was surveyed by the GSS, respectively. The dependent variable JI

θ

r
 represents census region dummies. Column 1 in Table 2 shows results from the regression that controls only for exogenous demographic characteristics (age, gender, native-born, and race) and includes regional dummies. Standard errors are clustered at the region-year level. To make the interpretation of the estimates easier, OLS estimation, rather than ordered probit or logit estimations, is presented.Footnote 6 Both white and black workers’ perceptions of job insecurity have risen over time, but the coefficient of (Black×Trend) is greater than that of (White×Trend) by 0.001 ~ 2. However, the p-value from testing whether the coefficients of (Black×Trend) are statistically significantly different from those of (White×Trend) suggests that the differences between the black and white trends are not statistically significantly different from one another. Because the regression in column 1 ignores the role played by other factors known to affect job insecurity such as education and occupation, columns 2 and 3 show results from the regressions that control for socioeconomic characteristics and occupations and industry, respectively. Columns 2 and 3 show that the statistical significance and the difference between the size of the coefficients on time trend virtually remain the same whether or not socioeconomic, occupation, industry are controlled. Turning to regional unemployment rates, they are highly statistically significant across different specifications for both whites and blacks. A one percentage point increase in regional unemployment rates is predicted to increase perceptions of job insecurity by 0.043 ~ 46 for black workers and by 0.034 ~ 37 on a four-point scale for white workers. That black workers’ fear of job loss is slightly more responsive to unemployment rates than white workers indicates that workers’ expectations is consistent with the reality that black men experience higher rates of job displacement than white workers (Fairlie and Kletzer 1998). However, again, the p-values suggest that there is little evidence that black workers’ perceptions of job insecurity react differently to the regional unemployment rates from those of white workers. Given that, in aggregate, both black and white workers have become more insecure about their jobs, it seems useful to examine subgroups of workers. I explore how the black-white gap in perceptions of job insecurity has been changing among different demographic groups. First, I divide the sample into men, women, and four age groups. Because including socioeconomic factors and industry/occupation controls did not affect the coefficients of interest substantially in Table 2, I control only for exogenous demographic characteristics (gender, age, native-born) and regions of residence. The results are shown in Table 3. Column 1 reveals that black men have experienced a larger decline in perceptions of job security over time than white men, and the difference is statistically significant. The coefficient of (Black×Trend) is statistically significant while that of white is not. This suggests that, over the 35 years (1977–2012), the black-white gap has increased approximately by 0.006×35 ≈ 0.2 on a four-point scale for men. The column 2 shows that the coefficient of (Black×Trend) is not statistically significant for female black workers but is statistically significant for female white workers, suggesting that black female workers may have experienced a relative decrease in job insecurity during the period. However, the difference in trends is not statistically significant; thus, trends in the gap by race offer no evidence of particularly higher job security for black female workers relative to that of white female workers. Moreover, for female workers, the coefficient of Black is large (0.23) and highly statistically significant, suggesting that black women still have higher perceptions of job insecurity than white women. Both male and female black workers’ perceived job insecurity again tends to be more sensitive to regional unemployment rates, but the differences are not statistically significant. Columns 3–6 report regression equations for different age groups. While there is no statistically significant black-white difference for workers aged 18–54, older black workers (55+) are feeling more insecure over time, and the black-white difference is statistically significant. For this group, the black-white gap has increased approximately by (0.013–0.003)×35 ≈ 0.35. However, black workers aged 55+ felt on average 0.36 points more secure than their white counterparts in 1977, as indicated by the coefficient of Black. This suggests that older black workers who used to feel more secure are no longer feeling more secure than older white workers. Also, older black workers’ perceived job insecurity is much more sensitive to regional unemployment rates that that of older white workers (0.08 vs. 0.03). Tables 4, 5, and 6 change from subgroups with only exogenous characteristics and report the regression results for other subgroups of the population. Of course, we must proceed with awareness that people are not randomly selected into different groups, and there might have been changing selection through time into education and occupations. Table 4 shows the results for workers with different amounts of education and contains interesting differences between blacks and whites. Both white and black high school graduates have experienced an increase in perceived job insecurity over time, but the size is larger for black workers, and the difference is statistically significant. For this group, the black-white gap has increased approximately by (0.007–0.002)×35 ≈ 0.18. Notably, among those who attended college, only white workers have been experiencing higher perceived job insecurity over time. For this group, the black-white gap has decreased approximately by (0.005)×35 ≈ 0.18. However, this finding may be confounded by the choice to go to college. For example, it may be that white “worriers” may be increasingly self-selecting into higher education to get a college degree over time. If this is the case, the fear of job loss is likely to increase among educated white workers relative to black counterparts. Finally, while there is no statistically significant difference between the black and white trends for high school dropouts, black high school dropouts’ perceived job insecurity is more responsive to regional unemployment (0.13 vs. 0.05), and the difference is statistically significant. Table 5 shows the results by occupation. To avoid statistical imprecision that may come from the small sample of blacks in the GSS, I use only broad occupation categories. Again there are some interesting differences between black and white workers. Among black workers, blue collar workers are increasingly feeling insecure. Among white workers, managers and professionals and white-collar workers’ perceptions of job insecurity has increased over time, though the differences between the black and white trends are not statistically significantly different from one another for these occupations. Finally, black managers are more likely to develop a fear of job loss when regional unemployment rates go up than white managers. In Table 6, the sample is divided into different industries. Again, I use only broad categories for industry. It is notable that, as the black dummy indicates, black workers in the construction/mining industry were on average 0.84 points more secure than white counterparts in 1977. However, black workers in the construction/mining industry have experienced a large increase in perceptions of job insecurity over time (0.03 per year), so black workers in these industries have higher perceived job insecurity in 2012. Also, their perceived job insecurity increases more with regional unemployment rates. Those black-white differences are statistically significant, as suggested by the p-values. But because the number of workers in the construction/mining industry is small, it is hard to draw any concrete inference.",1

A Case for Racial Identification Switching,December 2016,Salvador Contreras,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Racial identity is made and shaped by experiences over a long-term process. It affects whom we associate with, the political views and cultural attitudes we hold. Akerlof and Kranton (2000) go further and state that the “choice of identity may be the most important “economic” decision people make.” Research has confirmed that identity has an effect on economic outcomes (Gorinas 2014; Russo and Hooft 2011; Benjamin et al. 2010; Espenshade et al. 2004, and Bertrand and Mullainathan 2004). In light of the economic importance of identity, work by Antman and Duncan (2015) and Francis and Tannuri-Pianto (2013) shows that an individual’s racial identity responds to economic incentives (Mason 2004a). Antman and Duncan (2015) show that in states with affirmative action bans the share of self-reported African-American group drops while the Asian group grows. The authors reconcile this by suggesting that when the penalty for being Asian (a group hurt by affirmative action university admission policies) and economic benefit for being African-American (implied advantage in university admission decisions) are removed a fraction are likely to switch their racial identity. This suggests that the choice of racial identity may be a function of perceived external (economic, cultural, social) benefits and costs and in/out group interactions (Stewart 2009 and Darity et al. 2006). In other words, racial identity is a social construct (Mason 2004b, and Harris and Sim 2002). Extensive research supports the view that identity choice is influenced by external factors (Mason 2004b). The objective of this paper is to add to the existing empirical literature of race identity. Specifically, we take advantage of the affirmative action bans around the year 2000 as a form of exogenous variation to evaluate factors that drive race switching. The first and fourth wave of the NELS 1988 dataset allows us to measure race consistency over a 12-year period. We find that those who reside in an affirmative action ban state alter how they respond to the race question. We show that in the immediate aftermath (or environment leading up to) of an affirmative action ban individuals are more likely to hold on to childhood racial identity (Asian and Black). Second, we show that switchers are predominately multiracial who reside in states that do not adopt affirmative action bans. Our findings suggest that race identity is not permanently fixed across time for a non-trivial fraction of our sample of 26 year-olds. The fourth wave, which takes place in the year 2000, does not allow us parse out economic and/or social-political incentives produced by the timing of the ban on racial identification. We find that at the time of the ban all race groups are either less likely (non-Hispanic Asian and Black) or no more likely (Hispanic) than non-Hispanic Whites to switch race. This suggests that in the short-run social-political factors at the time of a ban dominate long-term economic benefit/damage that may come about from the policy change. A wave 5 (non-existing) would help bring clarity to the long-term effect of the ban. Sherif et al. (1955) shows that when individuals (strangers) are brought together and made to share common goals they will collaborate to counter/respond to a (second) hostile group. This explanation of group identification is consistent with our findings that switching is far less likely in states that adopt affirmative action bans. We propose that affirmative action bans are likely understood by minorities at the time of the ban as being political acts against their group’s interest. To illustrate this point, consider California’s Proposition 209 passed by California voters in 1996 (taking effect in 1997). Proposition 209 was a voter approved constitutional amendment that prohibited state government institutions from using race or sex when making decisions dealing with public employment, contracts, and public education. The ban potentially benefits Whites and Asians (Arcidiacono et al. 2016). For example, Asians were the group most hurt by affirmative action admissions based decisions into the University of California system. However, Proposition 209 was followed and preceded by a number of ballot initiatives that at the time of Governor Pete Wilson’s tenure appeared to be against the interests of minorities. For instance, Proposition 227 was a ballot initiative passed in 1998 by California voters to eliminate bilingual education (Frank 1998, and Crawford 1998). Proposition 187 (Save Our State) passed in a referendum in 1994 made it a crime to offer public services (healthcare, education, etc.) to undocumented immigrants (Evelyn 1999). In social-political environments where minority groups’ interests appear to be under attack, even the most agnostic apolitical individuals may find themselves supporting/aiding their groups cause. Walter Isaacson’s biography of Albert Einstein paints him as secular in his worldviews while having a strong sense of obligation to his own group. Albert Einstein is quoted as saying: Despite my internationalist beliefs, I have always felt an obligation to stand up for the persecuted and morally oppressed members of my tribe… According to the Los Angeles Times Poll of the November 1996 election 37% of Whites, 74% of Blacks, 76% Latino, and 61% of Asians voted against Proposition 209.Footnote 1 Only Whites as a group overwhelmingly supported Proposition 209. Asians who potentially had the most to gain from Proposition 209 (the majority) voted against it. The results we present support an argument that policies perceived to undermine the interest of minorities makes one more (consciously) aware of one’s own minority identity. We show that systematically, in the time around the affirmative action bans in California, Texas, Washington, and Florida racial identity switching becomes far less likely. The data does not allow us to see if the pattern of race switching changes years after the adoption of the bans. In addition, we cannot get at the effect that affirmative action bans had on those more directly impacted (i.e. college bound students). However, work by Antman and Duncan (2015) suggests that in the long-run Asian and African-American identification move in opposite directions as years after the ban elapse. In March 2014, California abandoned Senate Constitutional Amendment 5 (SCA5) that would have largely undone the effects of Proposition 209. The Chinese-American lobby is largely credited with helping kill these efforts (Mason 2014). The paper is organized as follows. “Identity” section reviews identity and related literature. “Identification Strategy” section introduces our estimating strategy and data. “Results” section presents our empirical results. “Conclusion” section provides concluding remarks. Identity has many domains. Individuals have an identity over race, religion, political ideology, sexuality, work, family, etc. Each of these identities carries qualities and attributes that define who one is at a particular space and time. Identity therefore, serves to filter external stimuli and give meaning to our actions and social interactions. This is important as it suggests that biases, prejudices, predispositions, etc. as defined by our identities can potentially have significant social, cultural, and economic implications. In particular, the stereotype literature has shown that individuals act out (behave in accordance to) their identities (Benjamin et al. 2010; Gonzales et al. 2002; Shih et al. 1999; Steele and Aronson 1995; Steele 1997). We learn from social psychology literature that cognitive ability, intellectual curiosity, and current identity are predictors of personal identity development (Grotevant 1987; Marcia 1966; Berman et al. 2001). These factors are also likely to be significant predictors of social identity development. Identity formation is therefore a process of experimentation and self-discovery whose consolidation leads to the adaptation of our identities (Berman et al. 2001 and Grotevant 1987). Darity et al. (2006) produced a game theoretical framework to study alternative racial identity (“labeling”) social norms. In their model, social identity norms are established out of social interactions within and between groups. The predictions of their model in part depend on phenotype (ability to “pass”), resources (exclusivity), and group identification of others. Among the set of dominant strategies, they find that a mixed equilibrium will give rise to “passing” or assimilation. The ability to pass is in part facilitated/hindered by individual’s own physical characteristics. Antman and Duncan (2015) focus on multiracial individuals because of their ability to (more easily) “pass” for a member of another group. If identity is in part explained by economic payoffs, as predicted by Darity et al. 2006, then an affirmative action ban will cause a non-trivial fraction of multiracial individuals to adopt a race choice consistent with the economic benefit/damage of group affiliation.Consistent with this prediction, Antman and Duncan (2015) find a drop in the share of multiracial African-Americans following an affirmative action ban. The literature on identity faces many empirical limitations. For example, the absence of individual-specific observations is a problem. Work by Antman and Duncan (2015) exploit racial variations in group identity shares by state. They are not able to identify the actual switcher. They show that differences in population shares controlling for migration patterns can be explained mostly by the exogenous affirmative action ban. The significant differences in shares of Asian and African-American population following an affirmative action ban suggest that systematically some proportion of the population choose a different racial identity. Unfortunately, they were not able to evaluate the characteristics of individuals that changed race. Measurement error is a problem in racial identity studies. Work by Liebler and Halpern-Manners (2008) and Harris and Sim (2002) emphasize that racial identity is sensitive to the survey employed. The work by Harris and Sim (2002) using the Add Health dataset show that responses to multiple race questions are sensitive to the location where the survey is administered. For example, adolescent interviewees were far more likely to be multiracial if answering the survey at school then if answering at home (Harris and Sim 2002). These studies highlight potential estimating concerns when employing self-reported multiracial variables. However, according to this same literature race choice is understood to be a social construct. Harris and Sim (2002) finding that racial ancestry is influenced by the location of the interview further support the view that identity is space-time dependent. Additionally, measurement error was likely introduced in 2000 when the US Census and (other government entities) changed the way race was asked on survey forms. In particular, the Census adopted a two-part race question (1. Are you Hispanic? 2. Race?). Harris and Sim (2002) exclude Hispanics from their analysis partly because it is understood that the change to the race question created confusion in the part of interviewees. The implied consequence of the two-part question is that the social construct of race identity is not adequately expressed. That is, the expression of identity is partly biased by the wording, questions, and/or order the questions appear on the survey (Hirschman et al. 2000). To the extent that biases affect our estimates they are likely from the surveys collection methods and time of collection. We are not aware of any concerns raised by previous research using this dataset about sample and survey collection biases. Our results are limited to a national representative sample of 8th graders in 1988. This omits 14 year-olds who were no longer enrolled in school.",2

Evidence from the Caribbean Community and Common Market,December 2016,Sokchea Lim,Walter O. Simmons,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Global remittances have reached $557 billion in 2013 and are projected to grow at a rate of about 4% to $636 billion by 2017 (World Bank 2015). Approximately 75% of the money goes to developing countries. The flows to Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) was substantial, reaching $61 billion in 2013 although the growth has slowed down, growing at a little more than 1% in the last two years. The Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM), an integrated region consisting of Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and Grenadines, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago, received roughly $4.5 billion in 2012 (World Bank 2013).Footnote 1 Due to small population the per-capita receipts are substantial in most countries. St. Kitts and Nevis, Jamaica and Guyana ranked among the top 10 per-capita recipients, receiving $842, $791 and $590, respectively (Lim and Simmons 2015). The impact of remittances on overall development depends on how remittances are utilized. Samuel (1996) indicates if remittances are used mainly for conspicuous consumption, they might induce growth in the short run, but at the expense of long-run economic development. Given the high percentage of importation content in the consumption pattern of CARICOM countries, there can be negative impact on balance of payments and limited spill over for the contribution to economic development. However, if remittances are used for investment and essential consumption to improve health, education, and other productive activities of the society, development of the society can be greatly enhanced. Given the economic challenges of many countries in CARICOM, it is generally assumed that in the absence of remittances the economies would have significantly more severe socio-economic challenges. There are priori indications that the increased flows of remittances have facilitated substantial socio-economic development in the region but no definitive empirical studies have been done to substantiate or provide evidence on such outcome. Often times, the Caribbean region is studied in conjunction with Latin America and the region’s identity is often minimized within the aggregate analysis. World Bank (2006) shows that remittances are growth-enhancing though the magnitude is relatively small while Mundaca (2009) finds a more pronounced impact of remittances on economic growth, especially when financial development is accounted for. Nsiah and Fayissa (2013) and Ramirez and Sharma (2008) use cointegration test and provide evidence for the long-run relationship between per-capita growth and remittance flows. Unlike these studies, Lim and Simmons (2015) examine specifically the homogeneous part of the region, CARICOM, and find no long-run relationship between remittances and income but a relationship with consumption. The main purpose of the paper is to analyze the impact of remittances on the socio-economic development of CARICOM countries. If remittances has not boosted long-run economic growth in this region; then, what have they done? More specifically, we examine data from 1970 to 2013 on the long-run impact of remittances on four areas of social development including health, education, communication infrastructure, and demographic changes. To our knowledge, the paper is the first that empirically examines the relationship between remittances and social development in this region. The paper adds to the current knowledge about the role remittances play in the social development of the region. Further, the findings of this study provide insights which are useful for assessing the performance of each country and are a useful tool for policy makers who formulate policies that deal with immigration, migrant workers, and remittance transfers.",4
43.0,3.0,The Review of Black Political Economy,17 December 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12114-016-9241-x,"Nineteenth Century Black and Mixed-Race Physical Activity, Calories, and Life Expectancy: Nutrition, Sanitation, or Medical Intervention?",December 2016,Scott Alan Carson,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Nineteenth century African-Americans experienced considerable degrees of political and economic exclusion. From its founding, US economic arrangements were based on inequality, and blacks were at an institutionalized disadvantage to whites. This inequality extended not only to black material conditions but also to their physical activity, nutrition, and life expectancy. While inferior to whites under slavery, the variety and quality of black diets were sufficient to maintain slave health (Fogel and Engerman 1974; Sutch 1976), and as slave owner property, slave masters had incentives to maintain slave health and extend slave life expectancies. After emancipation, economic arrangements changed, and Southern agricultural productivity decreased (Ransom and Sutch, 1997, pp. 151–155; Irwin 1994); however, we are uncertain how black and mixed-race individual’s physical activity and nutrition varied with the transition from bound to free labor. After generations under slavery, when given a choice, black workers may have chosen to work less, and their physical activity levels would have decreased (Ransom and Sutch 1977, pp. 41–47). It is also unclear how black life expectancy changed with the transition and the change in nutrition associated with slavery’s demise. As a result, this study considers how nineteenth century US institutional change altered the nutrition, physical activity, and life expectancy facing African-Americans. Individual height and weight reflect the cumulative net difference between calories consumed less those required for work and to fend off disease. An individual’s height reflects genetic factors but also environmental and nutritional circumstances between conception and maturity (Cole 2003). Their weight is partially a function of their height but is a snapshot of their nutritional status at the time of measurement, and heights, weights, and physical activity levels are used here to estimate cumulative and current net nutrition when other material welfare measures are scarce or unreliable. An important extension to weight, height, and BMI measures is to use these values to estimate calories required to achieve and maintain weight and height (Harris and Benedict 1919; Mifflin et al. 1990). Fogel and Engerman (1974, pp. 109-115) and Fogel (1989, pp. 132–138) show that slaves received more calories per day than whites. Steckel (1979, pp. 373-375) documents early that fairer complexioned blacks were taller than their darker complexioned counterparts. Bodenhorn (1999) also shows that mixed-race African-Americans had taller statures than darker complexioned blacks. Rees et al. (2003) show how slave owners allocated nutritional resources over a slave’s life to maximize slave-holder wealth with respect to slave diets and activity levels. However, while these measures provide important insight into biological conditions during economic development, they provide less information about the physical activity and calories required to maintain weight and health. At the same time that anthropometric studies have created a need to more clearly evaluate nutrition during US economic development, research from nutrition and health studies have extended techniques to estimate the nutrition required to sustain an individual’s physical activity, weight, and height (Mifflin et al. 1990; Weijs et al. 2008). Even when wage and income data are available, calories and nutrition are important measures for non-pecuniary conditions facing a population. Various historical calorie and nutrition measures are available from such diverse sources as slave plantation records, aggregate food balance sheets, and dietaries (Floud et al. 2011; Dirks 2016). Estimated calories reported here are from energy equations and represent calories required per day to maintain an individual’s weight, height, and physical activity (Harris and Benedict 1918; Mifflin et al. 1990). Komlos (1987, p. 909) illustrates that US antebellum calories decreased with economic development and attributes it to the separation of food production from food consumption (Dirks 2016, p. 62). Throughout the nineteenth century, there were nutritional imbalances among the labor force. Increasing urbanization, immigration, and the growth of the industrial sector were greater than the growth in agricultural productivity, which put US national food supplies under stress. Moreover, dietary compositions changed with urbanization and economic development, and the US agricultural sector could not supply the growing demands for proteins, amino acids, and dairy products. In sum, a considerable body of nutrition and anthropometric studies show that slaves and free blacks received sufficient nutrition to perform work, which was associated with changes in their physical measurements. It is against this backdrop that this study considers three paths of inquiry into nineteenth century black physical activity, nutrition, and life expectancy. First, how did late 19th and early twentieth century black physical activity and calories vary over time and across their respective distributions? Throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, black and mixed-race BMRs and calories decreased while their life expectancies increased, indicating that black life expectancy increased despite diminishing calories associated with their transition to a free labor force. Second, how did black physical activity and calories vary by occupations and socioeconomic status? Physically active farmers had greater BMRs and required more calories per day than workers in other occupations. Third, how did black BMRs and calories vary by residence within the US? Rural Southern blacks had greater BMRs and required more calories per day than blacks in the Upper South, and Northeastern blacks had both the lowest BMRs and received the fewest calories per day, indicating that urban workers were physically less active and required fewer calories per day than workers in rural locations.",1

When exploring this history of resistance after 1865, we can clearly identify a central theme around economic self-sufficiency. This article does not propose that economic stability would lead to the dismantling of oppressive institutions and/or ideologies that seek to disadvantage people of African descent, it simply observes that access to economic resources and equal opportunity to economic mobility was and continues to be a core principle for many social movements spearheaded by the African American community. Economic development is commonly defined as the process of improving the standard of living of people at the national, state and local level (Malecki 1997; Arndt 1987).Footnote 1 The process of economic development can include, but is not limited to, initiatives geared toward job creation, technological advancement, opportunities for wealth accumulation, and professional skill development. The central objective is to improve quality of living. Thus, economic development is vast and encompasses the economy, education, government and infrastructural design (Malecki 1997; Schumpeter 2011).Footnote 2
 This research utilizes the term economic development to focus on the process or processes used by African Americans to engage their national, state and local economies to maximize their participation for the purpose of improving economic standings in regards to employment, wealth holdings and economic mobility. It must be noted that at times these processes expand the traditional scope of economic development due to the social and political reality of African American communities. Thus, this research identifies act by African Americans to improve their economic standing as a form of economic development. Historically, African American led social movements geared toward, or including a component for, economic development sought to address a critical issue that has yet to be solved. While much of the Black leadership up until the 1960s committed itself to liberalist approach for economic development, more radical constituencies concluded that liberalism was insufficient for addressing African Americans economic challenges (Carmichael 1963; Sullivan 1963). In fact, the inability of legislation, the thrust of liberal reformists, to produce fair employment practices motivated a wide abandoning of the liberalist approach and brought into question capitalism as a system. For many, capitalism represented a system that produces economic instability and inherently exploited the labor of the poor. It must be noted that the various movements differ in aims, scope, objectives and tactics used to obtain its desired outcomes. Examples of these movements are the inception of the reparations movement foraged by the National Ex-Slave Mutual Relief, Bounty and Pension Association, the solidification of early models of Black Capitalism through organization like the National Negro Business League, direct action protest models like economic boycotting such as the ‘Don’t buy where you can’t work movements” used in Harlem, Chicago, Philadelphia and other large Black communities in metropolitan cities. Although these movements unfolded in different time periods and in different geographical places helped to refine and identify effective models for addressing economic development. These movements not only illustrate the resilience of people of African descent, it also, however, exposes the shortcomings and the need to assess and possibly shift future objectives. This research offers a much need evaluation of the methods used by African Americans to engage economic development and the objectives outlined by our various communities to assess the feasibility of acquiring success. In addition, it explores past assertion that challenges the practicality of economic development within a capitalistic system that finds its roots firmly embedded in white supremacy and exploitation. The discourse on capitalism and the viability of Black economic development is central to the construction of objectives for future movements geared toward African American economic development. To be clear, if African American economic development and capitalism have no positive correlation, more radical objectives must be developed to explore new economic systems that are conducive for Blacks acquiring economic security. A look at movements organized and carried out in Philadelphia aimed at economically empowering African Americans could be useful in assessing degrees of success toward identified objectives and in evaluating gains toward addressing the critical question of economic self-sufficiency. The African American community in Philadelphia has a lengthy history of social activism and was successful in establishing early legislation protecting African American employment rights. This paper surveys demonstrations in Philadelphia geared toward improving African Americans’ collective economic reality. Next, it assesses the success of the demonstrations in Philadelphia toward their desired objectives. Then, it analyzes the significance of these movements toward addressing the central concern of economic stability. Lastly, it recommends necessary shifts in objectives to adequately address economic self-sufficiency.",

Mason,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Historically, “passing” and “acting white” have been two forms of acculturation available to African Americans. “Passing” occurs when European-phenotype persons of African descent select a white-alone racial identity. If there is a relatively larger economic payoff to white identity, there will be strong incentives for European-featured Africans to identity as white. “Acting white” permits acculturation for some African Americans who are otherwise unable to pass. For instance, mixed-race self-identification can be an individualistic acculturation strategy for those seeking to arbitrage the differences in economic inequality associated with market and social premia obtained by white-alone persons relative to black-alone persons. Consequently, a mixed-race self-identity strategy may not get a person into an advantaged group (e.g., white-alone in the US) but it may allow a person to more or less successfully distance himself from a disadvantaged group (e.g., black-alone in the US). Identity differences among African Americans were widespread during the nineteenth century. In their analysis of 1860 census data of the urban South, Bodenhorn and Ruebeck (2003) found that light-skinned mixed-race persons, “mulattoes,” often had economic incentives to distinguish themselves from blacks. By rejecting blackness and “acting white” it was sometimes possible for mulattoes to obtain better education, higher occupational status, and greater wealth accumulation (Bodenhorn and Ruebeck 2007). Simply separating themselves from black-alone or darker African Americans was not sufficient for mulattoes to achieve greater socioeconomic wellbeing, the separation also had to occur in a context whereby it was beneficial to whites. Further, the advantages of mixed-race identity varied by region and by the demographic composition of the population. Black-white persons of the Lower South (and the Caribbean) were most frequently the children of affluent white males and (free or enslaved) black women; hence, they secured advantages not available to persons who were black-alone, for example, manumission, some degree of education, and inheritance from fathers. (See Bodenhorn 2003 and accompanying references). Black-white persons of the Upper South were most frequently the children of poor white males and enslaved black women. Hence, the mulatto-black economic differential in the Upper South was smaller than the mulatto-black economic differential in the Lower South. Matching individuals from the 1880 and 1900–1940 US federal census, Nix and Qian (2015) find that over 19% of African American males passed for white at some point during their lifetime and that about 10% of these passing males later reverse-passed to a black identity. Importantly, Nix and Qian note that “passing was accompanied by geographic relocation to “whiter” communities; reverse passing was common and accompanied by relocation to “blacker” communities (page 37).” Most often, passing occurred in Northern states. Passing from black to white was positively associated with better political-economic and social opportunities for whites relative to blacks (page 4). Although the Nix and Qian results are strongly consistent with the predictions of Darity et al. (2006), it should be noted that the racial identities of persons in these censuses was determined by the census enumerator, not by the head of household or other respondent. Further, for the 1880, 1910, and 1920 censuses the racial categories are white, mulatto, and black, while white and black are the categories for 1900, 1930, and 1940 censuses, with the mulatto category merged into the black category. The racial classification instructions for enumerators were vague and mostly depended on visual inspection by the enumerator. Liebler et al. (2014) provide a descriptive analysis of changes in racial self-identity for a panel of persons linked from the 2000 and 2010 federal censuses. Among African Americans, fewer persons selected into the black-alone identity than selected out of this identity, regardless of the initial identity in 2000. For example, among the top 20 identity response changes: 112,882 persons changed from black-alone to white-alone and 102,464 persons changed from white-alone to black-alone; 130,788 persons transferred from black-alone to black-and-white, while 90,086 persons switched from black-and-white to black-alone (Liebler et al. 2014: 32). Similarly, among Non-Hispanic blacks 71,382 persons changed from black-alone to black-and-American Indian/Alaska native, but just 50,000 made the opposite change; 90,086 Non-Hispanic blacks who self-identified as black-and-white in 2000 changed to black-alone in 2010, but 130,788 changed from black-alone to black-and-white (Liebler et al. 2014: 26). Among Hispanic African Americans who self-identified as black-alone during 2000 (238,070 persons), 77% joined that category in 2010, but 55% left that category by 2010. Hispanic African Americans who self-identified as black-and-white had identity persistence of just 11%, with 77% leaving that category and 115% joining. Liebler, et al. do not provide information on the relationship between nativity and changes in racial self-identification, but there are a large fraction of first and second generation immigrants among Hispanics and African American immigrants may originate from countries with more fluid and gradational racial categories than the United States, for example, the Caribbean and Central America. As such, nativity may be a significant determinate of identity change. Importantly, also, Leibler, et al. show that among those who self-identify as Non-Hispanic black-alone identity stability increases with age, moving from 95% (persons no more than 29 years of age) to 98% (persons at least 45 years of age); however, identity stability declines with age among Non-Hispanic African Americans who self-identity as black-and-white, moving from 63% (persons no more than 14 years of age) to 20% (persons at least 45 years of age). Recent regression studies have added nuance to our empirical knowledge of racial identity selection. For example, Antman and Duncan (2015) and Contreras (2016) examine the effects on racial self-identification when state governments ban the utilization of affirmative action policies in higher education, contracting, and employment. Both studies find that the racial identification effects of an affirmative action ban depend on the age and ancestral origin of the person. Working with concatenated cross-sectional data, Antman and Duncan find that for African Americans under 25 years of age and with a multiracial ancestral heritage an affirmative action ban reduces by about 15% the probability of self-identifying as black. But, for African Americans ages 26–34 and with a black-alone ancestral heritage an affirmative action ban increases by about 0.20% the probability of self-identifying as black; this probability falls to 0.10% for persons 35–59 years of age. Also, for Asian Americans with a multiracial ancestral heritage an affirmative action ban increases by about 15% the probability of self-identifying as Asian. Similarly, for Asian Americans with an Asian-alone ancestral heritage an affirmative action ban increases by about 1.0% the probability of self-identifying as Asian. Antman and Duncan argue that when an affirmative action ban occurs persons affiliated with underrepresented ancestral groups are less likely to self-identity as a member of the racial group, while persons affiliated with overrepresented ancestral groups are more likely to self-identity as a member of the racial group. Hence, when affirmative action bans are implemented persons of African ancestral origin are less likely to self-identity as black, while persons of Asian ancestral origin are more likely self-identify as Asian. Persons 18–25 years of age represent a group that is immediately affected by an affirmative action ban. When Antman and Duncan confine their analysis to this group of currently enrollees, they find that African Americans with a multiracial ancestry are 19% less likely to self-identify as black while African Americans with no relevant racial ancestry are 0.40% more likely to enroll in college. But, there are no statistically significant effects for African Americans not enrolled in college. Persons of multiracial and Asian-alone ancestry are more likely to self-identify as Asian, regardless of college enrollment status. But, persons of no relevant Asian ancestry are less likely to self-identify as Asian. Stewart (1997), the inaugural paper on the economics of identity, provides an explanation for the heterogeneity of the Antman and Duncan results. Specifically, age and ancestral origin are proxies for what Stewart calls the stock of race identity.Footnote 1 Younger persons and persons with a multicultural ancestral origin may have lower stock or a different quality of stock of race identity than older persons or persons with a black-alone ancestral origin. Hence, heterogeneity across persons within a racial group in the quantity or quality of the stock of race identity, that is, the degree of attachment to a racial group, will facilitate heterogeneity in responses to exogenous factors (such as an affirmative action) that affect individual self-identification.Footnote 2
 Contreras uses longitudinal data that is limited to persons who are 26 years of age, a sample of persons who are not immediately affected by an affirmative action ban on college admissions. He compares identity selection in affirmative action ban states for persons at age 26 relative to their identity selection at age 14. Per the considerations of Stewart (1997) and Darity et al. (2006), racial and ethnic minorities view an affirmative action ban as attack against their social group’s social, economic, and political interests. Contreras argues that public “policies perceived to undermine the interest of minorities makes one more (consciously) aware of one’s own minority identity.” Hence, rather than undermining the incentive to self-identify as an African American such policies might increase this probability. Contreras confirms that “in the time around the affirmative action bans in California, Texas, Washington, and Florida racial identity switching becomes far less likely.” African Americans living in affirmative action ban states are 3% less likely to change their racial identity in response to a ban, regardless of ancestry origin, while Asian Americans are 5% less likely to change their racial identity. Multiracial Hispanics are 20% less likely to switch racial identity in response to an affirmative action ban, though Native Americans are 19% more likely to change their racial identification.Footnote 3
 Mason and Matella (2014) also provide evidence that when political and social actions are internalized by persons as an attack against their social group, such attacks will strengthen the person’s sense of group identity and push the person away from acculturating the toward alternative group perceived as initiating the hostile actions. Mason and Matella use inter- and intra-state variation in hate crimes after the September 11, 2001 attacks to explain changes in racial self-identification among Americans of Arab and Islamic descent. (See also Gould and Klor 2015). The increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes encouraged a rise in the fraction of Arab and Islamic Americans self-identifying as non-white, viz., either “other” or black. Golash-Boza and Darity (2008) find that interview-identified skin shade is a predictor of race among Hispanics. Stewart (2009) finds currently existing institutional rules and procedures designed to reduce the intensity of pre-enlistment racial identity and to increase the intensity of post-enlistment military identity have limited efficacy. In their analysis of black racial identity in Brazil, Mitchell-Walthour and Darity (2014) find that the extent of a person’s exposure to racial discrimination (“other-group antagonism”) and a sense of black-linked fate (“own-group altruism”) are positively related to black identification. Saperstein and Penner (2012) show that alternative measures of inequality and socioeconomic status have a substantive effect on both interviewer-identified and self-identified race. (See also Kramer et al. 2016; Alba et al. 2016; Saperstein and Penner 2016).",6

Patel,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Colorism is the “allocation of privilege and disadvantage according to the lightness or darkness of one’s skin, with favoritism typically granted to those with lighter skin” (Diette et al. 2015, page 156). Colorism explains intra-group variations among Blacks on a variety of outcomes. Darker skin tone Blacks have lower education, income, occupational prestige (Harvey et al. 2005; Keith and Herring 1991), social status (Hersch 2006) and poorer health (Borrell et al. 2006). Darker skin tone is not associated with differences in abilities—even after controlling for parent’s socioeconomic status and a variety of individual characteristics, skin tone led to systematic differences in future income and status (Keith and Herring 1991; Mason 2004). Recent studies have continued to find support for wage differentials based on skin tone (Goldsmith et al. 2006; Kreisman and Rangel 2015). One less explored area in this literature is the influence of skin tone on self-employment. Despite persistence of inter-group differences in self-employment between Blacks and Whites (Lofstrom and Bates 2013), colorism could explain intra-group variations in self-employment among Blacks. If darker skin tone Blacks face discrimination in traditional labor markets, then to mitigate effects of discrimination in traditional workplaces and improve economic returns to their human capital they may seek self-employment to close gaps in status and income. Although self-employment could be desirable among darker skin tone Blacks, based on a review of the literature on colorism and endowments necessary for self-employment, they may be less likely to engage in self-employment for two reasons – lower accumulation of human capital relative to their lighter skin tone counterparts and possible discrimination and hindrances in self-employment efforts from inter- and intra-group stakeholders. Key endowments for entry into self-employment are education, cognitive ability, diverse occupational experiences, financial resources and social capital (Dunn and Holtz-Eakin 2000; Parker 2004). Empirical findings on colorism show that skin tone is negatively associated with accumulation of human capital from an early age and continues to influence income and occupational prestige in later life (Hunter 2007; Monk 2014). Darker skin tone individuals have lower inter- and intra-group social capital, and due to inter-group bias, they could be perceived as more ‘Black’ in lending markets (Fairlie 1999) and may face greater consumer discrimination (Borjas and Bronars 1989). Such limited accumulation of endowments necessary for self-employment could limit darker skin tone Blacks from engaging in self-employment. Persistent effects of skin tone over lifetime (Adams et al. 2016) may continue to restrain darker skin tone Blacks from engaging in self-employment as they may expect continued inter- and intra-group discrimination that could hinder self-employment activities. However, darker skin tone individuals who attain these human capital endowments may realize higher returns. Bridging colorism with the literature on studies examining intra-group variations in socioeconomic status (Bates 1997), location (Boyd 1991), and cohort (Fairlie and Meyer 2000) leading to self-employment differences among Blacks, we ask: (i) whether variations in skin tone among Blacks influence the likelihood of engaging in self-employment? and (ii) whether influence of skin tone persists, such that higher human capital or other characteristics related to self-employment do not mitigate the lower likelihood of engaging in self-employment? As such, the purpose of the paper fits into stratification economics, where structural and intentional processes generate and maintain persistent differences in life outcomes for darker skin tone Blacks (Diette et al. 2015). Focus on intra-group variations in self-employment complement studies examining the inter-group differences between Black and White self-employment (Blanchflower 2004; Fairlie 1999; Le 1999). Darker skin tone, an additional basis of disadvantage among Blacks in seeking self-employment, is a finding particularly relevant given NLSY 1997 data used in this study includes millennials, a generation where social narratives seem to suggest that discrimination may be on the decline. Findings show that the influence of skin tone in explaining self-employment is significant among Black millennials. It must be noted that that we do not disentangle the skin tone effects from mixed-race effects. As first generation mixed race Blacks may have lighter skin-tone than other Blacks, differences in resources necessary for self-employment could also be explained by mixed race. Offsprings of mixed race couples may have higher endowments, explaining correlation between skin tone and self-employment resources.",3

Myers Jr,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Harvard University, established in 1637, has a reputation for being a trendsetter in higher education (Greene 2011; About Department of Economics).Footnote 1 It was one of the first major research universities to guarantee full financial aid to all low-income students admitted (Otani 2015); it pioneered the use of a core curriculum (Bombardieri, 2004); was an early adopter of the SAT examination as a requirement for admission (History of the SAT); and notably, has been a leader in targeted admissions of students from underrepresented racial minority groups (Roberts 2015). There is a saying: “Harvard leads and higher education follows.”Footnote 2
 Harvard’s Department of Economics, founded in 1897 (Mason and Lamont 1982), produced its first Ph.D. in 1905 (Harvard University 1900). Many faculty members throughout the first half of the twentieth Century received their doctorates from Harvard, creating a distinct and identifiable school of thought that ultimately became one of the dominant schools of thought in the United States (Harvard/Radcliffe). Key areas in the Economics Department at Harvard included the analysis of monopolistic competition, the extension of international trade theory, and in later years, it became a center for Keynesian economics in the United States (Mason and Lamont 1982). The Department helped to shape the training of economics throughout the entire nation throughout much of the twentieth Century. This essay is rooted in dining room conversations with my father, Samuel L. Myers, Sr., a 1949 graduate of the Ph.D. Program in Economics at Harvard University. My father had produced a programmed textbook for teaching introductory economics at Morgan State College.Footnote 3 He talked about his professors at Morgan who inspired him; his professors at Boston University who supported his interest in economic analysis of the Negro; and he detailed his experiences in the Ph.D. program in economics at Harvard University, recounting his interactions with Joseph A. Schumpeter, Gottfried Haberler, Alvin Hanson, John Dunlop, John Kenneth Galbraith, and most of all, John D. Black.Footnote 4 It was during these conversations that my father modestly revealed that he was “only the fifth” black to obtain the Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University. This kernel of information apparently has remained unchallenged and unappreciated by economic historians and others interested in the role of race in the profession. Clearly, if my father were the fifth black to receive the Ph.D. in economics from Harvard, then there must be some record of the first, second, third and fourth recipients of this coveted degree. This essay is designed to document the evidence available concerning the production of black economists at Harvard from 1905 until 1955. At my father’s 95th birthday party, celebrated first at the Spring 2014 meeting of Gamma Boulé of Sigma Pi Phi FraternityFootnote 5 and then at the headquarters of Minority Access, Inc.,Footnote 6 I recounted more recent conversations with him designed to establish conclusively the identities of the doctoral recipients who preceded him at Harvard. With fading memory, my father speculated that the first might have been W.E.B. Dubois; the second probably was Abram Harris; the third possibly was someone by the name of Greene, who did mathematical location theory. This ordering conflicted with the widely documented evidence that the graduate economics department at Harvard had not yet been formed at the time that Dubois received his degreeFootnote 7; that Abram Harris received his degree from Columbia, not Harvard.Footnote 8 And, a quick search of graduates of Harvard produced no one by the name of Greene with a thesis on location economics. In an entirely unguarded moment, I jokingly mentioned during the ceremonies that since the person my modest father thought was the first, could not have been the first; since the person who putatively was the second clearly was not first or second; and since the person who apparently was the third could not be found, that meant that perhaps my father was the first. Given that the audience included major business executives, college presidents, top elected officials, and prominent leaders of the African American community in Baltimore, I immediately sensed the folly of making such casual claims. I was fortunate to have the assistance of a talented undergraduate student participating in the University of Minnesota’s Ronald McNair summer mentorship program interested in the famed agricultural economist, John D. Black, whose picture adorns the graduate seminar room of the University of Minnesota’s Department of Applied Economics. Black had been one of my father’s senior mentors at Harvard with many vital links to Minnesota. Lawrence Karongo, with the help of Cheniqua Johnson, another undergraduate at the University of Minnesota, spent the summer of 2014 tracking down the dissertations of all doctoral recipients from Harvard’s economics department and combing through public records, census records, newspaper and magazine accounts to identify the race and ethnicity of each of the 609 Ph.D. recipients in economics from 1905 to 1955. This essay is the story of these efforts and provides insights into the production of black Ph.D.’s at, arguably, the leading economics department in the United States by the end of World War II. I will begin by discussing the methodology used to document the six black Harvard Ph.D.’s in economics during the period under review. In producing the list, I also report the dissertation topics, the dissertation advisors, and connections that heretofore have not been fully articulated. Then, I present estimates from a simple model that asks and answers the question: what are the key factors that contributed to the production of black Harvard Ph.D.’s in economics in any given year? The concluding section offers insights about the patterns, themes and linkages and their implications for the production of minority Ph.D.’s in the twenty-first Century.",3
